40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 83 Diffraction {{of light}} by a {{sinusoidal}} sound wave {{is discussed in}} detail. Assuming that the <b>sound</b> <b>column</b> modulates only the phase of the incident light in both time and space, the frequencies, wavevectors, and intensities of the diffracted waves are obtained for normal incidence. A transition length (width of sound beam) is defined, above which all diffraction effects disappear due to destructive interference. Constructive interference is obtained, however, provided the light is incident at the Bragg angle, {{in which case the}} diffracted beam appears to be reflected from the acoustic wavefronts. The transition length thus separates the region of multiple -order (Raman -Nath) diffraction from the region of single -order (Bragg) diffraction. It is found to be directly proportional to the square of the acoustic wavelength and inversely proportional to the optical wavelength. In the case of Bragg diffraction, the energy is exchanged sinusoidally between the diffracted and undiffracted beams. Owing to the finite width of the sound beam, the Bragg condition is relaxed, and the effect can be used to control the direction and phase of the diffracted beam or to determine the angular distribution of the acoustic power. Next, a particle picture of diffraction in terms of photons and phonons is given. The diffraction process is described as a single as well as a multiple three -particle interaction. The effects of finite optical and acoustic beamwidths and variation of acoustic frequency are considered in terms of momentum conservation. Finally, an analysis based on Maxwell's equations for an arbitrarily polarized light beam propagating in an arbitrary direction is given using the partial -wave approach. A set of coupled difference- differential equations for the diffracted amplitudes is derived from the optical wave equation and analytic solutions are obtained in the Raman-Nath and Bragg regions of diffraction. The results for normal and Bragg incidence are obtained as special cases. Limits of the two regions are defined, thus giving a transition region in which numerical solutions can be obtained...|$|E

The method fully exploits the redundancy in the MBES measurements obtained from the overlap of adjacent swathes. It searches for those water <b>column</b> <b>sound</b> speeds that result in a maximum agreement in the bathymetry along the overlapping swathes. The Gauss-Newton method is employed for the optimization.

The continuous progressivity of a strong and rapidly-occluding storm {{off the coast of}} California roaring from the Pacific Ocean led to flash flooding including mud and debris flows in certain zones. In order to understand the tough effect this storm had upon the zone, time-series of 125 NWS and RAWS weather stations are tested including at least 80 % of hourly observations for a period of 72 hours.

Bacterial productivities per cubic meter were usually greater in the euphotic zone than in deeper aphotic water, but when integrated through the water column, {{approximately half of the}} bacterial production occurred in the deeper aphotic portion.

40|$|When fire {{takes place}} in a steel frame, any heated column may buckle at some {{temperature}} due to deterioration in both the stiffness and the strength, although the external load to the frame remains unchanged during fire. This column’s buckling is likely a main cause of the instability for steel frames subjected to fire. Researches on the high temperature buckling of columns span, in fact, for decades. Culver (1973) was the first to analyze precisely the behavior of the buckling of columns by using finite element analysis. Referring to the experimental studies conducted by Burgess et al. (1992), Franssen has recently made a specific comparison between the test and numerical analysis results (1995, 1996). Although the studies on centrally compressed and simply supported columns provide the basic knowledge on the problem, the behaviors of the heated columns incorporated into the frame are different from those of isolated members. In fact, when fire occurs in a steel frame, the expanded and therefore elongated column is axially restrained by the rest of members, so that thermal compressive force is applied additionally to the heated column (Neves, 1995; Correia Rodrigues et al., 2000). As a result, the buckling temperature of the heated column is lowered due to this thermal stress. On the other hand, since the incorporated column is, at the same time, restrained rotationally at its ends by the neighboring members, the effective length of this column should become shorter than the column height and this raises in turn the buckling temperature of the column. Another facet of the problem is the overall stability of the frame, when and after the incorporated columns buckle due to fire. Some frames may fall into instability directly after the incorporated column buckle, while the other may remain stable and be able to sustain further increase in member temperature. Once the instability takes place, the former frame cannot maintain static equilibrium any more. This means that, to solve the problem, ordinary load controlled analysis is not applicable in this case, but we need to develop another new numerical method to analyze the unstable frames. For the latter stable frames with heated and buckled columns, on the other hand, stress redistribution capacity of the neighboring members may play an essential role on controlling their ultimate states. Therefore, to clarify the structural performances of the frames with heated and buckled columns, a special emphasis must be placed on their stabilities as well as their ultimate load carrying characteristics when and after several heated columns buckle. The adopted analysis method must be able to trace these natures of the problem accordingly. In view of the above observations, the main objectives of this study are to be set as follows: 1. To understand and to clarify the mechanics which control the overall stabilities of steel frames with heated and buckled columns. 2. To develop a numerical analysis program that can solve such stability problems of steel frames subjected to fire. 3. To clarify the buckling temperatures of the incorporated columns as well as the frame’s ultimate temperatures. 4. To find the actual ultimate states and the corresponding ultimate temperatures of steel frames subjected to fire. 5. To find the means to prevent the frames subjected to fire from instability. In order to achieve the above presented objectives, this dissertation is divided into five chapters, which are briefly described below. Chapter one starts with brief review of previous studies. Fire resistant design of steel structures is reviewed in many relevant aspects, the experimental tests, and numerical analysis. After that, the problem about instability in steel structure that occurred in the collapse of WTC Towers is summarized. This is considered an indispensable background for conceiving the objective of this study, which constitutes the above sections. In chapter 2, the stabilities and the ultimate behaviors of steel frames after the incorporated heated columns buckle are investigated extensively. If the surrounding members can redistribute the vertical load of the frame which has been carried by the buckled column, it may retain the stability and may not collapse immediately. On the contrary, when the surrounding members are weak, an overall frame will fall into instability directly due to column buckling. This chapter describes and discusses these problems specifically. Furthermore, in this chapter, the development of the numerical analysis method is described specifically, which can simulate both the stable and unstable behaviors of steel frames subjected to fire. The development is focused on the computational procedure to simulate an unstable and therefore actually a dynamic frame behavior purely by a static means. At the end of this chapter, example numerical solutions solved by the method developed are shown, where complete fire responses and realistic ultimate states due to fire of steel frames are illustrated and discussed extensively. By using the numerical method whereby the control of the analysis is switched between load and displacement methods, we can examine the behavior of the steel column subjected to fire until it overall collapses. The load controlled analysis is the increase-in-temperature method. While the displacement analysis is the analysis that one degree-of-freedom of the unstable member’s node is gripped, and it is moved in the direction that the unstable state is growing. The displacement analysis is carried out under the temperature that the structure loses its stability. By using this analysis method to analyze some examples of a steel structure subjected to fire, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The main unstable condition of a steel structure subjected to fire is the “snap-through” process. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. That means that the structure’s ability to remain stable while the surrounding members restrain the buckling column is intimately connected with the instabilities of the structure itself. ･ The collapse of the structure is not decided solely by the buckling of the heated column. The ultimate temperature of the structure’s collapse mode varies according to the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members. If the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is low, the structure loses its stability and collapses suddenly after the column buckles. In this case, the ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is lower than the column buckling temperature due to the thermal stress. However, if the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is high, the structure still keeps its stability even though the column buckles. The ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is more than the column buckling temperature. The third chapter clarifies specifically the buckling temperatures of steel columns incorporated into frames. The buckling temperature is defined as the one at which a column begins to show an apparent buckling deformation. The incorporated columns are restrained rotationally by the adjacent members when they buckle. Therefore the effective buckling length of the column is shorter than its height. In this chapter, simple closed form formulae are presented to estimate both the effective buckling length and the buckling temperature of an incorporated heated column. Finally, comparisons are made between the numerically solved buckling temperatures of incorporated columns and the corresponding theoretical predictions, and the accuracy and the applicability of the formula are discussed in detail. From the investigated results, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The rotationally restraining effect of the connecting members has an effect on the column’s buckling temperature. However, the thermal expansion of the beam does not have a direct affect on the buckling temperature. ･ The exterior column is not axially restrained by the adjacent members during the fire. The lower end of the heated column is rotationally restrained by the unheated connecting members, so its boundary condition can be assumed to be fixed end. On the other hand, for {{the upper end of the}} heated column’s case, the rotationally restraining effect of the upper-story unheated column can be neglected due to the thermal expansion of the beam. The buckling temperature of the exterior column can be assumed to be the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. ･ The interior column is strongly rotationally restrained by the adjacent members, so its effective length is equal to 0. 5 h. However, it is also axially restrained by the adjacent members. As a result it buckles at a temperature that is lower than the estimated buckling temperature. In this case, when considering the buckling temperature, the thermal effect should be included. An incorporated column is not only restrained rotationally as discussed in the previous chapter but, if it is heated, it is also restrained axially by the surrounding members. Chapter 4 clarifies the latter problems specifically. The axial restraint of the surrounding members plays two contrary roles on the stability action of the frame. Firstly, it adds axial compressive force to the incorporated column and so increased compressive force lowers the column’s buckling temperature. On the contrary, once the column buckles, the surrounding members turn to work so as to redistribute a part of the axial compressive force carried by the bucked <b>column</b> to other <b>sound</b> <b>columns,</b> which is therefore helps to strengthen the overall stability and to raise the ultimate temperature of the frame. This is called herein stress redistribution effect of the surrounding members. In this chapter, the lowering of the column’s buckling temperature and the raise of the frame’s ultimate temperature, which are both brought by the effects of the surrounding members, are formulated respectively in theoretical closed forms. Finally the numerical analysis, which are developed in Chapter 2, are conducted extensively to obtain the realistic column’s buckling and the frame’s ultimate temperatures of a lot of practical steel frames, which are used to verify the accuracy and the applicability of the above derived formulae. In this chapter, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The effects of the axially restraining members have two mechanical roles. The first role is to restrain an expanded heated column. As a result of this action, the thermal compressive force is added to the heated column. This causes a drop in buckling temperature of heated columns. On the contrary, the second role is to redistribute a part of the compressive force of the buckled <b>column</b> to other <b>sound</b> <b>columns.</b> As a result of this action, the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. It causes a rise of the ultimate temperature of a frame. However, if the second stress redistribution ability is not enough, it falls into instability immediately after the heated column buckles. The ultimate temperature for this frame is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature, since the buckling is affected by the first thermal effect. ･ Based on the above observation, it is found that a higher ultimate temperature of a frame is obtained if it has higher stress redistribution capacity. A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a frame is to install a suitably proportioned hat truss. A hatted frame is found to have definitely an improved redundancy. ･ Closed form formulae to predict both the buckling temperature of a heated column and the beam plastified temperature of a frame is presented herein. Conducting the numerical fire response analysis, the predicted temperatures are found to be in good agreement with the numerical results for various structural and heating conditions. The prediction to estimate the improved ultimate temperature of hatted frames is also proposed herein. In chapter 5, the conclusion of this thesis is drawn: ･ The “snap-through” phenomenon is the main unstable condition of steel structures subjected to fire. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. ･ The column’s buckling temperature can be estimated by the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. The exterior column’s effective length ratio can be calculated from the proposed equation while the interior column’s effective length ratio is 0. 5. ･ In the case that the stress redistribution ability is not enough to retain the stability of the steel frame, the structure falls into the instability state and failure at the buckling temperature under thermal effect. It means the ultimate temperature of that structure is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature. However, in the case that the stress redistribution ability is high, a part of the compressive force of the buckled column is redistributed to other <b>sound</b> <b>columns.</b> As a result the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. ･ The ultimate temperature can be determined by the higher temperature among the bucking temperature under thermal effect and the beam plastified temperature. ･ A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a steel frame is to increase the redundancy of the axial force to the steel frame.

This was a rich period for Eddie Gordon's DJ career with various awards Gravesend and Dartford Reporter 'DJ of the Year 1984-1985', Radio Kent '1986 Club of the Year' with The Slammer, Kent Evening Post '1986 Club of the Year' with The Slammer, Kent Evening Post 1987 Kent Club of the Year with The Sleeze and in 1989 Eddie Gordon was Kent 'Music Man of the Year' - Kent Evening Post.Throughout the 1980s Eddie Gordon was responsible for introducing the music for the Frank Warren Boxing Shows on the ITV channel with the boxers emerging from the dressing room to a fanfare of music to arouse the audience, which is now {{a regular part of}} all world championship televised boxing. The events held at the Royal Albert Hall, London, were major ITV programs of the era.Also from the mid to the late 1980s Eddie spotted and supported the emerging DJ talents of Tim Westwood BBC Radio 1, Trevor Nelson MBE BBC Radio 1, Gilles Peterson BBC Radio 1, Norman Jay MBE, CJ Macintosh and Paul Oakenfold at his Gravesend club night The Slammer and in his weekly music <b>column</b> <b>Sounds</b> Spot in the county newspaper the Kent Messenger.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{inversion}} {{techniques are}} often used to characterize portions of the marine environment or the seabed. Matched field methods as, e. g., the well known conventional “matched field processing” (MFP) or the “model based matched filter” (MBMF), are able to estimate the best fit from the correlation of modelled acoustic pressure fields with the field measured {{in an array of}} hydrophones in the first case, or with the impulsive response in timedomain in the second case. The results of the whole process show estimations of physical parameters that could represent the seabed (attenuations, densities, sound speeds), the water <b>column</b> (<b>sound</b> speed profile, depth) or the geometries (receiver depth, source depth, sourcereceiver range). The technique can be tuned and applied to geoacoustic inversion, acoustic tomography or passive source localization. The present work proposes to present the analysis and results of MFP inversion with broadband data recorded on a 8 -hydrophones array during the geoacoustic run of the Ocean Acoustic Exploration 2010 experiment (OAEx' 10) nearby Arraial do Cabo city, off the south-east coast of Brazil. The analysed acoustic signals are multi-tones over the frequency band 250 Hz [...] 1000 Hz emitted by a source positioned at 700 -m from the receivers, in a environment considered range-independent. Normal modes model, space-coherent Bartlett cost function and genetic algorithm optimization are used to estimate the best replica field and the physical parameters from seabed, producing results in reasonable agreement with previous geophysical ground truth from this brazilian site...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} an algorithm for inverting for the geoacoustic {{properties of}} the seafloor in shallow water. The input data required by the algorithm are estimates of the amplitudes of the normal modes excited by a low-frequency pure-tone sound source, and estimates of the water <b>column</b> <b>sound</b> speed profiles at the source and receiver positions. The algorithm makes use of perturbation results, and computes the small correction to an estimated background profile {{that is necessary to}} reproduce the measured mode amplitudes. Range-dependent waveguide properties can be inverted for so long as they vary slowly enough in range that the adiabatic approximation is valid. The thesis also presents an estimator which can be used to obtain the input data for the inversion algorithm from pressure measurements made on a vertical line array (VLA). The estimator is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which treats the mode amplitudes and eigenvalues as state variables. Numerous synthetic and real-data examples of both the inversion algorithm and the EKF estimator are provided. The inversion algorithm is similar to eigenvalue perturbation methods, and the thesis also presents a combination mode amplitude/eigenvalue inversion algorithm, which combines the advantages of the two techniques. by Travis L.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{stringent}} impairments in matched-field processing {{is the impact of}} missing or erroneous environmental information on the final source location estimate. This problem is known in the literature as model mismatch and is strongly frequency dependent. Another unavoidable factor that contributes to model mismatch is the natural time and spatial variability of the ocean waveguide. As a consequence, most of the experimental results obtained to date focus on short source-receiver ranges (usually < 5 km), stationary sources, reduced time windows and frequencies generally below 600 Hz. This paper shows that MFP source localization can be made robust to time–space environmental mismatch if the parameters responsible for the mismatch are clearly identified, properly modeled and (time-) adaptively estimated by a focalization procedure prior to MFP source localization. The data acquired during the ADVENT’ 99 sea trial at 2, 5, and 10 km source-receiver ranges and in two frequency bands, below and above 600 Hz, provided an excellent opportunity to test the proposed techniques. The results indicate that an adequate parametrization of the waveguide is effective up to 10 km range in both frequency bands achieving a precise localization during the whole recording of the 5 km track, and most of the 10 km track. It is shown that the increasing MFP dependence on erroneous environmental information in the higher frequency and at longer ranges can only be accounted for by including a time dependent modeling of the water <b>column</b> <b>sound</b> speed profile.

40|$|Understanding of the {{evolution}} of fluid-fault interactions during earthquake cycles is a challenge that acoustic gas emission studies can contribute. A survey of the Sea of Marmara using a shipborne, multibeam echo <b>sounder,</b> with water <b>column</b> records, provided an accurate spatial distribution of offshore seeps. Gas emissions are spatially controlled by a combination of factors, including fault and fracture networks in connection to the Main Marmara Fault system and inherited faults, the nature and thickness of sediments (e. g., occurrence of impermeable or gas-bearing sediments and landslides), and the connectivity between the seafloor and gas sources, particularly in relation to the Eocene Thrace Basin. The relationship between seepage and fault activity is not linear, as active faults do not necessarily conduct gas, and scarps corresponding to deactivated fault strands may continue to channel fluids. Within sedimentary basins, gas is not expelled at the seafloor unless faulting, deformation, or erosional processes affect the sediments. On topographic highs, gas flares occur along the main fault scarps but are also associated with sediment deformation. The occurrence of gas emissions appears to be correlated with the distribution of microseismicity. The relative absence of earthquake-induced ground shaking along parts of the Istanbul-Silivri and Princes Islands segments is likely the primary factor responsible for the comparative lack of gas emissions along these fault segments. The spatiotemporal distribution of gas seeps may thus provide a complementary way to constrain earthquake geohazards by focusing the study on some key fault segments, e. g., {{the northern part of the}} locked Princes Islands segment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- High-frequency {{acoustic}} backscatter measurements {{have long}} {{been used as a}} method to detect zooplankton populations in the ocean. Ship-borne echo-sounders can map distributions over relatively large areas, but are not practical for following developments over long periods of time. Self-contained echo-sounders, either moored at depth looking upward, or mounted on surface buoys looking downward produce time series of acoustic backscatter which are a means for monitoring long-term behaviour of zooplankton populations. Combining these instruments with a cabled observatory allows this information to be acquired and monitored in near real-time, and thus to contribute to understanding and monitoring the state of one of the key components of coastal marine ecosystems. In this paper, we will discuss what we believe is the first operational example of an inverted echo sounder as part of a cabled seafloor observatory. The first component of the VENUS seafloor observatory, in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, began operation in February, 2006. The instrument platform is located 3 km from the Institute of Ocean Sciences dock, at 96 m depth. A 200 kHz upward looking echo <b>sounder</b> (Acoustic Water <b>Column</b> Profiler TM, also known as the ZAP, for Zooplankton Acoustic Profiler) is located on the platform. The instrument collects a profile of acoustic backscatter strength throughout the water column once per second and transmits the data over the cable to the VENUS shore station. Power and control communications are also supplied over the cable. The techniques for command and control of the instrument over the VENUS VPN are described, as are the means for real-time display of the data using TCP/IP protocols. Continuous data retrieval and image posting to the VENUS website are performed automatically using th...|$|R
