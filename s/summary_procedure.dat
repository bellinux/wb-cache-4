25|$|If {{a company}} {{has gone into}} an {{insolvency}} procedure, administrators or liquidators should aim to realise the greatest amount in assets to distribute to creditors. The effect is to alter orthodox private law rules regarding consideration, creation of security and limited liability. The freedom to contract for any consideration, adequate or not, is curtailed when transactions are made for an undervalue, or whenever it comes after the presentation of a winding up petition. The freedom to contract for any security interest is also restricted, as a company's attempt to give an undue preference to one creditor over another, particularly a floating charge for no new money, or any charge that is not registered, can be unwound. Since the Cork Report's emphasis on increasing director accountability, practitioners may sue directors by <b>summary</b> <b>procedure</b> for breach of duties, especially negligence or conflicts of interest. Moreover, and encroaching on limited liability and separate personality, a specific, insolvency related claim was created in 1986 named wrongful trading, so if a director failed to put a company into an insolvency procedure, and ran up extra debts, when a reasonable director would have, he can be made liable {{to contribute to the}} company's assets. Intentional wrongdoing and fraud is dealt with strictly, but proof of a mens rea is unnecessary in the interest of preventing unjust enrichment of some creditors at others' expense, and to deter wrongdoing.|$|E

That did not apply to <b>summary</b> <b>procedure</b> cases. The ad hoc judge, selected by the member state, was expected to fulfil all the requirements of a normal judge; the President of the Court had ultimate discretion over whether to authorise him to sit. The Court was mandated to open on 15 June each year and continue until all cases were finished, with extraordinary sessions if required; by 1927, there were more extraordinary sessions than ordinary ones.

The original Statutes of the Court provided that all 11 judges were required to sit in every case.

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} {{procedural}} due {{process can be}} understood as a choice of-law doctrine. Many procedural due process cases require courts to choose between a procedural regime characteristic of the common law—personal notice, oral hearing, neutral judge, and jury trial—and <b>summary</b> <b>procedures</b> employed in administrative agencies. This way of thinking about procedural due process is at odds with the current balancing test associated with the Supreme Court’s opinion in Mathews v. Eldridge. This Article aims to show, however, that it is consistent with case law over a much longer period, indeed, most of American history. It begins with a reading of due process cases in state courts before the Civil War, and argues that, in many of these cases, courts were asked to negotiate the institutional conflict between themselves and various summary bodies, including non-common-law courts, magistrates, commissioners, corporations, and even legislatures, which {{played a significant role in}} the administration of government. The Article then reconstructs federal due process cases in the period from 1870 to 1915, arguing that the Supreme Court limited the use of <b>summary</b> <b>procedures</b> by testing their fit with the so-called public interest, or public right, ostensibly at issue. Finally, the Article turns to the due process “revolution” and “counter-revolution,” showing how the traditional choice-of-law framework broke down, resulting in the Mathews decision...|$|R

The 4 advisory opinions issued by the Court were in the Polish Postal Service in Danzig Question, the Expulsion of the Ecumenical Patriarch Question, the Treaty of Lausanne Question and the German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia Question. 1926 saw reduced business, with only one ordinary session and one extraordinary session; it was, however, the first year that all 11 judges had been present to hear cases. The court heard two cases, providing one judgment and one advisory opinion; a second question on German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, this time a judgment rather than an advisory opinion, and an advisory opinion on the International Labour Organisation, grouped into the International Labour Organisation Questions.|$|E
2500|$|The Court faced {{increasing}} work {{as it went}} on, allaying {{the fears}} of those commentators who had believed the Court would become like the Supreme Court of the United States, which was not presented with a case for its first six terms. The Court was given nine cases during 1922 and 1923, however, with judgments called [...] "cases" [...] and advisory opinions called [...] "questions". Three cases were disposed of during the Court's first session, one during an extraordinary sitting between 8 January and 7 February 1923 (the Tunis-Morocco Nationality Question), four during the second ordinary sitting between 15 June 1923 and 15 September 1923 (Eastern Carelia Question, S.S. [...] "Wimbledon" [...] case, German Settlers Question, Acquisition of Polish Nationality Question) and one during a second extraordinary session from 12 November to 6 December 1923 (Jaworznia Question). A replacement for Ruy Barbosa (who had died on 1 March 1923 without hearing any cases) was also found, {{with the election of}} Epitácio Lindolfo da Silva Pessoa on 10 September 1923. The workload the following year was reduced, containing two judgments and one advisory opinion; the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case, the Interpretation of the Treaty of Neuilly Case (the first case of the Court's Chamber of <b>Summary</b> <b>Procedure)</b> and the Monastery of Saint-Naoum Question. During the same year, a new President and Vice-President were elected, since they were mandated to serve for a term of three years. At the elections on 4 September 1924, Charles Andre Weiss was again elected Vice-President and Max Huber became the second President of the Court. Judicial pensions were created at the same time, with a judge being given 1/30th of his annual pay for every year he had served once he had both retired and turned 65.|$|E
60|$|There are two {{paths of}} folly in these matters. One is to regard all Indian matters, Indian {{procedure}} and Indian policy, {{as if it}} were Great Britain or Ireland, and to insist that all the robes and apparel that suit Great Britain or Ireland must necessarily suit India. The other is to think that all you have got to do is what I see suggested, to my amazement, in English print--to blow a certain number of men from guns, and then your business will be done. Either of these paths of folly leads to as great disaster as the other. I would like to say this about the Summary Jurisdiction Bill--I have no illusions whatever. I do not ignore, and I do not believe that Lord Lansdowne opposite, or anyone else can ignore, the frightful risks involved in transferring in any form or degree what should be the ordinary power under the law, to arbitrary personal discretion. I am alive, too, to the temptation under <b>summary</b> <b>procedure</b> of various kinds, to the danger of mistaking a headstrong exercise of force for energy. Again, I do not for an instant forget, and I hope those who so loudly applaud legislation of this kind do not forget, the tremendous price that you pay for all operations of this sort in the reaction and the excitement that they provoke. If there is a man who knows all these drawbacks I think I am he. But there are situations in which a responsible Government is compelled to run these risks and to pay this possible price, however high it may appear to be.|$|E

The only {{question}} for us is whether there is such a situation in India to-day as to warrant the passing of the Act the other day, and to justify resort to the Regulation of 1818.

You must protect the lives of your officers. You must protect peaceful and harmless people, both Indian and European, from the blood-stained havoc of anarchic conspiracy. We deplore the necessity, but we are bound to face the facts. I myself recognise this necessity with infinite regret, and with something, perhaps, rather deeper than regret. But it is not the Government, either here or in India, who are the authors of this necessity, and I should not at all mind, if it is not impertinent and unbecoming in me to say so, standing up in another place and saying exactly what I say here, that I approve of these proceedings and will do my best to support the Government of India.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probably}} a congenital absence of some faculty which I ought to possess which withholds me from adopting this <b>summary</b> <b>procedure.</b> But I am not ashamed to share David Hume's want of ability to discover that polytheism is, in itself, altogether absurd. If we are bound, or permitted, to judge {{the government of the}} world by human standards, it appears to me that directorates are proved, by familiar experience, to conduct the largest and the most complicated concerns quite as well as solitary despots. I {{have never been able to}} see why the hypothesis of a divine syndicate should be found guilty of innate absurdity. Those Assyrians, in particular, who held Assur to be the one supreme and creative deity, to whom all the other supernal powers were subordinate, might fairly ask that the essential difference between their system and that which obtains among the great majority of their modern theological critics should be demonstrated. In my apprehension, it is not the quantity, but the quality, of the persons, among whom the attributes of divinity are distributed, which is the serious matter. If the divine might is associated with no higher ethical attributes than those which obtain among ordinary men; if the divine intelligence is supposed to be so imperfect that it cannot foresee the consequences of its own contrivances; if the supernal powers can become furiously angry with the creatures of their omnipotence and, in their senseless wrath, destroy the innocent along with the guilty; or if they can show themselves to be as easily placated by presents and gross flattery as any oriental or occidental despot; if, in short, they are only stronger than mortal men and no better, as it must be admitted Hasisadra's deities proved themselves to be--then, surely, it is time for us to look somewhat closely into their credentials, and to accept none but conclusive evidence of their existence.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>summary</b> <b>procedure,</b> the court found, {{is to get the}} accused to explain his failure to comply with a warning. To achieve this purpose, the burden of proof is imposed upon the accused, which, if he should fail to {{discharge}} it, usually results in a conviction. Remaining silent, therefore, invariably invites conviction. This is so because the fact of the warning and the failure to comply will ordinarily become conclusive proof and, {{in the absence of an}} explanation for the failure, the conviction must usually ensue. Viewed in this context, the court found that the <b>summary</b> <b>procedure</b> and the burden of proof imposed upon the accused are inseparable. The burden of proof is essential to the effectiveness of the <b>summary</b> <b>procedure</b> and the achievement of its purpose. The combined effect of the two is that the accused is compelled to break her or his silence by the risk of a conviction. To this extent, the court determined, the <b>summary</b> <b>procedure</b> envisaged in s 72(4) limits the right to remain silent and not to testify at such an inquiry.|$|E
