The bramble is an {{aggressive}} example: it advances forcefully {{from side to side}} and, once settled on its course, there is little that can stand in its way. An altogether faster species is the birdcage plant, which inhabits Californian sand dunes. When its location becomes exposed, it shifts at great speed to another one with the assistance of wind — and it is this that allows many forms of vegetation to distribute their seeds. While not a plant, the spores of fungi are also spread in a similar fashion. One of the most successful (and intricate) flowers to use the wind is the dandelion, whose seeds travel with the aid of 'parachutes'. They are needed to travel miles away from their parents, who are too densely packed to allow any new arrivals. Trees have the advantage of height to send their seeds further, and the cottonwood is shown as a specialist in this regard. The humidity of the tropical rainforest creates transportation problems, and the liana-species Alsomitra macrocarpa is one plant whose seeds are aerodynamic 'gliders'. Some, such as those of the sycamore, take the form of 'helicopters', while others, such as the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> release their seeds by 'exploding'. Water is also a widely used method of propulsion. The tropical sea bean Entada gigas has one of the biggest fruits of all plants and is dispersed by water streams. However, most plants use living couriers, whether they be dogs, humans and other primates, ants or birds, etc., and to that end, they use colour and smell to signify when they are ripe for picking.|$|E

60|$|Naturally, the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> knows its own {{business}} best, {{and is not}} without sufficient reasons of its own for this strange and, to some extent, unmannerly behaviour. By its queer trick of squirting, it manages to kill at least two birds with one stone. For, in the first place, the sudden elastic jump of the fruit frightens away browsing animals, such as goats and cattle. Those meditative ruminants are little accustomed to finding shrubs or plants take the aggressive against them; and {{when they see a}} fruit that quite literally flies in their faces of its own accord, they hesitate to attack the uncanny vine which bristles with such magical and almost miraculous defences. Moreover, the juice of the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> is bitter and nauseous, and if it gets into the eyes or nostrils of man or beast, it impresses itself on the memory by stinging like red pepper. So the trick of squirting serves in a double way as a protection to the plant against the attacks of herbivorous animals and other enemies.|$|E
60|$|Artillery marks {{a higher}} stage than the sling and the stone. Just so, in many plants, a step {{higher in the}} {{evolutionary}} scale as regards the method of dispersion, the capsule itself bursts open explosively, and scatters its contents to the four winds of heaven. Such plants {{may be said to}} discharge their grains on the principle of the bow and arrow. The balsam is a familiar example of this startling mode of moving to fresh fields and pastures new: its capsule consists of five long straight valves, which break asunder elastically the moment they are touched, when fully ripe, and shed their seeds on all sides, like so many small bombshells. Our friend the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber,</b> which served as the prime text for this present discourse, falls into somewhat the same category, though in other ways it rather resembles the true succulent fruits, and belongs, indeed, to the same family as the melon, the gourd, the pumpkin, and the vegetable-marrow, almost all of which are edible and in every way fruit-like. Among English weeds, the little bittercress that grows on dry walls and hedge-banks forms an excellent example of the same device. Village children love to touch the long, ripe, brown capsules on the top with one timid finger, and then jump away, half laughing, half terrified, when the mild-looking little plant goes off suddenly with a small bang and shoots its grains like a catapult point-blank in their faces.|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{you know}} my friend the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber.</b> If you don't, that can be only because you've never looked {{in the right place}} to find him. On all waste ground outside most {{southern}} cities--Nice, Cannes, Florence: Rome, Algiers, Granada: Athens, Palermo, Tunis, where you will--the soil is thickly covered by dark trailing vines which bear on their branches a queer hairy green fruit, much like a common cucumber at that early stage of its existence when we know it best in the commercial form of pickled gherkins. As long as you don't interfere with them, these hairy green fruits do nothing out of the common in the way of personal aggressiveness. Like the model young lady of the books on etiquette, they don't speak unless they're spoken to. But if peradventure you chance to brush up against the plant accidentally, or you irritate it of set purpose with your foot or your cane, then, as Mr. Rider Haggard would say, 'a strange thing happens': off jumps the little green fruit with a startling bounce, and scatters its juice and pulp and seeds explosively {{through a hole in the}} end where the stem joined on to it. The entire central part of the cucumber, in short (answering to the seeds and pulp of a ripe melon), squirts out elastically through the breach in the outer wall, leaving the hollow shell behind as a mere empty windbag.|$|E

40|$|Cucurbitacins {{are highly}} oxygenated {{compounds}} abundantly found in Cucurbitaceous genera such as Citrullus, Cucumis, Cucurbita and Luffa. A relatively common cucurbitacin found in Cucurbitaceous species is cucurbitacin E (CuE). Although cucurbitacins exhibit positive effects both pharmacologically and {{in protecting the}} plants from certain diseases, they have {{a high degree of}} bitterness even at concentrations lower than 10 ppb. With the emergence of new cultivars, the expression of the genes that favor the production of cucurbitacins can be enhanced leading to the production of an inedible cultivar. To determine the efficacy of a method that detects these cucurbitacins in plant tissues we have selected an “indicator plant” that stores an abundance of these compounds. Locally, the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> (Ecballium elaterium) is also being used as a rootstock in general practice to graft cucurbitaceous crops, owing to the disease resistance of the <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> to several pests and diseases.

40|$|Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Rich. (also {{known as}} {{squirting}} or exploding cucumber) is a weedy plant {{that belongs to}} the Cucurbitaceae family. The roots and juice of its fruits were used in our traditional medicine against rheuma and sinusitis. This plant, and especiallu its fruit, is poisonous. The work reviews and analyses the traditional use, biological activities with the corresponding chemical constituents, and toxicological data on Ecballium elaterium species. Data regarding <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> was collected using electronic databases and library search for selected peer-reviewed articles. Additional information on traditional use and botany was obtained from published books.

40|$|Objectives. To {{present a}} rare {{occurrence}} in ear, nose and throat practice of upper airway allergic edema from use of juice {{extracted from the}} fruit of Ecballium elaterium. Introduction: Ecballium elaterium is a plant indigenous to the Mediterranean region that bears the common name <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber.</b> Many people in this region {{for the treatment of}} sinusitis use the juice of its fruit. However, allergy-prone patients after using it may sometimes present with edema at various sites of the upper respiratory tract. Otolaryngologists are frequently asked to diagnose and treat such an emergency situation. Study Design: Retrospective review of the records of 42 patients with this condition during the last 4 years. Methods. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed for age, sex, presenting symptoms, physical examination, and medical treatment. Seasonal distribution and data from the history of the patients were also considered. Skin prick and prick-to-prick testing to various allergens was performed in 12 patients. Results. Most of the patients presented with localized swelling of the uvula and the nasal mucosa, whereas in the remainder of the patients various sites of swelling of the upper respiratory tract were observed. Skin tests elicited positive reactions to pollen weeds and to various fruits of the Cucurbitaceae family. Treatment of the patients with corticosteroids and antihistamines resulted in an uneventful recovery, and we did not need to resort to therapeutic modalities, such as intubation or tracheotomy. Conclusions. We think a further study of the pharmaceutical properties of the plant's fruit juice is needed, especially regarding its curative properties of rhinitis and sinusitis. However, adverse reactions in some patients with a positive history of allergy should always be considered...|$|E
30|$|As well-known, {{screening}} of medicinal plants and natural products for their pharmacological activities desired {{for human health}} is an essential step for discovery of novel drug candidates. Since our extensive studies on discovery of new cholinesterase and TYR inhibitors from herbal sources have been conducted since the year of 2000, the current stage, we have aimed to screen randomly selected fourteen plant species [Atriplex lasiantha Boiss. (AL), Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Rich. (EE), Centaurium erythraea subsp. rhodense (Boiss & Reut.) Melderis (CER), Centaurium erythraea subsp. turcicum (Velen.) Melderis (CET), Centaurium maritimum (L.) Fritsch (CM), Centaurium spicatum L., Centaurium tenuiflorum (Hoffmans. & Link) Fritsch, Ricotia carnosula Boiss. & Heldr.

(ZM), and Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (PO) with medicinal and industrial importance for their AChE, BChE, and TYR inhibitory activities by ELISA microtiter assays at 100  μg mL- 1. Among the plant species screened, Atriplex species in Bulgaria [5], Ecballium elaterium (<b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber)</b> in Italy [6], and Centaurium species [7] in southern Italy are consumed as food, while Ricotia carnosula and Conringia grandiflora, the endemic species to Anatolia, along with Vaccaria hispanica (cow cockle) have been recently cultivated {{to be used as}} ingredients in nutraceutical industry in our country and these three species have also potential to be used for ornamental purposes. The marine seagrass (or Neptun grass), Posidonia oceanica, is an endemic species to the Mediterraneaen Sea, which forms wide meadows underwater, while Zostera species (eelgrass) forms dense sea grass beds. All these three marine species are considered to be ecologically imperative species making critical habitat and hunting zones for plentiful fish and invertebrates.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{calculations}} and measurements {{have been performed}} to determine the turgor pressures in plant phloem. Although most calculated turgor pressure gradients support the pressure flow theory (Housley and Fisher 1977; Rogers and Peel 1975; Turgeon 2010), experimental validations through direct measurement, particularly in trees, are insufficient {{due to the lack}} of a reliable real-time measurement method for the sink phloem (Knoblauch and Oparka 2012). The first direct measurement of phloem turgor pressure on actively growing trees was reported by (Buttery and Boatman 1964) using Bourdea and Schomeyer’s glass capillary manometer method (Bourdeau and Schopmeyer 1958). The daily height difference and the impacts of season, tapping, wounding and 2, 4, 5 -T stimulation (Buttery and Boatman 1964, 1966, 1967) on the phloem turgor pressure in H. brasiliensis were examined. The phloem turgor pressure gradients change consistently due to tree stomata opening and leaf water deficit, but surprisingly the measured gradient is not along the mass flow direction. The essentially same methods were also used to measure the phloem turgor pressure of red oak (Quercus rubrum) by (Hammel 1968), <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> (Ecballium elaterium) by Sheikholeslam and Currier (1977), white ash (Fraxinus americana) by Susan et al. (1981) and Lee (1981). Applying a more advanced technology, Wright and Fisher (1980) and Gould et al. (2004, 2005) established a more reliable methodology with pressure probes glued onto severed aphid stylets. Hammel’s measurement in Q. rubrum (Hammel 1968) and Gould et al’s measurement in Sonchus oleraceus and Hordeum vulgare (Gould et al. 2005) supported the pressure flow hypothesis. However, the measured turgor pressure gradients in E. elaterium (Sheikholeslam and Currier 1977) and F. americana (Lee 1981) were not in good agreement. The phloem turgor pressures are not always strong enough to drive phloem flow and are not proportional to plant size (Turgeon 2010). Therefore, the experimental verification of the existence of the required pressure gradients from source to sink of the sieve tube has not been unambiguously tested (Knoblauch and Peters 2010).|$|E
30|$|Screening {{of plant}} {{extracts}} for their enzyme inhibitory {{effect is a}} quite popular pharmacological tool as it gives a preliminary idea about efficiency of a plant towards the targeted disease. On this purpose, we have obtained some promising results out of our screening with thirty-one extracts from fourteen plants species selected for the present study. Besides, our literature survey revealed {{that none of the}} plants screened herein has been reported with any of these enzyme inhibitory activities up to date. The genus Atriplex, commonly known as saltbush or orache, consists of mostly halophytic species with edible property such as AL. To our knowledge, cholinesterase or TYR inhibitory activity of AL has not been studied so far, whereas another species, Atriplex halimus L., was demonstrated to have a significant AChE inhibition by Benamar et al. [20]. Particularly, its chloroform extract had 74.60 [*]±[*] 1.45  % of inhibition at 125  μg mL- 1, while the crude extract of the plant exhibited 66.03 [*]±[*] 1.10  % of inhibition at 250  μg mL- 1 which was shown to contain a very low amount of flavonoids consistent with our data. Therefore, the authors stated that some other type of compounds rather than flavonoids may produce the strong AChE-inhibitory effect of Atriplex halimus. Consistently, we have found by HPLC analysis that AL lacks of flavonoids except for rutin, which was actually shown to be inactive in AChE/BChE inhibition assays in our earlier publication [21]. Thus, one can make comment that none to very low inhibitory effect of the AL extracts in the enzyme inhibition assays are likely associated with the absence of flavonoid derivatives such as quercetin (Table  2). EE, a medicinal species also called <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> or exploding cucumber, has been suggested to be used against memory deficiency amongst the local people in Turkey (personal communication). Despite of this information, our experiments revealed that neither the fruit juice, nor the EtOH extracts from different parts of EE, was capable of inhibiting any of these enzymes in a good level (Table  2). This may lead such a comment that EE should be further tested by other mechanisms related to neurodegeneration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Europe, only {{a limited}} number of {{cross-cultural}} comparative field studies or meta-analyses have been focused on the dynamics through which folk plant knowledge changes over space and time, while a few studies have contributed to the understanding of how plant uses change among newcomers. Nevertheless, ethnic minority groups and/or linguistic “isles” in Southern and Eastern Europe may provide wonderful arenas for understanding the various factors that influence changes in plant uses. Methods A field ethnobotanical study was carried out in Mundimitar (Montemitro in Italian), a village of approx. 450 inhabitants, located in the Molise region of South-Eastern Italy. Mundimitar is a South-Slavic community, composed of the descendants of people who migrated to the area during the first half of the 14 th century, probably from the lower Neretva valley (Dalmatia and Herzegovina regions). Eighteen key informants (average age: 63. 7) were selected using the snowball sampling technique and participated in in-depth interviews regarding their Traditional Knowledge (TK) of the local flora. Results Although TK on wild plants is eroded in Montemitro among the youngest generations, fifty-seven taxa (including two cultivated species, which were included due to their unusual uses) were quoted by the study participants. Half of the taxa have correspondence in the Croatian and Herzegovinian folk botanical nomenclature, and the other half with South-Italian folk plant names. A remarkable link to the wild vegetable uses recorded in Dalmatia is evident. A comparison of the collected data with the previous ethnobotanical data of the Molise region and of the entire Italian Peninsula pointed out a few uses that have not been recorded in Italy thus far: the culinary use of boiled black bryony (Tamus communis) shoots in sauces and also on pasta; the use of <b>squirting</b> <b>cucumber</b> (Ecballium elaterium) juice for treating malaria in humans; the aerial parts of the elderberry tree (Sambucus nigra) for treating erysipelas in pigs; the aerial parts of pellitory (Parietaria judaica) in decoctions for treating haemorrhoids. Conclusions The fact that half of the most salient species documented in our case study – widely available both in Molise and in Dalmatia and Herzegovina – retain a Slavic name could indicate that they may have also been used in Dalmatia and Herzegovina before the migration took place. However, given the occurrence of several South-Italian plant names and uses, also a remarkable acculturation process affected the Slavic community of Montemitro during these last centuries. Future directions of research should try to simultaneously compare current ethnobotanical knowledge of both migrated communities and their counterparts in the areas of origin. </p...|$|E
