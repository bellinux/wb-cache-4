60|$|Without a cry, Bill's {{grasp on}} the oar loosened; he fell over it limply, his head {{striking}} the almost <b>submerged</b> <b>log.</b> A dark-red fluid colored the water; then his body slipped over the oar {{and into the}} river, where it sank.|$|E
60|$|The {{remaining}} volunteers saw {{the force}} of this argument and when somebody increased the blast of the lamp so that the roaring column of flame leapt up higher, the men stood very still, staring at the two who had now gained {{the center of the}} partly <b>submerged</b> <b>log.</b>|$|E
60|$|He drew a {{long breath}} {{on the shore of}} the lagoon within about a hundred yards from the {{stranded}} bows of the Emma. The tide was out and he walked {{to the end of a}} <b>submerged</b> <b>log</b> and sent out a hail for a boat. Jorgenson's voice answered. The sun had sunk behind the forest belt of the coast. All was still as far as the eye could reach over the black water. A slight breeze came along it and Jaffir on the brink, waiting for a canoe, shivered a little.|$|E
50|$|Males {{usually found}} {{perch on the}} rocks and {{floating}} logs and grasses in the forest stream. They fly occasionally to reveal their glistening wing patches. Females lay their eggs in <b>submerged</b> <b>logs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dangers on {{the upper}} river include shallow, {{extremely}} braided channels, and aufeis. Overhanging vegetation and <b>submerged</b> <b>logs</b> pose risks along the entire course, as do bears along the lower reaches in late summer and early fall.|$|R
50|$|M.duboulayi is omnivorous. Their diet {{comprises}} {{all kinds}} of foods, especially invertebrates and algae, and in captivity they eat flake food. They like open water and may form small groups around <b>submerged</b> <b>logs</b> and subsurface vegetation.|$|R

5000|$|Pterophyllum {{is a small}} genus of {{freshwater}} fish from the family Cichlidae known to most aquarists as [...] "angelfish". All Pterophyllum species originate from the Amazon Basin, Orinoco Basin and various rivers in the Guiana Shield in tropical South America. The three species of Pterophyllum are unusually shaped for cichlids being greatly laterally compressed, with round bodies and elongated triangular dorsal and anal fins. This body shape allows them to hide among roots and plants, often on a vertical surface. Naturally occurring angelfish are frequently striped longitudinally, colouration which provides additional camouflage. Angelfish are ambush predators and prey on small fish and macroinvertebrates. All Pterophyllum species form monogamous pairs. Eggs are generally laid on a <b>submerged</b> <b>log</b> or a flattened leaf. As {{is the case for}} other cichlids, brood care is highly developed.|$|E

50|$|The species prefers vegetated {{areas in}} {{sluggish}} backwaters, lakes, and ponds with gravel, sand, or bedrock bottoms. They {{also can be}} found in very muddy waters and are able to tolerate poor water conditions. Green sunfish tend to spend their time hiding around rocks, <b>submerged</b> <b>logs,</b> and other objects that provide cover and protection.|$|R
50|$|Glenlyon Dam {{provides}} {{water for}} irrigation of grain and fodder crops. It is managed by SunWater. Swimming, fishing, boating and water skiing are all permitted, with no restrictions on boating except near the dam wall. Two boat ramps facilitate access for boating. In {{the upper reaches}} of feeder creeks there a large areas of standing timber and <b>submerged</b> <b>logs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1978, {{at the age}} of 69, Sabbe {{was found}} near his birthplace of Paidra, Lasva Parish in southeastern Estonia by two KGB agents posing as fishermen. When they {{attempted}} to arrest him, he leaped into the Võhandu River and either drowned accidentally or deliberately wedged himself under a <b>submerged</b> <b>log.</b> The KGB, which took photographs before and after the attempted arrest, maintained that Sabbe drowned while attempting to escape. But some have observed that the river is narrow, sluggish and shallow at that point, an unlikely place for an accidental drowning, and that the open field on the opposite bank and the river's lazy loops gave an elderly man no place to flee from two young, physically fit pursuers. The Forest Brethren's code of conduct and the quickness of Sabbe's reaction suggest that Sabbe was prepared not to be taken alive.|$|E

5000|$|In March 1935, the United States Navy {{was making}} {{plans for a}} new patrol bomber that would have {{increased}} performance and weapon load capability from their newly procured Consolidated YP3Y-1. Prototypes were ordered from Sikorsky in June 1935 and Consolidated Aircraft in July 1936. Sikorsky's entry, the XPBS-1 (Bureau Number 9995), made its first flight on 9 September 1937, the Consolidated XPB2Y-1 on 17 December of the same year. [...] The XPBS-1 was evaluated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, but the Navy contract went to Consolidated. The XPBS-1 remained in naval service, temporarily operated by Patrol Wing Five at Norfolk, Virginia in 1939, then by Patrol Wing Two at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, until it was finally assigned to transport squadron VR-2 at Naval Air Station Alameda, in 1940. On 30 June 1942, the XPBS-1 hit a <b>submerged</b> <b>log</b> upon landing at NAS Alameda. Among its passengers was CINCPAC Admiral Chester W. Nimitz who suffered minor injuries. One member of the flight crew, Lieutenant Thomas M. Roscoe, died. The XPBS-1 sank and was lost.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the manicured areas that make {{up most of the}} gardens, patches of less orderly shrubs, upland forest, marsh vegetation, and <b>submerged</b> <b>logs</b> attract wildlife, especially waterfowl, most prevalent in winter. The Rhododendron Society has counted 94 species in the garden, including grebes, herons, ducks, Canada geese, wigeons, gulls, thrushes, nuthatches, hummingbirds, and others.|$|R
50|$|Like {{several other}} tilapiine cichlids, the spotted tilapia is notable for its {{adaptability}} and prolific breeding. spotted tilapia breed {{when they are}} about 15 cm long and generally breed year long with peaks in November, March-April and July-September. They lay up to 1800 eggs usually on <b>submerged</b> <b>logs,</b> rocks or plants and the eggs hatch after approximately three days.|$|R
50|$|Spawning {{occurs in}} late June and early July, and the nests made {{in areas with}} <b>submerged</b> <b>logs</b> and other debris. The males, which also build the nests, {{fiercely}} and tirelessly defend and fan the clutch.

Closer to the coast, the hurricane produced a storm surge of 10 ft in Galveston and Velasco. However, due to the Galveston Seawall, much of the potential storm surge-related damage in Galveston was mitigated, though the seawall forced spray to rise 60 ft in the air. Areas outside the seawall on the Galveston beach, including two fishing piers and pavilions were destroyed. On Galveston's Tarpon Pier, ten members of a fishing party perished after the pier collapsed, though six were rescued by the yacht Mayflower. In western areas of Galveston, where there was no seawall, inland areas were inundated under 7 ft of water. However, Galveston's primary streets were submerged to a lesser extent, under 2 ft of water. In Velasco, the tide was reported to have been 3 ft higher than during the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which inundated the city under 4 ft of water. Areas of Sabine Pass were also inundated by the high waves, and the Southern Pacific Railroad was submerged in water.|$|E
5000|$|Based on his {{research}} at Macquarie Graduate School of Management, Captain Bethune {{set out to}} prove that hydrocarbon fuels could be replaced by sustainable bio-fuels. He had Earthrace designed by LOMOcean Design and built in order to break the world record for a circumnavigation of the globe by a powerboat in hopes that it would {{call attention to the}} viability of biodiesel as an alternative fuel. He mortgaged his New Zealand home and financed the building in the hopes of recouping the expenses from sponsorship. He declined a $4 million sponsorship from a company that would have required them to use regular diesel.His first attempt began in Barbados on 10 March 2007. He encountered significant delays due to issues with the propellers and other mechanical problems. On the night of 19 March, while around 22 km offshore from Guatemala, Earthrace collided with a local fishing boat. The crew was absolved of any responsibility after a 10-day investigation during which they were held in custody under armed guard in the military compound in Puerto Quetzal. The delays prevented them from completing the circumnavigation in record time using their original start location. The crew took Earthrace to San Diego where they made repairs. They then restarted their record attempt, leaving San Diego on 7 April 2007. Once they rounded Aceh in Indonesia and started crossing the Indian Ocean the vessel encountered significant bad weather in the first monsoon of the season. The monsoon remained with them all the way to Salalah in Oman. The vessel passed through the Suez Canal, then when getting close to Spain, crew discovered a structural failure around the depth transducer. Bethune said the [...] "failure was a result of the constant pounding in crossing the Indian Ocean". Crew made temporary repairs and headed out to cross the Atlantic, however the repairs failed and Earthrace limped back to port in Málaga, Spain. Bethune decided to abandon the attempt.Captain Bethune returned to New Zealand to recover from what he said was [...] "a brutal ordeal". After meeting with some of his original sponsors, he assembled a new team. The vessel was repaired and departed from Sagunto, Spain, in another record attempt on 1 March 2008. The second record attempt also suffered a large number of setbacks. The auto-pilot system failed in the Atlantic crossing. This was repaired in Puerto Rico. There was a general strike in Panama Canal causing 3 days in delays waiting to transit the canal. In the leg between Hawaii and Marshall Islands, there was a problem with the common rail injection system, which was repaired in Majuro. The crew then had their biggest setback in Palau, when Earthrace hit a <b>submerged</b> <b>log</b> a few nautical miles offshore. The vessel limped back into Palau with extensive damage. A list of problems included a bent driveshaft, propeller damage, smashed P-Bracket, smashed engine mounts, broken gearbox, rudder damage, and a 5 meter gouge down the starboard side of the composite hull. Crew determined it would be almost impossible to repair the vessel quickly in Palau. They made temporary repairs and ran on one engine to Singapore. On arrival, the initial assessment was repairs would take at least 2 weeks, which would make the record almost impossible to get. Marine salvage company Posh Semco offered to help with haul-out, and the vessel was pulled from the water. Crew worked around the clock for 3 days. Earthrace was put back into the water with what Captain Bethune described as [...] "the ugliest composite repair" [...] he'd ever seen. Crew continued on their voyage towards their finish line in Spain. Captain Bethune finished at the Spanish port of Sagunto on 27 June. The journey was completed in 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes, beating the former record by over two weeks. Captain Bethune later confessed the reason they missed the record on the first attempt was his leadership was poor. He said the real difference in the second successful attempt was he did a better job in making decisions and running the team. He also claimed his team had been outstanding in Singapore. They had achieved a small miracle in getting Earthrace repaired so quickly, in very challenging circumstances.|$|E
50|$|The {{spawning}} season of C. spiloptera lasts from mid-June until mid-August. Adult females deposit their eggs inside small crevices {{of rocks and}} <b>submerged</b> <b>logs</b> or roots. Their eggs, which typically hatch in about five days, are defended by male. The maximum reported age of C. spiloptera is five years, but most usually only live to be around two years of age.|$|R
50|$|Mandageria {{was a large}} {{predator}} about 1.5 to 2 m long. It had a long torpedo-shaped {{body and}} large tail fins. Mandageria also had large pectoral fins which had helped it manoeuvre around <b>submerged</b> <b>logs</b> when preparing to attack its prey. Mandageria had a functional neck joint, an otherwise uncommon feature among fish - Tiktaalik, Tarrasius, placoderms (esp. Arthrodira) and seahorses being other exceptions.|$|R
50|$|Pumpkinseeds {{are more}} {{tolerant}} of low oxygen levels than bluegills are, but less tolerant of warm water.
