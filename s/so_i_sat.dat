500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)", {{the lead}} single and first {{track of the}} album, was mainly written by Lohan as a letter to her father, Michael Lohan, who was incarcerated in June 2005 after {{surviving}} a car crash {{for which he was}} charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Additional writing and song production was done by Greg Wells and Kara DioGuardi, who revealed, [...] "If you solo the vocals you'll hear race cars, because we brought the studio to [...] trailer on [...] I'm not kidding! She had no time to do the record, so she would be on her lunch break, and I'd be like, 'Throw that thing down your throat and get over here, 'cause we got to finish these vocals!' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> for 14 hours on the set and would grab her for, like, 10 minutes at a time. The poor girl. That's the reality of young Hollywood. When they're hot, they're worked to death. It was 18/20-hour days. ... And I swear: 'Vroom! Vroom!' You can hear it in the back." [...] "My Innocence" [...] is also about the singer's father. Lohan also covered [...] "I Want You to Want Me" [...] by Cheap Trick and [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] by Stevie Nicks for the album.|$|E

60|$|I couldn't help it. I {{was tired}} and warm and <b>so</b> disappointed. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> right down on the rustic seat behind me and burst into tears, as the story-books say.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> {{amazed that}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{and looked at}} Pomona without saying a word.|$|R
60|$|This {{meant that}} I {{should have been}} obliged to leave Anscombe alone, which I {{did not wish to}} do, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> still and, as I have said, was {{intensely}} bored, hanging about the place and smoking more than was good for me.|$|R
2500|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down and}} did a huge list of {{everything}} I had read ... and when I finished the list I handed it to them [...] They said that's impossible, you couldn't read that many books in a year, two years, and I had read all of those books in {{two and a half}} weeks - and well, that's The Secret.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{first stage}} {{name as a}} dancer was [...] "Jennasis", which she later used as {{the name of a}} {{business}} that she incorporated ("Jennasis Killing Co."). [...] As for picking her permanent professional name, she said, [...] "I {{had to come up with}} a good name. [...] I didn't want a porno name. [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down, opened up the phone book and thumbed to the J's, cause I wanted it to match my first name." [...] She saw 'James', but rejected [...] "Jenna James" [...] because it [...] "sounds too porno". [...] Right under that was 'Jameson' which struck her as being the name of the whiskey she likes and thought [...] "Ok, that's perfect." [...] That night at work she saw her brother and asked him what he thought of the name [...] "Jenna Jameson". [...] He said, [...] "I'm drinking Jameson right now." [...] And the name stuck after that.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his release}} from Shrewsbury, Madjo opted to move abroad, signing for Chinese League One side Guangdong Sunray Cave on a free transfer. He made 18 league {{appearances}} for the club, scoring ten goals. He finished the 2009 campaign as the club's top goalscorer, and fifth in the overall goalscoring charts. The following season, Madjo signed for Albanian Superliga side KS Bylis Ballsh. He made his debut for the club in a 3–2 defeat to KS Vllaznia Shkodër on 22 August 2010, playing the whole 90 minutes. Madjo scored his first goal for the club on 30 October 2010, netting in the first minute of the match as Bylis beat Besa Kavajë 3–1. He also scored a last minute winner in the club's 3–2 home win against Shkumbini Peqin in November 2010. Madjo was given a straight red card in the club's 2–1 defeat to KS Kastrioti on 24 December 2010. It was to be Madjo's last game for Bylis. He later said that [...] "I felt that Bylis Ballsh did not respect my contract <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down with the club and cancelled my contract." [...] He made a total of 15 appearances for the Albanian side, scoring twice.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> {{down and}} rested, letting the oxen feed {{throughout}} {{the hours of}} light on the rich grasses which grew upon the bottom-most slopes of the big mountain where we were camped by a stream, not more than a hundred yards above the timber line.|$|R
60|$|As I {{had come}} to know that Kari never did {{anything}} without a reason and remembered that I was in a strange country where, lacking him, I should not have lived or could continue to do <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> fell into his humour. Moreover, I promised that I would remain still and neither speak, nor smile, nor rise from my chair unless he bade me. <b>So</b> there <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> glittering in the hot sunshine which burned me through the armour.|$|R
6000|$|I stood waiting. There {{was a long}} silence, {{the steam}} from the many breaths rising about me like a fog. At last one elder after another nodded his head slowly several times, and muttered, [...] "There is force in what the child has said." [...] Oh, the heart-lift that was in those words!--so transient, but, oh, <b>so</b> precious! <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down.|$|R
60|$|I felt {{exactly the}} same but, in view of Sara Ray's tears, admit it I would not; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> in grum silence while the other tongues wagged.|$|E
60|$|The kind frank way {{in which}} this was said quite won my heart, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down on the old cask, and told the sailor all my sorrows.|$|E
60|$|He slid {{through the}} bushes and disappeared. I sat where I was, musing, my work interrupted, a mood of bitter disillusionment heavy upon me. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> {{it may have been}} for hours.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> down <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> and scribbled, {{while my}} {{sovereign}} lady quietly stitched by my side. And here I tell my reader that I write {{on such a}} subject under protest,--declaring again my conviction that, if my wife only believed in herself as firmly as I do, she would write so that nobody would ever {{want to listen to}} me again.|$|R
6000|$|... "We do not forgive in our family, {{my darling}} Francoise. Is it not like old days to find {{ourselves}} driving together? And in this carriage, too. It {{is the very}} one which bore us back from the cathedral where you made your vows <b>so</b> prettily. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> as <b>I</b> sit now, and you <b>sat</b> there, and <b>I</b> took your hand like this, and I pressed it, and--" ...|$|R
5000|$|I had {{complete}} {{suspension of}} disbelief—really, I {{was eight years}} old and it transported me. I was on that beach running from that dragon, fighting that Cyclops. It just really dazzled me, and I bought it completely. And <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> actually <b>sat</b> through it twice and when I got home, I asked my mom, “Who does that? Who makes the movie?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{him first}} in his own room at night." [...] I knew {{in my heart that}} in {{whatever}} she did had been nothing wrong, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> silent waiting for her to go on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, dear lady, {{or rather}} your manner," [...] he answered, imperturbably. [...] "It {{seemed to me}} that you were saying all the time, 'Do not desert me! Do not desert me!' And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> tight." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{myself on}} the ground after the fashion of a scribe, having no choice, and the Princess sat herself on a couch {{at the end of}} the table, but Seti {{remained}} standing. Then the Princess said: ...|$|E
6000|$|That spiked my gun. I {{could not}} say anything. I was entirely out of verbal obliquities; to go further would be to lie, and that I would not do; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> simply <b>sat</b> still and suffered--sat mutely and resignedly there, and sizzled--for I was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes. Presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said: ...|$|R
60|$|After I had eaten, I {{attempted}} {{to walk again}} out of doors with my gun; but was <b>so</b> weak, that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down, {{and looked at the}} sea, which was smooth and calm. While I continued here, these thoughts came into my mind.|$|R
60|$|I {{was shown}} {{into the room}} <b>I</b> already knew <b>so</b> well, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down in Giulia's chair. I rested {{my head on the}} {{cushions}} which had pressed against her beautiful hair, her cheek; and I inhaled the fragrance which they had left behind them.|$|R
60|$|It was {{of small}} use {{to follow him}} further, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down on a {{prostrate}} yellow birch to rest and listen awhile in the vast silence, and to watch anything that might be passing through the cold white woods.|$|E
60|$|That was interesting; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down on a}} rock to watch. Whenever I took my {{eyes from}} him a moment, it was {{difficult}} to find him again, so perfectly did his plumage blend with the white ice upon which he stood motionless.|$|E
60|$|My fust {{idea was}} to go arter 'im, but I knew I couldn't catch 'im, and if I tried to meet 'im coming back I should most likely miss 'im through the side streets. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there with my pipe and waited.|$|E
5000|$|When {{questioned}} about the album, Kip Winger has stated: [...] "When the chance {{came up to}} do a new Winger record, I envisioned an upbeat totally rocking record that was a cross between the 1st Winger album and Pull. <b>So</b> Reb and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down and wrote all the music {{in a month or}} <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> worked for 6 months to finish it in the classic Winger style." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{upon the}} box of the first wagon, eating my food, which {{consisted}} of some biltong and biscuit, for I had not bothered to shoot any game that day, which was very hot, and wondering whether Zikali were still alive, also whether I should take the trouble to walk up the kloof and find out. On the whole I thought that I would not, as the place repelled me, and I did not particularly wish to hear any more of his prophecies and fierce, ill-omened talk. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> there studying the wonderful effect of the red evening light pouring up between those walls of fantastic rocks.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gulliver <b>sat</b> where <b>I</b> {{had left}} him. Defeat stared from his eyes. Lines of insane thought {{disfigured}} his face. Yet he sat, stubborn and upright, heedless of the uproar, heedless even that the late beams {{of the sun}} had found him out in his last desolation. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> too <b>sat</b> down without speech, and waited till he should come up out of his gloom, and find a friend in a stranger.|$|R
60|$|She didn't answer, but I {{could see}} it coming, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> still and waited. And {{presently}} she seemed to make up her mind that, {{even if it was}} no business of mine, it would be a relief to talk about it.|$|E
6000|$|Here was {{now another}} subject for my note-book, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down, {{and began a}} minute {{inspection}} of the noble-looking animal, while my comrades, heaping fresh logs on the fire, sat {{down in front of}} it, and for upwards of an hour, [...] "fought their battles o'er again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chap {{came in here}} {{directly}} {{you were}} gone--mumbled something about doing something for you. I didn't altogether like the look of him, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{on the table and}} watched. He hung around for a moment, and then, when he saw that I was sticking it out, he went off." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "(Guru Mani Madhava Chakiar) {{began playing}} the dual role of Parvati and Shiva... {{he sat on}} a wooden chair...I have never ever seen a Parvati <b>so</b> exquisitely beautiful. <b>I</b> have never seen a Shiva so {{handsome}} and <b>so</b> cunning. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there and wept as if I were alone in the presence of God. I then realised what theatre was all about – the falsehood of that old man made me arrive at a state where inhibitions and convictions, all became so fluid and beautiful. And this vision has remained with me always" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Agnes!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, no sir; I expect she's at home; {{and if she}} {{did come}} here {{with the rest of}} the neighbors I didn't see her; for when I found out what had happened, sir, <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> weak that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down in the kitchen all of a lump, and have just had {{strength}} enough to come out." ...|$|R
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|R
