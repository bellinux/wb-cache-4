50|$|A <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> is {{a linear}} drain used to {{evacuate}} ground water. The {{difference between a}} <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> and the traditional trench drain is that the <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> {{does not have any}} kind of grating. In recent years, this drainage concept is more often used in both indoor and outdoor applications, such as fire halls, car washes, landscaping, shower rooms and garages.|$|E
50|$|Compared to grated trench drains, the <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> {{has several}} advantages, {{as it does}} not have any kind of grating that deteriorates, rusts or needs replacement.|$|E
50|$|Fundamentally, the <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> {{is another}} type of trench drain. Slot {{describes}} its appearance on the ground. It is preferable in areas with heavy traffic, or which require intense cleaning.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slot</b> <b>drains</b> {{made from}} brick {{are used by}} architects, {{especially}} landscaping architects as they usually do not want grates {{to appear on the}} ground for fountains, playgrounds and gardens.|$|R
40|$|Stormwater {{runoff from}} {{highways}} is laden with contaminants, particularly heavy metals that adversely impact receiving waters. Traditional BMPs such as stormwater retention and detention facilities, while capable of settling out particulate bound metals, have high installation costs and considerable {{right of way}} requirements, and are thus not ideally suited for certain locations. Under some circumstances the natural roadside environment may adequately infiltrate stormwater runoff while also concentrating traffic generated contaminants, much like vegetated filter strips and biofiltration swales, preventing the discharge of metals to receiving waters. This research investigates the utility of these roadside areas, or low impact development (LID) low impact areas (LIAs), for stormwater contaminant mitigation. Three LIA natural roadside environments were instrumented with <b>slot</b> <b>drains,</b> precipitation and flow measurement devices, and sample collection apparatus in order to quantify overland flow and iii contaminant transport at three distances from the pavement edge. For all 36 precipitation events documented at the Pullman LIA site, stormwater runoff wa...|$|R
40|$|French drains or infiltrating filter drains are {{commonly}} fitted with slotted plastic pipe {{to act as}} an overflow mechanism when rainfall is too great to allow complete infiltration. The release of the effluent from such pipes is commonly to surface water courses. Whilst there is expected to be some slight degree of protection against hydrocarbon release because of interaction with the drain’s stone infill material this will be severely limited. This paper reports an experiment in which model filter drains with or without geotextile sleeves around the <b>slotted</b> <b>drain</b> are challenged with lubricating oil. The textile was a surface-treated non-woven geotextile manufactured from polyester. The models were challenged with very high loadings of oil, as would be anticipated in a motor vehicle collision occurring close to the drain. A series of simulated 10 - 20 mm rain events over 1 hour were applied and two sample types were collected which either included or excluded any free product. Additional aliquots of oil were added at each rain event. The un-sleeved models were found to release visible free product with the addition of as little as 100 ml of oil per linear meter of drain. For the models with geotextile sleeves there was no such release with as much as 2000 ml per linear metre. Analysis showed that under these conditions the geotextile sleeved pipes continued to produce effluent with hydrocarbon concentrations well below the 5000 g/l limit usually accepted in the UK...|$|R
50|$|The surface {{opening of}} channel {{drainage}} usually {{comes in the}} form of gratings (polymer, plastic, steel or iron) or a single slot (<b>slot</b> <b>drain)</b> that runs along the ground surface (typically manufactured from steel or iron).|$|E
50|$|Retrieving accidentally-dropped objects {{can be more}} {{difficult}} where a <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> is placed, as {{it is not easy}} to put fingers through the slot and get objects back, especially when the slot opening is small. A stick or paddle may be needed to move the object to a catch basin.|$|E
50|$|Trench drains are {{commonly}} confused with French drains, which {{consist of a}} perforated pipe that is buried in a gravel bed, and which are used to evacuate ground water. A <b>slot</b> <b>drain,</b> also wrongly associated with a trench drain, consists of a drainage pipe with a thin neck (or slot) that opens at the ground surface with sufficient opening to drain storm water.|$|E
40|$|Windage {{power loss}} in {{high-speed}} gearboxes result in efficiency losses and increased heating due {{to drag on}} the gear teeth. Meshed spur gear windage power loss test results are presented at ambient oil inlet temperatures both with and without shrouding. The rate of windage power loss is observed to increase above 10, 000 ft. min., gear surface speed, similar to results presented in the literature. Shrouding is observed to become more effective above 15, 000 ft. min., decreasing power loss by 10 at 25, 000 ft. min. The need for gearbox oil <b>drain</b> <b>slots</b> limits the effectiveness of shrouding on reducing windage power loss. Also, windage power loss is observed to decrease with increasing gearbox temperatures and to increase with oil flow. Windage power losses for the unshrouded meshed spur gears are 7 x more than losses determined from unshrouded single spur gear tests. A 6 x to 12 x increase in windage power is observed comparing shrouded single spur gear data with shrouded meshed spur gear data. Based on this preliminary study additional research is suggested {{to determine the effect}} of oil <b>drain</b> <b>slot</b> configurations, axial and radial shroud clearances, and higher gear surface speeds on windage power loss. Additional work is also suggested to determine the sensitivity of windage power loss to oil temperature and oil flow. Windage power loss of meshed spur gears tested in both the shrouded and unshrouded configurations is shown to be more than double versus the same spur gears run individually in the same shroud configurations. Further study of the physical processes behind these results is needed for optimizing gearbox shrouds for minimum windage power loss...|$|R
40|$|Stormwater run-off from {{industrial}} sources can impact the receiving environment by {{the discharge of}} toxic substances, nutrients, sediments or fresh water (in marine environments). The Port of Tauranga is New Zealand’s largest by cargo volume with untreated logs {{being one of the}} major exports. The port stores logs totalling up to 300, 000 m 3 with an average residency time of 18 days. Runoff from log storage areas can cause toxicity to aquatic life due to low pH, high organic solids content and associated BOD, and chemicals leached from timber such as resin acids. Metals and PAH’s from heavy vehicles and other machinery can also be present. At the port, stormwater collects from the storage areas into <b>slot</b> <b>drains</b> and is screened for larger particulates in screening chambers before discharging into Tauranga Harbour. Large rainfall events produce a visible, highly coloured plume extending across the main harbour channel. This study looks at compounds within the stormwater runoff and associated marine water samples and the toxicology of the effluent. It then focusses on the gradients of compounds found in sediments and biota in relation to the main discharge sources. This is followed with a more specific investigation of the bioaccumulation of resin acids in resident and transplanted mussels. It concludes with a comparison of low intertidal species assemblages within and outside the influence of the stormwater plume. Findings indicate that there are high levels of wood derived chemicals in the stormwater runoff and a gradient of quantities of these can be detected in nearby sediments, decreasing with distance from the discharge point of the effluent. Those compounds, such as metals, able to be quantified against national and international guidelines were well within acceptable levels. Others, such as resin acids, were found in lower quantities than in a previous study. A correlation between organics related to leachate from the logs, inorganic compounds found in the effluent and sediment grain size, indicates that some elements of the runoff may reach further into the harbour. The influence of dredging and disturbance of the seabed by shipping movements is considered in relation to this. Levels of organic compounds, related to the log storage in transplanted mussel populations, were not detected spatially or temporally and no evidence of bio-accumulation of resin acids was found. Based on the combined findings there are very low detectable effects on the marine environment from the runoff of the Port of Tauranga log storage areas. These {{come in the form of}} a gradient in chemical compounds related to the runoff and are well within the ANZECC (2000) Interim Guideline Levels. This study adds to the limited knowledge on log storage runoff into the marine environment and incorporates elements which can be applied to many areas of research related to stormwater discharge. It uses the Port of Tauranga runoff as a relevant example of issues and environmental responses related to urban and industrial stormwater runoff...|$|R
40|$|Fill {{and draw}} is a {{flushing}} technique {{that may be}} used to help remove contaminants from landfilled waste and, in so doing, accelerate the remediation of landfill sites. A simple fill and draw technique involves saturating in situ waste from the bottom up with water and then, normally following a pause, draining the landfill. In this way, soluble and diffusive contaminants can effectively be recovered from the waste mass. Repeating this process will sequentially reduce the masses of contaminants. This report describes a large-scale fill and draw tracer test that was performed in a 25 000 tonne test cell at a landfill in Landgraaf (The Netherlands), which contained a ~ 2. 5 m saturated zone at its base. Hydrogeological tracers were mixed with 800 m 3 water and introduced into the basal drainage system of the landfill test cell over a period of 17 days. 69 kg of bromide (in the form of potassium bromide) and 0. 56 kg of Rhodamine WT (RWT) were evenly mixed with the water and injected at a constant rate of 2 m 3 /hour through three <b>slotted</b> <b>drains</b> equally spaced across the base of the test cell. Towards the end of the injection phase, 0. 45 kg of Li was also added to the tracer mix to help assess the properties of the test cell’s basal sand layer. After a 3 day pause the injected water and tracer was then pumped from the cell using the same infrastructure that was used to introduce it. The tracer breakthrough data and the analysis of contaminants recovered from the waste during pumping were used to determine a number of important contaminant transport processes. Abstraction of the injected tracer occurred over two periods of constant pumping separated by a 40 day pause. The initial abstraction of 555 m 3 over a period of 26 days occurred at an average rate of 0. 9 m 3 /hr. The second 53 day phase removed a further 543 m 3 of leachate at an average rate of 0. 5 m 3 /hr. Drainage was from the three basal drains, with flow rates controlled manually. During abstraction, samples were collected from each drain, and from the combined discharge. An inline fluorometer, installed in the discharge, was also used to monitor the tracer return. Leachate heads were measured in fully-screened wells and piezometers with discrete response zones. By the end of injection, the leachate table had been raised by ~ 2. 2 m. The wells and piezometers were also used to collect water samples, before and throughout the tracer test. Average leachate levels {{at the end of the}} test were returned to starting conditions (i. e. ~ 2. 5 m saturated depth). Water samples were analysed in the laboratory for a wide range of parameters, including the introduced tracers Br, Li and RWT, and indigenous leachate contaminants including chloride, ammonia, electrical conductivity and dissolved organic carbon. The mass recovery of the bromide was between 61 - 83 %. The concentration of bromide measured in the piezometers with a deeper response zone (i. e. those nearer the base of the test cell), showed a higher peak during injection period than the shallower piezometers. The deeper piezometers also maintained higher concentrations of tracer at the end of the test than those with a shallower response zone. An inverse response was seen in the analysis of indigenous contaminants (including ammonia and chloride). In general, deep piezometers showed a more significant change in concentration than the shallower piezometers. Contaminant transport parameters for the waste were recovered from model fits to the introduced tracers Br and Li, and to indigenous contaminants Cl and NH 4. The tracer Li was mainly used to characterise the influence of the basal sand layer. A simple 1 D, two-porosity advection diffusion model (DP-Pulse) was used to provide a ‘first approximation’ fit to the data. Both the tracers and the indigenous contaminants fit the model well, suggesting that despite the complexity of the system, a simple conceptualisation is sufficient for estimating bulk contaminant flushing parameters. The results for Br and Cl, return extremely high values of tcb (the characteristic diffusion time of an immobile block of waste), in excess of 500 days. This may indicate that there are either large sections of the waste which are isolated from the flow, or that there are highly-localised preferential flow paths. The recovered values of tcb, indicate that the characteristic dimension of the immobile blocks is at least 20 cm and possibly greater than 60 cm. The block diffusion time for NH 4, was two orders of magnitude lower than for the other species, which may indicate that the spatial distribution of ammonia was a lot more varied than Cl. The results of this trial demonstrate the viability of the ‘fill and draw’ concept using the basal leachate drainage system of (hydrogeologically suitability) landfills as a potential accelerated landfill remediation technique. The models that have been developed will form the basis of future design tools. Further work is required to assess the efficiency of this modus operandi versus other landfill flushing techniques...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the use of}} slot {{drainage}} at airports, {{the manufacturers}} began engineering slot drainage for other types of construction project, including ports, docks, industrial areas, motorways, roads, car parks and urban developments. Differing sizes and load ratings variations of the original <b>slot</b> <b>drain</b> product now exist, manufactured by Gatic {{and a handful of}} other manufacturers, most notably Halfords and Aco technologies.|$|E
50|$|To clean a grated trench drain, the grates on top must be removed. This can be {{difficult}} or frustrating if the grates are stuck, or tools are needed to pull them up. If {{it is a long}} run trench drain, it is time consuming to remove the trench drain grates and put them back after cleaning. <b>Slot</b> <b>drain</b> can be cleaned by moving along a cleaning paddle to move the sediment into a catch basin.|$|E
50|$|The use of trench drains in {{construction}} {{began with the}} commission by the British Airports Authority of a company called Gatic. Airports were {{in need of a}} form of trench drainage with fewer movable parts and less tendency to collapse under heavy traffic than the traditional drainage gratings. Gatic designed and engineered the first stainless steel <b>slot</b> <b>drain,</b> and it was installed first at Stanstead Airport in the UK, following which it was specified at Britain’s most famous airport - Heathrow. These airports continue to use stainless steel slot drainage both airside and landside for surface water drainage requirements.|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} against environment pollution requests active actions for land remediation, with removal of pollutantnts and pathogenic agents. The waste landfills are incumbent dangers, with leachates polluting water beds. The fact is main {{concern of the}} EU and the enacted regulations requests decommissioning operations. Today techniques transfer and encapsulate the landfills, by expensive and humans unsafe methods, without fully cancelling out the leachate risk. This project overcomes the limitations of current solutions with resort to a mixed technique, mainly based on a robotic equipment, capable of creating a draining manifold through remotely operated fixtures. The technique combines micro-tunnelling technology, to create proper collecting lines under the landfill [1], with implantation in the waste bulk of the patented SIDRA® draining elements, to obtain a cost effective system for safe and final remediation of landfills. The SIDRA® pipes consist of hollow rods with <b>draining</b> <b>slots</b> covered by water soluble plastic caps, to prevent occlusion by the debris during drilling. To bring this concept into an exploitable industrial set-up, the project required the ideation and implementation of a reliable and effective robotic equipment, capable of moving and positioning within the small microtunnels, while accomplishing the drilling from the bottom, up to 20 - 30 m afar in the waste bulk with implantation of the piping system. No operator is allowed (nor would accept) to drill below leachate pools; thus the all task needs be fulfilled without human intervention. The paper gives details {{on the development of}} the drilling sequence and draining pipes implantation robot, with annexed local feeding, buffering and pre-setting modules and related monitoring and governing equipment. The SIDRA ® technique is registered method...|$|R
50|$|A {{trench drain}} (also channel drain, line drain, <b>slot</b> <b>drain,</b> linear drain or strip drain) is a {{specific}} type of floor drain containing a dominant trough- or channel-shaped body. It is used for the rapid evacuation of surface water or for the containment of utility lines or chemical spills. Employing a solid cover or grating that is flush with the adjoining surface, this drain is commonly made of concrete in-situ and may utilize polymer- or metal-based liners or a channel former to aid in channel crafting and slope formation. Characterized by its long length and narrow width, the cross-section of the drain {{is a function of the}} maximum flow volume anticipated from the surrounding surface. Channels can range from 1 in to 2 feet in width, with depths that can reach 4 ft.|$|E
