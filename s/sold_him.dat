5|$|As Leighton was {{unlikely}} to be dislodged, Ferguson promised to find Gunn another club, and fulfilled his pledge when he <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> for £100,000 to Norwich City in October 1986. The transfer nearly went through {{in the summer of}} 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.|$|E
5|$|After the 1836 election, Tyler {{thought his}} {{political}} career was at an end, and planned to return to private law practice. In the fall of 1837 a friend <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> a sizable property in Williamsburg. Unable to remain away from politics, Tyler successfully sought election to the House of Delegates and took his seat in 1838. He was a national political figure by this point, and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was shown}} footage of James Cameron's Avatar which <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> {{on the idea}} to shoot Resident Evil: Afterlife in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more {{specifically}} a Sony F35 camera. The crew spent two weeks in pre-production learning the 3D camera system. With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.|$|E

5|$|In 1788, while {{residing}} at his Wappocomo residence, Casey {{purchased a}} freed slave named John, {{who had been}} residing in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Virginia residents Francis McGuire, Baldwin Parsons, and Absalom Wells seized John and transported him to Virginia, where they <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> back into slavery to Casey. Such an act was illegal in Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society petitioned Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin to demand punishment of the three men by the Governor of Virginia. Virginia's governor refused, citing {{the absence of a}} provision in the United States Constitution calling for such an action. Governor Mifflin petitioned the United States Congress, and a bill was introduced that provided against such an occurrence.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had never}} seriously {{considered}} coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching {{position with the}} Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years {{he was not the}} league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E
5|$|John Meares, who {{had also}} served under Cook, sailed to the North West Coast in 1786. He spent the winter in Prince William Sound, his ship trapped by ice and his men dying of scurvy. He was rescued by the timely arrival of Dixon and Portlock. Meares {{organized}} a second expedition of two ships, the Felice Adventurero and Iphigenia Nubiana. Meares was captain of the Felice and William Douglas was captain of the Iphigenia. Meares decided not to license his ships with the EIC, instead trying to conceal the illegal activity by using the flag of Portugal. They arrived at Nootka Sound in May 1788. Meares later claimed that Chief Maquinna <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> some land and on it Meares had a building erected. These claims later became a point of dispute during the Nootka Crisis. Spain, which sought control of Nootka Sound, rejected both claims; the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. There is no doubt, however, that Meares had the sloop North West America built in Nootka Sound, the first nonindigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

That October, the Red Sox <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> along with seven other players to their Triple-A affiliate Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League.|$|E
25|$|Cardiff signed renowned goal-getters Ivor Allchurch and Peter Hooper for the {{upcoming}} 1962–63 Second Division campaign, and so Charles was moved to a more {{central role in the}} pitch. Though signed by Bill Jones, ironically George Swindin, the manager who had <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> at Arsenal, replaced Jones as manager in October 1962. Despite the disruption, Charles scored in both derby games against Swansea, in what was otherwise a forgettable season for Cardiff fans.|$|E

Later, in a parked car, Hampton gave Sawyer another packet, whereupon he said he had to get the money from the trunk. When he opened it, other agents moved in to arrest Hampton.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Hogan, having {{received}} immunity from prosecution, testified {{in the trial}} of Vince McMahon relating to shipments of steroids received by both parties from WWF physician Dr. George T. Zahorian. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used anabolic steroids since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that McMahon had neither <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> the drugs, nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government's case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.|$|E

25|$|Bobo {{was brought}} to Anacortes and lived in the Lowman family home. He quickly became a tourist {{attraction}} when word got around that a family had a gorilla living in their home. Over the next two years, the Lowmans raised Bobo {{as if he were}} a human until his size and strength posed issues too serious to ignore. Jean Lowman kept detailed accounts of the destruction Bobo wrought on their house and possessions. The Lowmans decided they could no longer take care of Bobo in their home, and <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> to the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle in 1953.|$|E
25|$|There were no cartels at {{that time}} in Mexico. Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers. He oversaw all operations; there was just him, his cronies, and the {{politicians}} who <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> protection. However, the Guadalajara Cartel suffered a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder Rafael Caro Quintero was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. Félix Gallardo afterwards kept a low profile and in 1987 he moved with his family to Guadalajara. According to Peter Dale Scott, the Guadalajara Cartel prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS), under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{increased}} success, and {{the release}} of a single, New Faces, Old Places, Shiels became concerned about Lynott's tendency to sing off-key. He then discovered that the problem was with Lynott's tonsils; he subsequently took a leave of absence from the band. By the time he had recovered, Shiels had decided to take over singing lead and reduce the band to a three piece. Feeling guility of having effectively sacked one of his best friends, he taught Lynott how to play bass, figuring {{it would be easier to}} learn than a six string guitar, and <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> a Fender Jazz Bass he had bought from Robert Ballagh for £36, and started giving him lessons.|$|E

25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one knew what the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a dozen times.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season, 1988–89, {{was not a}} happy one for Celtic and {{the team}} finished in third place in the league behind winners Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen. McAvennie, however, was one of Celtic's few form players that season and he'd scored 11 goals by Christmas time. However, a broken arm sustained in the New Year game at Ibrox against Rangers curtailed his goalscoring. McAvennie also wished to return to London to enable him {{to spend more time}} with then girlfriend, glamour model Jenny Blyth. After a public row with manager Billy McNeill over being dropped for a league match at Tynecastle in March 1989 against Hearts, Celtic relented to McAvennie's repeated requests for a transfer and <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> back to West Ham.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, some {{soldiers}} of the British armed forces met Hassan and <b>sold</b> <b>him</b> an official gun. When questioned {{about the loss of}} the gun, they told their superiors that Hassan had stolen the gun from them. On 29 March 1899, the British Vice Consul wrote a very stern and insulting letter to him accusing his camp of stealing the gun and asking him to return it immediately. This enraged Hassan and he sent a very brief and curt reply dismissing the allegation. Hassan's attention had been focused on the Ethiopian invaders of Somalia, but this incident brought him into conflict with the British as well. The British, Ethiopian Emperor Menelek II, and a small numbers of Somalis then joined together to crush Hassan's Dervish movement.|$|E
