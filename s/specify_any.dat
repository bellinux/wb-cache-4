5|$|At a {{professional}} level, most matches produce {{only a few}} goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not <b>specify</b> <b>any</b> player positions other than goalkeeper, {{but a number of}} specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.|$|E

The court also ordered a hearing {{in order to determine the}} date on which GGYC could reasonably be compelled to produce the Custom House Certificate for its yacht. On September2, 2009, GGYC filed an appeal against this decision.|$|E

25|$|Blasphemy in Islam is impious {{utterance}} or action concerning God, Muhammad {{or anything}} considered sacred in Islam.

The hadiths, which are another source of Sharia, suggest various punishments for blasphemy, which may include death. There {{are a number of}} surah in Qur'an relating to blasphemy, from which Quranic verses 5:33 and 33:57-61 have been most commonly used in Islamic history to justify and punish blasphemers. Various fiqhs (schools of jurisprudence) of Islam have different punishment for blasphemy, depending on whether blasphemer is Muslim or non-Muslim, man or woman. The punishment can be fines, imprisonment, flogging, amputation, hanging, or beheading.|$|E
25|$|In {{physics and}} mathematics, the {{dimension}} of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to <b>specify</b> <b>any</b> point within it. Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or {{the surface of a}} cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.|$|E
25|$|The Flag Resolution did not <b>specify</b> <b>any</b> {{particular}} arrangement, {{number of}} points, nor orientation {{for the stars}} and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa. The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial. One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.|$|E

25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in his {{discussion}} of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not <b>specify</b> <b>any</b> particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
25|$|In January, GM Steve Yzerman, {{who also}} served as the general manager for Canada's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics, elected not to name Lightning captain Martin St. Louis to Canada's roster, instead {{choosing}} the still-injured Steven Stamkos. After Stamkos was not medically cleared to play in Sochi in early February, Yzerman ultimately named St. Louis to Team Canada as an injury replacement. In late February, {{it was reported that}} St. Louis had requested a trade from Yzerman the month prior. St. Louis, who had a no-move clause in his contract with Tampa Bay, reportedly consented to only being traded to the New York Rangers. On March 5, 2014, St. Louis was sent to New York along with a conditional 2015 second round pick in exchange for New York captain Ryan Callahan, a 2015 first round draft pick, a conditional 2014 second round pick and a 2015 conditional seventh round pick. The deal came subsequently after Stamkos had been cleared to return to the Lightning's active roster. St. Louis cited his decision based on his family and thanked Lightning fans for their support during his tenure with the franchise, but would not <b>specify</b> <b>any</b> further about the reasons that led to his request.|$|E
