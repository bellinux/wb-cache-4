I joined the Coast Guard particularly because of two very good reasons. I like the sea and the Coast Guard also works in peace time. Not that I shall stay in after the war, but the deeds of the Coast Guard in time of peace equal in heroism any of the war time exploits of any service, their war time exploits are a matter of record and indicated by the percentage of casualties as compared to other branches.
