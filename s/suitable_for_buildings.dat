This paper proposes a side ratio constrain based boundary tracing algorithm for discrete points. This algorithm can effectively trace the boundary of concave polygons with holes.

40|$|In recent years, roof-spraying and rooftop lawns {{has proved}} {{effective}} on roofs with poor thermal insulation. However, roofs of most buildings have insulating material to provide thermal insulation during the winter. The {{effects of such}} a practice have not previously been quantified. In this study, the authors conducted measurements of an insulated building to quantify the thermal effects of roof-spraying and rooftop lawns. Roof-spraying did not significantly reduce cooling loads, and required significant amounts of water. The conclusion is that roof spraying is not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> with well-insulated roofs. Rooftop lawns, however, significantly stabilized the indoor temperature while additionally helping to mitigate the heat island phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring phase {{transition}} process, phase change materials (PCMs) can absorb or release {{a large amount}} of heat from the environment while maintaining its own temperature basically unchanged. The phase change energy storage material <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> was obtained from paraffin liquid and stearic acid with mass ration of 78 : 22, and the melting temperature can be regulated from 25 °C to 35 °C. Two step encapsulation was used to prepare phase change energy storage ceramsite: Waste aerated concrete was soaked in a mixed slurry composed of cement, white latex, steel slag powder and water; mixed powder of building gypsum and manganese slag was coated on the particles prepared in step. It solves the problem of easy leakage of phase change materials and compatibility with aggregate and cement, which provides a cost-effective approach for the utilization of waste autoclaved aerated concrete...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{possibility}} of using cross-laminated timber construction, which is commonly referred to as CLT, to support commercial buildings to thirty levels. A prototype building structure is proposed and analysed. The main structural elements, including a central tube core, columns and beams, are made of CLT. The CLT panels are arranged to ensure structural efficiency with minimal material wastage. A building of this height has the potential to undergo significant vibration in response to turbulent wind loading. The Eurocode analysis procedure for along-wind response of structures is applied to the prototype building, and the effect of the vibration on the comfort of building occupants and the magnitude of the loads on the structure is considered. The paper concludes that the proposed structural system with CLT elements may be <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> to thirty levels...|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} to retrofit existing essential facilities subjected to seismic excitation is proposed. The main {{features of this}} procedure are to reduce maximum acceleration and associated forces in buildings subjected to seismic excitation by reducing their strength (weakening). The weakening retrofit, which is an opposite strategy to strengthening, is particularly <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> having overstressed components and foundation supports or having weak brittle components. However, by weakening the structure large deformations are expected. Supplemental damping devices however can control the deformations within desirable limits. The structure retrofitted with this strategy will have, therefore, {{a reduction in the}} acceleration response and a reduction in the deformations, depending on the amount of additional damping introduced in the structure. An illustration of the above strategy is presented here through an evaluation of the inelastic response of the structure through a nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results are compared with different retrofit techniques. A parametric analysis has also been carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the retrofitting method using different combination of the performance thresholds in accelerations and displacements through fragility analysis...|$|E
40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} (CWs) {{originate from}} natural wetlands {{and are used}} for waste water treatment {{as an alternative to}} conventional treatment. This thesis was aimed at providing a literary summary of the types of house sewage water treatment plants and constructed wetlands used in the CR and abroad, of their hygienic aspects, functionality, treatment efficiency, expensiveness and the possibilities of their use in the conditions of the CR and their advantages and disadvantages. It also deals with a proposal of a suitable type of house CW for the conditions of the CR and a list of the necessary steps in construction of a house CW. Quite similar systems are being used for house sewage treatment in the Czech Republic and abroad { [...] } mostly septic tanks, ground mounds, constructed wetlands, active treatment plants and biodiscs. Alternative water treatment methods are generally not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> having (now or in the future) the possibility of connection to municipal sewerage systems. They are on the other hand <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> not connected to sewerage systems or for seasonal objects, remote places and holiday houses with seasonal waste water production. A system with horizontal subsurface flow is mostly used as a CW in the Czech Republic. This CW type ensures sufficient removal of organic contamination and insoluble substances, but the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal is relatively low. However it is fully sufficient in the instance of low PE numbers, as the loading rate is usually low and the concentration of contaminants in the output water meets the prescribed limits. Foreign researches show that hybrid systems combining horizontal flow with vertical flow and with recirculation are more suitable for improving efficiency of nitrogen removal. Systems with vertical flow and intermittent waste water dosage showing particularly good results in ammoniac removal are also suitable for nitrogen removal. Special materials with higher iron, aluminium or calcium content are most suitable as filling of a constructed wetland or as additional filters or for improvement of phosphorus removal from waste water as they are able to reach efficiency of up to 90 %. In my thesis I came to a conclusion that a CW with horizontal subsurface flow is the most suitable type of house constructed wetland treatment for the conditions in the CR, mainly because it is the most frequently used and thus best proven CW type with sufficient efficiency of treatment for the substances required by standards...|$|E
40|$|When {{the ground}} coupled heat pump (GCHP) system is {{utilized}} for air conditioning in cooling load dominated buildings, the heat rejected into ground will accumulate around the ground heat exchangers (GHE) {{and results in}} system performance degradation. A novel hybrid ground coupled heat pump (HGCHP) system with nocturnal cooling radiator (NCR) works as supplemental heat rejecter is proposed in this paper to resolve this problem. The practical analytical model of NCR and novel HGCHP system are established. The computer program based on established model is developed to simulate the system operation performance. The novel HGCHP system is designed and simulated for a sample building located in Hong Kong, and a simple life cycle cost comparisons are carried out between this system and conventional GCHP system. The results indicate that it is feasible to use NCR serves as supplemental heat rejecter of the novel HGCHP system for cooling load dominated buildings even those located in humid subtropical climate areas. This novel HGCHP system provides a new valuable choice for air conditioning in cooling load dominated buildings, and it is especially <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> with limited surface land areas.
