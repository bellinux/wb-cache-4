40|$|HEMA or 2 -hydroxyethyl {{methacrylate}} {{is a small}} monomer that is in widespread use, {{not only}} in dentistry. Its popularity in biomedical applications must be attributed to its relatively good biocompatibility, even though the uncured monomer is notorious for its high allergic potential. HEMA presents as a fluid that is well solvable in water, ethanol and/or acetone. This property and its solvent-like nature make HEMA frequently added to dental adhesives. It improves the stability of <b>adhesive</b> <b>solutions</b> containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, basically avoiding phase-separations that are typical of HEMA-free/poor adhesives. Another important characteristic of HEMA is its high hydrophilicity, making it an excellent adhesion-promoting agent for dentin. However, both in uncured and cured state, HEMA will readily absorb water. Uncured, water sorption may dilute the monomers to an extent that polymerization is inhibited. Cured, it still exhibits hydrophilicity, promoting water uptake with consequent nano-leakage and swelling. Like all methacrylates, HEMA is vulnerable to hydrolysis at basic and acidic pH. HEMA also lowers the vapor pressure of water and probably also of ethanol, thereby hindering good solvent evaporation from <b>adhesive</b> <b>solutions.</b> All these unfavorable properties along with the inferior polymerization efficiency of HEMA itself deteriorate the mechanical properties of HEMA-rich adhesives. There are consequently both PROS and CONS regarding the addition of HEMA to dental adhesives.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-analytical algorithm for {{the determination of}} the contact half width and surface pressure which results from both adhesive and non-adhesive contact problems involving functionally graded materials (FGM). The inhomogeneously elastic solid comprises a graded elastic coating whose shear modulus depends exponentially on the vertical coordinate and a homogeneously elastic substrate. The solid is assumed to be in a state of plane strain and thus a two-dimensional analysis is performed within this work. Using the work of Chidlow et al. (2011 a) as a starting point, we derive a pair of integral equations which may be used to determine approximations to the contact pressure when either the surface deflection or the deflection gradient is known over the contact region. As these integral equations are non-singular, we use Galerkin's method to approximate the contact pressure and it is found that relatively small trial spaces allow accurate computation of the pressure. Information about the prescribed load is then used to formulate an iterative algorithm to determine the contact half width. A selection of numerical results are presented using this method and it is found that the solutions computed here compare favourably with those of other authors.
