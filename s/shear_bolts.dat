40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} slab-column {{structures are}} widely used because of their practicality. However, this type of structures can be subject to punching-shear failure in the slab-column connections. Without shear reinforcement, the slab-column connection can undergo brittle punching failure, especially when the structure is subject to lateral loading in seismic zones. The <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{a new type of}} transverse reinforcement developed for retrofit of existing structures against punching. This research focuses on how the <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can improve the punching-shear capacity and ductility of the existing slab-column connections under vertical service and lateral seismic loads. A set of nine full-scale reinforced concrete slab-column connection specimens were tested under vertical service and cyclic loads. The vertical (gravity) load for each specimen was kept at a constant value throughout the testing. The cyclic lateral drift with increasing intensity was applied to the columns. The specimens were different in number of bolts, concrete strength, number of openings, and level of gravity punching load. Strains in flexural rebars in the slabs, crack widths, lateral loads, and displacements were obtained. The peak lateral load (moment) and its corresponding drift ratio, connection stiffness, crack width, and ductility were compared among different specimens. The testing results show that <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can increase lateral peak load resisting capacity, lateral drift capacity at peak load, and ductility of the slab-column connections. <b>Shear</b> <b>bolts</b> also change the failure mode of the slab-column connections and increase the energy dissipation capacity. The thesis includes also research on the development of guidelines for shear bolt design for concrete slab retrofitting, including the punching shear design method of concrete slab (with <b>shear</b> <b>bolts),</b> dimensions of bolts, spacing, and influence of bolt layout patterns.

40|$|Over {{the life}} span of a {{structure}} it may become necessary to retrofit, or strengthen certain components or elements. This may be due to construction errors, changes in use and occupancy, or changes due to material deterioration or damage. Slab-column connections in flat slab structures might need to be strengthened for punching shear. Using steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> to strengthen connections for punching shear is a new technique used for retrofit that was developed at the University of Waterloo. If the retrofitted part of the structure is exposed to the atmosphere, or to chemicals such as deicing salts, the steel can corrode, thus furthering to damage the structure. Non-corrosive materials that can replace the steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can be a good practical alternative to steel. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the development and use of non-corrosive <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections. Externally applied shear reinforcing bolts provide the punching shear reinforcement strength, while allowing the flexibility and ease of installation of an external application after construction. By providing a bearing area against both sides of the slab surface, the formation of punching shear cracks can be restrained, and the connection can become strengthened against punching shear failure. Three different types of non-corrosive <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> were developed and tested. The first was an off-the-shelf glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bolt / nut product. The two others used two different GFRP core rods with aluminum fittings crimped to their ends. A total of six specimens were tested, four were tested under an increasing static load, while two were tested with an unbalanced pseudo-dynamic lateral load. All six specimens were designed to fail in punching shear before reaching their flexural capacity. The results are compared against previous test results of specimens both unreinforced and reinforced with steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> to determine their effectiveness. From the test results {{it was found that the}} GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> did strengthen the connections for punching shear. The GFRP nut and bolt did not strengthen the connection, and, in fact, decreased its overall strength when compared to the unreinforced specimen. The presence of the GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> also increased the connection ductility and the deflection capability. In the pseudo-dynamic tests the GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> significantly increased the amount of energy dissipated by the connection under reverse cyclic loading.

40|$|In certain {{situations}} the punching {{strength of a}} connection may become inadequate after construction due to changes of connection geometry from drilling or coring, or from changes of building use, or construction and design errors. The use of shear reinforcement {{in the form of}} <b>Shear</b> <b>Bolts</b> is a new approach to strengthening slab-column connections. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the use of <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections without unbalanced moments. Six slab specimens were tested with different configurations of <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> and without shear reinforcement to verify the effectiveness of this method of reinforcement. The central idea is an externally applied shear reinforcing technique that provides strength in shear at par with other conventional reinforcement types {{on the one hand and}} offering the distinct advantage and flexibility of external application after construction. A shear bolt consists of an unhardened steel shaft threaded at one end and flared out to form a bearing/anchor surface on the other end. All six specimens were designed to fail in shear before reaching their flexural capacity, two of which were more critical than the others because of the presence of openings simulating utility ducts around the column perimeter. From the tests, comparisons of predicted loads with the failure loads indicated a higher ultimate load for slab reinforced with the bolt system. Similarly, strain measurements from strain gauges attached to the longitudinal steel and deflection profiles of the slab showed that the new method was efficient in increasing the shear capacity of the slabs. In summary, the test program showed that <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> are effective in transforming the behaviour of the slab-column connections from a brittle punching shear failure mode to a more ductile flexural one. Deflection profiles at different load stages, and particularly at failure, show increased deflections for specimens reinforced with bolt reinforcements. This indicates an increased ductility at the connection. Similarly, load and flexural reinforcement strain magnitudes show substantial improvements in the strength of the connections...|$|E

The composite action can be achieved by achieving the shear connection between the beam and the concrete using the shear connectors, however, the composite construction have been well established for hot-rolled steel members and yet to be studied and researched for cold formed steel beams. This paper presents the ability of the cold formed lipped C-channel section {{to be used as a}} composite beam with Ferrocement slab. The shear connection is developed by using <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> size 12 mm diameter which were being tested and proven to create adequate shear connection. Three variations of the ferrocement flange were tested for bending and compared with the bending capacity of the bare coldformed steel beam.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is on developing new punching shear retrofit techniques for slab-column connections to improve the seismic response of flat-plate systems. Previous tests have shown the effectiveness of using shear reinforcement to enhance the shear strength and ductility of individual slab-column connections. However, while ductility reduces the earthquake impact on structures, increased stiffness attracts higher forces. Herein, a new type of punching shear retrofit element, <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> with flexible washers, is introduced. The flexible washers allow for shear crack opening during the lateral displacements, {{while at the same time}} providing control of the crack width by using the appropriate washer thickness and/or stiffness. A set of six slab-column connections retrofitted with this new type of shear reinforcement was tested. The results show that this technique improves the lateral load-deformation response of the connections, increasing the ductility without a commensurate increase in stiffness. Lower stiffness results in lower shear forces attracted by the column and continuous opening and closing of cracks results in higher energy dissipation through friction within the crack interfaces. The effect of this type of shear reinforcement on the response of an assembled structure is also important. This study investigates such behaviour analytically, using various connection hysteretic responses to check how energy dissipation within individual connections affects the overall energy dissipation of a flat-plate system. Different lateral load supporting systems were investigated to determine the hysteretic response needed at slab-column connections to avoid sudden collapse. This research shows how to achieve the desired characteristics of a flat plate structure subjected to an earthquake - sufficient strength and stiffness to withstand moderate intensity shaking, and sufficient ductility to act in parallel with a more rigid structural system under strong base motions. Such design of slab-column connections is in agreement with the philosophy of ”capacity design”, where the designer ”tells the structure what it should do in the event of a major earthquake”. The presented system was designed for slab retrofit. However, it can be anticipated that similar concepts can be used in the construction of new slabs in seismic zones...|$|E

Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures.

The finite element analyses (FEA) can supplement the existing testing background and can be used for parametric investigation, since they can indicate different aspects on punching shear failure, leading to possible recommendations for the design codes and models. In this thesis, 3 D FEA of reinforced concrete slabs with the FE software ABAQUS using the concrete damaged plasticity model are presented. The appropriate calibration of the concrete model, is done in this study based on an interior slab-column connection without shear reinforcement (SB 1), considered as the control specimen, which was tested under vertical loading in a previous study. The predictive capability of the calibrated model was demonstrated by simulating and analyzing different types of slabs without shear reinforcement. Interior specimens under static and reversed cyclic loadings and edge slabs under static and horizontal loadings are examined. The predicted capability of the calibrated model is then examined by simulating slab-column connections with shear reinforcement.

The injection machinery consisted of three (3) parallel slow speed reciprocating gas compressors each driven by a natural gas driven internal combustion engine through a speed reducing gearbox. The equipment had been purchased in an early phase of the project by the original oil company, so {{it could not be}} changed. Due to the critical timing of compression required to maintain reservoir pressure and incremental oil recovery, the equipment could not be changed without large financial consequences. After preliminary review of the purchased equipment, it was recognized early by the engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) design engineering team that the compressor type and selection including the design were not the preferred arrangement. However, due to schedule and contract constraints the selection and design could not be significantly changed. Although the compressor itself was considered properly selected there was considerable attention given to the drive train. This drive train consisted of the internal combustion engine, a gearbox, a steel torque shaft that connected the gearbox to the compressor and an intermediate bearing/bearing support. As the project progressed there were significant design improvements made to improve the safety, operation, and life of the compressor train. The initial design of the torque shaft indicated that it would fail every time the machinery experienced a shutdown. In order to overcome such a failure the drive train included a special coupling with <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> that would shear every time the compressor train had shut down, the function of which was to prevent the torque shaft from fatigue failure. Shearing bolts during every shutdown was not considered safe or acceptable operating practice. During the course of the project, there were significant improvements made, first to the torque shaft, and then to the coupling connecting the gearbox to the torque shaft, then to the coupling between the engine and high speed gear pinion. The torsional characteristics were improved significantly with the upgrades and design improvements. After installation, extensive field testing was conducted on each injection gas compressor to ascertain the torsional characteristics of the drive train, including stresses in critical components during the shutdown events. The data confirmed that the torque shaft was in fact designed for infinite life and would not fail from material fatigue as was feared initially. During the design phases engineering consultants were contracted to perform torsional studies to confirm the torsional critical speeds initially predicted by the compressor manufacturer. After installation the same consultant used strain gauges to measure the torsional shear stresses and the torsional critical speeds.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections of cold-formed stainless steel at elevated temperatures and post-fire condition {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel are mainly based on those of carbon steel, and are applicable for room (ambient) temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperatures. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel structures at elevated temperatures. The key {{findings of the investigation}} are described in the following paragraphs. A total of 25 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of three different grades of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The stainless steels are austenitic stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1. 4571 (AISI 316 Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1. 4162 (AISI S 32101). Totally 434 tests on bolted connections of stainless steel were performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the nominal strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European codes for stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the material properties at elevated temperatures were used in the design equations for room temperature. It is shown that the nominal strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A total of 78 cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections were tested in post-fire condition. The test results were compared with those tested at room temperature. Generally, it is found that the bolted connection strengths in post-fire condition cooling down from 350 and 650 ºC are higher than those tested at room temperature for all three grades of stainless steel. Finite element models for single shear and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Static analysis technique was used in the numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 450 specimens were performed using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing resistances of bolted connections of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing resistances of cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections were proposed based on both the experimental and numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC. The bearing resistances of bolted connections obtained from the tests and the finite element analyses were compared with the nominal strengths calculated using the current design rules and also compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing resistances of bolted connections at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. The proposed design equations are recommended for bolted connections assembled using cold-formed stainless steels. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The embedding tests were conducted to calculate the yield strength of bolted joint by EYT and the compression test, to estimate the embedding strength based on Sawata and Yasumura [9].|$|R

The storm tore open a panel {{on the north side}} of the dome; <b>sheared</b> <b>bolts</b> and insulation fell into the arena. After the storm passed, the teams returned to the court at 10:30 and completed the game.|$|R

50|$|Most non-steel framed bikes have a {{separate}} removable derailleur hanger, generally made from aluminium which is bolted to the dropout. These are intended as a cheap replaceable part {{so that in the}} event of an accident or mechanical problem that could damage the derailleur or frame, the derailleur hanger breaks or deforms instead. Sometimes a <b>shear</b> <b>bolt</b> which is designed as a weak point will also be used. There are dozens of different derailleur hangers available and one model is seldom interchangeable with another.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} of a tractor PTO auger is to harness the tractor's {{available}} energy by attaching a PTO shaft to a tractor's PTO drive in order to drill a hole of predetermined size (size of the auger shaft and diameter) and depth into the ground. This in turn will provide power to the Tractor PTO Auger's gearbox. Most modern [...] Tractor PTO Auger gearboxes come standard with a <b>shear</b> <b>bolt</b> to protect the gear drive if the auger encounters an obstruction such as rock during drilling a hole.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{conventional}} {{composite construction}} involving hot-rolled steel section, the composite action is usually achieved by using conventional headed shear studs connectors. However, use of headed studs is not practical for cold-formed steel (CFS) section {{due to its}} very thin form {{that is difficult to}} weld. A suitable bolt and nut type shear connector was proposed; experimental tests were carried out to evaluate its performance. This study also investigated the use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) integrated with CFS by means of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors to develop composite action. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors in SCC integrated with CFS section as composite beam system. Eighteen push-out test specimens comprising of M 12, M 14 and M 16 sized <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connector of grade 8. 8 with longitudinal spacings of 150 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm centers were fabricated, cast and tested until failure. The experimental results showed that all <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors possessed a good shear resistance capacity. Not much difference in strength capacity of specimens with M 14 and M 16 <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors was found, perhaps due to CFS failure. Varying the size and longitudinal spacing of the <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors revealed that the connectors' strength capacity changed slightly between M 14 and M 16 bolts specimens but, significantly for M 12 bolt specimens...|$|R

These failure mechanisms are observed in three sets of testing: (1) Simple Pin Loading, (2) Window tests (pin loading with transparent out-of-plane constraints), and (3) Double <b>Shear</b> <b>Bolted</b> Joint. The first two test setups involve a unique fixture that allows the collection of far-field strain visualization via Digital Image Correlation, providing {{a better understanding of}} the laminate’s response to the load in real time. These results are subsequently compared to one another and work done in previous publications...|$|R
40|$|Findings are {{presented}} {{of the first}} stage of an investigation of second-order effects that influence the resistance and stiffness of single <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> joints. These effects develop as a result of joint deformation and the rotation of all, or part, of the bolt. A two-dimensional finite element model incorporating these effects is introduced and predicted behaviour compared to laboratory test results of pre-tensioned M 16 single shear joints. The model is shown to accurately predict the load-slip curve, giving better predictions of resistance than the present Eurocode design equations indicating potentially underutilised strength reserve. Furthermore, the model allows the individual components of the second order effects to be quantified separately. 1...|$|R
