30|$|ResultsFor the {{assessment}} of radioactive <b>soil</b> <b>contaminations</b> with naturally occurring radionuclides at children’s play areas and residential areas the ingestion of soil is the decisive pathway of exposure. For children’s play areas a threshold level of 0.2 [*]Bq/g for the sum U- 238,max[*]+[*]Th- 232,max was obtained. At areas with only impacts of ambient radiation from the contaminated ground test thresholds of 0.5 [*]µSv/h are recommended.

25|$|Pesticides and {{herbicides}} {{are applied}} to agricultural land to control pests that disrupt crop production. <b>Soil</b> <b>contamination</b> can occur when pesticides persist and accumulate in soils, which can alter microbial processes, increase plant uptake of the chemical, and also cause toxicity to soil organisms. The {{extent to which the}} pesticides and herbicides persist depends on the compound’s unique chemistry, which affects sorption dynamics and resulting fate and transport in the soil environment. Pesticides can also accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and soil organisms. In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects, such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests (i.e. insects that prey on or parasitize pests) than they are to the target pests themselves.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 {{provided}} an opportunity to improve a highly contaminated area known as the Homebush Bay site.

The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that could pose a risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney’s winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the “greenest” single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the uptake, translocation, distribution and accumulation of Cd, Zn and Fe and the interaction of these elements in winter wheat. The objectives were: (1) to characterise specificity among winter wheat genotypes in terms of accumulation of Cd, Zn and Fe in various organs and identify genotypes combining low accumulation of Cd with high accumulation of Zn and/or Fe, (2) to determine genetic specificity of winter wheat genotypes in terms of translocation of Cd, Zn and Fe from the vegetative parts to the grain, and (3) elucidate an effect of <b>soil</b> cadmium <b>contamination</b> on the distribution and accumulation of Cd, Zn and Fe in various organs of wheat. In the 2007 / 2008 vegetation season, 52 winter wheat varieties (34 Croatian, 7 Austrian, 5 Hungarian, 3 French and one variety of Russian, Italian and German descent) were investigated. The pots were arranged, according to a completely randomized design with two levels of <b>soil</b> Cd <b>contamination</b> (0 and 20 mg kg- 1 soil) in four replicates. In the vegetation season of 2008 / 2009 the experiment {{was set up to}} a completely randomized block design with 10 varieties of wheat and three levels of <b>soil</b> Cd <b>contamination</b> (0, 2 and 5 mg kg- 1 soil) in four replicates. The concentration of Cd, Zn and Fe in the solution of plant samples was determined by ICP-OES. The concentration of Cd, Zn and Fe was determined at the flowering stage in the root, stem,leaves, flag leaf and spike and in a full maturity in the straw, leaves, glumes and grain. Collected data were statistically analyzed with SAS software 9. 1. 3. Analysis of variance identified a statistically significant difference in the concentrations of Cd, Zn and Fe in vegetative parts and grain between the tested wheat varieties at all levels of <b>soil</b> Cd <b>contamination.</b> It was also found that the <b>soil</b> Cd <b>contamination</b> had a significant effect on the accumulation of Cd in grain while the accumulation of Zn and Fe in the grain hasn’t been influenced by <b>soil</b> Cd <b>contamination.</b> The tested genotypes differed significantly in the Cd, Zn and Fe plant uptake factor {{as well as in the}} coefficient of translocation from roots to stems and from roots to the flag leaf. According to correlation coefficient between the concentrations of Cd, Zn and Fe in the grain, the tested cultivars were divided into six groups which differ in the interrelation of these elements. Obtained results may serve as a starting point for investigation of the mechanisms of uptake, translocation and accumulation of Cd, Zn and Fe in winter wheat as well as for the selection of genotypes with increased concentrations of Zn and Fe and decreased Cd concentration in the grain.
