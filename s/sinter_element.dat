40|$|Filter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable filter for removing large quantities of aluminum corrosion product (boehmite) from reactor water. Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, <b>sintered</b> filter <b>elements,</b> <b>sintered</b> ceramic fllter <b>elements,</b> cotton stringwound filter elements, felted-cotton filter elements, cation resin, adsorption resin, diatomaceous earth precoat filter, and a wood-cellulose precoat filter. Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with filter elements and precoat filters is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi. Very little additional load {{can be obtained by}} operating to a higher pressure drop. Of the filters tested, the precoat filter snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite. The efficiency of the precoat filter was in excess of 99 %, and the efficiency of the cation resin was for the most part in excess of 95 %. For various reasons, the other filters were eliminated from final consideration. The test program and available literature indicated that an element type precoat filter using wood cellulose as the precoat media would be most suitable for the proposed application. (auth...|$|R

First, Li, Cu, and Zn nitrates were added to GDC powders. The effect of these additives on the densification was studied by dilatometry on pellets, and show a large decrease of the sintering temperature from 1330 °C (pure GDC), down to 1080 °C, 950 °C, and 930 °C for Zn, Cu, and Li addition, respectively. However, this promising result does not apply to screen-printed layers, which are more porous than pellets and in which the shrinkage is constrained by the substrate. The second approach consists in preparing a pre-sintered GDC layer, which is subsequently infiltrated with Ce and Gd nitrates and sintered at 1250 °C to increase its density. Such an approach results in highly dense GDC interlayers. Using La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) as electrode, the influence of the interlayers on the cathode performance was studied. The addition of sintering aids dramatically increases the cell resistances, most likely because the additives increase the reactivity between GDC and either Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) or LSCF, thus losing the expected benefit related to the decrease of sintering temperatures. The interlayers prepared by infiltration do not induce additional resistances in the cell, which results in power densities of single cells 40 – 50 % higher than those of cells prepared with commercial GDC interlayers, making this approach a valuable alternative to sintering aids...|$|R

In order to enhance surface properties of those PM (Powder Metallurgy) alloys like hardness and abrasive wear, nitriding and carbonitriding treatment are applied. One of the main problem of PM chemical heat treatment alloys is their porosity degree. In the experiments Fe-Ni-Cu-Mo and Fe-Mo sintered structural parts modified by boron were made.

The iteration is stopped if the requirements on the product properties are fulfilled. The method is applied to the selective laser sintering process of titanium powder and the goal of the optimisation is to produce a ring with prescribed geometry. One of the novelty of our approach is to feed the data base with experimental results obtained from process simulation: our idea is to use the sintering machine only once and to produce a part which is “first time right”.

The relative dielectric permittivity, position and width of the transition temperature range for BTS FGM depends on the Ti/Sn concentration gradient and can be easily tailored. Sintering is the most challenging step of FGMs processing, since the constituent layers with different chemical compositions shrink with different rates and the resulting mismatch stresses can lead to FGMs distortion. To obtain high-quality FGMs it is desirable to predict the sintering process for every graded layer and to design sintering strategy. Two- and four-component BTS FGMs were chosen as model systems for the designing of sintering strategy.

40|$|Purpose: The PM {{industry}} is in continuous development {{due to the}} necessity to increase its potential and competitiveness. This fact {{and the demand for}} substituting certain alloying elements used so far, require the addition of new alloying elements and new processes leading to and optimization of costs, strength and tolerances. A different method for introducing Mn into the alloying system is proposed in the present work. Mechanically-blending and mechanically alloying Mn containing master alloys are generated and based on three different steels grades, ASC 100. 29 (plain iron), Astaloy CrL and Astaloy Mo (pre-alloyed systems). Design/methodology/approach: To profit Mn sublimation effects, small Mn particles, in order to increase the specific surface available to sublimate, must be homogenously added. Different milling times are considered in order to attain the desired master alloys containing 50 % of Mn which is diluted in each base powder by normal mixing. New alloying systems were then pressed to a green density of 7. 1 g/cm 3 and sintered at 1120 ºC in 90 N 2 - 10 H 2 atmosphere. STA showed Mn diffusion during sintering and a densification enhancement. Findings: The sublimation of Mn during sintering provides some specific phenomena which facilitate the <b>sintering</b> of alloying <b>elements</b> with high oxygen affinity. The resulting mechanical properties and the microstructures must be discussed considering the high energy stored in the master alloy which favours the mass transport mechanism during sintering. Research limitations/implications: Research is being continued with the optimisation of the mechanical properties and the application of heat treatments taking the profit of the increase of the hardenability induced by Mn.
