50|$|The {{production}} of a high-quality double seam is dependent on several factors, including conformity to the set can and end specifications, {{the quality of the}} seamer tooling used and its compliance with the can and end being used, the condition of the <b>seaming</b> <b>machine</b> and the setup of the seaming rolls, lifter pressure and other components. When the machinery is set up correctly and the incoming materials (cans, ends, tooling, etc.) comply to the set specifications, the result should be ideal first and second operation seams.|$|E
40|$|In {{the food}} industry, quality {{assurance}} is {{strongly associated with}} consumer safety {{and the risk of}} compromising the purity of products. Specifically, in the canning industries, rusty, dented or bulging cans may contain bacteria and cause foodborne illness. This article discusses the application of DMAIC and failure analysis {{to reduce the number of}} crushed cans in a canning industry. The methodology was of an applied nature, with an exploratory objective, a qualitative and quantitative approach and a case study method used. Through statistical analysis, it was found that the amount of dented packaging in the production process, which comprises the steps of filling, seaming and basketing, was high. The step with the highest number of crushed cans between three stages was seaming. This was followed by the application of FMEA failure analysis related to the use of an automated <b>seaming</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally, an action plan was roposed to solve the problem of cans crushed in the seaming step and the results demonstrate the improvements obtained before the target after 4 months (August-November 2015) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some <b>seaming</b> <b>machines</b> have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some <b>seaming</b> <b>machines,</b> this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other <b>seaming</b> <b>machines,</b> the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|R

5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized sheet iron was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including sheet iron folders, or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and <b>seaming</b> <b>machines,</b> did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the Tin, Sheet Iron and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the Tin, Sheet Iron, and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R

50|$|When woven from {{polyester}} {{it can be}} {{a challenging}} fabric to sew; it tends to be slippery and may be difficult to control through the presser foot of a sewing <b>machine.</b> <b>Seams</b> have a tendency to pucker and pull; a smaller stitch length and properly balanced tensions can minimize this, though the experience of the sewer will affect the finished result as well. Pins can make holes and marks in polyester charmeuse so it's very important to use proper sharp dressmakers pins with a smooth, not abrupt, taper to the point. For greater ease of sewing, a sizing product can be sprayed on before cutting and washed out after the garment is completed.|$|R
40|$|Work {{measurement}} always {{plays an}} essential role in the apparel industry. Sewing time prediction is one of core process to run the apparel business. The factors influencing the sewing time include sewing length, <b>seam</b> types, <b>machine</b> types, difficulty grades, RPM of machines, stitches per inch, specific workmanship, types of cloth, special parts, and other specific processes. Neural network has been successfully applied in many fields, and they also have the characters and functions of training, learning, and simulation to make optimal and accurate judgments by stimulating the human thought model. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to use back-propagation network to predict sewing time for a case of a local company. First of all, the collection of the parameters having high correlation with the output of the network is very important task. After appropriate training and testing, the network can be applied in future sewing time applications. Nevertheless, how to predict the sewing time of each apparel style accurately and adequately is not an easy task. In this research, we aim to solve the problem with neural network tools. Finally, we found that it is suitable for the variety of sewing process and different kinds of styles in the apparel industry...|$|R
40|$|The French {{research}} institute, INERIS, {{requested the}} assistance of the CSIR’s Division of Mining Technology in developing further precautionary measures against explosions in their collieries. In response to this approach, an on-board active suppression system was adapted to meet their mining requirements. This system is used on tunnelling machines in Germany where the machine is positioned {{in the middle of the}} tunnel, which is therefore not much wider than the machine itself. With this configuration, the machine is never away from the tunnel face during the cutting cycle. As a result, the possible volume in front of the machine of combustible gas requiring suppression is less than 50 m 3. In South Africa this technology has been adapted to suit a twocut mining method which entails greater distances from the face and thus much larger volumes of methane mixtures requiring suppression. The particular configuration of the Explo-Stop® system being investigated required the suppression of possible methane ignition volumes of up to 180 m 3 of a 9 % per volume methane/air mixture. The volume is a consequence of the large cross-sectional area of French underground workings and of the two-cut mining method used in France. In order to take the second cut in the coal <b>seam,</b> the <b>machine</b> is pulled back a maximum distance of 4 m, leaving an air pocket in which gas can accumulate. The machine-mounted system is required to effectively suppress any flame ignited by such a large accumulated volume of methane. The results of the protocol tests done at Kloppersbos showed that the system was capable of suppressing all simulated methane ignitions for the prescribed conditions. This was achieved with a temperature increase of less than a 100 °C at the operator’s position and without any flame being detected at this position. [URL] Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{reciprocating}} motion in no beam supported mining machines, putting energy saving as a starting point in Coal Bed Methane (CBM) exploitation, this paper designs a completely non-circular gear automatic reversing vertical drainage machine based on the theory of non-circular gear transmission. In the field of CBM exploitation, the use of non-circular gears is an attempt at an innovation. First of all, according to the working conditions of the pump and use requirements, a scheme is established whereby the one-way rotary motion of the motor is changed into reciprocating motion so that it could drive the oil pumping rod to achieve the upper and lower mining. Secondly, this paper has designed a new type non-circular gear reversing box as the core component to replace the traditional four beam linkage mechanism and also provides elaborate calculations. Finally, the movement simulation of the non-circular gear reversing gear system is completed. Comparing the motion simulation results with the theoretical ones, the correctness of our theoretical analysis can be verified. Compared with the traditional devices, the new coal <b>seam</b> gas drainage <b>machine</b> model design has nearly 11 % higher efficiency, which has obvious energy saving effects and reduces the cost of mining coal seam gas...|$|R
