500|$|In {{the last}} years of the decade the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, while Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, spawned number one hit single [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", and {{eventually}} sold eight million copies worldwide. Britny Fox from Philadelphia and Winger from New York released their eponymous débuts in 1988. In 1989 Mötley Crüe produced their most commercially successful album, the multi-platinum number one Dr. Feelgood. In the same year eponymous débuts included Danger Danger from New York, Dangerous Toys from Austin, Texas, who provided more of a Southern rock tone to the genre, [...] and Enuff Z'Nuff from Chicago who provided an element of psychedelia to their sound and visual style. L.A. débuts included Warrant with Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich (1989), and Skid Row with their eponymous album (1989), which reached number six in the Billboard 200, but they were {{to be one of the}} last major bands that emerged in the glam metal era. Glam metal entered the 1990s as one of the major commercial genres of popular music. In 1990 débuts for Slaughter, from Las Vegas with <b>Stick</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Ya and FireHouse, from North Carolina, with their eponymous album reached number 18 and number 21 on the Billboard 200 respectively, but it would be the peak of their commercial achievement. Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both in 1991) and Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991) showcased the genre's popularity.|$|E
40|$|Article partly {{based on}} {{interview}} with Jonathan A. J. Wilson] It’s {{the first piece}} of true attitude on video in about two decades.

Well watch in amazement as a group of awesome women in high heels, skateboards, motorbikes and headscarves (that last bit is important) <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> just as hard, or harder. Who are they <b>sticking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to?</b> Well, to watch the “Mipsterz” on YouTube is to see women innocently being themselves and being knowingly and wickedly provocative at the same time. All <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> be is a bunch of women in a music video in, yes, hijabs — so why the firestorm of debate once it went viral? It shocks every which way. It’s freaked out conservative Muslims, who think they’re too out there, and disturbed their non-Muslim audience, who are amazed they are out there at all. That something so simple has the power to shock is, I suppose, shocking in itself...|$|R

[...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film an F grade and wrote, [...] "George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun." [...] Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, [...] "The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music." ...|$|E
