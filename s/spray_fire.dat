500|$|On 5 May 1998, a fire {{broke out}} onboard [...] while off the Western Australia coast. The fire {{was caused by the}} rupture of a {{flexible}} fuel line (one of a number used to replace rigid hoses) on cylinder number nine, starboard engine. This sprayed diesel fuel onto a hot indicator cock, which ignited a <b>spray</b> <b>fire,</b> resulting in the deaths of four crew. Following the fire, the Australian Government and the RAN began a major investigation known as the Westralia Board of Inquiry. The enquiry found that the RAN and the contractor Australian Defence Industries (ADI) did not critically examine their course of action and that key personnel in both the RAN and the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified. The inquiry also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for the intended purpose. In 2005, ADI was fined $75,000 for failing to provide a safe workplace. Seven sailors who were severely traumatised by the fire have also sued ADI and subcontractor Jetrock. In August 2006, the Australian Government decided to accept liability after it reached settlement with the ADI and Jetrock. The seven sailors stand to receive compensation totalling up to $10million.|$|E

40|$|Liquid fuel <b>spray</b> <b>fires</b> emit high {{radiation}} heat fluxes, posing great {{threat to}} humans. The study of suitable agents and techniques for extinguishing this {{particular type of}} fire is of great importance. In this study, degradable 2 -bromo- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene (BTP), a new clean fire extinguishing agent, was tested for its effectiveness in extinguishing three types of liquid fuel <b>spray</b> <b>fires,</b> namely diesel, gasoline, and ethanol. Bench-scale experiments were conducted in a 6 × 5 × 3 m compartment with natural ventilation. The liquid fuels sprayed at varying pressures were ignited by a small open flame and then extinguished by a portable BTP extinguisher. Results showed that BTP of less than 60. 0 g could extinguish all liquid fuel <b>spray</b> <b>fires</b> of 0. 20 to 1. 0 MPa in less than 2. 0 s. The results also showed that when compared with fire sparked by gasoline and diesel, it is significantly easier to put out ethanol <b>spray</b> <b>fires</b> because of its high flame temperature and low flame power. Based on well-established fire suppression theories and experimental results, the detailed mechanism of how BTP functions as an extinguishing agent in the suppression of liquid fuel <b>spray</b> <b>fires</b> will be discussed.

50|$|The Pen Huo Qi (fire {{spraying}} machine; lit. <b>spray</b> <b>fire</b> device) was a Chinese piston flamethrower {{that used}} a substance similar to gasoline or naphtha, invented around 919 AD during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Advances in military technology aided the Song Dynasty in its defense against hostile {{neighbors to the}} north, including the Mongols. The earliest reference to Greek Fire in China was made in 917 AD, written by Wu Renchen in his Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms. In 919 AD, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the 'fierce fire oil' {{that could not be}} doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu (林禹) in his Wu-Yue Beishi (吳越備史), hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire. Lin Yu mentioned also that the 'fierce fire oil' derived ultimately from China's contact in the 'southern seas', with Arabia (大食國 Dashiguo). In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River) in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames. The Chinese applied the use of double-piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and a downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame (as referred to in the Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 AD). In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976 AD, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975 AD. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction. Documented also in later Chinese publications, illustrations and descriptions of mobile flamethrowers on four-wheel push carts appear in the Wujing Zongyao, written in 1044 AD (its illustration redrawn in 1601 as well).|$|E

Phosphite {{has been shown}} to be effective in controlling this pathogen on a wide range of plant species across different families. Although fire is a regular event in the Australian landscape and plays key roles in the ecosystem, nothing is known about the relative uptake of phosphite by shoots pre- and post-fire or how fire may alter the redistribution and persistence of phosphite within woody plants. Adenanthos cuneatus (re-sprouter), Banksia attenuata (re-sprouter) and B. baueri (re-seeder) are all susceptible to P. cinnamomi and are responsive to phosphite treatment. These species were selected within four plots in an area of the Stirling Range National Park that was scheduled for a fuel-reduction burn in November 2006.
