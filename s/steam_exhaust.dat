Currently, the major drawback is the high capital cost compared to other forms of power production.|$|E
2500|$|Pope still {{insisted that}} he needed a gunboat to cover his {{projected}} landing on the Tennessee side of the river. Foote called two councils of war among his captains; in the first, on March 20, his decision not to risk running past the batteries was confirmed. When Halleck wrote to Foote, saying, [...] "Give him (Pope) all the assistance in your power," [...] Foote called a second council, on March 29. This time, Commander Henry Walke, captain of , thought that the risk was worth the candle, and volunteered to take his boat through. Foote gave the necessary orders, and Carondelet was prepared for the run. She was covered with rope, chain, and whatever loose material lay at hand.

2500|$|Exhaust steam is {{directed}} upwards {{out of the}} locomotive through the chimney, {{by way of a}} nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar [...] "chuffing" [...] sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that {{is at the same time}} traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the ejector) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting back pressure on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the <b>steam</b> <b>exhaust</b> to draw more air past the radiator.|$|E
50|$|Locomotives {{with high}} {{chimneys}} and low footplates had the additional advantage of keeping smoke and condensing steam above the engine driver's field of vision. Grade limitations of railways through hilly terrain required tunnels and overhead bridges imposing a loading gauge limiting {{the height of}} chimneys. Increasing the velocity of <b>steam</b> <b>exhaust</b> tended to both accelerate airflow through the firebox and lift the smoke higher above {{the end of the}} chimney. By the 1830s <b>steam</b> <b>exhaust</b> was directed through a contracted nozzle called a blastpipe to achieve desired velocity through the chimney. Pressure drop through the blastpipe nozzle was subtracted from the boiler pressure available to the steam pistons. Robert Stephenson estimated some locomotives lost half their power through blastpipe back pressure.|$|E
50|$|To use the {{cylinders}} as pumps necessitates complete {{reversal of the}} normal gas flow. Atmospheric air is drawn through the <b>steam</b> <b>exhaust</b> and compressed air ejected through the steam inlet. A separate chimney is provided, usually behind the main chimney, to exhaust the compressed air without increasing flow through the smokebox (which would cause increased draught of the fire).|$|E

Scott Russell and two engineers went below and ordered the steam to be blown off and the engine speed reduced. Five stokers died from being scalded by hot steam, while four or five others were badly injured and one had leapt overboard and had been lost.
