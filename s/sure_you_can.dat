2500|$|Craig's sister, Jess Nicholls, also {{confirmed}} their departure via the band's official forum. [...] "If {{any of you}} were at Homebake yesterday, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> agree the set was amazing and sounded better than ever," [...] she wrote. [...] "The band has made a creative decision to revert back to a three piece, as they originally started. I know you will probably {{have a lot of}} questions but just wanted to say don't fear, this is in no way the end of the Vines!!" [...] Nicholls, Heald and Sheridan performed again at Southbound music festival in Perth on 8 January 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Belle is an {{influential}} proponent {{of discipline and}} control in parkour, saying, [...] "Precision is all about being measured," [...] and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. [...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, {{you have to do it}} at least three times to be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘You {{are always}} {{responsible}} and trustworthy, Mr. Crisparkle. Do <b>you</b> really feel <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> answer for him so confidently?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford this?" [...] she asked, {{looking at}} him critically. [...] "It may cost you a {{sovereign}} or thirty shillings." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{their trip}} to Miami, Sloan and Thompson began {{assembling}} their ideas. They organized a powerpoint project, titled, The Miami Project, {{and began a}} series of presentations in their local offices at the Poynter Institute. Their colleagues were interested yet unenthusiastic about the project. In the spring of 2004, while preparing for an annual Online Leaders seminar at the Institute, they were asked to present it again. This time, they decided to present the story {{from the perspective of the}} future, as if it had already happened. They assembled the first version of the film late one night in Poynter's visual journalism lab, on an iMac G4 running Final Cut Pro. The narrative was met with enthusiasm by the conference participants, and they soon began revising and polishing their presentation, this time using Macromedia Flash. They kept presenting it, introducing the film dramatically – gliding into rooms wearing tin foil hats. They always followed the movie with the question: [...] "If this is what the year 2014 looks like, what are you going to do today to make sure your news organization doesn't get sidelined? How do you make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> play in this environment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like {{to leave}} you here alone. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> help {{yourself}} without George? Can I do anything before I go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Jimmy, are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{get work}} in Chicago? Wouldn't {{it be better}} to stay on here, where all the {{managers}} are, and--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See the President?" [...] said a {{young lady}} in an ante-office. [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see him just now. Have you an appointment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh fie, fie!' cried Mr Pecksniff. 'You {{are very}} pleasant. That I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't! That I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't! How <b>CAN</b> <b>you,</b> you know?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you really}} carry me {{up all the}} way, Arnie?" [...] she whispered. [...] "I am so tired to-night. <b>You</b> are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> manage it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Aur. You might {{spare me}} {{the shame of}} telling you; since I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> divine my thoughts: I will, therefore, tell you nothing.|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Zane took Helen's hand, {{and stroked}} it. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "you ask him, lass. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{persuade him to}} stay." ...|$|E

6000|$|MURRAY (with a grin). <b>Sure</b> thing! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> {{consider}} yourself heartlessly jilted. (He turns and raises his glass {{towards the door}} through which Eileen has just gone, as if toasting her.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> walk without pain," [...] she said. [...] "We {{will not}} trouble you, Mr. Ducaine," [...] she added, as I moved {{to open the}} door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me! O Lord! Stop a moment!" [...] says Mr. Smallweed. [...] "He's so very prompt! Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it carefully, my worthy man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-night, {{if you are}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get on. Here, {{take this}} stick--it is no use to me.' Saying which, Pierston put his {{walking-stick}} into the young man's hand.|$|E
60|$|Gee whiz! It goes fast. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stop it? Better be careful, young man. There was an {{elevator}} once {{in our town}} that--fifteenth floor? All right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right, then," [...] {{the other}} man answered. [...] "It gave me a turn, though. <b>You</b> are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make it again in the time you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if it wasn't for you {{he would}} never have started. And now that poor Tryst's dead he would leave it alone. I'm <b>sure</b> only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make him lose that haunted feeling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “They’ll {{get away}} <b>sure,</b> unless <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stop ’em,” put in Merwell, {{and he seemed}} to be almost as {{interested}} as anybody. It galled him exceedingly to think that his companion in crime might escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell me {{anything}} I may be ignorant of in that subject. You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear dead friend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty's eyes shone softly. [...] "We {{have been}} waiting for you, Walter--we knew you would come. Still, I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> ever get quite back to where you were before." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Sandgate, not undiscernibly, {{took her}} choice of {{ignoring}} the point of this. [...] "Your surrenders to Kitty are your own affair--but are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really bear to see Grace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|CARMODY (with a grin). You did, darlin', and fair, too. (Tom slinks back to {{the chair}} {{in the rear of}} table, sulking. Carmody pats Nora's red hair with delighted pride.) <b>Sure</b> it's <b>you</b> <b>can</b> beat the divil himself! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] he answered, {{making a}} desperate clutch at calmness, but losing his grip, [...] "I'm {{going to make}} a clean breast of it this time, for <b>sure!</b> Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do what <b>you</b> like about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By God's soul, John!" [...] {{cried the}} Prince, [...] "it is very <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see more {{with one eye}} than any man in this army with two. But it is even as you say. And this larger band behind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But tell me," [...] said Lenehan again, [...] "are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{bring it}} off all right? You know it's a ticklish job. They're damn close on that point. Eh?... What?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do that, captain," [...] Jacques put in; [...] "from what I {{have seen}} {{of the boy}} I am certain he will keep the promise he has made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> a great deal. Better {{not come}} near me otherwise, for I make every one into a slave. I want my morning reading now--that book on Advent, there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Abe Blower {{knew your}} Uncle Maurice well," [...] said Mrs. Morr, to her son. [...] "They were friends for years. I am <b>sure</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find Mr. Blower {{he will do}} all he <b>can</b> for <b>you,</b> and for me, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song finds a man {{taking a}} stance for {{fidelity}} and offering a unique rebuff {{to a woman}} trying to lead him astray by saying, [...] "you {{want to give me}} lovin' and I'm <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> but it'd be like givin' water to a drowning man..." ...|$|R
60|$|ALICE (who is THE DEARTH now). Thank you. Better {{read the}} telegram, Matey, to be <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make it out.
