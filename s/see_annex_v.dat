40|$|Concluding {{its current}} session, the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) today {{approved}} three draft resolutions on {{issues related to}} the situation of human rights in Cambodia, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Committee approved the draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a recorded vote of 74 in favour to 3 against (Belarus, Rwanda, Uganda), with 85 abstentions (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>V).</b> By the draft’s terms, the General Assembly would condemn the continuing violations of human rights and international law in that country and condemn all massacres and reported perpetration of acts of mutilation and cannibalism, cases of summary or arbitrary executions, and the continuing recruitment and use of child soldiers. The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, noting that his country was emerging from a long and devastating war in which some 3 million people had been killed, said the sponsors of the draft before the Committee had ignored the progress under way and had not suggested any way {{to bring an end to}} impunity. The draft’s sponsors had lost sight of the need to provide relief for victims. Hi...|$|E

MARPOL <b>Annex</b> <b>V</b> prohibits at-sea disposal of plastic materials from vessels, and specifies the distance from shore at which other materials may be dumped. <b>Annex</b> <b>V</b> also requires the provision of port reception facilities for garbage, but it does not specify these facilities or how they are to be provided. Since the at-sea dumping restrictions apply to all vessels, the reception facility requirement applies to all ports, terminals, and marinas that serve vessels.
