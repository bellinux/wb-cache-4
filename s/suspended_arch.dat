50|$|The {{choice of}} large steel through arches for this location, with the roadway <b>suspended</b> from the <b>arches</b> by cables, allowed wide {{navigation}} channels on the river, minimized pier construction, {{and provided a}} profile to the bridge that was aesthetically pleasing. By replacing the old drawbridge with a high-level crossing (the bridge provides more than 90 ft of clearance above the river), the Arrigoni Bridge foreshadowed subsequent major highway crossings of Connecticut's navigable rivers.|$|R

5000|$|For the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, Calatrava won the {{commission}} to cover the existing stadium with a new roof, to make a similar roof for the velodrome, and additionally to build four entrance gateways, a monumental sculpture to symbolize the games, and other architectural features to give harmony and variety to the complex. The roof for the stadium, {{in the form of}} bent [...] "leaves" [...] of laminated glass, is designed to reflect 90 percent of the sunlight. The roof covers 25,000 square meters, and is supported by double-tied arches of tubular steel, with a span of 304 meters (997 feet) and a height of 60 meters (197 feet). It is 250 meters long and 20 meters high, suspended by cables from two parabolic arches. The Velodrome has a white cap supported by two concrete arches 45 meters high, weighing 4000 tons, from which the glass and steel roof is <b>suspended.</b> similar <b>arches.</b> Calatrava also designed an enormous parabolic arch at the entrance and the Wall of Nations, a mobile sculpture of tubular steel which moves in a wavelike patterns.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by James Barney Marsh and built in 1911, the same year in which he filed a patent for his rainbow arch design. His design features two arched ribs, one {{on either side of}} the roadway, rising above the deck. The deck is <b>suspended</b> from the <b>arches</b> by vertical risers. Drivers see the rainbow arch crowns on each side, similar to crossing a pony truss bridge. The bridge over the Little Cottonwood River is one of the oldest Marsh rainbow arches in the country. Unfortunately, as traffic flow increased and farm machinery got larger, many of Marsh's rainbow arch designs became obsolete, since they could not be widened. There are only half a dozen Marsh rainbow arch bridges remaining in Minnesota.|$|R

50|$|The N&BR Act absolved the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway from a {{commitment}} it had earlier made to build such a bridge, {{on condition that}} the company paid the N&BR £100,000 toward the construction cost. Robert Stephenson selected the double-deck configuration to carry a roadway {{as well as the}} railway in preference to a side-by-side solution simply on the ground of thE complexity of the pier foundations, as it was known that finding a hard bottom in the river was going to be difficult. A masonry structure was ruled out for similar reasons, and cast iron bowstring arches were adopted. The tied arch design eliminates thrust at the abutments and piers. To avoid a clearance problem, the road deck was <b>suspended</b> below the <b>arch</b> ribs on hangers, an idea put forward by George Leather, 1787-1870, a Leeds engineer.|$|R

The low noise level is also appreciated, as is the ability to swivel the cab around on its vertical axis. The swiveling ability of the cab gives better visibility and also helps reduce the amount of head rotations. Furthermore, jarring motions and extreme swing due to uneven terrain are much less bothersome than in a conventional cab design. Vibration levels at the operator's seat in the self-leveling cab are equal to those measured in conventional rigid cabs.

60|$|This {{composition}} {{has suffered}} so grievously by time, {{that even the}} portions of it which remain are seen to the greatest disadvantage. Little more than various conditions of scar and stain can be now traced, where were once the draperies of the figures in the shade, and the <b>suspended</b> garland and <b>arches</b> on the right hand of the spectator; and in endeavouring not to represent more than there is authority for, the draughtsman and engraver have necessarily produced a less satisfactory plate than most others of the series. But Giotto has also himself fallen considerably below his usual standard. The faces appear to be cold and hard; and the attitudes are as little graceful as expressive either of attention or surprise. The Madonna's action, stretching her arms to embrace her Son, is pretty; but, on the whole, the picture has no value; {{and this is the}} more remarkable, as there were fewer precedents of treatment in this case than in any of the others; and it might have been anticipated that Giotto would have put himself to some pains when the field of thought was comparatively new. The subject of Christ teaching in the Temple rarely occurs in manuscripts; but all the others were perpetually repeated in the service-books of the period.|$|R
50|$|The Black Prince's Ruby, an {{enormous}} spinel which adorns {{the centre of}} the Imperial Crown of State, has a rich and dramatic history. It once belonged to a Sultan of Granada, who was murdered by Pedro the Cruel, King of Castille. He presented it to Edward, the Black Prince, in gratitude for his military assistance at the Battle of Navaretto in 1367. It was inherited by Edward's son, Richard II of England. Richard had it in his possession when he surrendered to his cousin, the future Henry IV of England in Wales in 1399. Henry later usurped the throne and Richard was murdered. Henry's son, Henry V of England, wore this stone in the crown he wore around his helmet at the Battle of Agincourt. During the battle a bejewelled gold fleuron was struck from this same crown and lost. The stone was similarly worn in the crown of Richard III of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. When Richard was killed during the fighting it famously rolled under a hawthorn bush to be retrieved by Lord Stanley and placed on the head of the victorious Henry Tudor, later Henry VII of England. The Imperial Crown of State also contains pearls worn as earrings by Queen Elizabeth I of England; these are <b>suspended</b> from the <b>arches</b> of the crown.|$|R
6000|$|When dark December glooms the day, And takes our autumn joys away; When {{short and}} scant the sunbeam throws, Upon the weary waste of snows, A cold and profitless regard, Like patron on a needy bard, When silvan occupation's done, And o'er the chimney rests the gun, And hang, in idle trophy, near, The game-pouch, fishing-rod, and spear; When wiry terrier, rough and grim, And greyhound, with his length of limb, And pointer, now {{employed}} no more, Cumber our parlour's narrow floor; When in his stall the impatient steed Is long condemned {{to rest and}} feed; When from our snow-encircled home, Scarce cares the hardiest step to roam, Since path is none, save that to bring The needful water from the spring; When wrinkled news-page, thrice conned o'er, Beguiles the dreary hour no more, And darkling politican, crossed Inveighs against the lingering post, And answering housewife sore complains Of carriers' snow-impeded wains; When such the country cheer, I come, Well pleased, to seek our city home; For converse, and for books, to change The Forest's melancholy range, And welcome, with renewed delight, The busy day and social night. [...] Not here need my desponding rhyme Lament the ravages of time, As erst by Newark's riven towers, And Ettrick stripped of forest bowers. True--Caledonia's Queen is changed, Since on her dusky summit ranged, Within its steepy limits pent, By bulwark, line, and battlement, And flanking towers, and laky flood, Guarded and garrisoned she stood, Denying entrance or resort, Save at each tall embattled port; Above whose <b>arch,</b> <b>suspended,</b> hung Portcullis spiked with iron prong. That long is gone,--but not so long, Since, early closed, and opening late, Jealous revolved the studded gate, Whose task, from eve to morning tide, A wicket churlishly supplied. Stern then, and steel-girt was thy brow, Dunedin! Oh, how altered now, When safe amid thy mountain court Thou sitt'st, like empress at her sport, And liberal, unconfined, and free, Flinging thy white arms to the sea, For thy dark cloud, with umbered lower, That hung o'er cliff, and lake, and tower, Thou gleam'st against the western ray Ten thousand lines of brighter day. [...] Not she, the championess of old, In Spenser's magic tale enrolled, She for the charmed spear renowned, Which forced each knight to kiss the ground - Not she more changed, when, placed at rest, What time she was Malbecco's guest, She gave to flow her maiden vest; When from the corslet's grasp relieved, Free to the sight her bosom heaved; Sweet was her blue eye's modest smile, Erst hidden by the aventayle; And down her shoulders graceful rolled Her locks profuse, of paly gold. They who whilom, in midnight fight, Had marvelled at her matchless might, No less her maiden charms approved, But looking liked, and liking loved. The sight could jealous pangs beguile, And charm Malbecco's cares a while; And he, the wandering squire of dames, Forgot his Columbella's claims, And passion, erst unknown, could gain The breast of blunt Sir Satyrane; Nor durst light Paridel advance, Bold as he was, a looser glance. She charmed at once, and tamed the heart, Incomparable Britomarte! [...] So thou, fair city! disarrayed Of battled wall, and rampart's aid, As stately seem'st, but lovelier far Than in that panoply of war. Nor deem that from thy fenceless throne Strength and security are flown; Still as of yore Queen of the North! Still canst thou send thy children forth. Ne'er readier at alarm-bell's call Thy burghers rose to man thy wall, Than now, in danger, shall be thine, Thy dauntless voluntary line; For fosse and turret proud to stand, Their breasts the bulwarks of the land. Thy thousands, trained to martial toil, Full red would stain their native soil, Ere from thy mural crown there fell The slightest knosp or pinnacle. And if it come--as come it may, Dunedin! that eventful day - Renowned for hospitable deed, That virtue much with Heaven may plead In patriarchal times whose care Descending angels deigned to share; That claim may wrestle blessings down On those who fight for the good town, Destined in every age to be Refuge of injured royalty; Since first, when conquering York arose, To Henry meek she gave repose, Till late, with wonder, grief, and awe, Great Bourbon's relics, sad she saw. [...] Truce to these thoughts!--for, as they rise, How gladly I avert mine eyes, Bodings, or true or false, to change, For Fiction's fair romantic range, Or for tradition's dubious light, That hovers 'twixt the day and night: Dazzling alternately and dim, Her wavering lamp I'd rather trim, Knights, squires, and lovely dames, to see Creation of my fantasy, Than gaze abroad on reeky fen, And make of mists invading men. Who love not more the night of June Than dull December's gloomy noon? The moonlight than the fog of frost? And can we say which cheats the most? [...] But who shall teach my harp to gain A sound of the romantic strain, Whose Anglo-Norman tones whilere Could win the royal Henry's ear, Famed Beauclerc called, for that he loved The minstrel, and his lay approved? Who shall these lingering notes redeem, Decaying on Oblivion's stream; Such notes as from the Breton tongue Marie translated, Blondel sung? O! born Time's ravage to repair, And make the dying muse thy care; Who, when his scythe her hoary foe Was poising for the final blow, The weapon from his hand could wring, And break his glass, and shear his wing, And bid, reviving in his strain, The gentle poet live again; Thou, who canst give to lightest lay An unpedantic moral gay, Nor less the dullest theme bid flit On wings of unexpected wit; In letters as in life approved, Example honoured and beloved - Dear Ellis! to the bard impart A lesson of thy magic art, To win at once the head and heart - At once to charm, instruct, and mend, My guide, my pattern, and my friend! [...] Such minstrel lesson to bestow Be long thy pleasing task--but, oh! No more by thy example teach - What few can practise, all can preach - With even patience to endure Lingering disease, and painful cure, And boast affliction's pangs subdued By mild and manly fortitude. Enough, the lesson has been given: Forbid the repetition, Heaven! [...] Come, listen, then! for thou hast known, And loved the minstrel's varying tone, Who, like his Border sires of old, Waked a wild measure rude and bold, Till Windsor's oaks, and Ascot plain, With wonder heard the Northern strain. Come, listen! bold in thy applause, The bard shall scorn pedantic laws; And, as the ancient art could stain Achievements on the storied pane, Irregularly traced and planned, But yet so glowing and so grand - So shall he strive in changeful hue, Field, feast, and combat to renew, And loves, and arms, and harpers' glee, And all the pomp of chivalry.|$|R
