5|$|At the US Open, Federer lost a much-anticipated {{semifinal}} {{match to}} Novak Djokovic, after <b>squandering</b> two match {{points in the}} fifth set, which repeated his previous year's result against Djokovic and added a second loss from two sets up in Grand Slam tournament play to his record. With that loss, it meant that Federer did not win {{at least one of}} the four majors in 2011, the first time since 2002. Later that month in September 2011, in a South African poll, Federer was voted the second most trusted and respected person in the world, next to Nelson Mandela.|$|E

This comes to pass: {{the death of the}} Captain's cousin, the heir to the family's baronetcy, makes him the likely eventual heir. The current Baronet accepts the Captain as his heir, buying out the Colonel's interest to prevent his <b>squandering</b> the family fortune. The two lovers are reunited, leaving Gilmore bitter and despondent.|$|E
5|$|Seara disappeared, {{together}} with Minerva, Libertatea, Steagul {{and most other}} Germanophile papers, in late summer 1916, shortly after Romania declared war on the Central Powers. When the German and Austrian troops invaded southern Romania, forcing the Ententist government to flee for Iași, some of Searas former staff remained in Bucharest and chose the path of collaborationism. This was notably pursued by Arghezi, Galaction, Bărbulescu and Karnabatt, all of whom wrote for the propaganda tribune Gazeta Bucureștilor. According to popular rumors, Bogdan-Pitești fell out of favor with the occupiers, who eventually discovered {{that he had been}} <b>squandering</b> their grants.|$|E

5|$|Coutances {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln on 8 May 1183, {{selected}} by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at Angers by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was enthroned at Lincoln Cathedral on 11 December 1183. While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of <b>squandering</b> its resources. Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell.|$|E
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of <b>squandering</b> the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E

5|$|The 1863–64 season saw Wills' {{engagement}} to Anderson collapse, possibly {{due to his}} womanising, and {{it was revealed that}} he had been mismanaging Cullin-la-ringo, in part by <b>squandering</b> family finances on alcohol while claiming it as station expenditure. The trustees demanded that he stay in Victoria to answer for the property's runaway debt. In response, Wills left Australia to join Parr's XI on a month-long tour of New Zealand. Initially standing in as umpire, he went on to captain local teams against the English, and filled the same role for a Victoria XXII {{at the end of the}} tour in Melbourne. He faced the trustees soon after. His mother struggled to condemn him but ultimately approved his dismissal from Cullin-la-ringo, thus fulfilling the premonition in Horatio's will.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began <b>squandering</b> in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation among this crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that they roll the dice again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won and kept his fortune, but reportedly still failed to pay the £10,000.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} {{defendants}} {{were required to}} pay trial expenses, and Cofresí's family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maravedí. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, {{with little or no}} support from Cofresí's brothers and sisters, was left with the debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother's legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Ignacio's granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofresí's <b>squandering</b> of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. Appraised at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by Félix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities giving them the cargo of the San José y las Animas in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later.|$|E

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent <b>squandering</b> of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were Ryuhei Kitamura's direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall <b>squandering</b> its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. Shun Oguri, Tetsuji Tamayama, Gō Ayano, Meisa Kuroki and Tadanobu Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed {{it as part of}} a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”.|$|E
5|$|Loxton then {{played in}} each of Australia’s four {{remaining}} tour games before the Tests, {{but was unable to}} do enough to force his way into the first-choice team. He made 39 and 52 against Lancashire, and 16 against Nottinghamshire, <b>squandering</b> his starts in the latter two innings to run outs. In the match against Hampshire, he made one in his only innings after Australia were caught on a damp pitch and took a solitary wicket. The Australian team's batting depth did not help Loxton’s cause; in the final pre-Test match against Sussex, a match won by an innings and 325 runs, he was slated to bat at No. 9, but Australia’s earlier batsmen were largely untroubled so Bradman declared at 5/549. The all-rounder’s 3/13 in the first innings had the effect of removing him from the bowling line-up {{for the rest of the}} match, as Doug Ring, Ernie Toshack, Ron Hamence and Ian Johnson helped Ray Lindwall to bowl the touring team to an easy victory. Loxton had limited opportunities as those ahead of him tended to finish off the opposition before his turn, and did not score heavily enough when he had a chance, so he was overlooked for the First Test at Trent Bridge. Bradman again opted to use Brown out of position in the middle-order as Australia took an eight-wicket win.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, <b>squandering</b> numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E
