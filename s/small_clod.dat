5000|$|Mercator {{was buried}} in the church of St. Salvatore in Duisburg where a {{memorial}} was erected about fifty years after his death. The main text of the epitaph is a summary of his life lauding him as the foremost mathematician of his time who crafted artistic and accurate globes showing the heaven from the inside and the Earth from the outside ... greatly respected for his wide erudition, particularly in theology, and famous on account of his piety and respectability in life. In addition, on the base of the memorial, there is an epigram: To the reader: whoever you are, your fears that this <b>small</b> <b>clod</b> of earth lies heavily on the buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden for a man who had the whole weight of her lands on his shoulders and carried her as an Atlas.Following Mercator's death his family prepared the Atlas for publication—in four months. It was, after all, a hoped for source of the income that was needed to support them. This work entailed supplementing the maps of the 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of Mercator covering the northern countries, creating four maps of the continents and a world map, the printing of Mercator's account of the creation and finally the addition of eulogies and Walter Ghim's biography of Mercator. The title itself provides Mercator's definition of a new meaning for the word [...] "Atlas": Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura which may be translated as [...] "Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the fabric {{of the world and the}} figure of the fabrick’d, or, more colloquially, as Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created." [...] Over the years Mercator's definition of atlas has become simply A collection of maps in a volume.The atlas was not an immediate success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce another edition in 1602 but only the text was reset, there were no new maps. Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps of that book Mercator's un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598 the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{temporary}} haul {{roads and}} landings in west-central Alberta were tilled with a winged subsoiler {{specifically designed for}} tilling compacted forest soils. Surface soil {{had been removed from}} all sites during construction, and spread over three of the four landings prior to tillage. Soil bulk density at the 0 – 10, 10 – 20, and 20 – 30 cm depths, and clod size distribution at the 0 – 30 cm depth were measured immediately after tillage. Bulk density of undisturbed and compacted (untilled) soil was also measured. Mean bulk density of compacted soil in haul roads was significantly greater than the bulk density of undisturbed soil, but not for landings. Tillage significantly reduced mean bulk density on three haul roads and two landings; subsurface soil was relatively dry at these sites. Most soils were difficult to fracture into <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> because these weakly aggregated soils were severely remoulded and compacted by equipment, particularly logging trucks operating on the haul roads. The degraded soil was massive and the strenght of the surface soil layers was generally much higher than was the strength of lower soil layers; this resulted in the subsoil deforming around the wings of the subsoiler rather than fracturing the surface soil. Fracturing of compacted soil into <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> was apparently enhanced by at least 2 years of frost action. The winged subsoiler was only moderately effective at fracturing recently compacted soil because of an often high soil water content, but it was observed that sites where soil was broken into large clods was loosened by frost action the following winter. Alternative methods of tilling compacted soil that insure soil fracturing over a wider range of soil water contents are needed for loosening compacted soil in northern boreal forests...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, the {{presence}} of a new type of agricultural-surface tillage used for the sowing of wheat and corn has been observed with increasing frequency. It illustrates less roughly ploughed soils, with a greater quantity of <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> distributed over the soil surface. In this paper, a new description of such rough agricultural surfaces is proposed. It is based on a composite model, including a classical surface represented by an exponential correlation function, together with a random cloddy structure. This description enables volumetric structures to be introduced over the soil's surface. A numerical moment-modeling method, based on integral equations, is used to evaluate the contribution of clods to the radar backscattering behavior of agricultural surfaces. It is found that {{the presence}} of clods explains the very small correlation lengths which are often found in cloddy agricultural fields. The classical approach, in which the surface is described by a correlation function only based on two statistical parameters, rms height and correlation length, overestimates the backscattering coefficients when compared with an approach that includes the clods. This overestimation is often observed with real radar data for such fields...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated to obtain some understanding on the behaviour of soil at higher moisture content {{and to explore}} the potential of preparing paddy fields with reduced amounts of water. This investigation comprised of three separate studies. Based on existing information that water could be reduced when soil clods were initially formed prior to flooding, the effects of clod size, clod initial moisture content and confining states on the rate of water uptake were explored. The moisture gradients within clods wetted and dried for different period of times were also studied. The results of the clod wetting experiments show that· the rate of water uptake by capillarity was greatest when clods were initially very dry and <b>smaller</b> <b>clods</b> tended to absorb water faster than bigger clods when under confined conditions. Confining {{had no effect on}} infiltration when the initial condition was very wet. On drying, the <b>smallest</b> <b>clod</b> dried the fastest, reduced greater volume and increased its dry bulk density significantly. Larger clods required,longer drying period to arrive at a uniform moisture profile within as compared to <b>smaller</b> <b>clods.</b> Results from the wetting experiments were tested against the infiltration model of. Jarvis and Leeds-Harrison (1987) and a model developed based on linear flow of heat into a solid (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959). A second project involved the study of soil deformation at high moisture contents in an attempt to produce clods with minimum draught force using simple relieved tines at various rake angles and depths in a soil tank. The principal. objective of the - ii - study was to utilise soil implement mechanics knowledge to improve the efficiency of soil preparation for wetland crops. Aspects like the nature of soil disturbance, extent of disturbance and draught requirement were investigated. The soil was in a plastic consistency prepared to three specified density states of 940, 1000 and 1250 kg/m 3 • The soil disturbance pattern was monitored using implanted coloured beads and glass sided tank studies. In addition, the extent and height of heave and surface disturbance were noted. Predictive models based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics theory were developed to predict the interaction between the soil and simple implements at three rake angles. These were based on the lateral failure theory of Godwin and Spoor (1977) and the two dimensional soil failure model of Hettiaratchi and Reece (1974). Results from the single tine study were tested against the models. A sliding resistance component and crescent effect were incorporated to improve the predictions for the 45 ° and 90 ° rake angle tines. The magnitude of each mode of failure is dependent upon the critical aspect ratio which varies with tine rake angles and soil conditions. The mode of failure is considered to be lateral when the tine aspect ratio is larger than the critical aspect ratio and an upward failure when the tine aspect ratio is lower than the critical aspect ratio. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. For the backward raked tine, a model was developed based on the formation of an elliptical wedge and bearing capacity type of failure ahead and below the wedge. This failure theory was based on the bearing capacity failure for deep footings. The model - iii - helped identify an additional parameter that influenced the draught force for a backward raked tine. This parameter is the sliding resistance component on both sides and beneath the elliptical soil wedge •. Results from multitine studies showed that draught force increased with tine spacinq but the increase was not significant. In the wet condition the tines merely cut slots and little or no interaction was noted. In an effort to find the optimum water level for soil puddlinq, a laboratory study was conducted to determine the influence of water-soil ratio on the ease of puddling air dry aqqreqates. Soil puddlinq was carried out usinq a·rotary stirrer simulatinq the rotary motion of a rotary cultivator commonly used in wetland preparation •. The results obtained showed that· the fastest dispersion of particles resultinq in a minimum wet bulk density of 1. 23 Mg/m 3, was achieved at a water-soil ratio of 1. 2. (A supersaturated condition equivalent to a moisture content of 120 % dry basis). Increasing the water-soil ratio above this value did not change the wet bulk density value for all stirring times...|$|R
40|$|In its gregarious phase the locust Dociostaurus maroccanus (Thunberg) (Orthoptera Acrididae) has {{periodically}} caused significant yield {{losses in}} many Mediterranean and Asian countries, and alarm {{in the general}} public. Population outbreaks {{in recent years have}} frequently required the application of control measures, based on those that have low environmental impact, which are only possible with a sound knowledge of locust bio-ethology and ecology. Our research was aimed at studying the spatial distribution of D. maroccanus egg pods in two Apulian egg bed areas in southern Italy, thus contributing to the rationalization of control methods. The distribution of D. maroccanus egg pods was investigated using a geostatistical approach. Three sampling designs (called A, B and C), characterized by different mesh and clod sizes, were compared to evaluate their effectiveness and affordability. In both egg bed areas, the variogram models were asymptotic with a small nugget effect, and indicated an aggregated distribution of egg pods. Contour maps showed that design A, based on a larger mesh and clod size, was characterized by few hot spots and an extended zone of “low density” egg pods, while design B, involving a <b>smaller</b> mesh and <b>clod</b> size, showed a more structured distribution, with various hot spots alternating with zero level zones. Finally, design C, based on a larger mesh size and <b>smaller</b> <b>clods,</b> showed a single extended hot spot surrounded by a large area without egg pods. Moreover, because of the larger amount of soil to be examined, design A was about 2. 6 - and 10. 9 -fold more time consuming than designs B and C, respectively. Our data showed that sampling designs providing smaller and denser samples should be preferred over designs with fewer and larger samples when information on both the distribution and density of egg pods is needed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil {{roughness}} {{is a key}} parameter to {{our understanding}} of soil properties and soil-water interaction, most of which occur at millimeter scales. Soil irregularities, such as aggregates, clods and interrill depressions, influence water infiltration and overland flow. The objective {{of this study is to}} observe and quantify clod evolution under cumulated precipitation. We prepared two soil trays with loose silt soil and pre-sieved clods put on top, at low and high concentrations. These trays were then subjected to a set of five successive artificial rainfalls. The digital elevation models (DEM) were recorded for each tray, at millimetric resolution, at the initial stage and after each subsequent rainfall. The clods were automatically segmented on the DEM and the diameter, surface area and volume of these clods were measured by computer. The isolated clods showed comparable behavior on both trays. The <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> were almost always decreasing in volume until they disappeared. The other clods swelled during the first rain or the first two rains, and then decreased in area and volume. The decrease was faster for volume than for area. This probably reflected a soil detachment phenomenon, which mostly affected the heights of the clods. On the high concentration tray, the close inter-proximity of the clods induced merging and the formation of blocks. The rate of decrease of clod volume as a function of cumulative precipitation could be modeled using exponential and linear equations. <b>Small</b> and intermediate-sized <b>clods</b> showed an exponential decrease that was smoother as the clod size increased. Large clod volume decrease was almost linear. We were further able to model the trend of the slope parameter of the exponential decrease, as a function of clod size. Our study has shown how the DEM recording and image analysis can be used to quantify the evolution of clods under rainfall, improve our understanding of clod dynamics under rainfall and roughness parameterization. The size dependency of clod volume decrease is important for soil conservation decisions. This will obviously affect crust formation, surface armoring, soil erosion and surface permeability to water and gas...|$|R

The horizons studied developed on a large range of age and facies of calcareous or calcium-saturated clayey sediments. The water retention properties were studied from − 10 hPa to − 15 000 hPa water potential using <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> collected in winter when swelling is at a maximum and water content close to field capacity. The specific water content and volume of the clods at field conditions, their specific volume at − 15 000 hPa water potential, the clay content, the organic carbon content, the cation exchange capacity, the N 2 -BET surface area and calcareous content were measured. The clay fabric, which is the spatial distribution of the elementary clay particles, was quantified when the soil was close to field capacity and we could attribute the whole pore volume to the porosity of the clay fabric. Our {{results show that the}} water retention properties of the clay vary greatly from one soil to another with respect to the clay fabric. The variation of the latter depends on the cation exchange capacity, the size of elementary particles and hydric stress history of the clay. We show that the water retention properties of the studied clayey soils vary according to the clay content and fabric, the latter being related either to parent material fabric or to both the hydric history of the soil and size of the elementary clay particles...|$|R

Sometimes both male and female will display together, the male pursuing the female in a twisting, low flight. They normally breed during the summer months, and breeding is often triggered by rain and so can take place at almost any time when conditions are favourable. The nestis a shallow depression which is lined with plant and other material, with the rim often marked out with small stones or <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> of earth. The nest is usually situated beneath a shrub or a grass tuft so that some shade is provided. Both sexes incubate the clutch of 2 to 3 eggs, for around 11 to 12 days. The chicks start to leave the nest some time before they are able to fly for short periods at around six days old and typically leave it altogether at around eight days old. Soon after the chicks leave the nest, the chicks separate and each adult becomes solely responsible for one chick, this may be behaviour which reduces the risk of predation. If there are more than two chicks the other chicks often do not survive. The chicks fledge properly at around 21 or 22 days old and reach sexual maturity at about a year old.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBecause {{the surface}} micro-topography {{has a large}} impact on soil properties, {{numerous}} {{studies have focused on}} surface roughness, soil height changes, and soil cloddiness characterization. Usually, feature parameters are estimated from soil measurement samples, based on statistics characterizing the surface as a whole. Now, the shortcoming of such a global approach is that it fails to detect local soil height changes and non-stationarities. The present study introduces a new method to identify and characterize the clods on a seedbed surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM). It is based on an a priori model of the clods, namely objects presenting closed elevation contours with high gradient values. Our clod segmentation method was assessed {{with the help of a}} soil scientist on the two kinds of tilled soil surfaces which were considered in this study: an artificial surface made in the laboratory to have a controlled roughness, and an actual seedbed surface made in an experimental field. In both cases results were evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and showed the performance of the method. We also study the impacts of the main parameters of the method and the computer time. Its main limitations are that it fails to identify the <b>small</b> <b>clods</b> (diameter <b>smaller</b> than 7 mm in this study) and the clods embedded within another piece of relief, such as a greater clod or a hollow border.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{state of the}} seedbed is of importance to the plant environment as it influences some important processes in the soil such as seedling emergence, water and solute transport, and ease of root penetration. This is affected {{to a large extent}} by tillage process, the tillage implement type and the geometry of the implement used. A field experiment was carried out on a clay soil to determine the effect of the geometry of bladed tillage implements on some soil physical properties after tillage. The soil properties evaluated were bulk density, mean clod size distribution and total pore space after tillage and the extent of loosening achieved. Implement parameters considered were blade width, rake angle and depth of operation of the implement. Two blade widths of 75 and 150 mm were evaluated in combination with three rake angles of 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Each tillage implement was drawn through the soil at four operating depths of 100, 150, 200 and 250 mm. Larger rake angles were observed to result in larger mean aggregate sizes and greater bulk density reductions when compared to smaller rake angles. Greater reduction in bulk density was observed with the wider of the two blade widths evaluated. Mean clod size after tillage was also observed to be large for the wider of the two widths evaluated. Irrespective of width and rake angle, greater operating depths resulted in larger mean clod sizes and greater reductions in bulk density as compared to shallower operating depths. Fractal analysis showed the extent of fragmentation to be greater at shallower operating depths, hence the <b>small</b> mean <b>clod</b> sizes obtained...|$|R
