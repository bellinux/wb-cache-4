A storage container is utilized which has a passive system so that fluid/thermal and electrical interfaces with the logistics module is not required. The container for storage comprises two units, each having an inner <b>storage</b> <b>shell</b> and an outer shell receiving the inner shell and spaced about it. The novelty appears to lie in the integration of thermally efficient cryogenic storage techniques with phase change materials, including the multilayer metalized surface thin plastic film insulation and the vacuum between the shells.

40|$|Molten salts (MS) in the 580 °C range {{could be}} used to store excess energy from solar power {{stations}} and possibly from nuclear or coal. The energy can be stored up to a week in large containers at elevated temperature to generate eight hours of electricity to be used at night or during peak demand hours. This helps to reduce the fluctuation experienced at thermal solar power stations due to weather conditions. Our research supported by Office of Naval Research (ONR), presents a survey of salts to be used in molten salt technology and the design of large steel and hybrid molten salt storage shells. The physical characteristics of these salts such as density, melting temperature, viscosity, electric conductivity, surface tension, thermal capacity and cost are discussed. Cost is extremely important given the large volumes of salt required for energy storage at a commercial power station. Formulas are presented showing the amount of salt needed per required megawatts of stored energy {{depending on the type of}} salt. The estimated cost and the size of tanks required and the operating temperatures are presented. Recommendations are made regarding the most efficient type of molten salt to use. Commercial thermal solar power stations have been constructed in the US and overseas mainly in Spain for which molten salt is being considered. A field of flat mirrors together with collection towers are presently used in some designs and parabolic troughs used in others to produce electricity commercially. Two designs of tanks for the storage of excess energy from thermal solar power plants using molten salts (MS) at 580 °C is presented. Energy can be stored up to a week in large containers to generate eight hours of electricity for use at night or to reduce weather related fluctuation at solar thermal energy plants. The research presented in this thesis shows detailed designs of cylindrical shells for the storage of high temperature molten salts. One <b>storage</b> <b>shell</b> consists of an inner stainless steel layer designed to resist corrosion and an external steel structural layer to contain the large pressures resulting from the molten salt with a steel bottom. The other <b>storage</b> <b>shell</b> consists of an inner stainless steel layer and an external reinforced concrete structural layer with a steel bottom. Both cylindrical tanks are 54 feet high and has an 80 foot diameter, with the salt level at a height of 42 feet. Given the heat of the molten salt and the size of the tank, designs include a flat shell cover supported on stainless steel columns and a semispherical utility access dome at the center. Considerations are made for the reduction of strength of steel at elevated temperatures. Layers of external insulation materials are used to reduce heat loss in the storage shells. Designs also present a 120 foot diameter posttensioned concrete foundation with 20 feet high steel side walls for the storage tank for the containment of molten salts in case of an accident. The tanks sit on a layer of sand to allow for thermal expansion...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with Muscovy ducks to study the influence of age and laying time on their egg quality. In addition the relationship between egg water loss during <b>storage,</b> <b>shell</b> thickness and storage time were tested. a total of 2920 eggs were collected and individually weighed, washed, fumigated and stored for a maximum period of 7 days. Then the eggs were incubated and candled on the 10 th day. All the shell obtained from unfertile eggs (10 th day), died embryo eggs (10 th and 30 th day) and hatched eggs (34 th day), were immediately cleaned by washing and dried in a forced draught stove. Individual egg measurements included: egg weight at collection and at incubation, shell weight and shell thickness. Shell weight per unit of egg surface area (SWUSA), water loss per unit of time, avg. shell thickness and percentage of shell on egg weight were calculated. Results obtained in this study show that the duck egg stored at 11 +- 0. 2 °C and R. H. 70 - 75 % loose 0. 03 g of water for each day of storage (P< 0. 001). Hatching rate is affected (P< 0. 05) by water loss during storage period and the best results (70. 34 %) are obtained when water loss per week is about 1 % of egg weight. Shell thickness, weight, percentage of shell on egg weight and SWUSA are significantly affected by laying time and age of bird (P< 0. 01). these parameters tend to decrease {{with the passing of}} laying -period and age of bird. A relationship between hatching outcome and shell weight percentage of shell on egg weight and SWUSA was observed (P< 0. 01). Moreover results showed that although shell weight increases with increasing egg weight (b=+ 0. 82), it does not do so proportionally, consequently there is concomitant decrease in percentage of shell on egg weight (b= - 0. 028) ...|$|E

Commercialisation projects for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2) captured at power plants are currently in the design stage for the Peterhead, White Rose, Caledonia Clean Energy (DECC, 2013, 2015) and Don Valley projects. Storage of the CO 2 captured by these projects is planned in strata deep beneath the North Sea in depleted hydrocarbon fields or regionally extensive sandstones containing brine (saline aquifer sandstones). The vast majority of the UK and Scotland’s potential storage resource, which is of European significance (SCCS, 2009), is within brine-saturated sandstone formations. The sandstone formations are each hundreds to thousands of square kilometres in extent and underlie all sectors of the North Sea. The immense potential to store CO 2 in these rocks can only be fully achieved by the operation of more than one injection site within each formation. Government, university and research institutes, industry, and stakeholder organisations have anticipated the need to inform a second phase of CCS developments following on from a commercialisation project in Scotland. The CO 2 MultiStore study, led by Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage (SCCS), investigates the operation of more than one injection site within a storage formation using a North Sea case study. The Captain Sandstone, within the mature oil and gas province offshore Scotland, contains the Goldeneye Field, which is the planned storage site for the Peterhead CCS project. Previous research (SCCS, 2011) was augmented by data from offshore hydrocarbon exploration and detailed investigation of the Goldeneye Field for CO 2 <b>storage</b> (<b>Shell,</b> 2011 a-i). The research was targeted to increase understanding and confidence in the operation of two or more sites within the Captain Sandstone. Methods were implemented to reduce the effort and resources needed to characterise the sandstone, and increase understanding of its stability and performance during operation of more than one injection site. Generic learning was captured throughout the CO 2 MultiStore project relevant to the characterisation of the extensive storage sandstones, management of the planned injection operations and monitoring of CO 2 injection at two (or more) sites within any sandstone formation. The storage of CO 2 can be optimised by the operation of more than one injection site in a geological formation by taking a regional-scale approach to site assessment. The study concludes that at least 360 million tonnes of CO 2 captured over the coming 35 years could be permanently stored using two injection sites in the Captain Sandstone. Confidence in the planned operation of two or more injection sites in a storage formation is greatly increased by the use of existing information, knowledge and data acquired during hydrocarbon exploitation. Widespread pressure changes should be expected by the injection of CO 2 at more than one site. Assessment, management and monitoring of pressure changes on a regional scale will optimise the storage capacity, ensure security of storage and prevent adverse effects to existing storage and hydrocarbon operations.

40|$|Storage and {{handling}} of {{large volumes of}} grain on Missouri farms is common. In 1978, on-farm <b>storage</b> capacity for <b>shelled</b> grain was approximately 309 million bushels. Much of this grain is stored in bins with capacities ranging from 20, 000 to 100, 000 bushels. Grain is also handled more quickly today. Today's large augers can transfer from two to {{four times as much}} grain as the augers of the past. Also, using automated equipment often means a farmer works alone most of the time. Increased storage capacities, larger and faster handling capacities and automation contribute to many potentially hazardous situations during the harvest and storage season. This guide sheet identifies many of them and suggests preventive measures that control or eliminate the hazardous exposure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the use of a waste marine sea shell product {{incorporated}} into a concrete mix as an aggregate replacement. Utilising <b>shells</b> reduces the <b>storage</b> of <b>shell</b> waste, also reducing the need for quarried aggregate and has potential benefits of adding a different material to a design mix concrete mix design for improved performance. Design/methodology/approach – The test methods used to evaluate the concrete were, British Standard tests for compressive strength (BS EN 12390 - 3 : 2002) and porosity (BS EN 12390 - 8 : 2009). A paired comparison test was carried out examining two different partial replacement shell aggregate mixes against a plain concrete control sample. Findings – The results showed a reduction in compressive strength when 50 per cent of sea shells were used as an aggregate replacement, for both sand and gravel, compared to the control sample. Crushed and graded sea shells used in concrete displayed a lower porosity/permeability than plain concrete. Originality/value – Whilst there is existing work relating to the compressive strength of concrete using sea shells, the porosity of concrete using sea shells has not been widely addressed and the paper investigates this aspect of sustainable concrete research...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} establish the effect of the biomass-heated natural convection dryer on insect damage, mould infection, aflatoxin contamination and the germination potential of maize grain during storage. Maize grains were dried using two methods; on bare ground simulating farmer practices and using the biomass dryer. The maize dried on bare ground took five days to dry to safe storage moisture content of 14 % while that of the biomass dryer took only 6 h. Drying maize grain using the biomass dryer delayed insect infestation by three months and significantly (p≤ 0. 05) reduced mould and aflatoxin contamination during storage for 6 months. Maize dried using the biomass dryer was only infested with Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella) while that dried on bare ground was infested by both the moth and the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) implying that the biomass dryer controlled the most important storage insect pest of maize in Uganda. Drying maize using the biomass dryer had no effect on the germination potential of the grain. Thus, drying maize grain with the biomass dryer reduces drying time and greatly improves the quality of the grain during storage. However, the subsequent storage quality of the grain highly depends on the <b>storage</b> form (<b>shelled</b> or unshelled), time and environment...|$|R
