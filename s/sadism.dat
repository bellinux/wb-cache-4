5|$|In Britain, by omitting some of Le Chiffre's <b>sadism</b> and James Bond's {{reactions}} in the torture scene, the film received the desired BBFC 12A rating.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} of the Spanish American dictatorship is omnipresent in The Kingdom of This World through the images of torture, fire, suppression, and hungry dogs for example. Carpentier's characters often find consolation in sexuality (which {{is closely related to}} the <b>sadism</b> of the violence theme) after experiencing violence.|$|E
5|$|The innate {{sexuality}} of bloodsucking {{can be seen}} in its intrinsic {{connection with}} cannibalism and folkloric one with incubus-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with semen being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral <b>sadism</b> is integral in vampiric behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual <b>sadism</b> implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Priapic worship {{amongst the}} women of Sicily {{continued}} into the 18th century; worshiping phallic votive objects and kissing such offerings before placing them upon the altar in the churches. Fetishism with the phallus architecturally and in smaller implements was also exhibited by certain Christian sects in medieval times, such as the Manichaeans, and was connected with masochism and <b>sadism,</b> a form of religious flagellantism. Smaller phallic shaped monuments {{in the form of}} idols, even vases, rings, drinking vessels and jewellery have been well-documented and could be found within medieval churches of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by <b>sadism,</b> and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|Kim {{solidified}} his {{break with}} cinematic realism by following The Housemaid {{with two more}} films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time. The Sea Knows (1961) transcended {{its roots in the}} standard anti-Japanese World War II film to become a distinctive examination of humanity, <b>sadism,</b> greed, lust for power and sexuality. The box-office success of this film enabled Kim to buy his first house, in the Namsan district of Seoul. Goryeojang (1963), dealt with a similar subject matter as The Ballad of Narayama (1983), directed by Shohei Imamura, a filmmaker with whom Kim has often been compared. Kim's version of the story is marked by his mixing of genres. For example, he frames the storywhich deals with an ancient tradition in which elders were abandoned to diewithin a modern lecture on birth control.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} sources {{about the}} reign of Caligula, although he {{is described as a}} noble and moderate emperor during {{the first six months of}} his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, <b>sadism,</b> extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province.|$|E
5|$|When encountering natives in the New World, Spanish explorers were {{occasionally}} {{told of a}} tribe composed {{entirely of}} women. One such tale was related to Cortés {{about a group of}} Amazons supposedly living in a province called Ciguatán. Juan de Grijalva was told of Amazons during his 1518 expedition through the Tabasco region of Mexico. Nuño de Guzmán followed tales of a nation of women who lived in riches on or near the sea, women with whiter skin who were accounted goddesses by the natives. He described how they used bows and arrows, and lived in many towns. Polk characterized Guzmán as driven by lust for sex and riches—his greed and <b>sadism</b> were well known.|$|E
25|$|These are {{described}} in true Sadean form. However, unlike some of his other works, the novel {{is not just a}} catalogue of <b>sadism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The term {{sadomasochism}} {{is derived}} from the words <b>sadism</b> and masochism. These terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology, since those require that the <b>sadism</b> or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners. Sadomasochism refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. <b>Sadism</b> describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting pain, degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).|$|E
25|$|Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud {{assumed that}} <b>sadism</b> in men {{resulted}} from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, {{was seen as a}} more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of <b>sadism.</b> Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that {{it would be difficult to}} distinguish as a separate inclination.|$|E
25|$|Causes {{of sexual}} {{violence}} are debated and {{explanations of the}} cause include military conquest, socioeconomics, anger, power, <b>sadism,</b> sexual pleasure, psychopathy, ethical standards, laws, attitudes toward the victims and evolutionary pressures.|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism, three {{personality}} traits that are together {{referred to as}} the dark triad, share certain characteristics, such as a callous-manipulative interpersonal style. The dark tetrad refers to these traits with the addition of <b>sadism.</b>|$|E
25|$|September 1969 saw {{the opening}} of Christie in Love, a play by Howard Brenton about Christie's murders and {{psychological}} abnormality, that relates them to violence and <b>sadism</b> in society as a whole. It has been revived several times since.|$|E
25|$|The triskelion as a BDSM symbol {{can easily}} be {{perceived}} as the three separate parts of the acronym BDSM; which are BD, DS, and SM (Bondage & Discipline, Dominance & Submission, <b>Sadism</b> & Masochism). They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.|$|E
25|$|One report {{suggested}} that Harris was a psychopath and Klebold was severely depressed, and consequently that Harris {{was influenced by}} <b>sadism,</b> whereas Klebold was influenced by revenge. This report {{suggested that}} all of the reasons the boys gave for the shooting were justifications in order to present themselves as killers with a cause.|$|E
25|$|The word <b>Sadism</b> {{originates}} {{from the}} works of Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, and the word Masochism originates from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of Venus in Furs. However, {{it is worth noting}} that the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in Justine. Venus in Furs describes a consented domme-sub relationship.|$|E
25|$|Ferguson {{emphasised}} that Fred, {{before meeting}} Rose, had committed {{at least one}} murder strikingly similar to those at issue in the present trial, and that the prosecution's case was largely circumstantial. He contended that Rose {{was unaware of the}} extent of Fred's <b>sadism,</b> and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, such works as Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue and 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade were exemplars {{of the theme}} of sado-masochism and {{influenced}} later erotic accounts of <b>Sadism</b> and masochism in fiction. De Sade (as did the later writer Sacher-Masoch) lent his name to the sexual acts which he describes in his work.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} only slowly improved. While the professionalization of Hungarian {{history and}} historiography {{coupled with the}} loosening of state ideological controls inevitably led to a fairer assessment of Horthy's life, popular volumes still painted him negatively. Influential biographies openly leveled ad hominem attacks at Horthy, accusing him of bastardy, lechery, <b>sadism,</b> greed, nepotism, bloodthirst, warmongering, and cowardice, among other vices.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} the camp was that the wire fences were only two metres high; they were not electrified, {{and they did not}} have lookout towers filled with guards {{pointing}} their machine guns at the internees. The atmosphere was radically different from an extermination camp: there were no executions (murders) or displays of <b>sadism</b> {{on the part of the}} guards.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{the year}} her divorce was finalized, she married Ernest Greene, {{professional}} name Ira Levine, {{a director of}} porn films, particularly bondage, discipline, <b>sadism,</b> and/or masochism-oriented films. They sometimes work together, as in The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women, directed by Tristan Taormino and Greene, and O: the Power of Submission, directed by Greene; she played supporting roles in both. The couple consider themselves polyamorous. Hartley has no children of her own.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study in}} Ireland, {{undertaken}} by the Garda Síochána, revealed the most serious content {{in a sample of}} over 100 cases involving indecent images of children. In 44% of cases, the most serious images depicted nudity or erotic posing, in 7% they depicted sexual activity between children, in 7% they depicted non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, in 37% they depicted penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, and in 5% they depicted <b>sadism</b> or bestiality.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to making {{films in the}} United Kingdom, Lee made films in mainland Europe: he appeared in two German films, Count Dracula (1970), where he again played the vampire count, and The Torture Chamber of Dr. <b>Sadism</b> (1967). Other films in Europe he made include Castle of the Living Dead (1964) and Horror Express (1972). Lee was a producer of the horror film Nothing But the Night (also 1972), in which he also starred. It {{was the first and}} last film he ever produced, as he did not enjoy the process.|$|E
25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of <b>sadism</b> and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{released}} {{with great}} fanfare and much anticipation, All Star Batman has consistently received negative reviews from critics. Nearly all {{complaints about the}} series are directed at Frank Miller's writing, specifically his non-traditional interpretation of the main character. In the series to date, Batman is consistently displayed as violent, cruel and almost childish at times, excited by his own <b>sadism</b> towards criminals, musing over the injuries he inflicts and disarray that follows. Infamous examples of this include his verbal and physical abuse of Dick Grayson {{in an attempt to}} prevent him from grieving over his parents' deaths, and the action of throwing a Molotov cocktail during a fight.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{research}} has engaged three further directions – the speculation {{that at least}} some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming <b>sadism</b> is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E
25|$|Most of the synagogues in Frankfurt were {{destroyed}} by the Nazis on Kristallnacht in late 1938, deportation of the Jewish residents to their deaths in the Nazi concentration camps quickening in pace after the event. Their property and valuables were stolen by the Gestapo before deportation, and they were subjected to extreme violence and <b>sadism</b> during transport to the train stations for the cattle wagons which carried them east. Most later deportees (after the war began in 1939) ended up in new ghettoes established by the Nazis such as the Warsaw Ghetto and the Lodz ghetto, before their final transportation and murder in camps such as Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka.|$|E
25|$|The third Steel Angel {{built on}} the design by Dr. Ayanakouji, she was {{activated}} by the Academy to destroy Kurumi. She is very strong due to being installed with two Angel Hearts instead of one, however this also means she is exempted from following the orders of Dr. Walski, her creator. Karinka is infamous for kidnapping and nearly killing Saki. She is very temperamental, devious, and has occasionally shown traits of <b>sadism.</b> She later joins Nakahito and the group, originally to figure out Kurumi's power, but she eventually develops a crush on Nakahito. It was thanks to Nakahito that Karinka became friendly. Like her elder sisters, she does not care if Nakahito sees her naked.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{focuses on}} the title character, a {{spinster}} librarian. Soon {{after the death of}} her father while on vacation in Rome, Martha meets a wealthy civil engineer who sweeps her off her feet. They encounter again at a wedding in her hometown of Constance and marry. However their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his <b>sadism</b> and for Martha to endure her masochism. Her husband shows his desire for her violently leaving marks on her body. He obsessively controls her life, her diet, her taste in music and her interest until she is confined to their house. Martha's initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband push her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The Eliminators {{debuted in}} the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling {{promotion}} at Gangstas Paradise in September 1995. They were initially {{brought in to}} job to the Steiner Brothers but after {{it became apparent that}} Steiners were leaving ECW, the Eliminators were booked to win their debut match, a six-man tag team match, which pitted Eliminators with Jason against Taz and Steiner Brothers. ECW promoter Paul Heyman quickly abandoned plans to give them a <b>sadism</b> and masochism character and instead booked them as an unstoppable force in the ECW tag team division. They were managed by Jason. The Eliminators won the ECW Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 1996 and 1997, feuding with teams such as the Dudley Boyz, The Gangstas, The Pitbulls, Sabu and Rob Van Dam and the Steiner Brothers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{agreed on}} by some psychologists that {{experiences}} during early sexual development {{can have a}} profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for <b>sadism.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many and varied {{references}} to the Marquis de Sade in popular culture, including fictional works and biographies. The eponym of the psychological and subcultural term , his name is used variously to evoke sexual violence, licentiousness, and freedom of speech. In modern culture his works are simultaneously viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica. Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, which caused him to become imprisoned. He thus {{became a symbol of}} the artist's struggle with the censor. Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of <b>sadism.</b> Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by artists and intellectuals because they espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism.|$|E
25|$|Sade's {{fiction has}} been tagged under many {{different}} titles, including pornography, Gothic, and baroque. Sade’s most famous books are often classified not as Gothic but as libertine novels, and include the novels Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue; Juliette; The 120 Days of Sodom; and Philosophy in the Bedroom. These works challenge traditional perceptions of sexuality, religion, law, age, and gender. His opinions on sexual violence, <b>sadism,</b> and pedophilia stunned even those contemporaries of Sade who were quite {{familiar with the}} dark themes of the Gothic novel during its popularity in the late 18th century. Suffering is the primary rule, as in these novels one must often decide between sympathizing with the torturer or the victim. While these works focus on {{the dark side of}} human nature, the magic and phantasmagoria that dominates the Gothic is noticeably absent and is the primary reason these works are not considered to fit the genre.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of Bonin's defense attorneys, William Charvet and Tracy Stewart, was {{to challenge the}} credibility of numerous prosecution witnesses, and to suggest that extremely significant mitigating factors as to {{the root causes of}} Bonin's behavior lay in the extensive physical, sexual, and emotional abuse he had endured throughout his childhood and adolescence. To support this contention, Bonin's defense attorneys summoned an expert on the developmental effects of violence and abuse on children named Dr. David Foster, to testify as to the conclusions of his psychological examinations upon Bonin. Dr. Foster opined that Bonin had, as a result of repeated abandonment, not received the nurturing, protection, and behavioral feedback as a child necessary for sufficient psychological development. This had been so consistent and prevalent, Foster stated, that Bonin held a confusion as to the differences between violence and love. In a direct rebuttal, the prosecution summoned a forensic psychiatrist and expert in both impulse disorders and sexual <b>sadism</b> named Dr. Park Dietz, who testified that the overall pattern of Bonin's behavior was inconsistent with an inability to control his impulses. Dr. Dietz further testified as to Bonin's actions being reflective of planning as opposed to impulsive behavior. In summary, Dr. Dietz concluded that Bonin was a sexual sadist, and that although Bonin suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, neither of these conditions had impaired his ability to control his actions.|$|E
