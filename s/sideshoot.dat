5000|$|The chief {{benefit of}} Treelucerne {{is its ability}} to {{increase}} soil productivity roughly 5 times over 5 years and up to 10 times over 10 years, in deep well drained soils mainly limited in Nitrogen such as those found in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa. The 15-28% Tree Lucerne plant protein is converted into other forms of protein such as eggs, milk, white meat (chicken) and red meat (ruminants and cattle). This is mainly done by combining the need for land demarcation (hedgerows and windbreaks) with the ability to produce [...] "high up in the air" [...] (vertical expansion) due to the tree like vertical growth of the Treelucerne hedgerow of 6-10 meters high to where there is available space horisontally. The side of the Hedgerow is then harvested by hand until it forms a plat surface, using a machete for trimming, often standing on step ladders. The 6 meter high Tree Lucerne hedgerows (typically 1-3 meters wide) yield the same nutritional value as normal Alfalfa (which is only 50 cm high). The lack of space for horizontal sideway expansion close to the ground force such land limited farmers to expand vertically, going up in the air, in order to find more space. This [...] "tree lucerne" [...] approach allows them to achieve multiple production benefits and a 5-10 time production increase, over time, due to Nitrogen Fixation, Soil Improvement and Terra Preta bio-char amendments and the physical tree like structure of Tree Lucerne (growing up, and expanding sideways, high up in the air, where there is space for sideway lateral branches, photosynthesis and <b>sideshoot</b> development).|$|E
40|$|Classical {{biological}} control (biocontrol) of invasive plants involves the deliberate introduction of biocontrol agents, termed natural enemies, such as insects, mites and pathogens, {{from the country}} of origin into the invaded country to control an invasive alien plant (weed) infestation. This thesis evaluates the biocontrol of crofton weed, Ageratina adenophora, in South Africa, with a stem gall fly, Procecidochares utilis, and a leaf-spot pathogen, Passalora ageratinae. The issues of multiple biocontrol agents, pathogen-insect interactions, the assessment of agent efficacy and post-release evaluations in biocontrol are addressed using crofton weed biocontrol as a case study. Laboratory trials showed an additive interaction between the fly and pathogen on crofton weed control. The fly inhibited vertical stem growth, with the gall acting as a nutrient sink, but crofton weed compensated with increased <b>sideshoot</b> growth. The pathogen inhibited <b>sideshoot</b> (vegetative reproduction) growth. Field trials showed an equivalent interaction between the two biocontrol agents. The pathogen inhibited <b>sideshoot</b> growth, however the fly did not inhibit stem height but the galled stems had less biomass allocated to bare stems, than sideshoots or live leaves, indicating weakened stems. Growth of crofton weed stems was slower in the field than the laboratory, therefore {{the effect of the}} biocontrol agents on the vegetative growth of crofton weed may be different in the laboratory, or field trials may need to run for a longer period to see an effect of the biocontrol agents. The fly reduced the reproductive output of crofton weed by 53. 8...|$|E

50|$|The tree has {{not been}} an {{unqualified}} success. In the elm trials conducted by the University of Minnesota, 'New Horizon' was found to need relatively high levels of maintenance, largely owing to its predilection for co-dominant leaders and heavy side branches. In the Netherlands, removal of <b>sideshoots</b> from the lower trunk was found to be necessary twice a year. In trials in eastern Arizona http://www.for.nau.edu/cms/content/view/512/706/ it often exhibited > 25% crown dieback over winter and a very high level of leaf scorch in summer. The tree is currently being evaluated in the National Elm Trial http://treehealth.agsci.colostate.edu/research/nationalelmtrial/NET_Cultivars.htm coordinated by Colorado State University.|$|R
40|$|Streets are {{important}} component of cities since they provide the best direct impression of the city. Therefore street scenes {{are important}} aspect in 3 D modeling. Fast 3 D City Modeling from a street level can also be quite important for emergency response by providing realistic, updated, accurate information about accessibility to and from affected areas. This paper presents a 3 D reconstruction approach for rapid 3 D visualization from street level, {{which is based on}} a combination of vehicle-based image sequence and 2 D vector map. The approach consists of two general steps: the rapid reconstruction of facade along the street based on <b>sideshooting</b> vehicle-based image sequence and 2 D map, and road texture recovery using. The algorithms presented are verified by experiments on real data set. 1...|$|R
5000|$|... That {{the growth}} of Karvi (Sirobilanthes callosus) in many places is very heavy and is a direct check on natural regeneration. To {{get rid of this}} weed is difficult, though {{probably}} not impossible. In the Jaunsar Division areas were successfully treated in 1906 by cutting S. Wallichi when the flowers were fully out and the fruit had begun to form, but was not actually ripe. The Strobilanthes callosus flowers every seventh or eight year in Uttara Kannada and then dies down, so that, at the period of flowering, it might be treated in a similar way with advantage. It should be borne in mind that cutting off the heads of Karvi when it first com- mences to flower is useless, as it then puts out <b>sideshoots</b> which flower later it can therefore only be treated when the flowers begin to fall. The time of flowering is given as September and October....Karvi is the difficulty here, with care it should be burnt directly after flowering. Seed-lings will suffer relatively little by burning as they have only appeared in the patches where Karvi is absent. WORKING PLAN REPORT UC-NRLF ANKOLA HIGH FOREST BLOCKS XXIV & XXV BY E. S.
