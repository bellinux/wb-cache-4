2500|$|A second {{argument}} is {{summed up by}} Alford's statement [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ever regard the to of the infinitive as inseparable from its verb." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{correspondent}} {{states as}} his own usage, and defends, the insertion of an adverb between {{the sign of the}} infinitive mood and the verb. He gives as an instance, [...] "to scientifically illustrate". But surely this is a practice entirely unknown to English speakers and writers. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ever regard the to of the infinitive as inseparable from its verb. And, when we have already a choice between two forms of expression, [...] "scientifically to illustrate" [...] and [...] "to illustrate scientifically", there seems no good reason for flying in the face of common usage.|$|E
2500|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are {{concerned}} {{in this case}} not with [...] "the complexity of the tax laws," [...] ante, at 200, but with the income tax law in its most elementary and basic aspect: Is a wage earner a taxpayer and are wages income? [...] t is incomprehensible to me how, in this day, more than 70 years after the institution of our present federal income tax system {{with the passage of}} the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, any taxpayer of competent mentality can assert as his defense to charges of statutory willfulness the proposition that the wage he receives for his labor is not income, irrespective of a cult that says otherwise and advises the gullible to resist income tax collections. One might note in passing that this particular taxpayer, after all, was a licensed pilot for one of our major commercial airlines; he presumably was a person of at least minimum intellectual competence.|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R

[...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
2500|$|The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and American philanthropist Cleveland Dodge, head of {{the board}} of Robert College, wrote to Wilson asking him not to declare war on Bulgaria, saying that it would have no effect on the war, but would harm the work of American missionaries, {{educational}} institutions, and American citizens in Bulgaria and Turkey. Wilson agreed to reconsider his proposal. [...] In his final message to Congress delivered on December 4, Wilson called for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but said, [...] "The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They too, are tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our proposed actions. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others." [...] After holding hearings on the subject, Congress accepted Wilson's argument and declared war on Austria-Hungary, but not on Bulgaria or Turkey.|$|E

6000|$|... "Undoubtedly I do," [...] replied Jessie, with decision. [...] "The {{whole affair}} is mysterious--ridiculously so. In truth it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are {{surrounded}} by mystery." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> online {{copyright}} infringement is {{a legitimate}} problem, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when {{what you really need}} is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet." ...|$|R
