40|$|Abstract approved: We {{discuss a}} {{relativistic}} transport theory of condensed matter {{based on a}} microscopic system containing bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom interacting via 3 and 4 -point interactions. We use the Dyson hierarchy {{as a solution to}} the underlying field theory and truncate this hierarchy by parametrizing the 2 -particle-irreducible kernels of the 4 - and 5 -point vertex functions. We then perform a complete crossing-symmetric reduction of the 2 -particle intermediate states of the theory. We obtain a reduction hierarchy and show how to explore the quality of our truncation scheme using this reduction hierarchy. Finally we discuss the problem of regularization of the theory in the case of hadronic matter by either putting form factors directly in the action or by using dispersion relations to introduce causal form factors into <b>singular</b> <b>diagrams...</b>|$|R

We prove that the resulting Laurent polynomial in indeterminate A decomposes non-trivially into two components with respect to powers of A modulo four, and that both components are invariants under the Reidemeister-type moves for virtual <b>singular</b> link <b>diagrams.</b> Comment: 20 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a two-dimensional Fermi liquid {{in the vicinity}} of a spin-density-wave transition to a phase with commensurate antiferromagnetic long-range order. We assume that near the transition, the Fermi surface is large and crosses the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary. We show that under these conditions, the self-energy corrections to the dynamical spin susceptibility, χ (q, ω), and to the quasiparticle spectral function function, A(k, ω), are divergent near the transition. We identify and sum the series of most <b>singular</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and obtain a solution for χ(q, ω) and an approximate solution for A(k, ω). We show that (i) A(k) at a given, small ω has an extra peak at k = k_F + π (`shadow band'), and (ii) the dispersion near the crossing points is much flatter than for free electrons. The relevance of these results to recent photoemission experiments in YBCO and Bi 2212 systems is discussed.

40|$|Two {{singular}} links are cobordant {{if one can}} {{be obtained}} from the other by singular link isotopy together with a combination of births or deaths of simple unknotted curves, and saddle point transformations.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} dynamical {{systems that}} have multiple time scales. The focus lies on systems with two fast variables and one slow variable. The twoparameter bifurcation structure of the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equation is analyzed in detail. A <b>singular</b> bifurcation <b>diagram</b> is constructed and invariant manifolds of the problem are computed. A boundary-value approach to compute slow manifolds of saddle-type is developed. Interactions of classical invariant manifolds and slow manifolds explain the exponentially small turning of a homoclinic bifurcation curve in parameter space. Mixed-mode oscillations and maximal canards are detected in the FHN equation. An asymptotic formula to ﬁnd maximal canards is proved {{which is based on}} the first Lyapunov coefficient at a singular Hopf bifurcation...|$|R

40|$|The FitzHugh-Nagumo {{equation}} {{has been}} investigated with {{a wide array of}} different methods in the last three decades. Recently a version of the equations with an applied current was analyzed by Champneys, Kirk, Knobloch, Oldeman and Sneyd [5] using numerical continuation methods. They obtained a complicated bifurcation diagram in parameter space featuring a C-shaped curve of homoclinic bifurcations and a U-shaped curve of Hopf bifurcations. We use techniques from multiple time-scale dynamics to understand the structures of this bifurcation diagram based on geometric singular perturbation analysis of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. Numerical and analytical techniques show that if the ratio of the time-scales in the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation tends to zero, then our singular limit analysis correctly represents the observed CU-structure. Geometric insight from the analysis can even be used to compute bifurcation curves which are inaccessible via continuation methods. The results of our analysis are summarized in a <b>singular</b> bifurcation <b>diagram...</b>|$|R

40|$|In his Critic of pure reason, Immanuel Kant {{notoriously}} claimed that, being grounded on {{the forms}} of sense intuition, arithmetical and geometrical propositions are both synthetic (i. e. informative) and a priori. Bernard Bolzano, followed in this by the logicist movement (from Gottlob Frege to Rudolf Carnap), answered that the generality and necessity of mathematical propositions and proofs can only be grounded on conceptual analysis. Even though, just like Frege, {{he is one of}} the fathers of formal logic, Charles Sanders Peirce provides some semiotic reasons to think that Kant was right: diagrams do convey general meanings and provide some knowledge which is necessary yet non-trivial. Unlike logical analysis, visual presentation of concepts in schemas or diagrams helps to explore concepts by stressing some of their “side” features in such a way that new knowledge is gained: « diagrams evolve what was involved » (CP 4 / 86). This is why, according to Kant’s notion of intuitive construction, mathematical inferences are not merely deductive but are inventive and ampliative. My talk aims at identifying some iconic virtues of diagrams which, according to Peirce, explain their epistemic productivity. A first one lies in the “formal” nature of icons, which allows them to express syntactic relations between descriptive (symbols) and demonstrative (indices) components of structured information. On this respect, even algebraic and ideographic expressions are icons exhibiting a general form – a “rheme” – in which places for indices are filled with variables “x” and “y” meaning “any individual”. For this reason, even though they are <b>singular,</b> <b>diagrams</b> are “abstractions” in the sense that they represent relations rather than their terms. Only with this in prospect can a second, and more studied, feature of diagrams matter, namely their two-dimensionality, which helps to exhibit complex relations that cannot be seen on linear linguistic expressions. Finally, a third feature of diagrams lies in their imaginary rather than referential character. Icons connote without denoting, and therefore they can be informational without this information being limited to singular individuals. Furthermore, this non referential character of icons is what makes them open to virtual exploratory manipulations that allow to consider and investigate possibilities which in turn inform us on not obvious properties of the presently visible configuration.

40|$|Using {{functional}} renormalization group methods, {{we study}} an effective low-energy model describing the Ising-nematic quantum critical point in two-dimensional metals. We treat both gapless fermionic and bosonic {{degrees of freedom}} on equal footing and explicitly calculate the momentum and frequency dependent effective interaction between the fermions mediated by the bosonic fluctuations. Following earlier work by S. -S. Lee for a one-patch model, Metlitski and Sachdev [Phys. Rev. B 82, 075127] recently found within a field-theoretical approach that certain three-loop diagrams strongly modify the one-loop results, and that the conventional 1 /N expansion breaks down in this problem. We show that the <b>singular</b> three-loop <b>diagrams</b> considered by Metlitski and Sachdev are included in a rather simple truncation of the functional renormalization group flow equations for this model involving only irreducible vertices with two and three external legs. Our approximate solution of these flow equations explicitly yields the vertex corrections of this problem and allows us to calculate the anomalous dimension η_ψ of the fermion field.

40|$|We {{review a}} {{systematic}} many-body method capable of describing Fermi liquid and Non-Fermi liquid behavior of quantum impurity models at low temperatures {{on the same}} footing. The crossover to the high temperature local moment regime is covered as well. The approach makes use of a pseudo-particle representation of the impurity Hilbert space {{in the limit of}} infinite Coulomb repulsion U as well as for finite U. Approximations are derived from a generating Luttinger-Ward functional, in terms of renormalized perturbation theory in the hybridization V. Within a "conserving T-matrix approximation" (CTMA), including all two-particle vertex functions, an infinite series of leading infrared <b>singular</b> skeleton <b>diagrams</b> is included. The local constraint is strictly enforced. Applied to the SU(N) × SU(M) multichannel Anderson model the method allows to recover the Fermi liquid behavior of the single channel case, as well as the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the multi-channel case. The results are compared with the "non-crossing approximation" (NCA) and with data obtained by the numerical renormalization group and the Bethe ansatz. The generalization of the method to the case of finite on-site repulsion U is presented in a systematical way and solved on the level of a generalized NCA, fully symmetric with respect to all virtual excitations of the model.

PRELUDE It is well-known that under the evolution of any scalar (uniform) parabolic equation of the form (1) ut = f(x,u,ux,uxx), the graphs of two solutions u 1 (x,t) and u 2 (x,t) evolve in such a way that the number of intersections of the graphs does not increase in time. This principle, known in various circles as “lap number ” techniques, entwines the geometry of the graphs (uxx is a curvature term), the topology of the solutions (the intersection number is a local linking number), and the local dynamics of the PDE. This is a valuable approach for understanding local dynamics for a wide variety of flows exhibiting parabolic behavior with both classical [52] and contemporary [6, 19, 39] implications. This paper is an extension of this local technique to a global technique. One such well-established globaliziation first appears in the work of Angenent on curve-shortening [5]: evolving closed curves on a surface by curve shortenin...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{fundamental}} criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring {{at least a}} partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place. The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the [...] "same" [...] entity or [...] "property", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the [...] "logical subject" [...] of the statement. The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the [...] "referent". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the [...] "referent"—perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion {{is that we are}} premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular [...] "objects" [...] in the first place, since we only need to behave as if they are already logically <b>singular.</b> The <b>diagram</b> {{at the beginning of this}} entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw [...] "an" [...] object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually to believe in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by mutually imagining that 'it' is singular. A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action. Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct representations of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character. Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time—which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory. This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as social constructivism.|$|R
