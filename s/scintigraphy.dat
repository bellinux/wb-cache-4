25|$|DMSA <b>scintigraphy</b> is {{used for}} the {{evaluation}} of the paranchymal damage, which is seen as cortical scars. After the first febrile UTI, the diagnostic role of an initial <b>scintigraphy</b> for detecting the damage before the VCUG was investigated and it was suggested that VCUG can be omitted in children who has no cortical scars and urinary tract dilatation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scintigraphy</b> of {{the lungs}} may detect {{moderate}} to severe alterations in the perfusion and possibly ventilation of the dorso-caudal lung. The use of radio-labelled red blood cells and <b>scintigraphy</b> to localise and or quantify hemorrhage is not useful due to general sequestration of labeled RBC by the lung, {{even in the absence}} of hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|A gamma camera (Î³-camera), {{also called}} a {{scintillation}} camera or Anger camera, is a device used to image gamma radiation emitting radioisotopes, a technique known as <b>scintigraphy.</b> The applications of <b>scintigraphy</b> include early drug development and nuclear medical imaging to view and analyse {{images of the}} human body or the distribution of medically injected, inhaled, or ingested radionuclides emitting gamma rays.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scintigraphy</b> (bone scan) {{can help}} to {{differentiate}} between suspensory origin desmitis and bone spavin.|$|E
25|$|Detection of any metastases of thyroid cancer can be {{performed}} with a full body <b>scintigraphy</b> using iodine-131.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scintigraphy</b> ("scint") {{is the use}} of gamma {{cameras to}} capture emitted {{radiation}} from internal radioisotopes to create two-dimensional images.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{abnormalities}} of the kidneys are identified with imaging tests. These may include Medical ultrasonography/ultrasound, {{computed axial tomography}} (CT), <b>scintigraphy</b> (nuclear medicine), angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).|$|E
25|$|<b>Scintigraphy</b> ("scint") {{is a form}} of {{diagnostic}} test wherein radioisotopes are taken internally, for example intravenously or orally. Then, gamma cameras capture and form two-dimensional images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Rash {{and taste}} disturbances, {{infrequent}} with most ACE inhibitors, are {{more prevalent in}} captopril, and this is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of captopril in clinical setting, although it is still used in <b>scintigraphy</b> of the kidney.|$|E
25|$|A typical nuclear {{medicine}} study involves administration of a radionuclide {{into the body}} by intravenous injection in liquid or aggregate form, ingestion while combined with food, inhalation as a gas or aerosol, or rarely, injection of a radionuclide that has undergone micro-encapsulation. Some studies require the labeling of a patient's own blood cells with a radionuclide (leukocyte <b>scintigraphy</b> and red blood cell <b>scintigraphy).</b> Most diagnostic radionuclides emit gamma rays, while the cell-damaging properties of beta particles are used in therapeutic applications. Refined radionuclides for use in {{nuclear medicine}} are derived from fission or fusion processes in nuclear reactors, which produce radionuclides with longer half-lives, or cyclotrons, which produce radionuclides with shorter half-lives, or take advantage of natural decay processes in dedicated generators, i.e. molybdenum/technetium or strontium/rubidium.|$|E
25|$|A CT {{angiography}} {{is useful}} for determining {{the exact location of}} the bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract. Nuclear <b>scintigraphy</b> is a sensitive test for detecting occult gastrointestinal bleeding when direct imaging with upper and lower endoscopies are negative. Direct angiography allows for embolization of a bleeding source, but requires a bleeding rate faster than 1mL/minute.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, technetium-99m <b>scintigraphy</b> {{has been}} {{combined}} with CT coregistration technology to produce SPECT/CT scans. These employ the same radioligands {{and have the}} same uses as SPECT scanning, but are able to provide even finer 3-D localization of high-uptake tissues, in cases where finer resolution is needed. An example is the sestamibi parathyroid scan which is performed using the Tc-99m radioligand sestamibi, and {{can be done in}} either SPECT or SPECT/CT machines.|$|E
25|$|More {{advanced}} imaging techniques {{can be used}} if the clinical picture is unclear; the exact role of different imaging modalities remains uncertain. Some studies have demonstrated findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) that can differentiate between septic arthritis and transient synovitis (for example, signal intensity of adjacent bone marrow). Skeletal <b>scintigraphy</b> can be entirely normal in transient synovitis, and scintigraphic findings do not distinguish transient synovitis from other joint conditions in children. CT scanning does not appear helpful.|$|E
25|$|Also, a {{radiological}} {{procedure is}} {{available as a}} reliable and accurate test for SS. A contrast agent is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the vestibule of the mouth opposite {{the neck of the}} upper second molar tooth. Histopathology studies should show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary <b>scintigraphy,</b> and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scintigraphy,</b> plain radiographs, and {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) may all be useful diagnostically. Patchy osteoporosis (post-traumatic osteoporosis), which {{may be due to}} disuse of the affected extremity, can be detected through X-ray imagery as early as two weeks after the onset of CRPS. A bone scan of the affected limb may detect these changes even sooner and can almost confirm the disease. Bone densitometry {{can also be used to}} detect changes in bone mineral density. It can also be used to monitor the results of treatment since bone densitometry parameters improve with treatment.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{of the hip}} {{may suggest}} and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually {{demonstrate}} a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI {{may be useful in}} making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed 6 weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone <b>scintigraphy</b> and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97 to 99% against 88 to 93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral epiphysis (the developing femoral head).|$|E
25|$|Thyroid iodine uptake {{blockade}} with {{potassium iodide}} {{is used in}} nuclear medicine <b>scintigraphy</b> and therapy with some radioiodinated compounds that are not targeted to the thyroid, such as iobenguane (MIBG), {{which is used to}} image or treat neural tissue tumors, or iodinated fibrinogen, which is used in fibrinogen scans to investigate clotting. These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. However, since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thyroid for iodide.|$|E
25|$|When any {{of these}} tests is positive, CT {{scanning}} of the adrenal gland and MRI of the pituitary gland are performed to detect the presence of any adrenal or pituitary adenomas or incidentalomas (the incidental discovery of harmless lesions). <b>Scintigraphy</b> of the adrenal gland with iodocholesterol scan is occasionally necessary. Occasionally, determining the ACTH levels in various veins in the body by venous catheterization, working towards the pituitary (petrosal sinus sampling) is necessary. In many cases, the tumors causing Cushing's disease are less than 2mm in size and difficult to detect using MRI or CT imaging. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing's disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, in {{all forms}} of digital X-ray imaging (radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT) the {{conversion}} of X-ray energy into visible light {{can be achieved by}} the same types of electronic sensors, such as flat panel detectors, which convert the X-ray energy into electrical signals, small bursts of current that convey information that a computer can analyze, store, and output as images. As fluorescence is a special case of luminescence, digital X-ray imaging is conceptually similar to digital gamma ray imaging (<b>scintigraphy,</b> SPECT, and PET) in that in both of these imaging mode families, the information conveyed by the variable attenuation of invisible electromagnetic radiation as it passes through tissues with various radiodensities is converted by an electronic sensor into an electric signal that is processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image.|$|E
500|$|A {{thallium}} {{stress test}} {{is a form}} of <b>scintigraphy,</b> where the amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal Na+/K+ ion exchange pumps. The Tl+ cation binds the K+ pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or dipyridamole induces widening (vasodilation) of normal coronary arteries. This produces coronary steal from areas where arteries are maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain [...] "cold". Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas which will benefit from myocardial revascularization. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic coronary artery disease.|$|E
500|$|Whenever {{a racing}} {{accident}} severely injures a well-known horse, {{such as the}} major leg fractures {{that led to the}} euthanization of 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro, or 2008 Kentucky Derby runner-up Eight Belles, animal rights groups have denounced the Thoroughbred racing industry. On the other hand, advocates of racing argue that without horse racing, far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses. [...] Although horse racing is hazardous, veterinary science has advanced. Previously hopeless cases can now be treated, and earlier detection through advanced imaging techniques like <b>scintigraphy</b> can keep at-risk horses off the track.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} imaging techniques {{are used to}} demonstrate PSS. Ultrasonography is a rapid, convenient, non-invasive, and accurate method for diagnosis of PSS. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of congenital PSS depends on finding an anomalous vessel either in the liver or just caudal to the liver in the dorsal abdomen, usually draining into the caudal vena cava. Ultrasonography {{can also be used}} to estimate hepatic volume and vascularity, and to identify related lesions affecting other abdominal structures, such as urinary calculi. Computed tomography (CT) may be considered when ultrasound expertise is lacking or ultrasonography is considered sub-optimal (e.g. because of the conformation of the patient). Control of respiration and careful timing of CT acquisition after contrast injection is necessary for optimal depiction of PSS. Rectal portal <b>scintigraphy</b> using 99mtechnetium pertechnetate, a technique of imaging involving detection of gamma rays emitted by radionuclides absorbed through the rectum and into the bloodstream, demonstrates the blood vessel bypassing the liver. [...] In certain institutions, <b>scintigraphy</b> is the preferred diagnostic technique, but this leaves the patient radioactive for 24h, which may be inconvenient depending on nursing needs. Portal venography is the definitive method for demonstrating PSS, but is invasive, hence it is best reserved for animals with a known shunt or those considered highly likely to have a shunt that was not detectable by ultrasonography.|$|E
2500|$|A {{veterinarian}} or experienced horse owner can palpate {{the back}} of a horse to pinpoint sources of pain and from there assess the most likely cause. [...] Radiographs (X-Rays) can be used to diagnose potential problems with cracked vertebrae, some forms of arthritis, impinging dorsal spinous processes (kissing spines), and other skeletal problems, although with large, heavily muscled animals this diagnostic modality is limited. [...] Certain types of soft tissue injury can be assessed with other modern diagnostic imaging techniques, such as ultrasound. In addition, <b>Scintigraphy</b> is often very useful in localising either bony or soft tissue disorders.|$|E
2500|$|A ventilation/perfusion scan (or V/Q scan or lung <b>scintigraphy)</b> {{shows that}} {{some areas of}} the lung are being {{ventilated}} but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot). This type of examination is as accurate as multislice CT, but is less used, due to the greater availability of CT technology. [...] It is particularly useful in people who have an allergy to iodinated contrast, impaired renal function, or are pregnant (due to its lower radiation exposure as compared to CT). The test can be performed with planar two-dimensional imaging, or single photon emission tomography (SPECT) which enables three-dimensional imaging. Hybrid devices combining SPECT and CT (SPECT/CT) further enable anatomic characterization of any abnormality.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, X-ray {{images as}} well as MRT, ultrasound, PET and <b>scintigraphy</b> images are {{protected}} by (copyright-like) related rights or neighbouring rights. This protection does not require creativity (as would be necessary for regular copyright protection) and lasts only for 50 years after image creation, if not published within 50 years, or for 50 {{years after the first}} legitimate publication. The letter of the law grants this right to the [...] "Lichtbildner", i.e. the person who created the image. The literature seems to uniformly consider the medical doctor, dentist or veterinary physician as the rights holder, which may result from the circumstance that in Germany many x-rays are performed in ambulatory setting and that the doctor prescribes the settings for the individual imaging.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} encompasses both {{diagnostic imaging}} {{and treatment of}} disease, and may also {{be referred to as}} molecular medicine or molecular imaging & therapeutics. [...] Nuclear medicine uses certain properties of isotopes and the energetic particles emitted from radioactive material to diagnose or treat various pathology. Different from the typical concept of anatomic radiology, nuclear medicine enables assessment of physiology. This function-based approach to medical evaluation has useful applications in most subspecialties, notably oncology, neurology, and cardiology. Gamma cameras and PET scanners are used in e.g. <b>scintigraphy,</b> SPECT and PET to detect regions of biologic activity that may be associated with disease. Relatively short lived isotope, such as 99mTc is administered to the patient. Isotopes are often preferentially absorbed by biologically active tissue in the body, and can be used to identify tumors or fracture points in bone. Images are acquired after collimated photons are detected by a crystal that gives off a light signal, which is in turn amplified and converted into count data.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scintigraphy</b> ("scint", Latin scintilla, spark) is a {{diagnostic}} test in nuclear medicine, where radioisotopes attached to drugs that travel {{to a specific}} organ or tissue (radiopharmaceuticals) are taken internally and the emitted gamma radiation is captured by external detectors (gamma cameras) to form two-dimensional images in a similar process to the capture of x-ray images. In contrast, SPECT and positron emission tomography (PET) form 3-dimensional images, and are therefore classified as separate techniques to <b>scintigraphy,</b> although they also use gamma cameras to detect internal radiation. <b>Scintigraphy</b> is unlike {{a diagnostic}} X-ray where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image.|$|E
