The Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Mars-GRAM) is based on parameterizations to approximate, as realistically as possible, the temperature, pressure, density and winds of the Martian atmosphere, and their latitudinal, longitudinal, diurnal, seasonal and altitude variation, from the surface through thermospherfc altitudes. Parameterizations are also included for the effects of global-scale dust storms on the variations of the thermodynamic and wind properties of the Martian atmos-phere. Mars-GRAM is written in Fortran 77, and is designed to run on an IBM-PC or compatible microcomputer. With the planned addition of radiation budget parameterizations, Mars-GRAM will have a variety of possible scientific applications as a "poor man's global circulation model " for the atmosphere of Mars. Among these are: (1) an ability to provide realistic, geographically and seasonally-dependent backgrounds of temperature and wind for <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> <b>tides</b> and atmospheric propagation of other wave disturbances (e. g. gravity-waves, mountain lee waves, etc.); (2) similar background fields of temperature and pressure for other environmentally varying physical processes (e. g. cloud nucleation process models, temperature-dependent chemical rate models, etc.); (3) <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> surface radiation budget, boundary layer dynamics, and synoptic and global-scale dynamics; and (4) investigations of the surface-atmosphere flux of dust and the zonal and meridional transport of dust during local-scale and global-scale dust storms.

He played a curious indirect role in the develop-ment of the theory of ocean circulation; many times over. The title of my talk might well be called the Goldsbrough variations. Goldsbrough was seven years younger than the much more productive and recognized Swedish oceanographer, V. Walfrid Ekman. In the years before the First World War, when Ekman and the Norwegian Vilhelm Bjerknes were laying the groundwork for dynamical oceanography, Ekman with his wind-driven spiral and determination of the equation of state of sea-water, Bjerknes with his careful formulation of a practical method of dynamic current determination at sea, Goldsbrough was teaching secondary school students, and published two little <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> <b>tides</b> in simple basins. It was not until 1919, at the age of 38, that Goldsbrough was able to enter an academic career at the University of Durham as a Lecturer in Mathematics. By this time Ekman was grappling with the problem of coupling his theory of the surface wind-drift to a geostrophic current below, exploring the influence of coastlines, bottom topography, and the role of another spiral frictional layer at the bottom. Ekman published the results of these important labors in 1923, and he acknowledged that the model considered still fell far short of a theory of the circulation in a...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> {{resonant}} internal <b>tide</b> motion. One common linear inviscid model represents the motion {{in terms of}} a two dimensional stream function satisfying a standard second order hyperbolic equation. This model is examined in detail and it is shown that existing solution techniques can be extended and unified with the classical theory of a single complex variable. This results in a number of new theoretical devices for the solution of the model, including c-conformal mapping - a mapping procedure that shares many of the traits of classical conformal mapping, and c-analytic continuation - a procedure for extending the domain of a solution analogous to standard analytic continuation. These techniques are applied to a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the model on closed basins. A crucial distinction relating to the geometry of the corners of the basin is noted, and the importance of energy sources and sinks is recognized. The analysis is found both to support the conjectures of other researchers that the existence of resonant motion may be predicted through an analysis of the characteristic coordinates of the inviscid model, and to demonstrate that the inviscid model is an inadequate vehicle for the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>tides</b> on basin topographies. A viscous form of the linear model is then discussed and a number of numerical solution techniques suitable for basin topographies are devised. The first of these is a straightforward application of standard collocation methods, but is found to be computationally expensive. A simpler, more efficient family of techniques based on the theory of c-analytic continuation is then derived. These methods are seen to be a natural extension of a Fourier series technique successfully employed by other authors. The predictions of the linear models are then compared with the results of laboratory experiments. Resonance effects are seen {{to play a major role}} in determining the motion of the fluid. However, the strongly resonant motions predicted by the linear models are not observed, and, in general, the agreement between model and data is poor. This is attributed to both the sensitivity of the problem and the difficulty associated with modelling the external forcing. The large amplitude strongly resonant motions predicted by the linear models prompt a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> nonlinear internal <b>tide</b> dynamics. A nonlinear model based on the Navier Stokes equations is considered, and numerical solutions are obtained via finite differences. These solutions show that for strongly resonant motion the "Rigid Lid" approximation commonly imposed at the free surface is inadequate and must be replaced with a more accurate nonlinear boundary condition...|$|R
