25|$|<b>Sciarid</b> flies {{are common}} pests of {{mushroom}} houses and of plants grown in protected culture, for example herbs, where the warm and moist conditions favour their rapid development. In commercial mushroom houses, <b>sciarid</b> fly larvae tunnel into the stalks of the mushrooms, and feeding damage can sever developing mycelium, causing mushrooms to become brown and leathery. Their faeces may also prevent the mycelium from colonising the casing layer, severely reducing yields. As a pest of plants, <b>sciarid</b> larvae {{feed on the}} root system.

A higher number of emergences occurred on substrates with higher number of <b>sciarids</b> larvae and on the substrate with soil mixed with coconut fiber. The predation capacity and behaviour of C. attenuata was studied in laboratory in relation to several species, including parasitoids and predators with {{an important role in}} protected crops.

5000|$|Fungus gnats in {{the family}} Sciaridae may be pests, but are {{typically}} harmless to healthy plants - and humans - but can inflict extensive damage to seedlings; their presence can indicate more serious problems. In houseplants, the presence of <b>sciarids</b> may indicate overwatering; they may be feeding on roots that have been immersed in water too long and are thus rotting, or the gnats may be attracted to fungus growing in saturated topsoil. Consequently, allowing the soil to dry may reduce their numbers. The pests are sometimes also managed by placing a layer of sandor indoor mulch {{on top of the}} soil around plants; by introducing Hypoaspis miles mites or applying the biological larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis (var. israelensis) to kill gnat larvae; by drenching the soil annually in an insecticidal soap. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with water and used to kill fungus gnat larvae in infected soil with a mixture of one part 3% hydrogen peroxide mixed with four parts water, then applied to the soil. [...] Adults can be trapped with yellow sticky traps made of yellow card stock or heavy paper coated in an adhesive since the adults are attracted to the color yellow.|$|R
40|$|Salivary glands {{were fixed}} in cold 1 per cent osmium tetroxide in veronal-acetate buffer {{containing}} sucrose and embedded in methacrylate mixture or Araldite. The salivary gland nuclei of <b>sciarids</b> show a continuous production of nucleoli, which remain multiple and not consolidated {{into a single}} structure. The earliest recognizable nucleoli, which we call "elementary nucleoli," are aggregations of a few paired 40 A fibrils and a few 150 A particles, at many points within chromosome bands. Further development consists of the detachment of the elementary nucleoli from their points of origin and their subsequent mutual coalescence. As a result, dense patches of nucleolar material are formed which become large nucleoli at the surface of chromosomes, either attached to the band or free. The fully formed nucleoli have a characteristic dual structure with a narrow dense periphery and a broader less dense internum. Fibrils and particles are present in both regions, and the difference in density reflects differences in the packing of the two structural elements. The duality in structure is lost in later stages. The nucleolar fibrils appear {{to be similar to}} the chromosomal fibrils. The 150 A particles in nucleoli, chromosomes, and nuclear sap seem identical. The significance of these observations is discussed for nucleologenesis in general...|$|R

40|$|Mushroom is {{considered}} a sensitive crop as it requires special care for contolling insect pests damages especially through phorid (Megaselia halterata) and <b>sciarid</b> (Lycoriella auripila) flies during March-November, creating cultivation problems and serious threat for mushroom industry in Pakistan, Sometime severe infestation of phorid and <b>sciarid</b> flies result into the total crop collapse. Thus, present study was planned (1) to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different insecticides (Trichlorphon, Malathion, Spinosad, Endosulfan, Deltamethrin, Spintoram, Imidacloprid, Diafenthuron and Permethrin) against these flies, (2) to evaluate the potential of six botanical (Neem nut. Neem leaves, Eucalyptus leaves, Nerium indicum leaves, Castor bean leaves and Tobacco leaves), (3) to determine the effectiveness of cultural/physical control (Light traps, Screening mesh, Hygiene and Temperature) and finally, (4) the integration of all these control measures in a compatible manners during three successive years of study. All the treatments were evaluated {{on the basis of}} reduction in adult of mushroom flies emergence (RAE), mushroom damage rate (MDR) in percentage and yield in three successive growing periods. Six insecticides viz., Trichlorphon, Malathion, Spinosad, Deltamethrin, Spintoram and Permethrin, out of nine, caused 77. 42 % to 90 % mortality of 3 rd instar larvae of phorid and <b>sciarid</b> fly under lab condition, while 73 % to 88 % in mushroom houses. Four plant extracts [Neem nut, Neem, Tobacco and Kanair (Nerium indicum) ] out of six caused 41 % to 72 % mortality of 3 rd instar larvae of phorid and <b>sciarid</b> fly under lab conditions, while 40 % to 68 % in mushroom houses. Pink colour flap light trap trapped maximum average mushroom flies per week (85. 50) followed by yellow (57. 00), blue (33. 95) and white (19. 45), respectively. Screening mesh and hygiene proved best reducing adult emergence up 51. 18 % and 45. 79 %, respectively. Integration of insecticides with plant extracts proved very effective against mushroom flies (phorid and <b>sciarid).</b> It controled the adult emergence about 90. 82 to 92. 44 % in mushroom house. In the same way, integration of chemical cultural and control controlled mushroom flies up to 91. 72 % and 93. 34 % in mushroom houses.

40|$|We {{studied the}} behavior, life cycle, and {{reproductive}} biology of the <b>sciarid</b> fly Scatopsciara cunicularius (Lengersdorf, 1943) under two constant temperatures. The <b>sciarid</b> was reared at 12. 3 ± 0. 6 °C and 22 ± 1. 7 °C on its host, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L. Our {{results show that}} the <b>sciarid</b> fly is able to complete its life cycle with liverwort tissue as its only source of food. The egg-laying potential of the insect ranged from 70 – 174 eggs per female (mean 110 ± 31 eggs). Reproduction was digenic, meaning that one female can produce both male and female progeny. The overall sex ratio did not depart from 1 : 1, although the progeny sex ratio was highly variable. The developmental period of S. cunicularius was considerably longer in the colder than the warmer temperature. Mean development time of the egg, larva, and pupal stages, and adult longevity in the warm regime was 4, 20, 4, and 5 d, whereas mean development time of each juvenile stage and adult longevity in the cold regime was 13, 95, 11, and 8 d, respectively. The results suggest that the phenology of S. cunicularius is temperature dependent. Scatopsciara cunicularius could constitute a promising agent for biological control of M. polymorpha...|$|E
40|$|Isolates {{from eight}} species of Agaricus were {{investigated}} in laboratory experiments for {{their effect on}} the development of the mushroom <b>sciarid</b> fly, Lycoriella ingenua (Dufour) (Diptera: Sciaridae), which is an important pest of the white mushroom Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach (Agaricaceae). The population levels of L. ingenua developing in compost inoculated with Agaricus mycelium varied with the Agaricus isolate used, with some isolates causing high levels of inhibition. The development of L. ingenua populations and the survival of larval instars were inversely proportional to the amount of Agaricus inoculum applied. There was also a negative relationship between L. ingenua survival and the extension rate of the Agaricus isolate in compost. The results suggest that inhibition of L. ingenua population development by Agaricus is linked to the rate at which compost is colonized by fungal mycelium. Therefore, on mushroom farms, <b>sciarid</b> fly control should focus on protection of the compost before it has become colonized by mycelium, as this is when it is most vulnerable to the pest...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring micromorphological {{investigations}} on Scots pine litter, several decomposition stages {{have been}} recognized on fallen pine needles, each being associated with the activity of animal and microbial organisms, both. To well-known fungal successions that have been so far described by mycologists we must add succession of animal groups such as nematodes, amoebae, enchytraeids, <b>sciarid</b> larvae, oribatid mites and earthworms. A bacterial development was observed in the L 2 layer, following penetration by microfauna (nematodes, amoebae). After that stage pine needles were actively tunnelled by enchytraeids, <b>sciarid</b> larvae and oribatid mites {{and at the same}} time were nibbled on by epigeic earthworms (L 2 and F 1 layers). When the fine root system of pine developed through accumulated old needles (F 1 layer), mycorrhizal fungi penetrated the needles and seemed to impede any further bacterial development.

In the laboratory, which was conducted at 25 degrees C at 60 - 80 % RH, with a 16 L : 8 D photoperiod, we examined the functional response of this species to three different pests, namely the <b>sciarid</b> fly (Bradysia sp.), the tobacco whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and the leaf miner Liriomyza trifolii. In the greenhouse, we studied the population dynamics of the predator and its prey on pepper and water melon crops grown in southern Spain. Adult hunter flies were found to exhibit a type I functional response to adult <b>sciarid</b> flies and whiteflies, but a type II response to adult leaf miners. The type II response {{was a result of}} the greater difficulty in capturing and handling leaf miners compared to the other two species. The dynamics of the predator-prey interaction in the greenhouse revealed that the predator specializes mainly on adult sciarids and that the presence of the other prey can be supplemental, but is never essential for survival of the predator; this, however, is crop-dependent. The results oil the dynamics of the predator-prey systems were obtained through a known population dynamics model with modifications...|$|E
40|$|Nucleoli, nuclear organelles {{in which}} ribosomal RNA is {{synthesized}} and processed, emerge from nucleolar organizers (NORs) located in distinct chromosomal regions. In polytene nuclei of dipterans, nucleoli of some species {{can be observed}} under light microscopy exhibiting distinctive morphology: Drosophila and chironomid species display well-formed nucleoli {{in contrast to the}} fragmented and dispersed nucleoli seen in <b>sciarid</b> flies. The available data show no apparent relationship between nucleolar morphology and location of NORs in Diptera. The regulation of rRNA transcription involves controlling both the transcription rate per gene as well as the proportion of rRNA genes adopting a proper chromatin structure for transcription, since active and inactive rRNA gene copies coexist in NORs. Transcription units organized in nucleosomes and those lacking canonical nucleosomes can be analyzed by the method termed psoralen gel retarding assay (PGRA), allowing inferences on the ratio of active to inactive rRNA gene copies. In this work, possible connections between chromosomal location of NORs and proportion of active rRNA genes were studied in Drosophila melanogaster, and in chironomid and <b>sciarid</b> species. The data suggested a link between location of NORs and proportion of active rRNA genes since the copy number showing nucleosomal organization predominates when NORs are located in the pericentric heterochromatin.

40|$|Fusarium Bosporus f. sp. cucumerinum is the fungal {{pathogen}} {{responsible for}} Fusarium vascular wilt of cucumber. The options for managing Fusarium wilt in greenhouse cucumbers {{are limited by}} our poor understanding of the modes of survival and dissemination of the pathogen. Aerial dissemination of the pathogen was investigated following {{the development of a}} highly specific and sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assay that reliably detected as few as 100 Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum genome copies in environmental matrices. Numbers of both macroconidia and microconidia were variable in greenhouse air samples at different times of day. A potential relationship between fluctuation in relative humidity and spore number was found. While this shows that the pathogen can be aerially disseminated, airborne spores were unable to infect wound stem sites. These results suggest that aerial inoculum propagates and disseminates the pathogen, but that infection is primarily through the root after aerial spores are deposited on the soil surface. Aerial dissemination was also found to occur through insect vectors. <b>Sciarid</b> and shore flies could carry between 1 × 102 and 1 × 106 pathogen genome copies/individual.

40|$|In <b>sciarid</b> flies, {{the control}} of sex {{determination}} and of the progeny sex ratio is exercised by the parental females, {{and is based on}} differential X-chromosome elimination in the initial stages of embryogenesis. In some species, the females produce unisexual progenies (monogenic females) while in others, the progenies consist of males and females (digenic females). The sex ratio of bisexual progenies is variable, and departs considerably from 1 : 1. Bradysia matogrossensis shows both monogenic and digenic reproduction. In a recently established laboratory strain of this species, 15 % of the females were digenic, 10 % produced only females, 13 % produced only males, and 62 % produced progenies with one predominant sex (33 % predominantly of female and 29 % predominantly male progenies). These progeny sex ratios were maintained in successive generations. Females from female-skewed progenies yielded female- and male-producing daughters in a 1 : 1 ratio. In contrast, daughters of females from male-skewed progenies produce bisexual or male-skewed progenies. The X-chromosome of B. matogrossensis shows no inversion or other gross aberration. These results suggest that {{the control of}} the progeny sex ratio (or differential X-chromosome elimination) involves more than one locus or, at least, more than one pair of alleles.
