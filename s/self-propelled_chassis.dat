40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} soil {{compaction}} by running bodies of mountain tandem-wheeled <b>self-propelled</b> <b>chassis</b> is developed. Proceeding {{from the soil}} rheological properties and parameters of adaptive mountain tandem-wheeled <b>self-propelled</b> <b>chassis</b> in the deformation distribution zone is defined functional dependency between soil average density and running parts of tandem-wheeled <b>self-propelled</b> <b>chassis.</b> Is developed the technique of calculation of all physical values that are stipulated due standard for assessment of running system's parameters impact on ground. Due these parameters is stated the comparison of experimental and serial <b>self-propelled</b> <b>chassis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many {{technological}} {{processes in}} the field of agricultural production mechanization, such as a grain crop, planting root-tuber fruits, fertilizing, spraying and dusting, pressing feed materials, harvesting of various cultures, etc. are performed by the machine-tractor units with variable mass of links or processed media and materials. In recent years, are also developing the systems of automatic control, adjusting and control of technological processes and working members in agriculture production. Is studied the dynamics of transition processes of mountain <b>self-propelled</b> <b>chassis</b> with variable mass at real change disconnect or joining masses that is most often used in the function of movement (m(t)  = ct) m(t)  = ct. Are derived the formulas of change of velocity of movement on displacement of unit and is defined the dependence of this velocity on the tractor and technological machine performance, with taking into account the gradual increase or removing of agricultural materials masses. According to the equation is possible to define a linear movement of machine-tractor unit. According to the obtained expressions we can define the basic operating parameters of machine-tractor unit with variable mass. The results of research would be applied at definition of characteristics of units, at development of new agricultural tractors...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} market economy {{it is highly}} {{important}} to implement new transport and energy-saving technologies into industrial enterprises and industrial objects’ workflow. And the main point here is employment of traction means which secure considerable economy in transport costs and, first and foremost, energy consumption. The issue of transport service of the rolling shop at a metallurgical enterprise is of high importance {{from the point of}} view of railway traction means utilization effectiveness, i. e. locomotives utilization within the process of shunting (which is carried out at railway tracks serving loading and unloading sites of the rolling shop). The article assesses operational indicators of locomotives’ performance by the time, power and adhesion weight within serving transport-and-handling complex of rolling shop at metallurgical enterprise. With this purpose transport technology of transport-and-handling complex of rolling shop is taken into consideration. In order to make the performance assessment of the locomotive fleet operation, algorithm of research has been developed. In accordance with this algorithm, operational parameters for TGM- 4 locomotives exploitation have been defined (the data is provided for locomotive operation during a shift). Adhesion weight and locomotive power calculations have been made for work and after-hours runs. The analysis shows the level of inefficiency of locomotives use. One of the main ways of saving these costs is substitution of high-powered locomotives with energy-saving traction means. This issue can be solved at the expense of traction means based on wheeled tractors or <b>self-propelled</b> <b>chassis</b> which can be used either on a road or on a railway track. In accordance with operational conditions, qualification of tractive effort and other parameters, the effectiveness of traction means utilization at railway- and auto-transportations significantly increase...|$|E

50|$|In early 1942, {{a request}} {{was made by}} the Army General Staff to mount a 128 mm gun on a <b>self-propelled</b> armored <b>chassis.</b> Firing tests of the 128 mm gun showed it to have a high {{percentage}} of hits; smaller caliber guns, such as the 88 mm and 105 mm, were also tested..|$|R
500|$|Although not {{a direct}} {{modification}} of the Panzer IV, some of its components, in conjunction with parts from the Panzer III, were utilized to make {{one of the most}} widely used <b>self-propelled</b> artillery <b>chassis</b> of the war—the Geschützwagen III/IV. This chassis was the basis of the Hummel artillery piece, of which 666 were built, and also the [...] gun armed Nashorn tank destroyer, with 473 manufactured. To resupply self-propelled howitzers in the field, 150 ammunition carriers were manufactured on the Geschützwagen III/IV chassis.|$|R

Under his leadership planetary rovers developed as robotic transport vehicles of space appropriation, and his group developed the first-ever planet research vehicles - «Lunokhods», Prop-M Rover (Apparatus of the Cross-Country Capability Estimate), apparatus for the jump movement at the moon of Mars - Phobos. Devices designed under his leadership also yielded data on physicomechanical properties of soil of the Moon and Venus.|$|R
50|$|Soviet {{engineers}} {{carried out}} some early experiments with tracked SPAAGs {{before and during}} World War II, including a modification of the T-70 light tank, resulting in the experimental T-90 SPAAG which was armed with two 12.7 mm DShKT heavy machine guns (the prototype was built in November 1942 by GAZ). The T-70 light tank would eventually be further developed into the SU-76 light <b>self-propelled</b> gun <b>chassis,</b> which in turn was to become the base for the ZSU-37 SPAAG. It was {{decided to use the}} chassis of the SU-76M in order to speed up and cheapen the production of the much needed tracked and armoured SPAAGs.|$|R

While some are <b>self-propelled</b> (integrated truck <b>chassis),</b> many are designed as trailers to be attached to a trailer hitch. These trailer hitches are common {{on the back of}} many cars and trucks, and RV trailers are commonly used for camping outings or road trips. In the United Kingdom, RV trailers are known as caravans.|$|R
