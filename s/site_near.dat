5|$|The bramble (Rubus sp.) lie {{around the}} ruins {{and along the}} {{south-east}} of the <b>site</b> <b>near</b> the houses. Due to an interest in preserving wildlife (e.g. refuge for mammals, insects, nesting wrens), they are not eradicated but contained.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{traces of}} human settlement {{date to the}} Neolithic with <b>sites</b> found <b>near</b> Stansstad that are from 4000-3100 BC. The same <b>sites,</b> <b>near</b> Stansstad, also contain Late Bronze Age (1400-1100 BC) artifacts, with additional Bronze Age <b>sites</b> <b>near</b> Hergiswil and Ennetmoos. A La Tène (500-100 BC) grave for a 10-year-old girl {{has been found in}} Stans. Based on these finds, it appears that the Nidwalden region has been settled since the 1st millennium BC.|$|R
5|$|Duxford {{has been}} {{associated}} with British military aviation since 1917, when a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> the village of Duxford, in southern Cambridgeshire, was selected for a new Royal Flying Corps training aerodrome. From 1925 Duxford became a fighter airfield, a role it was to retain until the end of its operational life, and in August 1938 the Duxford-based No.19 Squadron RAF became the first to operate the Supermarine Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Tawaf {{is followed by}} two Rakaat prayers at the Place of Abraham (Muqam Ibrahim), a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> the Kaaba inside the mosque. However, again because of large crowds during the days of Hajj, they may instead pray anywhere in the mosque. After prayer, pilgrims also drink water from the Zamzam well, which is made available in coolers throughout the Mosque.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen in Fishing Creek ranges from approximately 5 to 17.5mg/L at Benton. A <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Camp Lavigne had slightly less variability, ranging from 8 to 17mg/L. The concentration near Bloomsburg ranged between 4.1 and 17.1mg/L, {{with an average}} of 10.9mg/L.

5|$|Three {{sites were}} {{identified}} for possible deep geologic disposal in clay {{near the border}} of Meuse and Haute-Marne, near Gard, and at Vienne. In 1998 the government approved the Meuse/Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory, a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Meuse/Haute-Marne and dropped the others from further consideration. Legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2015, with operations expected in 2025.|$|E
5|$|A {{receiving}} station was formed from the immobile sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field ambulances, a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field Ambulances with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a detachment from an Egyptian hospital. This Receiving Station {{took over the}} <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients in mud huts, 400 patients in tents, and 700 patients in the abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E

5|$|A small example {{excavated}} {{from underneath}} the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic. Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture. The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium. Since {{there was not enough}} room to expand old Dudley Field at its <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Kirkland Hall, the Vanderbilt administrators {{purchased}} land adjacent to the present 25th Avenue South for the new facility. The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E
5|$|Although {{work had}} begun on the Millfields station, {{including}} {{the completion of}} the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham were unhappy at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the extension to meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed to curve away from the town, and a public subscription raised £2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428m) extension to a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> the town centre. Construction of the branch to Chesham began in late 1887.|$|E

5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, probably with a very low density of population.|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto <b>site</b> <b>near</b> two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock {{at a depth of}} about 500 meters in 2001. The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, was under construction at the site in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Excavations of Iron Age {{sites have}} {{recovered}} horse bones from ritual pits at a temple <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, {{including one of}} a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack. The majority of Iron Age chariot burials in Britain {{are associated with the}} Arras culture, and in most cases the chariots were dismantled before burial. Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E
5|$|Farm Fields, a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> Kinloch, {{provides}} some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized hazelnut shells found there have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this hunter-gatherer community may have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a <b>site</b> <b>near</b> the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E
