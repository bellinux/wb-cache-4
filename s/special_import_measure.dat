40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to empirically examine whether the United States' {{imposition}} of a <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restraint distorts foreign exports and thus affects world trade flows. We first develop a theoretical model of worldwide trade in which {{the imposition of a}} <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restraint by one country - an antidumping duty or a safeguard measure - causes significant distortions in world trade flows. We then empirically test this model by investigating the effect of US <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restraints on Japanese exports of roughly 3500 commodities into 29 countries between 1992 and 2001. Our estimation of a fixed-effects model of Japanese exports yields evidence that US import restraints both deflect and depress Japanese export flows. Imposition of a US antidumping duty against Japan deflects trade: export growth to non-US trading partners rises by 11 to 22 percentage points. The simultaneous imposition of a US antidumping duty against both Japan and a third country depresses trade: Japanese export growth to the third country falls by 0 to 18 percentage points. The magnitude of the trade depression effect is also larger when the US imposes an antidumping duty against a third country but not against Japan. A US safeguard measure leads Japanese export growth to third countries to rise 12 to 15 percentage points. Trade; Exports; Antidumping duties...|$|R

In our empirical analysis of the sustainability of current account for Turkey, cointegration approaches have been used.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how US <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restrictions affect {{the growth of}} China's exports to countries other than the US. We estimate an empirical model of trade deflection and trade depression of roughly 5100 commodities exported by China to 37 countries between 1992 and 2001. Our estimation yields evidence that US trade restrictions deflect Chinese exports to third, non-US markets. Imposition of a US antidumping duty against China leads {{the growth rate of}} targeted commodities to increase approximately 25 percentage points. Our results on the deflection of Chinese exports vary across commodity, with the strongest evidence of trade deflection appearing in the steel, pharmaceuticals and manufactured goods industries.

We present two concepts of nominal protection: legal tariffs and the actual import tariffs. In addition, we construct three measures of welfare: from the legal tariff; from the actual import tariffs; and from the actual import tariffs when rent-seeking is present. Finally, we compare the various measures of protection in terms of their impact on welfare. The results show that trade policies based on exceptions - such as those establishing the special im- port regimes - tends to decrease welfare...|$|R

Japan began to register surpluses in the current account in 1965, which later continued to rise, although they were punctuated by short-term deficits following the two oil price hikes in 1973 and 1979 (cf. 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis).|$|R
