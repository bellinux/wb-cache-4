Basically, this paper revolves around the idea of investigating the effect and distribution of velocity profile and pressure within a pump having the following <b>specification,</b> <b>Head</b> = 20 m, Flow rate = 280 m 3 /hr, and RPM = 1450. 3 D Navier–Stokes equations were solved using ANSYS CFX.

The static pressure on pressure side is evidently larger than that on suction side at the same impeller radius.

40|$|One of {{the first}} steps in animal {{development}} is axis formation, during which an uneven distribution of signals and/or transcription factors results {{in the establishment of}} polarity in the embryo. Hydra, one of the simplest metazoan animals, shows characteristics of a permanent embryo. Even adult polyps have a striking capacity to regenerate, suggesting that molecular mechanisms underlying de novo pattern formation are permanently active and self regulatory. Here we show that HEADY, a short, amidated peptide, plays {{a central role in the}} specification of apical fate in this simple metazoan. The HEADY gene, whose transcripts accumulate at the apical organizing center, is required for specification of apical fate, as disruption of HEADY function by dsRNA mediated interference (RNAi) results in severe defects in head formation. Conversely, an instructive role of HEADY in <b>head</b> <b>specification</b> is demonstrated by the application of synthetic HEADY peptide, which induces formation of secondary axes with head morphology.

Sequence elements in the 5 ¢-flanking region of ks 1 that are related to TPA-responsive elements may mediate the TPA inducibility of ks 1 expression.

Also known as the Venom Thruxton, this aimed {{to fill the gap}} left by the demise of the BSA Gold Star and was named after the Thruxton Circuit race track on a former wartime airfield in Hampshire where race-prepared Venoms had performed particularly well in production racing events. The Velocette Thruxton was a true racer, with a full race <b>specification</b> cylinder <b>head</b> that was gas flowed by hand to accommodate extra-large valves and a downdraught inlet port. The Amal carburetor was so large it required a distinctive cutaway {{in the bottom of the}} fuel tank, and race cams boosted performance to up to 120 mph. As well as the traditional black-with-gold-lining finish, the Velocette Thruxton was also produced with an unusual blue frame, forks and seat and silver petrol tank with gold lining. In 1968 the Lucas magneto was phased out, and Velocette replaced it with coil ignition. A total of 1108 Thruxtons were built, but although it had more power than the Venom the Thruxton could not save Velocette. The company went into liquidation in February 1971. The Thruxton has gone on to become one of the most sought-after of all classic British motorcycles, with many private owners having converted standard Venom models to the more valuable Thruxton specification.

Here, we present evidence that these genes are also required for proper ventral appendage development during development of the adult fly, where they specify medial to distal appendage development. Cells lacking the disco genes cannot contribute to the medial and distal portions of ventral appendages. Further, ectopic disco transforms dorsal appendages toward ventral fates; in wing discs, the medial and distal leg development pathways are activated. Interestingly, this appendage role is conserved in the red flour beetle, Tribolium (where legs develop during embryogenesis), yet in the beetle we found no evidence for a head segmentation role. The lack of an embryonic <b>head</b> <b>specification</b> role in Tribolium {{could be interpreted as}} a loss of the head segmentation function in Tribolium or gain of this function during evolution of flies.

40|$|AbstractThe dorsal {{marginal}} zone (DMZ) of an amphibian early gastrula {{is thought}} to consist {{of at least two}} distinct domains: the future head and trunk–tail organizers. We studied the mechanism by which the organizing activities of {{the lower half of the}} DMZ (LDMZ) of the urodelean (Cynops pyrrhogaster) embryo are changed. The uninvoluted LDMZ induces the notochord and then organizes the trunk–tail structures, whereas after cultivation in vitro or suramin treatment, the same LDMZ loses the notochord-inducing ability and organizes the head structures. A cell-lineage experiment indicated that the change in the organizing activity of the LDMZ was reflected in the transformation of the inductive ability: from notochord-inducing to neural-inducing activity. Using RT-PCR, we showed that the LDMZ expressed gsc, lim- 1, chordin, and noggin, but not the mesoderm marker bra. In the sandwich assay, the LDMZ induced bra expression in the animal cap ectoderm, but the inductive activity was inhibited by cultivation or suramin treatment. The present study indicates that the change in the organizing activity of the LDMZ from trunk–tail to head is coupled with the loss of notochord-inducing activity. Based on these results, we suggest that this change is essential for the <b>specification</b> of the <b>head</b> and trunk–tail organizers during gastrulation...|$|R

We show that the mxc product is dramatically needed in most tissues because its loss leads to cell death after a few divisions. mxc has also a strong maternal effect. We find that hypomorphic mxc mutations enhance other PcG gene mutant phenotypes and cause ectopic expression of homeotic genes, confirming that PcG products are cooperatively involved in repression of selector genes outside their normal expression domains. We also demonstrate that the mxc product is needed for imaginal <b>head</b> <b>specification,</b> through regulation of the ANT-C gene Deformed.

40|$|AbstractIn mouse embryo, {{the early}} {{induction}} {{of the head}} region depends on signals from the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) and the anterior primitive streak. Subsequently, node derivatives, including anterior definitive endoderm and axial mesendoderm, are thought {{to play a role}} in the maintenance and elaboration of anterior neural character. Foxa 2 encodes a winged-helix transcription factor expressed in signaling centers required for head development, including the AVE, anterior primitive streak, anterior definitive endoderm, and axial mesendoderm. To address Foxa 2 function during formation of the head, we used conditional mutants in which Foxa 2 function is preserved in extraembryonic tissues during early embryonic stages and inactivated in embryonic tissues after the onset of gastrulation. In Foxa 2 conditional mutants, the anterior neural plate and anterior definitive endoderm were initially specified. In contrast, the axial mesendoderm failed to differentiate. At later stages, specification of the anterior neural plate and anterior definitive endoderm was shown to be labile. As a result, head truncations were observed in Foxa 2 conditional mutants. Our results therefore indicate that anterior definitive endoderm alone is not sufficient to maintain anterior <b>head</b> <b>specification</b> and that an interaction between the axial mesendoderm and the anterior definitive endoderm is required for proper specification of the endoderm. Foxa 2 therefore plays an integral role in the formation of axial mesendoderm, which is required to maintain the specification of the forebrain and the anterior definitive endoderm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{understanding}} of the developmental mechanisms underlying the vast diversity of arthropod appendages largely rests on the peculiar case of the dipteran Drosophila melanogaster. In this insect, homothorax (hth) and extradenticle (exd) together play {{a pivotal role in}} appendage patterning and identity. We investigated the role of the hth homologue in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus by parental RNA interference. This species has a more generalized morphology than Oncopeltus fasciatus, the one other insect besides Drosophila where homothorax function has been investigated. The Gryllus head appendages represent the morphologically primitive state including insect-typical mandibles, maxillae and labium, structures highly modified or missing in Oncopeltus and Drosophila. We depleted Gb’hth function through parental RNAi to investigate its requirement for proper regulation of other appendage genes (Gb’wingless, Gb’dachshund, Gb’aristaless and Gb’Distalless) and analyzed the terminal phenotype of Gryllus nymphs. Gb’hth RNAi nymphs display homeotic and segmentation defects similar to hth mutants or loss-of-function clones in Drosophila. Intriguingly, however, we find that in Gb’hth RNAi nymphs not only the antennae but also all gnathal appendages are homeotically transformed, such that all head appendages differentiate distally as legs and proximally as antennae. Hence, Gb’hth is not specifically required for antennal fate, but fulfills a similar role in the <b>specification</b> of all <b>head</b> appendages. This suggests that the role of hth in the insect antenna is not fundamentally different from its function as cofactor of segment-specific homeotic genes in more posterior segments...|$|R

Bulk density and effective porosity were collected from (Shata 1978), specific yield, storage coefficient, transitivity, horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities from the analysis of available pumping test (Table  1, Gad 1995; Ismail 2008; Gad et al. 2015). El-Mahsama Lake and oxidation ponds were entered as a lake feature, using field measurement depth (3  m), discharge, an annual recharge rate of 14  mm/year, and an annual evapotranspiration rate of 2920  mm/year (13 meteorological stations, Ismail 2008). The Ismailia canal was added as a river boundary using an average depth of 4  m (Gad et al. 2015). Top and bottom elevations of the aquifer layer derived from DEM files (digital elevation model) are available from the World Wide Web ([URL] to automatically delineate the ground surface elevation above sea level. The values of the top layer matrix extracted through the use of DEM file are processed by surfer software and saved as spreadsheet file accepted by the Visual MODFLOW package. On the contrary, {{due to the lack of}} bottom layer elevation data and depending on the few well logs data referring to an aquifer average saturated thickness 140  m, the bottom layer elevation map of Quaternary aquifer was obtained by subtracting a constant value of 140  m from the top layer elevation data matrix using surfer software to reprocess the resulted map through visual MODFLOW software. The initial hydraulic head is the distribution of head in the groundwater system at the start of the simulation (Anderson and Woessner 1992). Initial hydraulic heads distribution in the Quaternary aquifer during Dec. 1992 (Gad 1995) was obtained from the well database in the study area.

A particularly exaggerated form is found in Diopsid stalk-eyed flies, in which both eyes and antennae are laterally displaced at the end of stalks. The processes of early development and <b>specification</b> of the <b>head</b> capsule in stalk-eyed flies are similar to those in Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila the homeobox gene ocelliless (oc) shows a mediolateral gradient of expression across the region of the eye-antennal imaginal disc that gives rise to the head capsule and specifies the development of different head structures. The genes and developmental mechanisms that subsequently define head shape in Drosophila and produce hypercephaly in stalk-eyed flies remain unclear. To address this, we performed an enhancer trap screen for Drosophila genes expressed in the same region as oc and identified the homeobox gene defective proventriculus (dve). In the eye-antennal imaginal disc, dve is coexpressed with oc in the region that gives rise to the head capsule and is active along the medial edge of the antennal disc and in the first antennal segment. Analyses of dve expression in mutant eye-antennal discs are consistent with it acting downstream of oc {{in the development of the}} head capsule. We confirm that orthologues of dve are present in a diverse panel of five stalk-eyed fly species and analyse patterns of dve sequence variation within the clade.

40|$|AbstractThe role of homeobox-containing {{genes in}} the {{regional}} specification of the vertebrate embryo has been an area of intense research over the last decade. Whereas {{it appears that the}} homeobox genes of the Hox gene family {{play an important role in}} the specification of the trunk, the genes and processes involved in the <b>specification</b> of the <b>head</b> are less well understood. We have isolated a new head-specific homeobox gene, XANF- 2, that appears to be involved in the regional specification of the anterior head of Xenopus embryos. This gene is initially expressed in the anterior dorsal region of early embryos and later exclusively in the primordium of the anterior pituitary gland. XANF- 2 represents the earliest marker for the anterior pituitary lineage. Ammonium chloride is able to induce the expression of XANF- 2 in uncommitted ectoderm. These and other data indicate that ammonium chloride is capable of inducing a large portion of the anterior dorsal region of the embryo which includes, but is not limited to, the anterior pituitary gland and cement gland anlagen. This implies that changes in intracellular ionic conditions play an important role in the formation of the anterior head region. In addition to NH 4 Cl, injection of follistatin RNA can induce transcription of XANF- 2, suggesting that these two unrelated compounds can activate a chain of events leading to the formation of the amphibian head. Furthermore, we demonstrate that planar induction in Keller sandwiches can induce XANF- 2 expression as well as the expression of the cement gland-specific gene, XCG 13, indicating that planar signaling can account for induction of even the most anterior regions of the embryo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground Segmentation of the Drosophila embryo {{is based}} on a cascade of {{hierarchical}} gene interactions that is initiated by maternal morphogens; these interactions define spatially restricted domains of zygotic gene expression within the blastoderm. Although the hierarchy of the segmentation genes that subdivide the trunk is well established, the patterning of the head is less well understood. Seven head segments can be assigned on the basis of metameric patterns of segment-polarity gene expression and internal sensory organs. The domains of expression of head gap-like genes broadly overlap, with their posterior margins out of phase by one segment. Taken together with the lack of pair-rule gene expression in the head, these observations led to the suggestion that head gap genes act in a combinatorial manner, determining head segmental borders and segmental identity at the same time. Results We have identified a new Drosophila gene, collier (col), whose expression at the blastoderm stage is restricted to a single stripe of cells corresponding to part of the intercalary and mandibular segment primordia, possibly parasegment 0. Reduction of col activity in early gastrula embryos by antisense RNA expression results in a specific lack of head structures derived from these segments. The expression of col coincides with a mitotic domain, which supports the proposal that cells in this domain undergo a concerted mitotic and differentiation program that is orchestrated at the transcriptional level. Col is an ortholog of mammalian early B-cell factor/Olfactory- 1. These proteins define a new family of transcription factors that contain a helix–loop–helix dimerization motif and a new type of DNA-binding domain that is highly conserved during evolution. Conclusion Here we describe Col, the first Drosophila member of a new family of transcription factors. Col may act as a ‘second-level regulator’ of head patterning. The structural conservation of Col during evolution raises the questions of its conservation of function in <b>head</b> <b>specification</b> and its interactions with other factors conserved between insects and vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} design and scaling characteristics of Tesla – or so-called “friction” – turbines, and offers design solutions for achieving optimum performance given the input specifications. The research covers turbines ranging from sub-watt power scavenging designs to watt-range mobile applications to kilowatt-range renewable energy applications. The characteristics of the turbine are demonstrated using micro fabrication, theoretical analysis, and ANSYS, COMSOL, and MATLAB simulations. A MATLAB GUI is provided for generating design specifications and turbine performance sensitivity. In Tesla turbines, the fluid profile {{and the length of}} the fluid path inside the rotor control the pressure drop and momentum transfer. In this research, analyses of rotor performance for incompressible flow are developed for different fluid profiles and fluid-path lengths. First, frictional losses in the nozzle and at the rotor-turbine interface are investigated, along with other turbine losses. These losses are then classified and modeled in terms of their relationship to head loss and shaft power loss, and investigated using MATLAB and COMSOL. As the turbine scales down, this scaled performance is evaluated and a constraint list for turbine hardware and operating parameters is derived. These results are used to optimize performance for the full range of millimeter to meter sized turbines. Tesla turbines at the scales covered in this dissertation (mm – m) are relatively easy to manufacture. The experimental mini-turbines presented in this research have two primary components, fabricated using commercially available technologies: 1) four 1 cm-diameter rotors with variation in number of disks, interdisk spacing, and effective area, and 2) a turbine enclosure with eight nozzles of varying area, angle, and shape. Test results from different configurations of nozzles and rotors are presented, and observations made on the performance trends of the turbine. Flow through the 1 cm rotors is also simulated in ANSYS to verify the momentum equations. The performance difference between analytical solutions, simulation, and experimental results is then studied, and a mapping of experimental results onto analytical results is proposed. In addition, various scaling-down methodologies are investigated. Disk spacing is varied as a power function of radius, and turbine performance is analyzed across the turbine range of 1 mm to 400 mm diameter. Using this approach, constant power density designs are specified that perform at better than 35 % mechanical efficiency for the entire range. As the turbine is scaled down, the roughening of the disks must be increased to control the fluid profile. Power density is very sensitive to the rotor spacing and the input head, and efficiency is very sensitive to the operating parameters and turbine design. This dissertation argues that these sensitivities explain the wide discrepancies in published turbine performances. A practical design tool is also offered, which inputs user <b>specifications</b> on <b>head,</b> flow, particulate size, and medium to generate a list of possible turbine designs along with a recommendation for four candidate designs. The sensitivities of turbine performance to the input head and input flow variations are also reported. The tool is designed to cover 20 mW to 20 kW power range and 2 mm to 500 mm rotor radius range. Current applications and potential extensions to the research are discussed in the conclusion...|$|R
