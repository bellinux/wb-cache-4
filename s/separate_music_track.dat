40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} for automatic music video summarization. The proposed summarization scheme {{is different from the}} current methods used for video summarization. The <b>music</b> video is <b>separated</b> into the <b>music</b> <b>track</b> and video <b>track.</b> For the <b>music</b> <b>track,</b> a <b>music</b> summary is created by analyzing the music content using music features, an adaptive clustering algorithm, and music domain knowledge. Then, shots in the video track are detected and clustered. Finally, the music video summary is created by aligning the music summary and clustered video shots. Subjective studies by experienced users have been conducted to evaluate the quality of music summaries and effectiveness of the proposed summarization approach. Experiments are performed on different genres of music videos and comparisons are made with the summaries generated based on <b>music</b> <b>track,</b> video track, and manually. The evaluation results indicate that summaries generated using the proposed method are effective in helping realize users' expectations...|$|R
50|$|Track {{separation}} is about extracting the original tracks as recorded, {{which could have}} more than one instrument played per track. Instrument recognition is about identifying the instruments involved and/or <b>separating</b> the <b>music</b> into one <b>track</b> per instrument. Various programs have been developed that can <b>separate</b> <b>music</b> into its component tracks without access to the master copy. In this way e.g. karaoke tracks can be created from normal <b>music</b> <b>tracks,</b> though the process is not yet perfect owing to vocals occupying some of the same frequency space as the other instruments.|$|R
