40|$|A new Transponder {{architecture}} {{offers the}} ability to reprogram the transponder in the field. The current implementation of flash based memories for code and/or parameter storage impede this feature due to significant current consumption over {{a long time for}} store operation. The proposed sophisticated approach uses the low current consumption of embedded nvSRAM memories. The nvSRAM embedded memory combines the fast unlimited access of a SRAM bitcell backed up by a SONOS based storage device. The store and erase procedure are based on Fowler-Nordheim erase and programming of the SONOS device. This field emission tunneling consumes very small current and provides the capability of programming all memory cells at the same time. The necessary charge is stored on a capacitor that was charged up very smoothly during power on by controlled current source technique to avoid the feedback on transponder operation. Based on this concept the code and/or parameters could be stored by hardware control of the transponders microcontroller, by software control insight and outsight of the system or even in case of emergency <b>system</b> <b>power</b> <b>down.</b> Beside the field programming capability a proprietary store procedure control allows to store additional information of the store procedure itself to flag the successful store operation. This capability provides the new powerful feature of logging the store procedure in a very low current consuming environment and checks the validity after re-powering the system. This paper gives an introduction in different approaches for transponder architectures by using nvSRAM memory architecture, presents the advantage and introduces new safety features in very low current consuming systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Scientific {{data centers}} {{comprised}} of high-powered computing equipment and large capacity disk storage systems consume {{considerable amount of}} energy. Dynamic power management techniques (DPM) are commonly used for saving energy in disk <b>systems.</b> These involve <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> disks that exhibit long idle periods and placing them in standby mode. A file request from a disk in standby mode will incur both energy and performance penalties as it takes energy (and time) to spin up the disk before it can serve a file. For this reason, DPM has to make decisions as to when to transition the disk into standby mode such that the energy saved {{is greater than the}} energy needed to spin it up again and the performance penalty is tolerable. The length of the idle period until the DPM decides to <b>power</b> <b>down</b> a disk is called idleness threshold. In this paper, we study both analytically and experimentally dynamic power management techniques that save energy subject to performance constraints on file access costs. Based on observed workloads of scientific applications and disk characteristics, we provide a methodology for determining file assignment to disks and computing idleness thresholds that result in significant improvements to the energy saved by existing DPM solutions while meeting response time constraints. We validate our methods with simulations that use traces taken from scientific applications...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} computing {{has been}} gaining increasing traction over the past decade, fueled by technological developments and rising demand for autonomous and battery-free systems. Energy harvesting introduces numerous challenges to embedded systems but, arguably the greatest, is the required transition from an energy source that typically provides virtually unlimited power for a reasonable period of time until it becomes exhausted, to a power source that is highly unpredictable and dynamic (both spatially and temporally, and with a range spanning many orders of magnitude). The typical approach to overcome this is the addition of intermediate energy storage/buffering to smooth out the temporal dynamics of both power supply and consumption. This has the advantage that, if correctly sized, the system ‘looks like’ a battery-powered system; however, it also adds volume, mass, cost and complexity and, if not sized correctly, unreliability. In this paper, we consider energy-driven computing, where systems are designed from the outset to operate from an energy harvesting source. Such systems typically contain little or no additional energy storage (instead relying on tiny parasitic and decoupling capacitance), alleviating the aforementioned issues. Examples of energy-driven computing include transient <b>systems</b> (which <b>power</b> <b>down</b> when the supply disappears and efficiently continue execution when it returns) and power-neutral systems (which operate directly from the instantaneous power harvested, gracefully modulating their consumption and performance to match the supply). In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy of energy-driven computing, articulating how power-neutral, transient, and energy-driven systems present a different class of computing to conventional approaches...|$|R
