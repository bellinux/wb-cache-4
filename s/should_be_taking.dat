At two filtration facilities (Clover Point in Victoria and Macauley Point in Esquimalt) sewage is screened to exclude objects larger than 6 millimetres before being released into the Juan de Fuca Strait via marine outfalls. Solid matter that is filtered out of the effluent is trucked to the Hartland landfill.

2500|$|Up to 8 {{players can}} {{participate}} in a single online match. Players are able to party with friends, pick a playlist of their favorite challenges and compete for supremacy across every stage of game. In addition to this, players never have to wait in a lobby again {{even if they are}} joining a race in progress. The multiplayer matches are split into differing game type playlists, such as Supercar Challenge, NFS Edition Racing, The Underground, Mixed Competition, Exotic Sprint, and Muscle Car Battles. Most of these modes pertain to different car varieties for each race, but the Supercar Challenge is meant entirely for the fastest cars on the fastest tracks. The player can select an event and vote towards the race course where the multiplayer game <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> place on. Players also take part in a reward system known as [...] "The Bonus Wheel", which randomly selects a reward and required goal criteria for it.|$|E
2500|$|Burke {{believed}} that property {{was essential to}} human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property {{formed the basis for}} social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also {{believed that}} it kept the monarch in check {{to the needs of the}} classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as naturalâ€”part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As Christopher Hitchens summarises, [...] "If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial." ...|$|E

2500|$|The HOD sent {{delegates to}} visit foie gras farms. One delegate, Robert P Gordon of New Jersey, {{indicated}} his personal position changed drastically after the visit. He also testified tube feeding is less distressing than taking the rectal temperature {{of a cat}} and urged the AVMA {{to take a position}} based on science, not emotion, while cautioning against anthropomorphism. [...] The New York delegation offered their opinion that opponents of foie gras were intending to create a wedge issue; that the arguments used against foie gras would be modified to be used against other livestock production. [...] The testimony of the delegate from the Association of Avian Veterinarians was that medicating and feeding sick birds via tube was a normal practice that birds accepted without stress. [...] Another delegate who toured the farms stated that the birds appeared to be well cared for and better off than other poultry raised in factory farming. [...] The overall position of the House of Delegates was that [...] "observations and practical experience shared by HOD members indicate a minimum of adverse effects on the birds involved." [...] The closing comments in the HOD were that the AVMA <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> positions on facts and science, make broad policy positions on general animal welfare, and support positions that created oversight of controversial practices for fear that prohibition would cause production to move to countries without animal welfare regulation.|$|E
