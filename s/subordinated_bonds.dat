40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of credit spreads for Japanese mega-banks with emphasis on comparing subordinated CDS spreads with the <b>subordinated</b> <b>bond</b> spreads {{from the viewpoint of}} price discovery in both credit markets. The main findings are summarized as follows. First, subordinated CDS and <b>subordinated</b> <b>bond</b> spreads are significantly cointegrated for most banks, and price discovery measures suggest that the CDS spread plays a more dominant role in price discovery than the bond spread. Second, although both CDS and bond spreads significantly react to the Japanese sovereign CDS spread, only the CDS spread reacts significantly to other financial market variables including its own volatility and equity return. Third, both spreads are responsive to the changes in fundamental accounting variables such as the capital? asset ratio and the nonperforming loan ratio. These accounting variables are likely to constitute common factors that are behind the cointegration relationship. Last, significant volatility spillovers are detected from the CDS to bond spreads. This result implies that new information flows more in this direction. <b>Subordinated</b> <b>Bond,</b> Credit Default Swap, Japanese Banks, Price Discovery, Volatility Spillover, Bivariate GARCH...|$|R

The main findings are as follows. <b>Subordinated</b> <b>bond</b> and CDS spreads are cointegrated in most cases, and the CDS spread plays a more dominant role in price discovery than the bond spread. In addition, there are significant volatility spillovers from the CDS to bond spread.

50|$|In finance, {{permanent}} interest bearing shares, or PIBS, are fixed-interest {{securities issued}} by building societies. PIBS become perpetual <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> if their issuer demutualises. Building societies {{use them in}} the way public limited companies use preference shares. Although similar to bonds, PIBS typically exist {{as long as their}} issuer does.Many PIBS were originally issued in an era of higher interest rates, and so appear attractive to investors looking for income in a world of lower interest rates. However, there are some disadvantages to PIBS; unlike bonds they have no fixed redemption date, so the buyer is {{at the mercy of the}} markets when they want to sell. Also, PIBS are not covered by UK government compensation schemes, interest does not 'roll up' - if a payment is missed, it is gone for good - and they rank behind depositors and other members in the event of financial distress.|$|E

Thus, there should be an upper bound on subordinated debt. JEL Classification: G 21, G 2...|$|E

The CGPI issued by Indonesian Institute of Corporate Governance (IICG) was a score from 0 to 100 while the characteristics of the bond consisted of three variables, namely <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds,</b> industry type and the maturity of the bond. The results of this study indicated that scores of CGPI, <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> and the type of the industry were statistically significant at ? 5 %while the maturity of the bond was not. The positive direction of the relationship between scores of CGPI to bond rating suggested that the higher the score, the higher the rating. The negative sign of <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> suggested that <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> had a rating lower than non-subordinated bonds.

5000|$|Credit {{enhancement}} is key {{in creating}} a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing <b>subordinate</b> <b>bonds.</b> The <b>subordinate</b> <b>bonds</b> are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a credit enhancement. As a result, {{it is possible for}} defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the senior bonds. Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a [...] "cushion" [...] against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an institutional discussion and an empirical {{analysis of the}} rating process of bonds. The {{focus is on the}} notching policy adopted by the major rating agencies. We argue that rating agencies may choose to provide only a coarse grid, and resort to somewhat arbitrary techniques to refine it. Consistent with our argument we find that the market systematically prices differently bonds of similar ratings, so as to account for the bias we discuss. Specifically, we find that yields of speculative rated senior bonds are higher than the yields of similar rated <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds.</b> We attribute the yield differential between similar rated senior and <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> to the notching policy adopted by the major rating agencies. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} use of public debt {{mezzanine}} instruments, which include participating bonds, <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds,</b> convertible bonds and bonds with warrants, by non-financial corporations and financial corporations in the Czech Republic. It aims to analyse and evaluate use of mezzanine financing instruments {{in the form of}} public debt mezzanine by selected economic entities in the Czech Republic in 2006 – 2012, and identify factors affecting the scope of their utilization. The performed research implies that public debt mezzanine instruments are used in the Czech Republic marginally only. Within the monitored period, these instruments were issued in the total volume of CZK 13. 43 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 49 bn), where <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> got a share of CZK 13. 26 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 48 bn). The share of newly issued public debt mezzanine instruments in the total financial sources of non-financial corporations and financial corporations within the monitored period was on the top in 2009, when it amounted to 0. 08 %. Wider utilization of public debt mezzanine instruments is particularly prevented by the fact that potential issuers are afraid of high costs relating to the process of issuance, but also to the life cycle of such an issue, and they are also afraid of lack of interest of investors (in the case of <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> and participating bonds), the owners’ fear of extension of control (in the case of convertible bonds and bonds with warrants), or {{the fact that it is}} difficult to estimate the cost of capital (in the case of participating bonds) ...|$|E
