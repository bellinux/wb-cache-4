25|$|Sagan's {{contribution}} to the 1969 symposium was {{an attack on the}} belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings: Applying several logical assumptions (see Drake equation), Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually. Not only does that <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unreasonable number of launchings, but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out.|$|E

25|$|The second {{interpretation}} is that Chen's actions were primarily intended to placate his core supporters rather than provoke a crisis. People who subscribe to this interpretation {{point out that}} Chen's early efforts to moderate his pro-independence position did not create a positive reaction either from the PRC or from his anti-independence opponents on Taiwan. He also alienated some pro-independence supporters. Therefore, Chen was forced {{to take a more}} assertive approach both as a negotiation tactic with the PRC and to keep support from his core supporters. This strategy is consistent with the oft-stated position that Taiwan would only seek independence as a preemptive measure in the face of evidence of PRC military aggression. However, even this interpretation provokes unease among many people, especially among policy makers in the PRC and the United States. The first problem is that this interpretation makes Chen <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old-style Taiwan politician that seems to say whatever pleases people. The second, more serious problem is the fear that through misunderstanding and misinterpretation, Chen may have provoked a war without intending to do so, as the PRC has repeatedly claimed that any progress towards independence would provoke war.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Giovanni Pastrone {{decided to}} launch Menichelli {{as a film}} star, and gave her the lead role in Il Fuoco (The Fire), which was a global popular and {{critical}} success. This acclaim catapulted Menichelli {{into the ranks of}} the lavishly-paid cinema divas, such as Francesca Bertini and Lyda Borelli. The film bore no formal relation to Gabriele d'Annunzio's novel of the same name, and was developed from a screenplay by Febo Mari, Menichelli's co-star. However, the film was full of d'Annunzian themes of violent passion, power and decadence. The film is divided into three parts: La Favilla (the spark), La Vampa (the flame/blaze) and Il Cenere (the ashes), which correspond with the three phases of the relationship between Menichelli's aristocratic poet and Mari's impoverished painter. The original poster for Il Fuoco depicts a key moment in the film. Menichelli's character knocks over an oil lamp, and asks Mari's character to choose between love and all-consuming passion, and he chooses the latter. Menichelli's feathered hat, long capes and fierece gestures make her <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> owl and reinforce one of the film's motifs; the link between the femme fatale and birds of prey. Menichelli earned the nickname 'Our Lady of Spasms' for her abrupt gestures in this film.|$|E

The solo was performed by Barrett, not Gilmour as is often noted. A recurring theme in the album, starting with [...] "Baby Lemonade", is the weather.

Rhea Dee of Pinkraygun.com almost entirely focused on Olivia's reactions to being back in the prime universe.

Throughout the series, he has various romantic interests. In the first game, there is tension between him and Elena Fisher, a reporter filming a documentary on his findings.

Additionally, stating a definition of parity for all integers can <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary conceptual shortcut if the only even numbers investigated so far have been positive.

It'll also seem like someone singing, rather than lip-syncing." [...] Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant gave Up! Close & Personal a negative review. He found himself straining to hear Alison Krauss and Union Station, and asked, [...] "And {{when was the}} last time you tuned in to a star's special to hear the background singers?" [...] Furthermore, he would have preferred the band to duet with Twain, rather perform backup for her. Catlin also criticized Twain's decision to model the show after Presley's 68 Comeback Special, believing she did so with far less efficiency. [...] "Not only is she not Elvis, she's not even Alison", he concluded. Allmusic rated Up! Close and Personal three out of five stars.|$|E

[...] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times noted, [...] "What left the deepest impression was {{something far more}} elemental: Beyoncé's ability to make self-aggrandizement <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> expression of humility... ambition seemed in proportion with her fans' expectations; she came by the sense of scale honestly." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as [...] "nothing short of breathtaking, making awesome and repeated use of silhouette, of great white blocks of video screens, of live dancers interacting with video". She praised the singer's [...] "fierce" [...] tireless dancing and concluded, [...] "But for all the hauteur here, in couture and bearing, Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range." [...] Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph found [...] "air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony... of an expensive revue show" [...] in the concert. Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music, McNulty concluded: [...] "Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch, and often blistering in her vocal attack".|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{sang with}} {{restrained}} soprano vocals throughout the album. Vibe magazine's Hyun Kim argued that its songs drew focus to her singing {{more than her}} previous records, [...] "bringing it to the forefront as opposed to hiding it behind the layered production". [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] was sung with breathless vocals by Aaliyah, who instructed her lover on how to please her sexually and equated her erotic high to a drug high. Ballads such as [...] "I Care 4 U", [...] "Never No More", and [...] "I Refuse" [...] were sung more emotively, expressing melancholy qualities and hurt. On [...] "I Can Be", Aaliyah sang {{from the perspective of}} an adulterous man's mistress who wanted to be his foremost girlfriend. Alex Macpherson from The Guardian wrote that [...] "Aaliyah's blank, numbed delivery" [...] on the song [...] "makes being the other woman <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> emotionally masochistic form of self-medication". Biographer Christopher John Farley said she [...] "emotionally detailed a song" [...] unlike on her previous albums and that [...] "her gentle voice now seemed like something elemental, a kindly wind blowing through the branches of a big tree." [...] According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah pushed musical notes [...] "into strange corners of syncopation's shifty architecture" [...] on the more [...] "shape-defying" [...] tracks.

I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago.

You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual center of the universe last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked like something that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E
