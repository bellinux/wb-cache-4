Nowadays it is established as an autonomous community of <b>Spain.</b> <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha</b> is bordered by Castile and León, Madrid, Aragon, Valencia, Murcia, Andalusia, and Extremadura. It is one of the most sparsely populated of Spain's autonomous communities. Albacete is the largest and most populous city. Its capital city is Toledo, and its judicial capital city is Albacete.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main methodological aspects and results {{obtained from the}} activity of the irrigation advisory service for farmers (SIAR) in Castilla-La Mancha, <b>Spain.</b> <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha</b> is a broad semi-arid region, with a total surface of 8 million hectares and an irrigable surface of more than 460000 ha. In most of these irrigations, at least 60 %, there are serious problems of water scarcity; thus it is necessary to carry out actions for improving the use of water for irrigation. Among the results and conclusions obtained, the most important are the technical, social and economic limitations, which constitute a handicap to achieving the objectives of the advisory service. 1...|$|E
40|$|Cage-trapping {{is one of}} {{the control}} methods {{frequently}} used by hunters to remove red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Spain, although its low efficiency and selectivity have been frequently reported. We tested the effect of the combinations of two bait types (live/ dead) and two scent attractants (fox urine/valerian extract) in order to improve the efficiency and selectivity of cage traps in central Spain. The combination of live bait and fox urine increased the efficiency of cage traps to capture red foxes in comparison with live bait alone. None of the experimental treatments led to a significant reduction in the capture rate of non-Target species, selectivity levels were always low (0 %- 21 %) and non-Target species were captured. In view of that, the burden of releasing captured non-Target animals depends ultimately on the trapper. For this reason, the use of cage traps is still questionable for managing foxes in <b>Spain.</b> <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha</b> Regional Government; code numbers 02 - 227 /RN- 52 and PREG- 05 - 23.

40|$|As {{opposed to}} the {{traditional}} Marshallian Industrial District, the Rural District becomes a new concept for territorial development thanks to the qualitative changes of population occurring since 1970 in developed countries and since 1980 in <b>Spain</b> and <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha.</b> The urban areas are decreasing in importance and the urban hierarchy and center-periphery relations evolved into less hierarchic and multipolar relations. Rural-rural movements occurred in rural environments, from minor cores to region cores and/or higher populated cores as a reproduction of a center-periphery model at rural territorial level.

40|$|The {{results of}} a topic-interest study on geosciences among 14 - to 17 -year-old school {{students}} are reported. The research was organized {{in the framework of}} the European project Geoschools to investigate the interest of students in the context of teaching strategies for geosciences in secondary schools. A questionnaire was designed as the main datacollection tool, based on the {{results of a}} comparison on geosciences curricula among the five European countries (Austria, Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain) which are the partners in the GEOschools project. The present study focuses on results from Greece and Spain but also includes preliminary results from Italy, for comparison purposes. Questionnaires were distributed in 20 schools (through 20 teachers with around 600 students) in each participating country. Specifically, a sample of 554, 14 - to 15 -year-old students were surveyed in 20 schools across Greece, a sample of 155, 14 - to 17 -yearold students was surveyed in seven schools in Aragón (Spain), and a sample of 624, 14 - and 16 -year-old children was surveyed in 11 schools in Sicily (Italy) to identify their main topics of interest in geosciences. Additional surveys in <b>Spain</b> in <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha</b> (Guadalajara), Madrid, Catalonia, and in the province of Gerona (134 students, 14 – 17 years old) and from Portugal (284 students) are still in the process of evaluation. Results indicate that the most attractive topics for children are Natural Hazards and Palaeontology. Teaching strategies also raise interest. Children from Spain generally show less interest in geosciences than do children of the same age from Greece. A discussion on the high educational potential of geological heritage is included, providing clear case examples for showing geological problems...|$|R
