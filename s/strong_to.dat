5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} {{that there was}} a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent <b>Strong</b> <b>to</b> personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E
5|$|Though most of {{the routes}} {{proposed}} over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the proposals for the Second Avenue Subway.

5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E

5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime engineering firm {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{continued}} to issue orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17December; {{in light of the}} growing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to maintain an increased level of awareness; he also ordered large-scale military exercises as a in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> attack. Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that they were no longer bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19 December the Dutch launched Operation Kraai, an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at Maguwo had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon becoming aware of the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight as they had been trained– as guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center moving quickly northeastward across those areas on the 27th. On the afternoon of April 27, CAPE values were estimated {{to be in the}} range of 2000–3000 J/kg across Louisiana and southern Mississippi, with the moderate instability moving northeastward across the southern Tennessee Valley; in addition, temperatures across the southeastern United States ranged from the 70s°F (mid-20s°C) to the lower 90s°F (near 35°C). Helicity levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|At 1:50p.m. CDT (18:50UTC), the SPC {{issued a}} tornado watch for {{northern}} and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance {{of two or}} more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado. Isolated shower activity began forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch, eventually growing into a line of <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> severe thunderstorms, including supercells. One such high-precipitation supercell was first severe warned at 6:11p.m. CDT (23:11UTC); the National Weather Service office in Chicago, Illinois warned of winds up to 70mph (110km/h) and quarter- to golf ball-sized hail. The weather forecast office upgraded the severe thunderstorm warning to a tornado warning at 6:35p.m. CDT (23:35UTC), and four minutes later, trained storm spotters reported a damaging tornado north of Ashton. This was one of several tornadoes observed across the Central United States on April8 and April9.|$|E

The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be <b>strong,</b> <b>to</b> aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E

5|$|Bavi and its {{precursor}} {{tropical disturbance}} impacted eastern Micronesia, with <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> gale force winds of between , reported on various atolls in the Marshall Islands. Considerable damage was {{reported on the}} islet of Ebeye, on the main atoll of Kwajalein, {{a small amount of}} tree damage was reported, while several old steel structures were made too dangerous to use. Overall damages in the Marshall Islands were estimated at US$2.1 million, while a fishing vessel and its crew of nine were reported missing during March 12. After impacting Eastern Micronesia, Bavi approached the Mariana Islands, with its circulation passing over Guam during March 15, where it caused the highest waves to be recorded on the island in a decade. Bavi also impacted the Northern Mariana Islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan, where power outages were reported and five houses were destroyed. Total property damages within the Mariana Islands were estimated at around US$150 thousand.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{condition}} of the northerly pass it was decided to leave divisional artillery to follow in the morning, guarded by the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade. So it was that only the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades of the 5th Cavalry Division which entered the Esdraelon Plain on the morning of 20 September. Despite orders to the contrary, the 14th Cavalry Brigade advanced directly towards Afulah, the objective of the 4th Cavalry Division. Only the 13th Cavalry Brigade was therefore available to attack 5th Cavalry Division's objective at Nazareth. This brigade was not sufficiently <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> capture the town and the Yildirim Army Group headquarters and Liman von Sanders escaped. The next day, after the German and Ottoman garrison had retreated, Nazareth was occupied by the 13th Cavalry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E

5|$|For its part, the Polish army marched {{across the}} Dniester into Moldavia in August 1497. The Sultan sent 500 or 600 Janissaries to Moldavia at Stephen's request, joining the Moldavian forces {{gathered}} at Roman. Stephen sent his chancellor, Isaac, to John Albert, requesting {{the withdrawal of}} Polish forces from Moldavia, but John Albert had Isaac imprisoned. The Poles then laid siege to Suceava on 24 September. The campaign failed: Teutonic reinforcements never arrived, with Johann von Tiefen dying on the way. Before long, a plague {{broke out in the}} Polish camp, while Vladislaus of Hungary sent an army of 12,000 <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> Moldavia, forcing John Albert to lift the siege on 19 October.|$|E

Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue, but {{preferred}} to save his main French army for more important matters, closer to home. The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents of Germans and Swiss French allies, as well as by French units that had fallen out of favour with Napoleon and the French high command.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E

5|$|Overnight, the 1st and 3rd Parachute battalions had skirted as {{far south}} as 2nd Parachute Battalion's {{original}} route into the city, hoping to follow them into Arnhem centre. They approached the German line before light and for several hours attempted to fight through the German positions. Spindler's force—being continually reinforced—was too <b>strong</b> <b>to</b> penetrate, and by 10:00 the British advance was stopped. A more coordinated attack followed in the afternoon, but it too was repulsed. Urquhart attempted to return to his Divisional Headquarters at Oosterbeek but became cut off and was forced to take shelter in a Dutch family's loft with two fellow officers. Lathbury was injured and also forced into hiding.|$|E
