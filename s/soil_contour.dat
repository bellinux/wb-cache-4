40|$|Soil cover {{transformation}} and changes of morphological and chemical properties of Albeluvisols in clear-cuttings of middle taiga spruce forests were studied. The observed changes in structure and properties of podzolic texturally-differentiated soils at cuttings of spruce {{forests in the}} middle taiga subzone do not cause their transition to any other soil type. Soil cover of secondary deciduous-coniferous forests which replace cut forests are characterized with a varied <b>soil</b> <b>contour</b> and {{a combination of the}} main type of podzolic soils under undisturbed spruce forests. The increased surface hydromorphism in cut areas causes formation of complicated sub-types of podzolic texturally differentiated soils (podzolic surface-gley soils with microprofile of podzol) and enlarges their ratio (up to 35 – 38 %) in soil cover structure. Temporary soil over-wetting at the initial (5 – 10 years) stage of after-cutting self-restoring vegetation succession provides for soil gleyzation, improves yield and segregation of iron compounds, increases the migratory activity of humic substances. Low content and resources of total nitrogen in forest litters mark anthropogenic transformation processes of podzolic soils at this stage. Later (in 30 – 40 years after logging), soils in cut areas still retain signs of hydromorphism. Forest litters are denser, less acidic and thick with a low weight ratio of organic carbon as compared with Albeluvisols of undisturbed spruce forest. The upper mineral soil horizons under secondary deciduous-coniferous forests contain larger amounts of total iron, its mobile (oxalate-dissolvable) components, and Fe-Mn-concretions...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of contour furrows, drill seeding, and aeration treatments in capturing overland flow, concentrating resources, and establishing perennial bunch grasses to convert dysfunctional semiarid rangeland to a functional rangeland. The site, located on the Edwards Plateau in west Texas, USA, had bare, structurally crusted soils with sparse short-grasses (Scleropogon brevifolius). The site had a low infiltration rate contributing to excess overland flow and loss of nutrients, organic matter, and <b>soil.</b> <b>Contour</b> furrows were installed with varying intra-furrow distances (0. 6 to 61 m) and then broadcast seeded to determine if furrow spacing would produce a vegetative response. Portions of the intra-furrow areas were aerated and drill seeded. All seed mixes contained warm season, perennial bunch grasses (Bouteloua curtipendula, Leptochloa dubia, and Setaria leucopila). Soil beneath furrows had greater soil water content (p-value < 0. 05) than intra-furrow areas. Furrow plots had greater density of seeded grasses and total vegetation (19 individuals m- 2 and 191 individuals m- 2, respectively) than intra-furrow plots (0 individuals m- 2 and 89 individuals m- 2, respectively). This study supports other findings that suggest 1. 5 m to 1. 8 m is optimum intra-furrow spacing. Vegetative responses to drill seeding and aeration treatments were insignificant. Observations suggest that contour furrows are effective at establishment and support of perennial vegetation by capturing and retaining water that otherwise would be lost to runoff from untreated soil...|$|E

Artificial refugia are any manmade objects that the animals may use for shelter (e. g. bird houses, bamboo stakes, lengths of pipe, etc.). By choosing refugia that the animals will readily enter and from which they may be easily removed, sampling can be directed toward particular species or size classes. Several variables have been considered when examining bias in sampling using these refugia. Among these variables are inside diameter of the pipes, pipe length, associated vegetation and height above ground. Our observations were not intended as an evaluation of polyvinyl chloride pipe traps as a sampling technique but rather were part of a study examining invertebrate and amphibian faunas associated with slope wetlands. Slope wetlands are wetlands formed where <b>soil</b> <b>contours</b> favor outcropping of water to the surface to form pools or channels often connected to streams.

This study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the same on Nitosols of Achefer District, Northwestern Ethiopia. The landuse systems studied included grassland, cultivated land, plantation forest and natural forest. The research was superimposed on land use systems that were located nearby on similar <b>soil,</b> <b>contour</b> line and slope classes. Undisturbed core and disturbed composite soil samples were collected randomly from two sites with three replications for each landuse system at two varying depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm). The undisturbed soil samples were analysed for bulk density, particle density, porosity and moisture content at different pressures; while the composite soil samples were analyzed for pH, organic carbon, total N and available P. Results of the study indicated that the lowest bulk and particle densities, the highest total porosity, and higher moisture content at both field capacity and permanent wilting percentage were found under natural forest land use system. In contrast, the highest bulk and particle densities, the lowest total porosity and lower water contents at both field capacity and permanent wilting percentage were obtained under the cultivated landuse system. Soil pH was moderately acidic under all landuse systems. The lowest organic carbon, total N, and C:N ratio were recorded under cultivated land; whereas the highest values of the same parameters were found under natural forest. In all landuse systems, organic carbon and total N decreased with soil depth. The highest and lowest available P contents were recorded under natural forest and grassland, respectively. From {{the results of the}} study it was possible to conclude that conversion of forest lands to cultivated and grasslands had detrimental effects on the soil physico-chemical properties under subsistance farming systems of the study area.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{region in}} the central Avon catchment is declining in both arable land and native vegetation. This decline has been due to the clearance of large tracts of native vegetation and its subsequent replacement by exotic crops and pasture species. The loss of vegetation has led to regional land degradation {{in the form of}} soil erosion and land salinisation. Therefore, changes in land management practices are required to make agricultural production more compatible with land conservation. Revegetation using native plants is the only management solution that integrates both land and ecological conservation with agricultural productivity. The continuation of current agricultural land use will therefore depend on the development of effective methods of revegetation. The land manager predominantly has a choice between directly sowing seeds and or planting nursery seedlings as methods of revegetation on degraded land. The widespread problem of land degradation in the Avon catchment dictates that the revegetation method chosen must be effective in terms of both seedling establishment and cost on a broad scale. To determine which method is most effective in revegetation, a series of laboratory and field trials were conducted. A trial was conducted in seed germination incubators to determine the relative importance of genetic and environmental influences on seed viability. The genetics of the seed stock had a significant influence on germination between different biolocalities. Similarly, environmental factors such as different temperature regimes also had a significant influence on seed germination. Consequently, a relationship was established between optimum germination temperature and the average mean winter temperature of the biolocality where the seed was collected. This suggests that temperature may influence seed genetics and subsequent germination, which varied according to the biolocality. The identification of environmental parameters that influenced seed germination provided a basis for comparison between direct seeding versus planted nursery seedlings in the field. The number of seedlings established {{in the second and third}} year at York was greater for direct seeding than from planted nursery seedlings with the exception of two species belonging to the Leguminosae family. However, the failure of seedlings from either method to become established in the field at Tammin emphasised the need to employ a post-sowing and planting management programme. The costs of seedling establishment using the direct seeding method was approximately one sixth the cost of nursery seedlings with the exception of Kennedia prostrata. The cost and time invested in revegetation programmes necessitates that the optimum seed biolocality should be selected in order to produce the most effective plant establishment from direct seeding in the field. Biolocality selection based on geographical distance alone did not produce conclusive criteria for effective revegetation. However, the matching of biogeographical regions and climatic conditions with the site of revegetation produced the most effective plant establishment. This predominantly resulted in the selection of a local species but in some situations biolocalities from further afield with a similar climate, also proved effective. The invasion of weeds at both the York and Tammin trial sites emphasise the potential effects on the establishment of native vegetation. The growth (height 2 ̆ 6 stem width) of nursery seedlings was significantly reduced while the growth height decreased and the mortality of direct seeded seedlings increased when subjected to weed competition. Reversing the trend in land and ecological degradation within the central Avon catchment can only be achieved through a revegetation programme that integrates nature conservation with agricultural productivity. Direct seeding is a cost effective method of plant establishment provided that adequate attention is given to pre-seed treatment, seed quality testing, selection of the optimum seed biolocality, <b>soil</b> <b>contour</b> and profile preparation and post sowing control of both weed and predators. However, revegetation of degraded land using nursery seedlings can be just as effective when the cost of seed is expensive and difficult to germinate. If the central Avon wheatbelt is to continue to function as the 2 ̆ 7 bread bowl 2 ̆ 7 of Western Australia then the establishment of native vegetation can only be achieved through the use of direct seeding methods on a broad scale. Current land management practises and the conservation of the remaining remnant vegetation will not maintain a sustainable agricultural based economy or adequately represent existing biodiversity in the central Avon catchment...|$|E

The treatments were: cultivation along contour lines, cultivation down the slope and exposed soil.

30|$|Studies {{revealed}} that SWC has been {{implemented in the}} Tigray Region, of northern Ethiopia since 1985. The implementation was more effective from the early 90 s due to the more emphasis given by the government towards land rehabilitation. The implementation of SWC {{in the region as}} a strategy was to reduce run-off, improve soil fertility and finally reverse the degraded landscape for the betterment of the rural livelihood. This study evaluated changes in vegetation cover following the implementation of SWC measures. Satellite images were used to generate SAVI and LST, whereas long-term AAP records were also used to account for the effects of precipitation. The implementation of different forms of SWC activities, such as area exclosure, stone terraces, <b>soil</b> bunds, <b>contour</b> ditches, moisture retention reservoirs and check dams are an optimal solution to reverse the vegetation degraded landscape of arid and semi-arid regions in Ethiopia. The supplemental survey made in the study area asserts that 95 % of the respondents observed a vegetation cover improvement in their locality over the last 25  years. This was due to the proper implementation of SWC, particularly the practice of area exclosure in protecting from human and livestock interference for better restoration. When degraded landscape protected with different SWC practices, run-off will reduce, infiltration capacity will increase, which retain soil moisture and finally improve vegetation density. In order to achieve such results, the involvement of local communities at all processes in the conservation program is essential. On this matter, Bewket (2007) argued that the success of any SWC intervention depends {{on the extent to which}} the introduced conservation technologies are accepted and adopted by the farmers.|$|R

For example, many soil properties are directly {{used in the}} modelling of environmental processes such as global climate change. These aspects have not previously been studied at this level in La Rioja (a region of Spain with a humid Mediterranean environment). The intention {{of this study was}} to provide quantitative information on soil assessment and mapping methods for natural soils in a humid Mediterranean environment. The properties considered included: pH and organic matter, calcium carbonate and clay contents. For testing, samples were selected from several different soil types which, in theory, were only affected by pedogenetic processes and had developed on different parent materials. More than half of the samples did not contain any CaCO 3, while the rest of the samples presented a variety of CaCO 3, forms, with high percentages being present in certain cases (up to 65 % on the surface). It was possible to establish two different areas: one predominantly acidic and the other principally basic. The predominately basic samples were due to the high percentage of carbonate in the parent materials. The clay content on the surface was similar to that in the subsurface layers. Finally, the organic matter contents in the uppermost layers presented average values of 3. 9 %,with a range of from 0. 3 to 17. 5 %. The major variations in soils were determined by soil type (therefore by soil forming processes), parent material composition, and vegetation type. This study reveals that these methods are useful to determine the spatial distribution of some soil properties in undisturbed <b>soils.</b> The <b>contour</b> maps of <b>soil</b> property variability could be used to improve future sampling designs and management decision...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{present an}} {{exploration}} of soil matric suction effected by water uptake via tree root at toe of slope on various condition between wet condition (high rainfall) and dry condition (prolonged no rainfall). Matric suction generated by active root tree has substantial influence soil moisture content on residual soil slope. A field monitoring was carried out to collect matric suction data at slope in two conditions; with a tree located at toe of slope and absent of a tree. The installations of instruments particularly at slope with tree at toe were placed within vicinity of the tree with certain depths and distances. The matric suction data from field monitoring was influence by the rainfall events {{that lead to the}} instability of soils slope. Analysis of soil matric suction distribution pattern indicates that the highest matric suction value was at shallower depth and proximity of tree. The matric suction profiles obtained from field monitoring are applied as an input data to develop <b>soil</b> matric suction <b>contour.</b> The effect of transpiration driven by active root zone generated matric suction on soil at vicinity of tree may create dry soil to increase soil shear strength...|$|R

Data were converted to raster format for various planning analyses using the Map Analysis Package. The project raised the issues of data resolution, accuracy, and volume, and the relative priority of the different information types when combining data for analysis and display. The project has also motivated ongoing design and implementation of new software with a more interactive error finding approach to geographic data base construction. The software features fully graphic entry and editing of geometric and attribute data with "smart " capabilities to develop and maintain full topological consistency. Interfaces to scanning hardware and software, output to the ODYSSEY Geographic Information System and common polygon-based microcomputer mapping packages, and conversion to raster format {{are included in the}} software.

40|$|Environmental {{protection}} and conservation of tourism hot-spots {{can be controlled}} through management planning, zoning and permitting. This methodology will allow government bodies and agencies to assess natural and cultural values of a selected area consistently. A common approach to management and control of conservation areas within a tourist hotspot is {{through the use of}} a visualisation and spatial analysis techniques within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Visualisation has been the foundation of scientific progress throughout history and with current technology GIS has advanced these visualisation techniques to develop powerful three-dimensional graphical computing environments. This type of GIS planning methodology involves the identification of a range of environmental, social and economic issues that have an influence on a specific tourist location or study area. The general objective of this project is to strengthen tourism planning and conservation through GIS applications such as visualisation, 3 D fly-through and spatial analysis. GIS can be regarded as providing a toolbox of techniques and technologies of wide applicability to the achievement of sustainable tourism development (Giles, 2003, p. 2). These objectives will be achieved through providing examples of how GIS visualisation and analysis techniques were used within the Currumbin Valley study area, Examples include: - Research and identify suitable and relevant spatial data sets for GIS analysis and modelling ie. Major roads, dwellings, <b>soil</b> coverage, <b>contour</b> data and regional ecosystems; - Use a Global Positioning System (GPS) to identify existing walking tracks; - Develop a 3 D model to include a DEM and digital aerial photography of the study area, and; - Create a virtual fly-through that will display existing natural and man-made features, landscape sensitivities, terrain analysis and conservation assessment for an existing tourism area. These visualisation techniques provide GIS users with tools to develop a higher level of thinking and problem solving which in turn will give a better understanding for decisions not only in the tourism and conservation industries but a wide range of planning, environment and engineering projects...|$|R

Using the remotely sensed images of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite P 6 IRS P 6 Linear Imaging Self Scanner IIILISS III images captured in October 2010 and November 2011 having resolution of 23. 5 m X 23. 5 m and images from Google Earth Pro of study area were used and cartosat satellites. Map of India with scale 11500000 and soil maps of India {{were used for the}} experimental study. The thematic maps like drainage map land use and land cover map <b>soil</b> maps and <b>contour</b> map were prepared adopting the PCI Geomatica 10. 0 software. The geographical information systems GIS analysis was made for the said themes using the Arc GIS ArcMap 10. 0. The Karwadi- Nandapur watershed was found to be the third order basin. The present study aims to assess the morphometric characteristics of the watershed basin and it has been assessed by applying GIS techniques. Strahlers method has been employed to assess the fluvial characteristics of the study watershed. Each morphometric characteristic is considered as a single parameter and knowledge based weight age has been assigned by considering its role in soil erosion. The morphometric properties determined for this watershed as a whole and for each watershed will be useful for the efficient planning of water harvesting and groundwater projects on watershed basis...|$|R

40|$|Contour hedgerow systems {{consisting}} of various combinations of tree and grass species {{can be used}} on sloping lands to minimize erosion, restore fertility, and improve crop productivity, but there is need {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} each system for its suitability at any locality as effective erosion control. The objectives of this study were to determine the amount of <b>soil</b> conserved by <b>contour</b> calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus) –Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) hedgerows, and then develop a support practice P-subfactor for conservation planning in central Kenya. As a benefit beyond soil conservation, biomass yield and N and P retention by the hedgerows were determined. Cumulative data for five cropping seasons from 1997 to 1999 indicated that the contour hedges on 20 % slope conserved more soil (168 Mg ha− 1) than on the 40 % slope (146 Mg ha− 1) compared to the control plots. For both slopes, this was equivalent to a 0. 7 P-subfactor for use by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model in predicting soil erosion. The N and P losses between the hedges and control were statistically significant only on the 20 % slope (P = 0. 05). Combined biomass yield from the calliandra–Napier grass hedges were 12 and 9 Mg ha− 1 per year and 40 % slopes, respectively. This soil conservation technology may be used by small-scale farmers that use mixed farming systems in the highlands of central Kenya and similar ecoregions as a step towards sustainable farming...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>soil</b> {{conservation}} systems: <b>contour</b> drainage, strip cropping, and terracing, {{were designed}} and established within separate plots on hillside farmlands in St. Lucia. A control plot with no form of soil conservation was also established. Topographic and soils surveys of these plots were conducted. Rainfall, runoff and soil loss were measured over one wet season. Crop yields and construction and maintenance costs were also determined. For rainfall amounts between 14. 2 and 211. 2 mm, runoff depths varied from 0. 6 to 203. 6 mm {{in the control}} plot, 2. 1 to 199. 2 mm in the contour drained plot, 3. 2 to 155. 1 mm in the strip cropped plot and 1. 3 to 94. 7 mm in the terraced plot. The largest amounts of runoff were most often recorded in the strip cropped plot, while on most occasions, the terraced plot produced the least runoff. Soil loss rates varied from 0. 01 to 1. 77 kg/ha in the control plot, 0. 07 to 16. 88 kg/ha in the contour drained plot, 0. 2 to 28. 86 kg/ha in the strip cropped plot and 0. 01 to 6. 62 kg/ha in the terraced plot. Construction costs per hectare were EC$ 5565 for the contour drainage system, EC $ 5425 for the strip cropped system and EC$ 6350 for the terraced system. Further monitoring of the conservation systems is required for prediction of their long-term effectiveness in runoff and soil erosion control...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S. Geology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Publicly {{accessible}} {{soil and}} groundwater geochemistry databases were utilized {{to identify the}} distribution of major cations and anions in groundwater and cations in soil in the southern San Joaquin Valley (study area). The study area was divided into three geographic subareas based on proximity to the San Joaquin Valley axis and {{the presence or absence}} of the Corcoran Clay. These subareas were then further divided into intermediate and deeper groundwater intervals with the top of the Corcoran Clay or projected depth to the top of the Corcoran Clay as the boundary between the two intervals. Groundwater data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) databases were screened and used to present the spatial distribution of major ions in groundwater. Data from the USGS National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) were used present the spatial distribution of major cations in <b>soil.</b> Concentration <b>contour</b> maps, Piper plots, box-whisker plots, and scatter plots indicate that groundwater chemistry varies across the study area and that the Corcoran Clay limits mixing of intermediate and deep groundwater where the Corcoran Clay is present. In general, cation distribution in intermediate groundwater is dominated by sodium (Na) with magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) increasing in concentration in the southern and eastern parts of the study area. Intermediate groundwater is dominated by chloride (Cl-) across the western portion of the study area and sulfate (SO 42 -) across the eastern portion of the study area. The distribution of cations and anions in deep groundwater was similar to the intermediate groundwater with elevated concentrations of Na across the study area, elevated concentration of Cl- across the western portion of the study area, and elevated concentrations of SO 42 - across the eastern portion of the study area. Statistical analysis showed that Ca (negative correlation) and K (positive correlation) present the strongest correlations between intermediate groundwater chemistry and soil chemistry. Similarly, Ca (negative correlation) presented the strongest correlation between deep groundwater chemistry and soil chemistry; K showed a weak (positive) correlation between soil and deep groundwater chemistry. In addition, positive correlations were found between the molar ratio Mg:Na in soil and in both intermediate and deep groundwater [...] Geolog...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a basis for}} a land information system for the 40 ha subtropical highland catchment of Wang Jia, Yunnan Province, China. Information, including meteorology, geology, geomorphology, biology, pedology and crop productivity, was integrated using a geomorphopedological approach and expressed as maps using GIS. The developed protocol is proposed as a generic system, applicable to agricultural land evaluation in subtropical highland catchments. The results demonstrate that Wang Jia Catchment is relatively representative of the region, in terms of geomorphological features and land cover. Catchment soils, developed from residual, colluvial and alluvial materials of sandstone, shale and dolomite on different landscapes, were still young and strongly influenced by their geological parent material. Soils were normally slightly acidic to neutral. Soil fertility varied from poor to very fertile. Maize yield was significantly correlated with soil pH, total N, available N, P and K and thus the Soil Fertility Index. In 2002, maize yield was significantly correlated with manure and urea applications. There was considerable potential to increase maize yield with modified and innovative cropping practices in the catchment. Adopted primarily as a <b>soil</b> conservation practice, <b>contour</b> cultivation did not increase maize yield compared to downslope cultivation. Polythene mulch tended to increase maize yield in most years. These results largely accord with the results from controlled research plots in the same catchment. Analysis of intra-plot variations showed that soil samples from planting pits had higher total soil organic matter, total N, available N, available P and available K than inter-row samples, but with higher standard deviations. Most soil fertility parameters for inter-row samples were more similar to traditional random composite samples. These results suggest if composite samples were taken only from inter-rows, the results would have been similar, but the risk of sampling error would have been reduced.
