500|$|For {{purposes}} of identification, {{the positions of}} navigational stars [...] expressed as declination and <b>sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> [...] are often rounded to the nearest degree. [...] In addition to tables, star charts provide an aid to the navigator in identifying the navigational stars, showing constellations, relative positions, and brightness.|$|E
500|$|Each star's {{approximate}} {{position on}} the celestial sphere is given using the equatorial coordinate system. [...] The celestial sphere is an imaginary globe of infinite size with the Earth at its center. [...] Positions on the celestial sphere are often expressed using two coordinates: declination and <b>sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> which are similar to latitude and longitude {{on the surface of}} the Earth. [...] To define declination, the Earth's equator is projected out to the celestial sphere to construct the celestial equator, and declination is measured in degrees north or south of this celestial equator. [...] <b>Sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is a measurement between 0 and 360 degrees, indicating how far west a body is from an arbitrarily chosen point on the celestial sphere called the First Point of Aries.|$|E
500|$|In {{the star}} chart to the right, {{declination}} {{is shown by}} the radial coordinate, starting at 90° north {{in the center and}} decreasing to 30° north at the outer edge. [...] <b>Sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is shown as the angular coordinate, starting at 0° at the left of the chart, and increasing counter-clockwise.|$|E
50|$|A {{culminating}} {{star on the}} observer's meridian {{is said to have}} a zero <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (0h). One <b>sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> (approximately 0.9973 solar hours) later, Earth's rotation {{will carry}} the star {{to the west of the}} meridian, and its <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> will be +1h. When calculating topocentric phenomena, right ascension may be converted into <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> as an intermediate step.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a Microsoft Excel application that utilizes eclipsing binary ephemerides to calculate useful information for a program of observing eclipsing binary systems. Eclipsing binary star systems consist of two stars orbiting a common center of mass and oriented so that their plane of orbit is {{in the line of}} sight relative to the observer allowing the stars to eclipse each other. Consistent monitoring of eclipsing binary stars is important for establishing fundamental astronomical parameters, for instance mass and composition of stellar systems, and this application supports effective use of resources in such monitoring programs. The input variables to the application include system coordinates, system period, starting Epoch, and the user’s latitude and longitude. The program uses astronomical algorithms to calculate the epoch, Julian date, Gregorian date, local time, times of primary/secondary eclipse, altitude, Universal Time, Local Mean <b>Sidereal</b> Time, and <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of the eclipsing binary system. Currently the project is setup for the eclipsing binary system SV Camelopardalis. The calculator has been demonstrated effective through its application to obtain differential photometry data for SV Camelopardalis, a system which is of interest because of variability in its period by a potential third body...|$|R

50|$|Because right ascensions are {{measured}} in hours (of {{rotation of the}} Earth), they can be usedto time the positions of objects in the sky. For example, if a star with RA = 01h 30m 00s is on the meridian, then a star with RA = 20h 00m 00s {{will be on the}} meridian 18.5 <b>sidereal</b> <b>hours</b> later.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively {{to right}} ascension, <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (abbreviated HA or LHA, local <b>hour</b> <b>angle),</b> a left-handed system, {{measures}} the angular distance {{of an object}} westward along the celestial equator from the observer's meridian to the hour circle passing through the object. Unlike right ascension, <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is always increasing with the rotation of Earth. <b>Hour</b> <b>angle</b> may be considered a means of measuring the time since upper culmination, the moment when an object contacts the meridian overhead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> used in {{celestial}} navigation, {{is similar}} to right ascension, but increases westward rather than eastward. Usually measured in degrees (°), it is the complement of right ascension with respect to 24h.It {{is important not to}} confuse <b>sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> with the astronomical concept of hour angle, which measures angular distance of an object westward from the local meridian.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, {{hour angle}} {{is defined as}} the angular {{distance}} on the celestial sphere measured westward along the celestial equator from the meridian to the hour circle passing through a point. It may be given in degrees, time, or rotations depending on the application.In celestial navigation, the convention is to measure in degrees westward from the prime meridian (Greenwich hour angle, GHA), from the local meridian (local hour angle, LHA) or from the first point of Aries (<b>sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> SHA).|$|E
50|$|To {{calculate}} the azimuth {{of the sun}} or a star given its declination and <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace φ2 with declination and longitude difference with <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> and change the sign (since the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is positive westward instead of east).|$|R
50|$|Negative <b>hour</b> <b>angles</b> {{indicate}} the {{time until the}} next transit across the meridian; an <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of zero means the object is on the meridian.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{nautical}} almanac, the declination (celestial latitude), and the Greenwich <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (celestial longitude) {{are obtained}} {{of the observed}} object for the time of observation. The assumed longitude is now added or subtracted to the Greenwich <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle</b> of the object to obtain the local <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> that is the difference in longitude between the DR position and the geographical position of the object.|$|R
50|$|The cosine of the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (cos(h)) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the solar zenith angle. At solar noon, h = 0.000 so cos(h)=1, and before and after solar noon the cos(± h) term = the same value for morning (negative <b>hour</b> <b>angle)</b> or afternoon (positive <b>hour</b> <b>angle),</b> i.e. the sun is at the same altitude in the sky at 11:00AM and 1:00PM solar time, etc.|$|R

50|$|Observing the sun from earth, {{the solar}} <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is an {{expression}} of time, expressed in angular measurement, usually degrees, from solar noon. At solar noon the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is 0.000 degree, with the time before solar noon expressed as negative degrees, and the local time after solar noon expressed as positive degrees. For example, at 10:30 AM local apparent time the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is -22.5° (15° per hour times 1.5 hours before noon).|$|R
50|$|Next, the {{altitude}} and azimuth of the celestial body are computed for a selected position (assumed position or AP). This involves resolving a spherical triangle. Given the three magnitudes: local <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (LHA), observed body's declination (dec), and assumed latitude (lat), {{the altitude}} Hc and azimuth Zn must be computed. The local <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> LHA, {{is the difference}} between the AP longitude and the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of the observed object. It is always measured in a westerly direction from the assumed position.|$|R
50|$|With B the {{latitude}} (+N/S), L the longitude (+E/−W), LHA = GHA + L {{is the local}} <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> Dec and GHA are the declination and Greenwich <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of the star observed, and Hc the calculated altitude. Z is the calculated azimuth of the body.|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} difference regarding satellite footprints is {{the repetition}} frequency of each footprint. For the GPS, the satellite constellation repeats approximately every 12 <b>sidereal</b> <b>hours,</b> {{which means that}} the footprint repeats with the same period [24] and each satellite will illuminate the same area every orbit. However, for GLONASS, the satellite constellation repeats approximately every 8 sidereal days. Thus, the combined use of GPS and GLONASS gives both a better temporal resolution (more sea level observations per time unit) and spatial resolution (better sea surface coverage per time unit) than each system alone.|$|R
50|$|Local {{sidereal time}} at any {{locality}} {{differs from the}} Greenwich sidereal time value of the same moment, by an amount that {{is proportional to the}} longitude of the locality. When one moves eastward 15° in longitude, sidereal time is larger by one <b>sidereal</b> <b>hour</b> (note that it wraps around at 24 hours). Unlike the reckoning of local solar time in time zones, incrementing by (usually) one hour, differences in local sidereal time are reckoned based on actual measured longitude, to the accuracy of the measurement of the longitude, not just in whole hours.|$|R
