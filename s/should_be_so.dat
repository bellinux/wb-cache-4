5|$|In 1975, Peter Dodson, {{examining}} {{why there}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> many species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within {{such a short}} geological time frame and small area, published {{the results of a}} morphometric study in which he measured dozens of skulls. He found that many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes. For Lambeosaurus, he found that L. clavinitialis was probably the female of L. lambei, and Corythosaurus frontalis and Procheneosaurus praeceps were probably its juveniles. L. magnicristatus was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted Procheneosaurus cranibrevis and P. erectofrons as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the Procheneosaurus/Tetragonosaurus remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of P. cranibrevis was a Lambeosaurus juvenile, whereas others were Corythosaurus, based on the distinctive form of the contact of the nasal bone with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> as not to cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by {{the first year of}} Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E

5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote The Geographical Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|E

It was not only that Timarkhos had left this man—who {{no longer had the}} funds to support him—but that he had 'collected' protectors; proving, according to Aeschines, that he was not a kept boy (hêtairêkôs), but a vulgar whore (peporneumenos).|$|E
25|$|In the 1919 Cost Accounting Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.|$|E

25|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is discussed by Chatterjee as being highly derived in Protoavis, displaying synapomorphies of avialans more derived than Archaeopteryx, including {{the presence of}} a hypocleidium-bearing furcula, and a hypertrophied, carinate sternum. Chatterjee's interpretation of the fossils identified as such in his reviews of the Protoavis material are open to question due to the preservation quality of the elements and as of this time, {{it is not clear whether}} either character was in fact present in Protoavis. The glenoid appears to be oriented dorsolaterally permitting a wide range of humeral movement. Chatterjee implies that this is a highly derived trait which allies Protoavis to Aves, but why this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> is not clearly discussed in the descriptions of the animal. In and of itself, the orientation of the glenoid is not a sufficient basis for placing Protoavis within Aves. The scapular blade is far broader than illustrated by Chatterjee in his 1997 account, and not particularly avian in its gross form. The coracoid, identified by Chatterjee as strut-like and retroverted, is, like the supposed furcula and sternum, too poorly preserved to permit accurate identification. Moreover, the original spatial relationship of the alleged coracoid to the scapula is entirely unknown. Uncinate processes and sternal ribs are missing.|$|E

500|$|Kylie had {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Chris True from AllMusic gave it two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, giving it a mixed review. He said [...] "While the production values on Kylie's debut are dated at best and the tunes are nothing but standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum, there are some rather endearing qualities to it. Firstly, she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock, et al." [...] He did say that Minogue would become a pop star and a [...] "European icon". Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five. The stand out track, he said, was [...] "I <b>Should</b> <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> Lucky", as he said [...] "but anyone who denies 'I <b>Should</b> <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> Lucky' classic status has clearly let their tune detection muscles turn to flab". He also finished saying [...] "The bog-standard S.A.W. production renders Kylie as dated as that haircut on the album cover, and it's as loaded with variety as a loaf of bread, but the little Aussie pop rocket is already showing signs of personality and the record's quintessentially '80s charm ultimately wins through." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of her debut single [...] "Locomotion" [...] in Australia, Minogue {{traveled}} to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I <b>Should</b> <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> Lucky" [...] in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response {{to what he had}} learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia, attractive and very talented, there had to be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. After hearing the song, Waterman said [...] "I thought it was fantastic, so I ran over to the DJ and asked him what it was. He said 'Its Kylie Minogue - I <b>Should</b> <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> Lucky'." [...] He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit.|$|E

The album was produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who also wrote nine of the ten tracks on the album. Most of the album's composition is disco music, with strong bubblegum pop influences. The album contains a few ballads, namely [...] "Je ne sais pas pourquoi", [...] "It's No Secret", [...] "I'll Still Be Loving You" [...] and [...] "I Miss You".
