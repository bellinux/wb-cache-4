40|$|The first {{electrochemical}} lithium insertion {{was characterized}} for several graphite materials with {{high degree of}} crystallinity, different particle size distributions and surface morphologies in an ethylene carbonate (EC) /propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. For coarser graphite materials and graphites with a low <b>superficial</b> <b>defect</b> concentration, an irreversible process was observed which correlated with the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. Different natural and synthetic graphites with similar particle size distribution and active surface area showed differences in the passivation behavior during the first electrochemical reduction. The fraction of graphite particles exfoliating during the first galvanostatic lithium insertion linearly increased with length of the irreversible plateau, which concomitantly moved to more positive potentials. This behavior can be rationalized when considering, besides the surface structure, local overpotentials for the solid elect rolyte interphase formation process, and especially the overpotential distribution through the graphite electrode. These overpotentials cause a distribution of the local current density attributed to the passivation process. Optimizing the particle contacts in the electrode by applying mechanical pressure or by selecting the proper binder decreased the overpotentials and suppressed the graphite exfoliation in the EC/PC electrolyte. Therefore, both graphite surface structure and electrode engineering aspects {{have to be considered}} for successful passivation against exfoliation...|$|E

ResultsAt 8 weeks, implants that had been held in place exclusively with a PF were well integrated both laterally and basally. The repair tissue manifested an architecture {{similar to that of}} hyaline articular cartilage. However, most of the implants that had been glued in place {{in the absence of a}} PF were lost during the initial 4 -week phase of restricted joint movement.

Traditionally, the forehead flap is transferred in two stages, where the flap is thinned during the first stage to improve the aesthetic result, possibly jeopardizing its vascularity and increasing chance for flap necrosis. To overcome this problem, Menick described a three stage forehead flap technique, where initially the flap is transferred containing all tissue layers, making it an extremely safe technique. Only during the second stage, the flap - which now acts as a delayed flap - can safely be thinned aggressively according to aesthetic needs. During the final stage the pedicle is severed, the flap is thinned further and pedicle and flap are trimmed and inset.

The incorporation of Zr and Pr dopants in the ceria lattice increases the amount of surface defects and then the reactivity for the CO oxidation, in the order CeO 2 [*]<[*]Ce 80 Zr 20 [*]<[*]Ce 80 Zr 10 Pr 10 [*]<[*]Ce 80 Pr 20.

In the present case, the most active catalysts resulted to be pure ceria synthesized at either 2  ml min− 1 or 20  ml min− 1. Thus, the oxygen vacancies do not exhibit a direct beneficial effect on the soot oxidation reaction for these ceria-based materials, thus showing a different catalytic behavior for the two oxidation reactions.|$|R
40|$|Usual heat {{treatments}} of steels like austenitization are generally conducted in air. In such atmosphere, {{a part of}} the atoms of carbon could be removed from the superficial zone of steel. Indeed, those atoms of carbon, combined with oxygen present in atmosphere, can take gaseous form of carbon monoxide due to the great attraction between atoms of carbon and oxygen. This well-known phenomenon is called decarburizing. It can change microstructure to a large extent and, as a result, bring dramatic modifications of mechanical properties of steel, like decrease of fatigue lifetime. To characterize the extent of decarburizing phenomenon, observations by optical microscopy and/or hardness profiles measurements must be performed in a cross section, as it is advised by international standard. Until today, the eddy current technique is used to detect <b>superficial</b> <b>defects.</b> In practice, the control consists to create two groups of available samples or not, from a large sampling. In this study, we propose to estimate the decarburizing extent. In the present work, different durations of austenitizing at 920 °C temperature before oil quenching (50 °C) were performed on the SAE 92 V 45 steel in order to obtain various morphologies and different total depths of the decarburized zone. We will show, in the continuation, how eddy currents control is used to assess the level of decarburizing after a Fourier transformation performed on the output signal. This analysis allows us to link the harmonic decomposition of the signal to the duration of the heat treatment and/or to the total decarburizing depth and, consequently, to the mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Enamel microabrasion {{has become}} {{accepted}} as a conservative, nonrestorative method of removing intrinsic and <b>superficial</b> dysmineralization <b>defects</b> from dental fluorosis, restoring esthetics with minimal loss of enamel. However, {{it can be difficult}} to determine if restoration is necessary in dental fluorosis, because the lesion depth is often not easily recognized. This case report presents a method for analysis of enamel hypoplasia that uses quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) followed by a combination of enamel microabrasion with carbamide peroxide home bleaching. We describe the utility of QLF when selecting a conservative treatment plan and confirming treatment efficacy. In this case, the treatment plan was based on QLF analysis, and the selected combination treatment of microabrasion and bleaching had good results...|$|R
