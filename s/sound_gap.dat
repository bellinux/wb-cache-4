Murrow remained and the entire [...] "Trip to the Moon" [...] clips were cut. Since the opening shot of Murrow was 1.33 window boxed in the wide frame, they had to crop and blow up that shot for the 2.35 ratio which made it very grainy. The intermission was also cut for the 1968 re-release which included the freeze frame {{of the ship and}} fade into the second half. The reels justjump cut with an awkward <b>sound</b> <b>gap</b> {{between the first and second}} half. The chase scene was missing from this version too which reduced the running time to 167 minutes. However, some uncut 179-minute 35mm Technicolor prints were struck too which meant at least some theatres played the Roadshow version even though the vast majority showed the shorter cut. 35mm IB/Scope copiesof both versions exist from 1968. The 24 frames per second 70mm prints were also the 167-minute version in that year too. As a publicity stunt, Todd Jr. called the press when he removed a 70mm copy from a bank vault claiming it had been stored there since 1956 for safe keeping and was being shown at a theatre again. It was absurd since an original 70mm would've faded to pink by 1968 and the copy they exhibited was the cut re-issue 167-minute version.|$|E
40|$|Currently, anatomically {{consistent}} segmentation of vascular trees acquired with {{magnetic resonance}} imaging {{requires the use of}} multiple image processing steps, which, in turn, depend on manual intervention. In effect, segmentation of vascular trees from medical images is time consuming and error prone due to the tortuous geometry and weak signal in small blood vessels. To overcome errors and accelerate the image processing time, we introduce an automatic image processing pipeline for constructing subject specific computational meshes for entire cerebral vasculature, including segmentation of ancillary structures; the grey and white matter, cerebrospinal fluid space, skull, and scalp. To demonstrate the validity of the new pipeline, we segmented the entire intracranial compartment with special attention of the angioarchitecture from {{magnetic resonance imaging}} acquired for two healthy volunteers. The raw images were processed through our pipeline for automatic segmentation and mesh generation. Due to partial volume effect and finite resolution, the computational meshes intersect with each other at respective interfaces. To eliminate anatomically inconsistent overlap, we utilized morphological operations to separate the structures with a physiologically <b>sound</b> <b>gap</b> spaces. The resulting meshes exhibit anatomically correct spatial extent and relative positions without intersections. For validation, we computed critical biometrics of the angioarchitecture, the cortical surfaces, ventricular system, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces and compared against literature values. Volumina and surface areas of the computational mesh were found to be in physiological ranges. In conclusion, we present an automatic image processing pipeline to automate the segmentation of the main intracranial compartments including a subject-specific vascular trees. These computational meshes can be used in 3 D immersive visualization for diagnosis, surgery planning with haptics control in virtual reality. Subject-specific computational meshes are also a prerequisite for computer simulations of cerebral hemodynamics and the effects of traumatic brain injury...|$|E

40|$|Sequences {{of higher}} {{frequency}} A and lower frequency B tones repeating in an ABA- triplet pattern {{are widely used}} to study auditory streaming. One may experience either an integrated percept, a single ABA-ABA- stream, or a segregated percept, separate but simultaneous streams A-A-A-A- and -B [...] -B [...] . During minutes-long presentations, subjects may report irregular alternations between these interpretations. We combine neuromechanistic modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to study these persistent alternations and to characterize the effects of manipulating stimulus parameters. Unlike many phenomenological models with abstract, percept-specific competition and fixed inputs, our network model comprises neuronal units with sensory feature dependent inputs that mimic the pulsatile-like A 1 responses to tones in the ABA- triplets. It embodies a neuronal computation for percept competition thought to occur beyond primary auditory cortex (A 1). Mutual inhibition, adaptation and noise are implemented. We include slow NDMA recurrent excitation for local temporal memory that enables linkage across <b>sound</b> <b>gaps</b> from one triplet to the next. Percepts in our model are identified in the firing patterns of the neuronal units. We predict with the model that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept, the one dominant a larger fraction of time, more {{than those of the}} weaker percept-a property that has been previously established and generalized across several visual bistable paradigms. We confirm the qualitative prediction with our psychoacoustic experiments and use the behavioral data to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results.

40|$|Quantum {{mechanical}} methods {{based on}} the density functional theory (DFT) offer a realistic possibility of first-principles design of organic donor–acceptor systems and engineered band gap materials. This promise is contingent upon the ability of DFT to predict one-particle states accurately. Unfortunately, approximate functionals fail to align the orbital energies with ionization potentials. We describe a new paradigm for achieving this alignment. In the proposed model, an average electron-exchange hole separation controls {{the onset of the}} orbital-dependent exchange in approximate range-separated functionals. The correct description of one-particle states is thus achieved without explicit electron removal or attachment. Extensive numerical tests show that the proposed method provides physically <b>sound</b> orbital <b>gaps</b> and leads to excellent predictions of charge-transfer excitations and other properties critically depending on the tail of the electron density.

40|$|The locally {{resonant}} {{material is}} a composite made with statistically distributed locally resonant unit. It can completely block the elastic wave in certain frequency ranges. It provides a new and promising method for noise and vibration control. In this research, theoretical and experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to characterize the nature of such materials. In theoretical investigation, a new approach was developed to calculate the effective mass density for a sphere-type locally resonant unit, which has a hard sphere core, a soft shell layer surrounding, and a stiff host medium. The composite was developed as low-frequency sound shielding material. Different from the model in the original paper, which was based on wave propagation theory, the new approach was based on the vibration theory. The natural frequency of local resonance unit was calculated and then the composite behavior under harmonic load was investigated. It was shown that the effective mass density of the composite could turn to negative and infinite at the frequency close to resonance. In order to examine the influence of important parameters on the resonant frequency and effective mass density, parameter study has been carried out. It was found that a thicker soft layer with smaller modules could lead to lower resonant frequency. The predictions of wave spectral gap from the new approach and from the model in the literature approach were almost identical. A new membrane-type of locally resonant unit was fabricated and tested. It was consisted of hard circular plate adhered on the soft membrane that fixed in a rigid frame. It exhibited completely <b>sound</b> transmission <b>gap.</b> An analytical model was developed based on the wave propagation theory to describe the low-frequency effective mass per unit area for the composite material. The model provided a direct explanation of nature of the system and an accurate method to calculate effective mass per unit area of such a system. It was shown that the effective mass per unit area could turn to negative at certain frequency ranges, which led to complete sound attenuation. In order to measure the <b>sound</b> transmission <b>gap</b> position and verify the theoretical model, experimental work has been carried out.

Using monaural sound presentation we demonstrate a context and ability dependent ear-asymmetry in brain measures of temporal change detection. Our measure of temporal processing ability was a gap-detection task quantifying the smallest silent <b>gap</b> in a <b>sound</b> that participants could reliably detect. Our brain measure {{was the size of}} the mismatch-negativity (MMN) auditory event-related potential elicited to infrequently presented <b>gap</b> <b>sounds.</b> The MMN indexes discrimination ability and is automatically generated when the brain detects a change in a repeating pattern of sound. MMN was elicited in unattended sequences of infrequent gap-sounds presented among regular no-gap sounds. In Study 1, participants with low gap-detection thresholds (good ability) produced a significantly larger MMN to <b>gap</b> <b>sounds</b> when sequences were presented monaurally to the right-ear than to the left-ear. In Study 2, we not only replicated a right-ear-advantage for MMN in silence in good temporal processors, but also showed that this is reversed to a significant left-ear-advantage for MMN when the same sounds are presented against a background of constant low-level noise. In both studies, poor discriminators showed no ear-advantage, and in Study 2, exhibited no differential sensitivity of the ears to noise. We conclude that these data reveal a context and ability-dependent asymmetry in processing temporal information in non-speech sounds...|$|R
40|$|Aged humans show severe {{difficulties}} in temporal auditory processing tasks (e. g., speech recognition in noise, low-frequency <b>sound</b> localization, <b>gap</b> detection). A degradation of auditory function with age {{is also evident}} in experimental animals. To investigate age-related changes in temporal processing, we compared extracellular responses to temporally variable pulse trains and human speech in the inferior colliculus of young adult (3 month) and aged (3 years) Mongolian gerbils. We observed a significant decrease of selectivity to the pulse trains in neuronal responses from aged animals. This decrease in selectivity led, on the population level, {{to an increase in}} signal correlations and therefore a decrease in heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields and a decreased efficiency in encoding of speech signals. A decrease in selectivity to temporal modulations is consistent with a downregulation of the inhibitory transmitter system in aged animals. These alterations in temporal processing could underlie declines in the aging auditory system, which are unrelated to peripheral hearing loss. These declines cannot be compensated by traditional hearing aids (that rely on amplification of sound) but may rather require pharmacological treatment. ...|$|R

2500|$|Duration is {{perceived}} as how [...] "long" [...] or [...] "short" [...] a sound is and relates to onset and offset signals created by nerve responses to sounds.

Sometimes this is not directly related to the physical duration of a sound. For example; in a noisy environment, <b>gapped</b> <b>sounds</b> (sounds that stop and start) can sound as if they are continuous because the offset messages are missed owing to disruptions from noises in the same general bandwidth. This can be of great benefit in understanding distorted messages such as radio signals that suffer from interference, as (owing to this effect) the message is heard as if it was continuous.

40|$|Superior {{semicircular canal}} {{dehiscence}} (SCD) syndrome is a recently defined clinical disorder in which patients {{present to the}} clinic with vestibular symptoms, auditory symptoms, or both. Understanding the effect of SCD, {{a hole in the}} bony superior canal, on hearing will broaden our understanding of the mechanics of the inner ear and lead to better diagnosis and treatment of SCD syndrome. We evaluate the effect of SCD on cochlear responses to both air- and bone- conducted sound. In chinchilla SCD produces reversible changes in cochlear potential: an increased sensitivity to bone-conducted sound and a decreased sensitivity to air-conducted sound. Such differences in air- and bone-conducted <b>sound</b> (air-bone <b>gaps)</b> are typically associated with a conductive hearing loss due to middle-ear pathology; however, a SCD is an inner-ear pathology. We hypothesize that the SCD acts as a 'third window' into the inner ear, shunting volume velocity away from the cochlea and through the dehiscent canal, altering cochlear responses to sound. To qualitatively evaluate this hypothesis we measured sound-induced fluid motion within the SCD as well as the effect of SCD on sound-induced stapes velocity and middle-ear input admittance. (cont.) Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the SCD introduces a low-impedance shunt pathway. To quantitatively evaluate the third-window hypothesis we developed an anatomically and physiologically constrained lumped-element mechano-acoustic model that predicts the effect of SCD on cochlear responses. Our model also predicts the effect of anatomical variations, such as dehiscence size and location, on auditory sensitivity. This work demonstrates that an air-bone gap can be caused by pathological changes in inner-ear mechanics. Additionally, our model provides a framework that will be of direct clinical benefit in understanding the variable effects of SCD among patients. by Jocelyn E. Songer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In contrast, in three dimensions the Tkachenko mode frequency at long wavelengths becomes linear in the wavevector for any propagation direction out of the transverse plane. We compute the correlation functions of the vortex displacements and the superfluid order parameter for a homogeneous Bose gas of bounded extent in the axial direction. At zero temperature the vortex displacement correlations are convergent at large separation, but at finite temperatures, they grow with separation. The growth of the vortex displacements should lead to observable melting of vortex lattices at higher temperatures and somewhat lower particle number and faster rotation than in current experiments.

Despite the ecological importance of sea urchins and evidence they produce sound of their <b>sound,</b> knowledge <b>gaps</b> remain regarding the role of adult and larval sea urchins in acoustic ecology. In this thesis the sounds produced by 3 temperate and 3 tropical species of sea urchins were characterised. The soundscape of sea urchin habitat from important ecological systems (sea grass, temperate rocky reef, coral reef) in eastern Australia were also characterised. The sea urchins made a ‘crunching’ sound when feeding that was commonly produced around dawn, dusk or midnight. This sound ranged from 2 - 22 kHz with highest intensity from 2 - 8 kHz. Centrostephanus rodgersii appeared to contribute to a diurnal chorus between 2 - 8 kHz in the ‘barrens’ habitat of Jervis Bay, NSW. Analysis of the 5000 Hz 1 / 3 rd octave band revealed a difference between barrens sites of up to 10 dB re 1 µPa 2. A similar difference was found between two coral reef habitats recorded at One Tree Island, QLD. Arm angle development reflects swimming ability in sea urchin larvae and so was documented for two-armed and multi-armed larvae forms to characterise their swimming biology. In a behavioural study of early and settlement stage larvae of H. tuberculata and C. rodgersii, early stage larvae exhibited signs of negative phototaxis swimming down during the day, suggesting that they exhibit diurnal migration in the field. However, larvae did not modify this swimming behaviour in response to a reef noise.

First, we have calculated the dispersion relations of the acoustic modes by using a plane waves expansion method. We found that the surface branch exhibits both the folding effect and a band gap for the propagation along some particular directions. This {{is a very interesting}} result which demonstrates that the effects related to the existence of the band <b>gap</b> (<b>sound</b> velocity dispersion, difraction, refraction, ultrasound tunneling, etc.) can all appear, even if the thickness of the phononic. lm is much less than the penetration depth of the SAW. Then, we used an all- optical technique to monitor the spectral content of the SAW propagating along the Gamma X direction in the reduced Brillouin zone. We show that a wave with frequency in the stop band, is destructively difracted after it propagates through less than ten periods. Finally, we report on measurements of the Rayleigh wave phase velocity and we show that the transit time is independent of the distance traveled inside the phononic crystal, suggesting that tunneling trough the sample is involved.

We have a general {{understanding of}} how sea turtles perceive and respond to certain visual, magnetic, and chemical cues, but we understand very little about how they perceive and respond to acoustic cues. This dissertation explores the acoustic ecology of sea turtles, focusing on their auditory capabilities, responses to acoustic stimuli and the implications of this knowledge for their conservation. I measured the underwater and aerial hearing sensitivities of juvenile green (Chelonia mydas), hatchling leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and hatchling hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles by recording auditory evoked potential responses to tonal stimuli. Green turtles detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 600 Hz underwater (maximum sensitivity: 200 - 400 Hz) and 50 and 800 Hz in air (maximum sensitivity: 300 - 400 Hz), leatherbacks detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 200 Hz underwater (maximum sensitivity: 100 - 400 Hz) and 50 and 1, 600 Hz in air (maximum sensitivity: 50 - 400 Hz), and hawksbills detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 600 Hz in both media (maximum sensitivity: 200 - 400 Hz). Sea turtles were more sensitive to aerial than underwater stimuli when audiograms were compared in terms of sound pressure, but they were more sensitive to underwater stimuli when audiograms were compared in terms of sound intensity. I also examined the behavioral responses of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) to simulated low frequency acoustic deterrent devices (ADDs) and found that these turtles exhibited a mild, aversive response to these sounds. This finding indicates that low frequency tonal ADDs have the potential to warn sea turtles of the presence of fishing gear and suggest that field tests of ADDs are warranted.

I didn't think to look up very much about the piece when I first heard it, but when I finally did, years later, I was surprised to discover that it was one of the first pieces that Cage had written where he deliberately tried to explore silence in a structured way. So there are bars of silence and bars of <b>sound.</b> These <b>gaps,</b> or these spaces, were spaces that I felt somehow offered me the ability to enter into the piece with my own thinking. Spaces for thought, if you will, within the music, rather than a wall of sound that is all-invading. And also with Cage, as we know, there is an interest in the I Ching and various strategies that were used to generate musical compositions that would remove him to some extent from a more authoritative position of his own subjectivity. The idea of the grid—I was struggling with how to bring a number of disparate works together into a space and give them the same space. It was a question of how to address the space as well as the works within it, in a subtle but determined way. I was thinking about devising a band system, so there would be three bands, a tripartite division running horizontally around the space. It could be black, white, grey, whatever. It would give me different tiers to include works that could exist above, along side, in parallel, askance from other works. But I thought that that would almost be too crude. A much, much simpler way was just a very lightly drawn, using a 4 H pencil, linear grid that would run across all the wall surfaces from floor to ceiling, that would give a more planular space, a more extensive space, so that it didn’t feel—because of the proportion, because it’s 50 centimetres across every facet of the space—it wouldn’t feel like, ‘that’s at the top, and that’s at the bottom’. Just, ‘it’s located on the grid’. It equalises the space. For the name of the show, I was first thinking along the lines of ‘rhyme and reason’, rather than ‘rhyme or reason’, to include the analytic and conceptual as well as the emotive and the subjective. Because it seems to me that some of the most interesting works do that - however obdurate they might be, there is a sort of feeling of a mind at work, the mind that brought that thing into existence. But in having a dialogue with so many artists about their work and realising that I was being shown things I wouldn't have thought about otherwise, and also in being slightly worried that ‘rhyme and reason’ sounded almost too clear and understandable [...] . to come across this term ‘mind rhyme’—which does exist—I thought was fantastic, because it included both the conceptual and the poetic, the rhyme and the reason, but in a much more interesting way. A mind rhyme is a situation set up through language, poetry, rhyming, where the mind will anticipate the word that’s coming next. So it's possible to have a joke, a pun, an innuendo. A lot of these things revolve around a mind rhyme. But I was more thinking about, if you like, a visual mind rhyme, where you are presented with one artist's work, and you might begin to develop an understanding of that work, but because of what else is situated with it, you are somewhat confounded, or are lead to a point where there’s a kind of bifurcation, or split, and the directions are unpredictable. It creates another type of gap for the mind to work with, a space between what might have been anticipated and all kinds of unexpected associations. In thinking about another person’s work, it enters into my frame of reference and it becomes sort of a touchstone, and an important thing. It influences my own thinking. It's a form of collaboration. — As told to Kyra Kordoski Jenna Bliss uses video, performance, sound and text, to navigate public spheres intimately through letter writing and ambivalent fandom. Dreaming of singularity and collectivity simultaneously, she creates and then destroys her singular voice. Much of this work began by performing at pub open mic nights in London. Bliss recently exhibited at Woburn Slade Research Centre, London (2012); White Building [SPACE], London (2012); Piet Zwart Institute, NL (2012); and Camden Arts Centre, London (2012). She was born in Yonkers, New York, USA and currently lives and works in London. Joey Bryniarska's practice is concerned with technology, ornament, subjection, power, vitality. Within the self-reflexivity of reprographic mediums, she creates parallels between this technological food-chain and a larger system of parasitical dependency, reproduction, ornamental deceit and conditions of spectatorship. Bryniarska has exhibited at Post Box Gallery, London (2012); Collective Gallery, Edinburgh (2010); Complesso Monumentale Santo Spirito, Rome, IT (2010); and Royal Academy of Arts, London (2008). Born in Swindon, she currently lives and works in London. Céline Condorelli works, broadly speaking, with art and architecture, combining a number of approaches such as developing possibilities for ‘supporting’ the work of others, resulting in projects merging exhibition, politics, fiction, public space and whatever else feels urgent at the time. One of her long-term projects, Support Structure (in collaboration with Gavin Wade), has been exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (2008); GIL, Guangzhou, Beijing, CN (2007); and Chisenhale Gallery, London (2003). Other recent exhibitions include: Centre d’Art Contemporain de Brétigny, FR (2013); Nottingham Contemporary (2012); Victoria & Albert Museum, London (2011); Tate Modern, London (2011); and Centre Pompidou, Paris, FR (2010). Condorelli lives and works in London. Claudia Doms runs a graphic design studio and frequently collaborates with artists and editors from the UK and abroad. Since 2010 she has made a drawing a day and uses these as formal spurs for her songs, music, videos and paintings. Her work has been shown at: London Design Week (2011); Cream Espai Creatiu, Barcelona, ES (2011); Bulthaup Gallery, St. Petersburg, RU (2010); Witzenhausen Gallery, New York, USA (2010); Red October, Moscow, RU (2010); City Gallery, Tallinn, EE (2010); Meneer de Wit Gallery, Amsterdam, NL (2009); and Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, IT (2007). Born in Germany, Doms currently lives and works in London. Kati Kärki’s explorations in art have taken her through a combination of media, encompassing photography, printmaking, sculptural furniture, writing and spoken word. She has arranged discursive events, providing intimate settings for discussions about and around art. Recently she performed at Art 13 London (2013), and organized a daylong event at Whitechapel Gallery, London (2013). Kärki was born in Finland and currently lives and works in London. Elizabeth McAlpine works with video, film, installation and photography. Her work often engages with ideas of temporality, the passage of time, its tones and textures, and various ways of registering it. Recent solo exhibitions include: Laura Bartlett Gallery, London (2012); Laurel Gitlen, New York, USA (2012); Eastside Projects, Birmingham (2010); and Ballina Arts Centre, IE (2007). Her work is currently on view at The Metropolitan Museum, New York, USA.

Born in London, McAlpine currently lives and works in London. Fay Nicolson’s practice spans a set of associations around educational structures, material understanding and knowledge while approaching the difficulties of recording, coding and distributing presence and experience as information. Recent solo exhibitions include: Künstlerhaus Wien, Vienna, AT(2013); and PLAZAPLAZA, London (2012). Current group exhibitions include White Cube, Masons Yard, London (2013); and The Newbridge Project, Newcastle (2013). Other group exhibitions in 2013 include: Overgaden Institute of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen; Limoncello; and The London Art Fair, Art Projects. Born in Derby, Nicolson currently lives and works in London. Philomene Pirecki works across painting, photography, drawing, sculpture, projected image and language. Her work addresses memory, time, perception, and their representations. Pirecki often physically and conceptually references her existing works and considers how they can adapt and respond to new conditions and change over time. Recent solo exhibitions include: Green on Red Gallery, Dublin, IE (2013); MOTInternational, Brussels, BE (2012); Clockwork Gallery, Berlin, DE (2012); and Laure Genillard, London (2011). Selected group exhibitions include: Wilfried Lentz Gallery, Rotterdam, NL (2013); Wysing Art Centre, Cambridge, (2013); Supplement, London (2012); Cristina Guerra Gallery, Lisbon, PT (2012); Chelsea Space, London (2011); and The Barbican Art Gallery, London, (2010). Born in Jersey, and currently living and working in London, Pirecki founded the curatorial platform, Occassionals, a peripatetic project for artists, writers and curators to make their work public, usually over a single day or an evening. Laure Prouvost’s approach to filmmaking, often situated within atmospheric installations, employs story-telling, quick cuts, montage and deliberate misuse of language to create surprising and unpredictable work. Recent solo exhibitions include the Max Mara Prize for Women at Whitechapel Gallery, London (2013); and Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia, IT (2013). Her works have also been on view at Morra Greco Foundation, Naples, IT (2013); Tate Britain, London (2013); MOTInternational, London (2012); Sculpture Center, New York, USA (2011); and The Serpentine Gallery, London (2010). Born in Lille, France, and currently living and working in London, she is a Turner Prize 2013 nominee and was the winner of the Max Mara Prize for Women in 2011. Chooc Ly Tan’s practice is multi-disciplinary and incorporates sculpture, video, installations and performances. Through her work she attempts to see beyond the physical constants that govern people’s lives, their significance, and to make the possibility of their subjugation all the more fantastic. She asks, “what would a world devoid of physical laws, such as gravity and frames of references, geometry and time, be like”? Selected solo and group exhibitions include: Circa Projects, Newcastle (2012); Carlos/Ishikawa Gallery, London, (2012); Drawing Room, London (2012); Transmission Gallery, Glasgow (2011); and The Royal Society, London (2011). Tan was born in La Roche sur Yon, France and currently lives and works in London...|$|R
