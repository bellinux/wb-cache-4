5|$|Although she has {{campaigned on}} her husband's behalf since {{early in his}} {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E
5|$|George visited Russia {{again in}} 1867 {{to meet with}} his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was {{determined}} to find a wife {{and the idea of}} an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.|$|E

25|$|When Ruskin later {{sought to}} become engaged to a teenage girl, Rose La Touche, Rose's parents were concerned. They wrote to Gray {{to ask about}} the marriage; <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> by {{describing}} Ruskin as an oppressive husband. The engagement was broken off.|$|E
25|$|A notable remark of {{hers was}} made to the English soprano Adelaide Kemble when they {{attended}} the late concert in London by the great Italian soprano Giuditta Pasta, who was clearly past her prime.

25|$|Marie Louise was {{described}} to be frugal, especially {{in comparison to}} the excesses of her mother-in-law Henriette Amalia. Due to this frugality, she was able to give large sums to various charitable causes. On one occasion, a nobleman offered her lavish hospitality; <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> by asking if he did not feel guilty at using money he could have donated to the poor.|$|E

25|$|So Manoah {{offered to}} God a young goat and a meal-offering, {{and as the}} flame went up off the altar toward heaven, the angel ascended in the flame and disappeared, and Manoah and his wife fell on their faces, as Manoah {{realized}} that he was an angel. Manoah told his wife that they would surely die, as they had seen God, but <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> that if God had wanted to kill them, God would not have received the burnt-offering or shown them what God did.|$|E
25|$|Her {{career began}} in 1909 when <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> {{to a local}} {{newspaper}} advertisement placed by producer/director Thomas Ince's Bison Motion Pictures. The movie studio was looking for someone with the physical attributes to portray an American Indian and who was physically capable of doing stunts and riding horses. While she had never acted before, Workman fit the appearance that Ince wanted. She apparently embellished her riding skills, as {{she did not have}} any, but nevertheless quickly learned horsemanship. Given the stage name Mona Darkfeather, she was cast in her first starring role as an Indian maiden named Owanee in the 1911 movie Owanee's Great Love.|$|E
25|$|Melanie Jayne Chisholm {{was born}} in Whiston, Lancashire, and later moved to Widnes, Cheshire, at a young age. She {{attended}} Fairfield High School. Following school, she studied for a diploma course in dance, singing, drama, and musical theatre at the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in Sidcup, Southeast London. During college, <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> to an advert in The Stage by Chris and Bob Herbert, who were looking {{to form a new}} girl group, later to become the Spice Girls. She left college just short of completing her three-year course and gained teaching qualifications in tap and modern theatre dance with the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.|$|E

25|$|This {{came to a}} {{head when}} a {{fugitive}} criminal claimed sanctuary in an Augustinian church in Manila. An artilleryman, Francisco de Nava, owned a female slave named María, with whom he was having illicit relations. The archbishop, upon learning this, ordered Nava to sell the slave. When he refused, she was taken from him and sold. The artilleryman soon tried to get the slave back, declaring he wanted to marry her. One day he saw the woman passing in a carriage with her new mistress, who happened to be the governor-general's wife. Going up to the carriage, he spoke to the woman, but <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> that she preferred to be the slave of another than his wife. Thereupon Nava, blind with anger, drew his dagger and killed her.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau’s {{creation}} became controversial on Capitol Hill. In December 1920, a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee questioned Van Winkle and District Commissioner Charles W. Kutz. Subcommittee members Rep. George Tinkham (a Republican from Massachusetts) (and Rep. Thomas U. Sisson, a Democrat from Mississippi) objected that Congress had {{not specifically}} appropriated {{funds for a}} bureau of policewomen. Colonel Kutz responded that Congress had specifically appropriated funds for police officers, and “there {{is nothing in the}} law that requires that policemen shall be of the male sex.” During the hearing, Tinkham, an opponent of women’s suffrage, asked Van Winkle dozens of questions. When asked why she was doing this work, <b>she</b> <b>replied,</b> “because I have nothing else to do; it is my job in life.” Ultimately, the Subcommittee did not withhold the Bureau’s appropriation.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 1845, Anna's 15-year-old sister, Eliza Julia Edwards, married James Millard, a Sergeant-Major {{with the}} 4th Troop Artillery, Indian Army in Deesa, Banaskantha, Gujarat, India. Their daughter, Eliza Sarah Millard, born in 1848 in India, married on 7 October 1864 in Surat, Gujarat, India. Her husband was Edward John Pratt, a 38-year-old British civil servant {{who had served}} in the Indian Navy. One of their sons, William Henry Pratt, born 23 November 1887 upon their return to London, was better known by his stage name of Boris Karloff, making Anna his great-aunt. Anna Edwards never {{approved}} of her sister's marriage, and her self-imposed separation from the family was so complete that, decades later, when a Pratt relative contacted her, <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> by threatening suicide if he persisted.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. <b>She</b> <b>replied</b> that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed {{out to them}} to lock the doors. <b>She</b> <b>replied</b> that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work {{was on the other side}} of the motel building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E
25|$|After losing at WrestleMania XX, Kane fell in {{love with}} Lita, but was spurned. This led to him {{kidnapping}} Lita in May and asking her an unknown question, to which <b>she</b> <b>replied</b> in the affirmative later that month. On the same night, Kane won a 20-Man battle royal for a World Heavyweight Championship match against Chris Benoit at Bad Blood. Six days before Bad Blood in a tag team match between Kane and La Resistance against Edge and Benoit, Kane beat Benoit after muscling out of the Crippler Crossface and giving him a huge Chokeslam. Lita later announced that she was pregnant, with Matt Hardy her then-boyfriend both on- and off-screen, assuming that he was the child's father. On the June 21 episode of Raw, Kane claimed that he was the dad. The next week, he explained that he had impregnated Lita in order to continue his legacy and justified a vicious attack on Shawn Michaels several weeks earlier by claiming that Michaels had stood in the way of him winning the World Heavyweight Championship. In order to appease Kane, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane a rematch with Benoit, instructing Benoit that he could only win by submission, whereas Kane could win the title by any means. Despite dominating much of the match, Kane again lost to Benoit. Following the match, Lita came to the ring and low-blowed Kane, who initially went to chokeslam her in revenge but stopped when he realized that she was trying to force him to cause her to miscarry their child.|$|E
