They called the hill calidus mons - the hot hill - for it is a south-facing slope with extremely favourable climatic conditions. The Romans’ name also yields the modern name, “Calmont”. The slopes, set at between 50 and 55°, are Europe’s steepest vineyard terraces. Grown here are most outstanding Riesling wines, which at both state and federal levels achieve high awards.|$|E
