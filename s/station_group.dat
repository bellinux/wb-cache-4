Introduced in May 1973, they were originally stationed at Bodø Main Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Sola Air Station and <b>Station</b> <b>Group</b> Banak. In 1997, the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions. From 1995 to 1998, one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and since 1999, one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1978 The {{continental}} shelf {{region of the}} southeastern Bering Sea may be classified into five provinces (<b>station</b> <b>groups)</b> based on infaunal distribution. Three large <b>station</b> <b>groups</b> lie in adjacent bands extending from the Alaskan coast to the shelf break, roughly paralleling the bathymetry. Two smaller groups occupying positions {{at the head of}} Bristol Bay and off Nunivak Island were identified. Stations in the northwestern section of the study area (near the Pribilof Islands) show no strong affinity to the major <b>station</b> <b>groups.</b> Fourteen major biocoenoses identified on the basis of species distribution show strong correlation with the spatial positioning of <b>station</b> <b>groups.</b> Spatial patterning of these species groups is described {{on the basis of their}} representation at <b>station</b> <b>groups.</b> Characteristic differences in trophic structure between <b>station</b> <b>groups</b> are attributed to the effects of storm-induced turbulence in nearshore environments and periodic intensive input of organic carbon in the midshelf region...|$|R

40|$|A {{strategy}} is presented for analysing marine biological survey data and relating the biotic patterns to environmental data. To avoid circular argument, biotic and environmental data are kept separate. The {{strategy is}} illustrated by a worked example using data {{on the distribution of}} 182 nematode species in 107 samples in the River Exe estuary. Nineteen <b>stations</b> are <b>grouped</b> Into 4 main clusters using complementary classification and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) ordination techniques. These are both based on root-root transformed abundance data with the Bray-Curtis measure of similarity. Indicator species characterising each group are extracted using information statistics. Inverse analyses give clusters of co-occurring species which are strongly related to the <b>station</b> <b>groups.</b> Relationships of <b>station</b> <b>groups</b> to environmental variables are revealed by superimposing data for one variable at a time on the MDS plot, showing that some <b>station</b> <b>groups</b> differ in sediment granulometry and others in salinity, for example. Some of the other factors plotted show no difference between <b>station</b> <b>groups.</b> Similarly, physiognomic characteristics of the species are superimposed on the MDS plots of the inverse analysis of species groups, revealing differences in setal length and trophic status between the species groups. Finally, the 4 major <b>station</b> <b>groups</b> and species groups are related to one another in terms of morphological adaptation to the habitat...|$|R

Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the Olympics; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA Basketball Tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections.
