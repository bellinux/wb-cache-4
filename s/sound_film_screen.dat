5000|$|As {{noted by}} film scholar Clifford McCarty {{in the book}} Film Composers in America: A Filmography, 1911-1970 (2000), {{determining}} who was the composer of a film requires more research than consulting the <b>film's</b> <b>screen</b> credits. Screen credits in the era he researched were not intended {{to inform the public}} about who were the creative personnel of the <b>films.</b> <b>Screen</b> credits served largely to establish the importance of an individual to the film industry. In silent films, the composers were rarely credited as the film scores accompanying the film could vary from one movie theater to another. In <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> there was only one score, but most American film studio were initially reluctant to procide music credits to anyone except the songwriters. When the studios granted a credit, they would name the music director of the studio. In theory, the music director was responsible for composing, arranging, and conducting of film music. But the director did not have to personally do all these things. It was still usual in the 1930s for the music department head to be credited or awarded instead of the actual composers.|$|R

40|$|The author {{deals with}} the coming of a <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> and its reviews in the {{contemporary}} Czech art and film magazines. The first part describes development of film and film art from its beginnings in the late 19 th century to the time just before the coming of a <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> {{at the turn of the}} twenties and thirties of the 20 th century. The author also describes the evolution of the sound technology in the film and the coming of the first <b>sound</b> <b>films</b> including problems which this change has brought. In the practical part the author examines articles about this topic in the Czechoslovak art magazines using the qualitative analysis and describes the media image of the <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> at the time of its boom. The thesis describes main themes in those articles - the artistic quality of <b>sound</b> <b>films,</b> the future of the <b>sound</b> <b>film,</b> the <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> and the theater and international character of the film - and several related subtopics and ideological streams. He also finds out that the criticism of the <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> at those times is mostly negative, but despite that, its future development and existence had been expected. At last the author finds an improvement in an evaluation of aesthetic qualites of <b>sound</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R
