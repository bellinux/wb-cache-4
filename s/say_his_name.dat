2500|$|Throughout the series, Rowling {{establishes}} that Voldemort is so feared in the wizarding {{world that}} it is considered dangerous even to speak his name. Most characters in the novels refer to him as [...] "You-Know-Who" [...] or [...] "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" [...] rather than <b>say</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> aloud. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a Taboo is placed upon the name, such that Voldemort or his followers may trace anyone who utters it. By this means, his followers eventually find and capture Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. In the second book, Rowling reveals that I am Lord Voldemort is an anagram of the character's birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle. According to the author, Voldemort's name is an invented word. Some literary analysts have considered possible meanings in the name: Philip Nel states that Voldemort {{is derived from the}} French for [...] "flight of death", ...|$|E

60|$|As I {{was young}} then--not thirty yet--I took {{myself and my}} {{troubles}} very seriously. The old mate, who had acted as chief mourner at the captain's funeral, was not particularly pleased at my coming. But {{the fact is the}} fellow was not legally qualified for command, and the Consul was bound, if at all possible, to put a properly certificated man on board. As to the second mate, all I can <b>say</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was Tottersen, or something like that. His practice was to wear on his head, in that tropical climate, a mangy fur cap. He was, without exception, the stupidest man I had ever seen on board ship. And he looked it too. He looked so confoundedly stupid that {{it was a matter of}} surprise for me when he answered to his name.|$|E

I know nothing of these stories. He may or {{he may not be}} a partner of Mr. Campion, of Shepherd's Inn: he has a handsome villa, Abbey Road, St. John's Wood, entertains good company, rather loud, of the sporting sort, rides and drives very showy horses, has boxes at the Opera whenever he likes, and free access behind the scenes: is handsome, dark, bright-eyed, with a quantity of jewellery, and a tuft to his chin; sings sweetly sentimental songs after dinner. Who cares a fig what was the religion of Mr. Sherrick's ancestry, or what the occupation of his youth? Mr. Honeyman, a most respectable man surely, introduced Sherrick to the Colonel and Binnie.|$|E
60|$|On {{the outside}} sands {{between the end}} of the Marina and the Martello tower, you may find, at very low tides, great numbers of a sand- tube, about three inches long, {{standing}} up out of the sand. I do not mean the tubes of the Terebella, so common in all sands, which are somewhat flexible, and have their upper end fringed with a ragged ring of sandy arms: those I speak of are straight and stiff, and ending in a point upward. Draw them out of the sand - they will offer some resistance - and put them into a vase of water; you will see the worm inside expand two delicate golden combs, just like old-fashioned back-hair combs, of a metallic lustre, which will astonish you. With these combs the worm seems to burrow head downward into the sand; but whether he always remains in that attitude I cannot <b>say.</b> <b>His</b> <b>name</b> is Pectinaria Belgica. He is an Annelid, or true worm, connected with the Serpulea and Sabellae of which I have spoken already, and holds himself in his case like them, by hooks and bristles set on each ring of his body. In confinement he will probably come out of his case and die; when you may dissect him at your leisure, and learn a great deal more about him thereby than (I am sorry to say) I know.|$|E
5000|$|He {{pronounced}} <b>his</b> <b>name</b> {{the traditional}} Castilian way, which in English sounds like [...] "WEN-thess".
