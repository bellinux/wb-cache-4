5|$|After {{his escape}} from Pekalongan, Soeprapto {{and his family}} first went to Cirebon. They then went to Yogyakarta, where Soeprapto became a judge at the high court.

50|$|The Oath <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> {{required}} {{any person}} taking public or church office in England to swear {{allegiance to the}} monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Failure to do so was {{to be treated as}} treasonable. The Oath <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> was originally imposed by King Henry VIII of England through the Act <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> 1534, but repealed by his daughter, Queen Mary I of England and reinstated under Mary's half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I of England under the Act <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> 1559.

5|$|The <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the Fifth Air Force in {{the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night {{movement}} of supplies to the battle area.

5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion with the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, {{the roots of the}} split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{identified}} with the Democratic-Republican Party and espoused the Jeffersonian principles of limited government and individual liberty. He was chosen to represent Nelson County at the constitutional convention held at Frankfort, Kentucky in 1799 to draft the second Kentucky Constitution. As a delegate, he advocated the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the legislative branch over the executive and judicial branches, which he believed provided ordinary citizens {{a greater role in}} state government. The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, providing for the direct election of these officers instead.|$|E
5000|$|Over the {{following}} centuries this evolved into three separate oaths; <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> (repudiation <b>of</b> the spiritual or ecclesiastical authority of any foreign prince, person or prelate), Allegiance (declaration of {{fidelity to the}} Sovereign) and in 1702 Abjuration (repudiation of the right and title of descendants of James II to the throne). Oaths of allegiance were exacted from Lords, by Henry IV and Henry VI in 1455 and 1459, and oath <b>of</b> <b>supremacy</b> was introduced under Henry VIII in 1534. Elizabeth I introduced an Act <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> in 1563 requiring an oath to be taken by all future Members of the House of Commons. A new oath of allegiance appeared under James I (prompted by the [...] "Gunpowder Plot") under the Popish Recusants Act 1605, and the Oath of Allegiance Act 1609. This oath required recognition of James I as lawful King and renunciation of the Pope. The 1609 Act required Commons MPs to take the oath of allegiance and <b>of</b> <b>supremacy,</b> {{but this was not}} [...] "parliamentary" [...] oath, as it was not taken in Parliament, and there were no consequences if not sworn.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of the 1990s was marked by the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago Bulls, which saw them appear in six Finals. Coached by Phil Jackson and led by NBA superstar Michael Jordan, the Bulls won a title in every single appearance to the Finals from 1991 to 1998. Jordan was also the Finals MVP every time. The only other team to win championships during this period was the Houston Rockets, who went back-to-back in 1994 and 1995 during Jordan's initial retirement from professional basketball.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, Brown did not play. Harvey {{came to the}} crease at 3/304 and put on 164 for the fourth wicket before his partner Morris was out for 294. He put on another 63 with Loxton before falling for 95. During his innings, Harvey repeatedly advanced out of the crease to attack the spinners. Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, their highest score of the tour, which underpinned a dominant innings victory. Harvey and the other Australian batsmen repeatedly left their crease to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard, who ended with 0/186. Goddard had been touted as a possible England selection because the bowlers used {{in the first two}} Tests had failed to challenge the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Australia’s batsmen, but the tourists’ attack ended his prospects. Loxton's innings earned him Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which was a rain-affected draw.|$|E

5|$|His reign saw {{the rise}} of socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian {{independence}} movement, all of which radically changed the political landscape. The Parliament Act 1911 established the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords. As {{a result of the}} First World War (1914–1918), the empires of his first cousins Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany fell, while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment. In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the Commonwealth of Nations. He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII.|$|E
5|$|Intent on {{restoring}} the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Saladin's direct descendants within the Ayyubid family, an-Nasir Yusuf was eventually able {{to enlist the}} backing {{of all of the}} Syria-based Ayyubid emirs in a common cause against Mamluk-dominated Egypt. By 1250, he took Damascus with relative ease and except for Hama and Transjordan, an-Nasir Yusuf's direct authority stood unbroken from the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia to the Sinai Peninsula. In December 1250, he attacked Egypt after hearing of al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah's death and the ascension of Shajar al-Durr. An-Nasir Yusuf's army was much larger and better-equipped than that of the Egyptian army, consisting of the forces of Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and those of Saladin's only surviving sons, Nusrat ad-Din and Turan-Shah ibn Salah ad-Din. Nonetheless, it suffered a major defeat at the hands of Aybak's forces. An-Nasir Yusuf subsequently returned to Syria, which was slowly slipping out of his control.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
50|$|By 1536, Henry VIII {{had broken}} with Rome, seized the Church's assets in England and {{declared}} the Church of England as the established church with himself as its head. The Act <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> 1534 confirmed the King's status as having supremacy over {{the church and}} required the peers {{to swear an oath}} recognising Henry's supremacy. Henry's daughter, Mary I, attempted to restore the English Church's allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> in 1555. Elizabeth I ascended to the throne in 1558 and the next year Parliament passed the Act <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> 1558 that restored the original act. To placate critics, the Oath <b>of</b> <b>Supremacy</b> which peers were required to swear, gave the monarch's title as Supreme Governor rather than Supreme Head of the church. This wording avoided the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping Christ, whom the Bible explicitly identifies as Head of the Church.|$|R
