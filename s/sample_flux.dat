In this thesis, two improvements to the process of core loss characterization of ferrimagnetic materials are made. First, the characterization is made based on the anhysteretic rather than hysteretic (actual) flux density. This makes design predictions of losses more accurate, as such predictions are based on the anhysteretic fields. Second, the effects of test <b>sample</b> <b>flux</b> density nonuniformity on the characterization process are accounted for. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{consistency}} of magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN) measurements under applied sinusoidal magnetic field control and sinusoidal magnetic circuit flux control was investigated under variable circuit permeability conditions. A U-core electromagnet {{was used to}} provide the alternating magnetic excitation. The magnetic circuit permeability was changed by varying excitation magnet lift-off and by using samples with known magnetic anisotropy. By controlling the circuit magnetic flux, measured as the flux {{in one of the}} U-core poles near the sample, MBN measurements were found to be consistent and independent of the excitation magnet lift-off in both a Si–Fe steel sample and an interstitial free (IF) steel sample at peak <b>sample</b> <b>flux</b> densities greater than 1. 16 T and 0. 29 T respectively. Consistency within a 95 % confidence level was demonstrated for lift-off values of 0. 6 mm or less, with decreasing sensitivity to lift-off observed at higher fluxes. MBN anisotropy measurements were also performed using both field control and flux control. Under field control conditions a component of the anisotropy signal was found to be dependent on the magnetic circuit permeability. This permeability dependence was absent when using flux control. The results demonstrated that flux control should be used when performing MBN measurements on samples where lift-off may be an issue, as values obtained will have less dependence on the excitation magnet characteristics than when field control is used...|$|E

40|$|The {{binary system}} eta Carinae has {{completed}} its first 5. 54 y orbit {{since the beginning}} of science operation of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We are now able to investigate the high-energy gamma-ray source at the position of eta Carinae over its full orbital period. By this, we can address and confirm earlier predictions for temporal and spectral variability. Newer versions of the LAT datasets, instrument response functions and background models allow for a more accurate analysis. Therefore it is important to re-evaluate the previously analyzed time period along with the new data to further constrain location, spectral shape, and flux time history of the gamma-ray source. We confirm earlier predictions of increasing flux values above 10 GeV toward the next periastron passage. For the most recent part of the data <b>sample,</b> <b>flux</b> values as high as those before the first periastron passage in 2008 are recorded. A comparison of spectral energy distributions around periastron and apastron passages reveals strong variation in the high-energy band. This is due to a second spectral component that is present only around periastron. Improved spatial consistency with the gamma-ray source at the position of eta Carinae along with the confirmation of temporal variability above 10 GeV in conjunction with the orbital period strengthens the argument for unambiguous source identification. Spectral variability provides additional constraints for future modeling of the particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission in colliding-wind binary systems.

40|$|We jointly {{constrain}} the luminosity function (LF) and black hole mass function (BHMF) of broad-line quasars with forward Bayesian modeling in the quasar mass-luminosity plane, {{based on a}} homogeneous sample of ~ 58, 000 SDSS DR 7 quasars at z ~ 0. 3 - 5. We {{take into account the}} selection effect of the <b>sample</b> <b>flux</b> limit; more importantly, we deal with the statistical scatter between true BH masses and FWHM-based single-epoch virial mass estimates, as well as potential luminosity-dependent biases of these mass estimates. The LF is tightly constrained in the regime sampled by SDSS, and makes reasonable predictions when extrapolated to ~ 3 magnitudes fainter. Downsizing is seen in the model LF. On the other hand, we find it difficult to {{constrain the}} BHMF to within a factor of a few at z>~ 0. 7 (with MgII and CIV-based virial BH masses). This is mainly driven by the unknown luminosity-dependent bias of these mass estimators and its degeneracy with other model parameters, and secondly driven by the fact that SDSS quasars only sample the tip of the active BH population at high redshift. Nevertheless, the most likely models favor a positive luminosity-dependent bias for MgII and possibly for CIV, such that at fixed true BH mass, objects with higher-than-average luminosities have over-estimated FWHM-based virial masses. There is tentative evidence that downsizing also manifests itself in the active BHMF, and the BH mass density in broad-line quasars contributes an insignificant amount to the total BH mass density at all times. Within our model uncertainties, we do not find a strong BH mass dependence of the mean Eddington ratio; but there is evidence that the mean Eddington ratio (at fixed BH mass) increases with redshift.

The reliability and uniformity of visual classification across eight human classifiers was calibrated and tested using a SDSS Stripe 82 region variable star catalog, and verified using an unsupervised machine learning approach. The resulting sample of periodic LINEAR variables is dominated by 3, 900 RR Lyrae stars and 2, 700 eclipsing binary stars of all subtypes, and includes small fractions of relatively rare populations such as asymptotic giant branch stars and SX Phoenicis stars.

40|$|Energy {{conversion}} processes involve losses. Specifically core losses, {{which are}} a result of the magnetization process in cored electrical energy conversion and storage devices. The cores are made of soft ferromagnetic materials that are easily magnetized and demagnetized. These soft magnetic cores, allow a reduction in size, higher energy storage density, and a reduction in magnetizing current, when compared to non-cored devices. The characterization of soft ferromagnetic materials is traditionally done under unidirectional pulsating fields, which is sufficient for single-phase transformers and inductors, where the cores are under pulsating fields. However, T-joints of three phase transformers and teeth-roots of rotating machine stator cores are exposed to two-dimensional rotational fields of higher core loss. Pulsating measurements are therefore insufficient in the characterization of soft ferromagnetic materials used in rotating electrical machines or in three phase transformers. In two-dimensional fields, the magnetization direction changes with time, tracing a flux density locus. This requires the measurement of tangential magnetic field and flux density components, hence the associated loss. This study proposes a two-dimensional rotational core loss tester for high flux density measurements up to about 2 T, at 60 Hz. Its frequency measurement range is from 60 Hz to 1 kHz. The initial sizing was done analytically, then implemented in three-dimensional finite element analysis, prototyped and experiments performed to verify its capability. It was validated by testing two 0. 35 mm and 0. 65 mm thick samples. Very high flux densities in the range of 2 T at 60 Hz were achieved in both samples. For the thinner <b>sample,</b> <b>flux</b> densities of 1. 8 T and 1. 6 T were measured at 400 Hz and 1 kHz, respectively, while for the thicker one, the range reduced to 1. 7 T and 1. 4 T, at 400 Hz and 1 kHz, respectively. The magnetizer also reproduced non-sinusoidal flux density waveforms, for flux densities {{less than or equal to}} 1. 0 T, without any waveform control. The proposed rotational core loss setup will find application in the characterization of electrical steels, and generation of pulsating and rotational core loss data. This data can then be applied in core loss models, uprating of megawatt (MW) rated machines, transient and hotspots analysis, and in the design of higher power density machines, such as high-speed machines...|$|E

Note that this version deprecates the use of load_table_model for XSPEC models. Sherpa/XSPEC users should use the new load_xstable_model function instead. Details Infrastructure and minor non-functional changes have been omitted. 242 Avoid use of inspect. getargspec in Python 3 Finish off the replacement of inspect. getargspec by inspect. signature. 263 List_data_ids() fails on py 3 with mixed id types (Fix # 262). Sherpa was sorting the list of dataset IDs in a non-python 3 compliant fashion, which resulted in issues when using strings and integers together as dataset IDs. This has now been fixed. 267 add wstat tests Add several regression tests for wstat. 282 Parallel_map not working on py 3 with numcores= 1 (Fix # 277). The utils function parallel_map failed on Python 3 when called with numcores= 1, i. e. on systems with only one processor/core. This has been fixed. 283 <b>Sample</b> <b>flux</b> and numpy deprecations (Fix # 273 and # 276). The sample_flux function was not working under Python 3 if the scales argument was provided.

This has now been fixed (Issue # 303). 307 Move XSPEC table support to load_xstable_model and deprecate its support in load_table_model (Fix # 270). Add the load_xstable_model routine to the sherpa. astro. ui module, which supports loading XSPEC additive or multiplicative (atable and mtable) models. The support for these models is still available via load_table_model in this release, but it is deprecated. The read_xstable_model routine has been added to the sherpa. astro. xspec module. 312 Fix over-zealous code clean up in PR # 287 affecting sigmarej. Fits using the sigmarej iterated-fit method were broken if a filter had been applied to the data before the fit and there are any bins that get ignored at larger bin values than the filtered-out data. (This fixes a subtle regression introduced by # 287). 313 Allow sequence=None when using gridsearch and Python 3. 5 (Fix # 309). Allow the gridsearch optimiser to be used with the sequence option set to None for Python 3. 5. Caveats The requirements for Sherpa are to build with Python 2. 7 and 3. 5. There has been limited testing with Python 3. 6, for which we distribute conda binaries. If in doubt, please install Sherpa in 2. 7 or 3. 5 environments only. Support for Python versions 3. 3 and 3. 4 is possible but would require community support. It has been reported during testing that some versions of the matplotlib conda package do not install properly because of a pyqt v 5 dependency. If you encounter this issue, please pin down pyqt to version 4, e. g. conda install matplotlib pyqt= 4. The sherpatest package is not distributed as a conda package anymore. This will probably be true for the foreseeable future. The sherpatest package contains data and functional tests that relies on external datasets, so it allows users and developers to run the entire regression tests suite. If you want to install sherpatest, please use pip and github: $ pip install [URL] If you decide to run the full regression tests suite you should also have matplotlib installed. If matplotlib is not installed a test will run and fail rather than being skipped. This issue will be fixed in the next release...|$|E

40|$|This is a CIAO release. Binaries will be {{provided}} with the next standalone release. Release notes are collected for all changes since CIAO 4. 8, which may be included from multiple standalone releases. Release Notes Sherpa 4. 9 now runs under both Python 2. 7 and Python 3. 5. The test infrastructure has been modified including simplification of the smoke test. Several bug fixes and enhancements are also included. Specific details are identified below. 14361 : Sherpa and Chips wrapper need to replace execfile for python 3 compatibility This fix modifies the sherpa and chips wrapper scripts to replace the 'execfile' command with an 'exec' command sequence that allows the wrapper script to be utilized by python 2. 7 or python 3. 5. Without the change, the option to specify a command script at the sherpa or chips command prompt (ie. 'chips /pool 1 /runme. py') will not work on python 3. 5 since the execfile {{does not exist in}} python 3. 5. 107 : Normalize plot labels. Plots created with plot_source used a different format to other plots when analysis=wavelength, in that LaTeX symbols were used for Angstrom and lambda (in other plots the string 'Angstrom' is used instead). The source plots now match the other plots. 138 : improve and fix issues in save_all function. added a new argument to save_all: if outfile is None then the outfh argument is used to define the output handle (the argument can be any file-like argument, such as a file handle like sys. stdout or the output of open, or a StringIO object) setting the clobber argument to save_all now means that the output file (the outfile argument, if not None) is deleted if it already exists; prior to this, the file would be appended to instead the source expression is now saved correctly for most cases (e. g. when not using set_full_model); this is bug # 97 but also affects non-PHA data sets the background model expression was not always written out correctly when using PHA data sets quality and grouping arrays of PHA data sets are now stored as 16 -byte integers rather than a floating-point value (this has no affect on the results, but matches the OGIP standard) fixed up saving the grouping and quality arrays of background PHA data sets (this would only be an issue if the background is being fit, rather than subtracted) basic data sets created with the load_arrays function are now written out by save_all as part of the script; this is intended for small datasets and may have problems with precision if used with floating-point arrays calls to load_psf are now correctly restored (they may not have been written out correctly if multiple data sets were loaded) user models are now written out to disk; this consists of two parts: writing out the function that defines the model, {{which may or may not}} be possible (if not, a place-holder function is added to the output and a warning displayed). the necessary calls to load_user_model and add_user_pars are now included in the output the Python code created by save all has undergone several minor changes: it now explicitly imports the sherpa. astro. ui module, so that it can be run from the IPython prompt using the %run command, or directly as python it uses the create_model_component function rather than eval to create model components (this is CXC bug 12146) many optional arguments to functions are now given as name=value rather than being a positional argument, to make it clearer what the script is doing. calls to load_data have been replaced by more-specific versions - e. g. load_pha and load_image - if appropriate there have been several minor syntactic clean ups to better follow the suggestions from PEP 8 When writing out code that defines a user-model, there is no attempt to make sure that modules used by the function are available. These will need to be added, either directly or imported, manually to the output. 153 : Minor bug with calc_chi 2 datavar_errors (Fix # 148). Make comparison test in calc_chi 2 datavar_errors less stringent, so to include the case where sqrt(x) = 0. 155 : Add argument to get_draws for supplying a covariance matrix. The get_draws function now accepts a user-provided covariance matrix. If no covariance matrix is provided, the covariance matrix computed by the default implementation is used. Note that covar() must be invoked before invoking get_draws if no covariance matrix is provided, otherwise get_draws will exit with an error. 165 : Remove usage of deprecated numpy API. 185 : Protect XPA command to avoid shell confusion. Fix the problem where if the working directory contained a file called x or y then the sherpa. astro. ui. image_data() function would fail with the message DS 9 Err: Could not display image 187 : Issue a more meaningful message when sherpa. astro. io is imported directly and no fits backends are available. (Fix # 92). 190 : Datastack can be used if no plotter available. The datastack package can now be used even if there is no available plotting backend. In this case, plotting functions will not be available, but the rest of the datastack functionality will. (Fix # 22). 195 Generalize calc_stat API + example of how to have several datasets with different fit statistics. Attempts to generalize the `calc_stat` API and enable simultaneous fits with different statistics for different data sets. 209 : Fix docstrings for group_snr() and group_adapt_snr(). Updates to the docstrings for clarity. 210 : New Smoke Test The smoke test has been greatly simplified: rather than running all the unit and regression tests that do not require test data, the smoke test now simply ensures that the basic installation works, i. e. that basic commands can be run and that dependencies can be reached. 211 : Cleanup of documentation and code in sherpa. astro. utils. The calc_kcorr function is now exported by sherpa. astro. utils. Minor changes to the documentation in sherpa. astro. utils were also made to conform to Sphinx standards. 221 Add model documentation (Fix # 217). Integrate existing model documentation (from external sources and the CIAO ahelp documentation system) into the model classes. 229 : Code is both Python 2. 7 and 3. 5 compliant. (Fix # 76). 242 : Avoid use of inspect. argspec in Python 3 This change replaces the deprecated 'inspect. argspec' call with 'inspect. signature'. 252 : Fix plot_photon_flux function. (Fix # 241). A bug where plotting photon flux was fixed by adding a missing argument to the sample_photon_flux call. 253 Make sure background is taken into account in calc_stat_info (Fix # 147). calc_stat_info call failed when wstat was selected, as the background was not taken into account. This issue has now been fixed. 254 Fix the documentation for set_rmf (Fix # 236). The documentation for set_rmf incorrectly referred to ARF rather than RMF. 256 Fix docstring in set_quality (Fix # 205). The docstring in set_quality now correctly indicates the quality flags. The previous documentation didn't describe the values of such flags properly. 257 Fix docstring for levmar tolerance (Fix # 257). The documentation string for the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization function now correctly states that the parameter default values are equal to the single precision epsilon, rather than the square root of the double precision epsilon. 263 List_data_ids() fails on py 3 with mixed id types (Fix # 262). Sherpa was sorting the list of dataset IDs in a non-python 3 compliant fashion, which resulted in issues when using strings and integers together as dataset IDs. This has now been fixed. 267 add wstat tests Add several regression tests for wstat. 282 Parallel_map not working on py 3 with numcores= 1 (Fix # 277). The utils function parallel_map failed on Python 3 when called with numcores= 1, i. e. on systems with only one processor/core. This has been fixed. 283 <b>Sample</b> <b>flux</b> and numpy deprecations (Fix # 273 and # 276). The sample_flux function was not working under Python 3 if the scales argument was provided. This has been fixed. Also, a DeprecationWarning was issued by numpy because during the sample_flux execution values were extracted from an array with non-integer indices. This has also been fixed. 284 String representation of data classes under py 3 (Fix # 275). Data classes DataPHA, DataARF, DataRMF, DataIMG, and DataIMGInt in sherpa. astro. data would throw an exception if users tried to print them as strings, under Python 3. This has been fixed. 287 Rewrite sherpa. stats. Stat. calc_stat and simplify sherpa. fit. Fit (fix # 227 # 248 # 289 # 292). In order to fix several issues related to the WStat support, and in order to make the code more maintainable, the sherpa. stats. Stat. calc_stat and sherpa. fit. Fit classes have gone through a round of refactoring. This fixes the following issues: # 227 Issues using wstat when grouping/filtering data; # 248 backscal column not treated properly for WStat; # 289 calc_stat does not error out if background subtracted data is used with Likelihood statistics; # 292 stat info does not include reduced stat/qval for wstat. 295 Fix display of pileup model in Python 3. 5 (Fix # 294). Fix display of instances of sherpa. astro. models. JDPileup so that, in Python 3. 5, they can be displayed after the model has been evaluated. 304 replace file -> open (Fix # 297). The save and restore functions used to use the file function which is not compatible with Python 3. This has now been fixed. 305 Fix python 3 issues with some session commands (Fix # 303). The set_xlog, set_ylog, and show_bkg_model functions were not compatible with Python 3. This has now been fixed (Issue # 303). 307 Move XSPEC table support to load_xstable_model and deprecate its support in load_table_model (Fix # 270). Add the load_xstable_model routine to the sherpa. astro. ui module, which supports loading XSPEC additive or multiplicative (atable and mtable) models. The support for these models is still available via load_table_model in this release, but it is deprecated. The read_xstable_model routine has been added to the sherpa. astro. xspec module. 312 Fix over-zealous code clean up in PR # 287 affecting sigmarej. Fits using the sigmarej iterated-fit method were broken if a filter had been applied to the data before the fit and there are any bins that get ignored at larger bin values than the filtered-out data. (This fixes a subtle regression introduced by # 287). 313 Allow sequence=None when using gridsearch and Python 3. 5 (Fix # 309). Allow the gridsearch optimiser to be used with the sequence option set to None for Python 3. 5. Caveats 319 : image_getregion returns byte string on Py 3. SH- 2 : The new test_save_restore test in the CIAO regression tests suite is failing on all platforms. We are investigating the reasons of the failure. The failure is triggered when the test is not run in isolation, and only when certain other tests are run before it. Also, this only applies to CIAO and not to standalone Sherpa. SH- 3 : Some tests are skipped during the CIAO regression tests. SH- 4 : Several OS X regression tests are failing. Note: The SH- 2 / 3 / 4 caveats are issues with the tests themselves, not with the code, and only appear when running the full CIAO regression tests suite. User will not be affected by the above issues unless they run the full CIAO regression tests suite...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{integration}} of optical remote sensing with flux measurements across multiple scales {{is essential for}} understanding global patterns of surface–atmosphere fluxes of carbon and water vapor. SpecNet (Spectral Network) is an international network of cooperating investigators and sites linking optical measurements with <b>flux</b> <b>sampling</b> {{for the purpose of}} improving our understanding of the controls on these fluxes. An additional goal is to characterize disturbance impacts on surface–atmosphere fluxes. To reach these goals, key SpecNet objectives include the exploration of scaling issues, development of novel sampling tools, standardization and intercomparison of sampling methods, development of models and statistical methods that relate optical <b>sampling</b> to <b>fluxes,</b> exploration of component fluxes, validation of satellite products, and development of an informatics approach that integrates disparate data sources across scales.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{potential}} for neutron spectrometers at novel accelerator driven compact neutron sources. Such a High Brilliance Source (HBS) relies on low energy nuclear reactions, which enable cryogenic moderators in very {{close proximity to the}} target and neutron optics at comparably short distances from the moderator compared to existing sources. While the first effect aims at increasing the phase space density of a moderator, the second allows the extraction of a large phase space volume, which is typically requested for spectrometer applications. We find that competitive spectrometers can be realized if (a) the neutron production rate can be synchronized with the experiment repetition rate and (b) the emission characteristics of the moderator can be matched to the phase space requirements of the experiment. MCNP simulations for protons or deuterons on a Beryllium target with a suitable target/moderator design yield a source brightness, from which we calculate the <b>sample</b> <b>fluxes</b> by phase space considerations for different types of spectrometers. These match closely the figures of todays spectrometers at medium flux sources. Hence we conclude that compact neutron sources might be a viable option for next generation neutron source...|$|R
