5|$|The deities {{associated}} with the Eye were not restricted to feline and serpent forms. Hathor's usual animal form is a cow, as {{is that of the}} closely linked Eye goddess Mehet-Weret. Nekhbet, a vulture goddess, was closely connected with Wadjet, the Eye, and the crowns of Egypt. Many Eye goddesses appear mainly in human form, including Neith, a sometimes warlike deity sometimes said to be the mother of the sun god, and Satet and Anuket, who were linked with the Nile cataracts and the inundation. Other such goddesses include Sothis, the deified form of the star of the same name, and Maat, the personification of cosmic order, who was connected with the Eye because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be the daughter of Ra. Even Isis, who is usually the companion of Osiris rather than Ra, or Astarte, a deity of fertility and warfare who was imported from Canaan rather than native to Egypt, could be equated with the solar Eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E
