30|$|Taraban (2011) {{examined}} metacognitive {{strategy use}} and epistemological beliefs in native-speaking engineering majors in the U.S. Consistent {{with the data}} of Vianty (2007) for processing in Bahasa Indonesia (the native language), analytic strategy use predominated over pragmatic strategy use.
