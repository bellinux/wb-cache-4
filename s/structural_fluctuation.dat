Although a number of molecular dynamics (MD) studies on proteins/DNA predicted the importance of such coupling, experimental evidence of variation of hydration dynamics with controlled <b>structural</b> <b>fluctuation</b> even in model macromolecule is sparse and raised controversies in the contemporary literature. Here, we have investigated dynamics of hydration at the surfaces of two similar anionic micelles sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium dodecylbenzene-sulfonate (SDBS) as model macromolecules using coumarin 500 (C 500) as spectroscopic probe with femtosecond to picosecond time resolution up to 20 ns time window. The constituting surfactants SDS and SDBS are structurally similar except one benzene moiety in the SDBS may offer additional rigidity to the SDBS micelles through π-stacking and added bulkiness.

40|$|Peptides with cell {{attachment}} {{activity are}} beneficial component of biomaterials for tissue engineering. Conformational structure {{is one of}} the important factors for the biological activities. The EF 1 peptide (DYATLQLQEGRLHFMFDLG) derived from laminin promotes cell spreading and cell attachment activity mediated by α 2 β 1 integrin. Although the sequence of the EF 2 peptide (DFATVQLRNGFPYFSYDLG) is homologous sequence to that of EF 1, EF 2 does not promote cell attachment activity. To determine whether there are structural differences between EF 1 and EF 2, we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations and conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that EF 1 and EF 2 had β-sheet structure as a secondary structure around the global minimum. However, EF 2 had variety of structures around the global minimum compared with EF 1 and has easily escaped from the bottom of free energy. The <b>structural</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of the EF 1 is smaller than that of the EF 2. The structural variation of EF 2 is related to these differences in the <b>structural</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and the number of the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). From the analysis of H-bonds in the β-sheet, the number of H-bonds in EF 1 is larger than that in EF 2 in the time scale of the conventional MD simulation, suggesting that the formation of H-bonds is related to the differences in the <b>structural</b> <b>fluctuation</b> between EF 1 and EF 2. From the analysis of other non-covalent interactions in the amino acid sequences of EF 1 and EF 2, EF 1 has three pairs of residues with hydrophobic interaction, and EF 2 has two pairs. These results indicate that several non-covalent interactions are important for structural stabilization. Consequently, the structure of EF 1 is stabilized by H-bonds and pairs of hydrophobic amino acids in the terminals. Hence, we propose that non-covalent interactions around N-terminal and C-terminal of the peptides are crucial for maintaining the β-sheet structure of the peptides...|$|E
