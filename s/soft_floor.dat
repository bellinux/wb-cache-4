To investigate this, groups of pregnant heifers were allocated to deep straw bedding (Soft) or cubicles (Hard), both with scraped concrete feeding alleys. After the grazing season, they were re-housed in cubicle systems, half on slatted concrete (Hard) and half on slatted rubber (Soft) alleys. Claw measurements, contact area and pressure distribution claw/flooring, claw disorders and leg lesions were recorded at the start and end of each housing season. Locomotion and leg lesions were also scored monthly after calving. Prevalence of sole haemorrhages was higher among pregnant heifers in cubicles than in deep straw. After calving, first-calvers on Hard floors had higher odds for lameness (OR = 3. 6; P < 0. 01), sole haemorrhages/ulcers (OR = 2. 2; P < 0. 05), white-line haemorrhages (OR = 2. 8; P < 0. 01) and leg lesions (OR = 2. 6; P < 0. 02) than those on <b>Soft</b> <b>floors.</b> Lowest prevalence and severity of sole and white-line haemorrhages (non-significant) in first-calvers was found in those on <b>Soft</b> <b>floors</b> and reared on Hard floors and the highest prevalence and severity on those on Hard <b>floors</b> reared on <b>Soft</b> <b>floors.</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>flooring</b> after calving is of most importance for healthy feet and legs...|$|R

40|$|The {{real-time}} bidding (RTB), aka programmatic buying, {{has recently}} become {{the fastest growing}} area in online ad-vertising. Instead of bulking buying and inventory-centric buying, RTB mimics stock exchanges and utilises computer algorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time; It uses per impression context and targets the ads to spe-cific people based on data about them, and hence dramat-ically increases the effectiveness of display advertising. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis and measure-ment of a production ad exchange. Using the data sam-pled from both demand and supply side, we aim to provide first-hand insights into the emerging new impression selling infrastructure and its bidding behaviours, and help identi-fying research and design issues in such systems. From our study, we observed that periodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks, bids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest time-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns in RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first price payment in fact is accounted for 55. 4 % of total cost due to {{the arrangement of the}} <b>soft</b> <b>floor</b> price. As such, we argue that the setting of <b>soft</b> <b>floor</b> price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable position.

With this vision, the ensuing problem on two-dimensional building models, non-incorporating soil-structure interaction, is being tackled by both analytical and neural network approaches. Computational results from both ends (of the approaches) show that the wave energy does not always propagate from the ground into the building, but for lower frequency range it sails to the building without any disturbances. However, for higher frequency range, the computational results show that the building experiences large “torsional” deformations, as a result the building may collapse. Finally, both the approaches maintain a good agreement among themselves. The present investigation may lead to a long way in contributing to better and more rational, simplified design criteria...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of damage to}} the claws and legs in piglets caused by the floor in farrowing pens is a widely known problem and very common in today's pig herds. Although the association between floor and damage {{has been known for}} over 35 years, no suitable solution has been found to reduce the negative impact. The {{purpose of this study was}} to make a literature study to document the experiences of the use of different types of flooring in farrowing pens and also, in an own study, examine if <b>soft</b> <b>floor</b> in farrowing crates could lead to reduced damage to the claws and legs in piglets compared to concrete floor. The study was conducted in two herds, A and B. In each herd, farrowing pens with concrete floor and concrete floor with polyurethane coating were compared. Data was collected from four and three batches in herd A and herd B respectively. In total, 270 piglets from 24 litters in herd A and 219 piglets from 18 litters in herd B were examined. The examination recorded number of injuries on; horn, sole, accessory digits, coronets, knees, fetlocks and hocks and the number of foot injuries, arthritis and claws abscesses. The definition of injury was perforated skin and all injuries were recorded on each individual piglet. In herd A, diameter of knee injuries and injuries on teats were also registered. The results showed that the piglets on the polyurethane coated floor in herd A had a significantly (p < 0. 05) lower number of injuries on their hocks compared to the piglets on the concrete floor. The proportion of piglets with injuries on hocks was 23. 0 % on concrete and 3. 3 % on polyurethane. For damages to the coronets, fetlocks, knees and diameter of knee injury there was a tendency (p < 0. 10) to fewer injuries and smaller wounds on the knees for piglets on the polyurethane coated floor. In herd B, the number of injuries on the horn and sole were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower on the polyurethane coated floor compared to the concrete floor. The proportions of piglets with injuries on horns and soles were 16. 7 % on concrete and 0. 0 % on polyurethane for horns, and 37. 7 % on concrete and 1. 0 % on polyurethane for soles. The conclusion is that <b>soft</b> <b>floor</b> in the farrowing pen can reduce the {{incidence of}} certain types of claw and leg injuries compared to concrete flooring. However, further and larger studies will be required to find the optimum floor type for piglets in order to improve the animal welfare and to reduce the use of antibiotics...|$|E

In order to assess the effects of long-term exposure to flooring systems differing in hardness and abrasiveness installed in the walking and standing areas an experimental study was carried out. Claw conformation, claw horn growth and wear rates, as well as static weight and pressure distribution were evaluated. On a rougher flooring (mastic asphalt), exaggerated wear, highest growth rate and a loss of sole concavity was seen, and most weight was exerted to the sole area of the claws. When rubber-equipped feed-stalls were used together with mastic asphalt in alleys cows showed reduced wear, positive net growth and reduced loss of the concavity compared to cows housed on asphalt alley surfaces. In comparison with asphalt flooring, rubber mats on the alleys resulted in lower growth and wear rates, increased net growth, preserved sole concavity and the bulb and wall area of the claw carried the most weight. Rubber mats together with little exposure to an abrasive asphalt surface resulted in claw horn net growth rates similar to that observed on aged, low abrasive concrete slatted floor. It was concluded that <b>soft</b> <b>flooring</b> provides good locomotion comfort for dairy cows but a moderate abrasion is also required to prevent claw overgrowth...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the manner in}} which a cow's claws make contact with the ground at the walk, the gait, and in particular the claw-ground contact pattern, were studied in 12 healthy, lactating dairy cows, using high-speed cinematography (500 frames/s) while the animals were walking on a treadmill. The results showed that the limbs were advanced around the contralateral limbs in a sigmoid curve. The feet contacted the ground with the foot axis and the tips of the claws rotated slightly outwards. In all cows the lateral claws contacted the ground before the medial claws in the hindlimbs, and in 10 / 12 cows in the forelimbs. The heel of the lateral claws was the region of initial contact with the ground in the hindlimbs of all cows and in the forelimbs in 9 / 12 cows. Lateral 'heel first' contact in the fore and hindlimbs appeared to be the normal gait pattern in these animals. Compared with a previous study of heifers, lactating cows had a larger step width in the hindlimbs and a smaller step width in the forelimbs. These ground contact patterns offer an explanation for the predisposition to claw disorders of the lateral claw of the hindlimb. The results of this study reinforce the suggestion that <b>soft</b> <b>floor</b> surfaces should be provided for cattle to prevent mechanical injury to the claws...|$|E

Data were collected from 49 cows in 53 lactation periods, which were divided into experimental group (n = 26) on rubber matted floor (EBG) and control group (n = 27) on concrete slatted floor (BBG). Housing conditions of both groups differed in kind of cubicles. EBG had soft rubber mat mattresses, BBG had cubicles with straw manure mattresses. Data analysed originated from the official milk performance testing of the "Landeskuratorium der Erzeugerringe für tierische Veredelung in Bayern e. V. " and from activity counters worn by the cows.

40|$|Cubicle housing {{offers a}} good {{compromise}} between {{the needs of}} the animals and those of the breeders; {{it is one of the}} main housing systems for dairy cows. The recommendations relative to the design and management of cubicle housing are, however, always subject to revision. Special attention is now being given to the improvement of animal comfort, particularly with regards to the lying cow. In this context, the level of comfort is estimated by the duration of the lying time, the frequency of the lying bouts and the ease with which cows are able to get up and lie down. The level of cow comfort is in direct relation to the softness of the floor, to the cubicle dimensions, and to the design of the lateral and frontal partitions. A <b>soft</b> <b>floor</b> can be assured through the use of either multilayer mattresses or a thick litter. Mattresses must be covered with a litter material that absorbs surface moisture and helps to ensure the cleanliness of the stall and udder. To achieve these objectives, the nature of the litter material (straw, sawdust, sand, lime, etc.) appears to be less important than the frequency of renewal. Cubicle floors covered with a thick layer (± 20 cm) of litter seem generally better appreciated by the cows than those equipped with mattresses, and their use is associated with a lower frequency of leg injuries as well as lameness. Sand appears to be a top-grade material for ensuring animal comfort. Nevertheless, the maintenance of a thick layer of litter demands an extra daily labor requirement and the handling of sand as a litter material requires specific equipment. There is a wide range of recommendations on cubicle dimensions due to differences in cow size and the need to take into account the cleanliness of the floor. Lateral partitions must be evaluated for their effectiveness in constraining the animal from spilling out into the neighboring cubicles while at the same time avoiding both injury and difficulties experienced by the cow in getting up and lying down. Finally, frontal partitions must be evaluated regarding their effectiveness in providing sufficient space to allow the cow to thrust its head forward as it stands up. Peer reviewe...|$|E
