[...] Dave Kehr of The New York Times reviewed the film writing, [...] "A delirious Bollywood reimagining of Reservoir Dogs, complete with musical numbers, <b>Sanjay</b> <b>Gupta's</b> Kaante shifts as fluidly between cinematic idioms as it does between Hindi and English." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "there is a steadfast earnestness in director <b>Sanjay</b> <b>Gupta's</b> deluded attempt to equal or even better Hollywood on its own ground that is rather touching -- but not to the degree that it sustains the film's many tedious stretches." ...|$|R
