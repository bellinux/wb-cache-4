40|$|The {{indirect}} rnatrix converter {{has been}} the subject to investigation for some time. One of the favorable features of this con verter is the absence of a de-link capacitar, which allows for the construction of compact converters capable of operating at adverse atmospheric conditions such as extreme temperatures and pressures. These features have been explored extensively and are the main reasons why the matrix converters family has been investigated for decades. The indirect matrix converter features an easy to implement and secure commutation technique, the de-link zero current commutation. Moreover, the conventional indirect matrix converter has bidirectional power flow capabilities and it can be designed to have small sized reactive elements in its input filter. These characteristics make the matrix converter a suitable technology for high efficiency converters for specific applications such as military, aerospace, wind turbine generator system, external elevators for building construction and <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mill,</b> where these advantages make up for the additional cost of an indirect matrix converter compared to conventional converters. This converter uses complex pulse width modulation and space vector modulation schemes to achieve the goal of unity displacement power factor and sinusoidal output current. Thanks to technological advances, fast and powerful microprocessors are used for the control and modulation of power converters. To deal with the high processing power needed for these microprocessors, some research has shown the positive potential of model-based predictive control techniques in many power electronics applications. While there are a few challenges to the predictive control method, it has been demonstrated as an appealing alternative to power converters control because its concepts are very intuitive and easy to understand, and it can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} systems. In addition, it may involve multiple variable systems and non-linear constraints, making it an easy controller to implement, especially since it is open to modifications and extensions for specific applications. Predictive current control can be described as a particular case of model-based predictive control which takes into account the inherent discrete nature of the switching states of the power converter and the digital implementation. JVIost of predictive current control methods applied in matrix converters take into consideration the output current regulation and the reactive power minimization on the input side, obtaining input currents in phase with their respective phase voltages. However, this cannot ensure that they present a sinusoidal waveform, especially when harmonic distortion in the source voltage or strong resonances on the input filter are present. To enhance the quality of the source current, in this document is illustrate how the predictive current control can be applied to an indirect matrix converter and how both source and load currents waveforms can be controlled...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling on tensile and microstructural properties of three industrial grade steels was investigated. <b>Skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling {{was performed on}} a laboratory mill equipped with a device designed to reproduce the effects of sheet tension and with load cells aimed at measuring the main working parameters. Analysis on tensile properties of <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolled samples showed for an ultralow C grade and a low C grade a decreasing trend of the yield strength down to a minimum, followed by progressive rising values with increasing rolling elongation. This trend was related to changes of the tensile curve shape, leading to a transition from discontinuous to continuous yielding. A zinc-coated mild steel grade featured a tensile curve with a knee at transition from elastic to plastic regime. Accordingly, the change in yield strength with increasing <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> elongation followed a linear trend. Microstructural and crystallographic information supplied by EBSD analyses suggested that the plastic strain induced by <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling originated a fairly homogeneous deformation field even on grains directly exposed on the strip surface.

40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or roller) {{leveling}} or by skin-pass rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during <b>skin</b> <b>passing,</b> and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> condition...|$|R
40|$|The common {{grades of}} steel used in roll forming are: hot rolled carbon steel, high {{strength}} low alloy and recovery annealed cold rolled sheet. These steels {{are prone to}} ageing and are often <b>skin</b> <b>passed</b> and/or roller leveled to eliminate ageing as it can lead to problems in forming. In roll forming, shape defects such as bow, twist and camber are considered to be related to very small plastic strains in the longitudinal direction and hence knowledge of the material properties in the elastic plastic transition range is necessary if the process is to be modelled accurately. Previous studies with aluminium have indicated that <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling can lead to residual stresses in the strip. In this work, the study was extended to aged carbon steel and to the effect of roller leveling on both aged material and strip that had been given a light cold rolling to simulate a <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> treatment. The results suggest that roller leveling reduced the magnitude of residual stresses resulting from <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling. The significant differences observed between tensile and bending test results, at and near, the elastic plastic transition reinforces the need to consider bending properties when assessing the effect of prior processing on strip for roll forming. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Bending {{and reverse}} bending are the {{dominant}} material deformations in roll forming, and hence property data derived from bend tests {{could be more}} relevant than tensile test data for numerical simulation of a roll forming process. Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses change the material behavior close to the yield in a bending test. So, residual stresses introduced during prior steel processing operations may affect the roll forming process, and therefore {{they need to be}} included in roll forming simulations to achieve improved model accuracy. Measuring the residual stress profile experimentally is time consuming and has limited accuracy while analytical models that are available require detailed information about the pre-processing conditions that is generally not available for roll forming materials. The main goal {{of this study is to}} develop an inverse routine that determines a residual stress profile through the material thickness based on experimental pure bend test data. A numerical model of the <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> (temper rolling) process is performed to introduce a residual stress profile in DP 780 steel sheet. The <b>skin</b> <b>passed</b> strips are used in a pure bending simulation to record moment-curvature data and this data is then applied in an inverse analysis to predict the residual stress profile in the material. Comparison of the residual stress profile predicted by the inverse routine with that calculated by finite element analysis (FEA) indicates an inverse approach combined with pure bend test may present an alternative to predict residual stresses in sheet metals...|$|R
