40|$|We {{initially}} <b>simplify</b> a three-phase <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> to a 'primitive' star-shaped structure {{formed by}} three planar interfaces meeting at a common line of intersection, and calculate the line tension {{associated with this}} primitive picture. Next, we consider the well-known more refined picture of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> that includes a 'core structure' consisting of interface deviations away from the planar interface picture. The corresponding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> properties were calculated earlier, within mean-field theory, using an interface displacement model or a more microscopic density-functional theory. The question we ask is {{to what extent the}} thermodynamic line tension of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> near a wetting phase transition {{can be attributed to the}} core structure. To answer it we compare our result for the line tension contribution associated with the primitive structure to the known line tension of the full structure (within mean-field theory). While our primitive structure calculation provides a surprisingly useful upper bound to the known line tension near a critical wetting transition, the nontrivial core structure of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> near first-order wetting is found to be responsible for an important difference between the known line tension and the upper bound provided by the primitive picture calculation. This accounts also for the discrepancy between the line tensions calculated by two different methods in an earlier mean-field density-functional model of a first-order wetting transition. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this paper we report the effects of surface roughness on <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients of water droplets on micro- and nano-patterned surfaces. Both advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients have been measured, analyzed and compared on smooth, one-tier (with micropillars), and two-tier (with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on micropillars) surfaces {{over a wide range}} of <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> velocities and droplet volumes. Our results indicate that superhydrophobic surfaces with CNTs on top of micropillars can significantly decrease both the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients. In comparison, both the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients on smooth surfaces were more than ten times larger than those on superhydrophobic surfaces. However, droplets on one-tier surfaces with only micropillars exhibit different dynamic behaviors on advancing and receding movements. We experimentally investigated the Wenzel-Cassie transition on micropillar structures and found that the receding motion on micropillars is dominated by the Wenzel behavior, which leads to higher receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients on one-tier surfaces. However, there is a high tendency for an advancing droplet to exhibit Cassie-type behaviors on one-tier surfaces. As a result, advancing <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficient is considerably mitigated on micropillars. On two-tier superhydrophobic surfaces, it was the Cassieâ€“Baxter behavior that dominates both the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> motions giving rise to less friction coefficients. Furthermore, the effects of surface roughness on <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> hysteresis are discussed in this paper. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 We {{study the}} {{evaporation}} of liquid droplets on flat and curved heated substrates. We derive an evolution equation for the drop thickness to evaluate its shape as it evaporates on a curved substrate. We adopt a one-sided model with thermal control which, {{together with the}} lubrication approximation, results in an evolution equation for the local height of the droplet. Without requiring any pre-assumption for {{the shape of the}} drop, we formulate the problem for the two modes of evaporation: (i) pinned <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> and (ii) moving <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> with fixed <b>contact</b> angle. For each evaporation mode, we solve the problem numerically for flat and curved solid substrates, separately. We first analyze the simplified evolution equation for the case of flat solid substrates. For the pinned <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> case, we observe that after a time interval the contact angle, i. e. the angle between the solid and the interface at the <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> dynamics become nonlinear and, interestingly, the local contact angle goes to zero in advance of total evaporation of the drop. For the case of moving <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> in which the singularity at the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is treated by a numerical slip model, we find that the droplet nearly keeps its initial circular shape and that the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> recedes with constant speed. We then analyze the problem for various periodic and quasi-periodic substrate profiles. For the case of pinned <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> we find the results to be very similar to the flat case. For the case of moving <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> we study the dynamics of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> and the apparent contact angle, i. e. the angle that the liquid appears to make with the solid surface when viewed at such a coarse resolution that the substrate appears flat (the angle between the horizon and the interface at the <b>contact</b> <b>line).</b> In contrast with our results for a flat substrate, for which the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> recedes at a nearly constant speed, we observe that the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> speed and position show significant time variation and that the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> moves in an approximately step-like fashion on relatively steep substrates. For the simplest case of a periodic substrate, we find that the apparent contact angle is periodic in time. For doubly periodic substrates, we find that the apparent contact angle is again periodic and that the problem exhibits a phase-locking behavior. For multi-mode quasi-periodic substrates, we find the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> behavior to be temporally complex and not only limited to an approximately step-like motion. In all cases, we find that the overall evaporation is increased relative to the flat substrate...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the pinning and {{depinning}} {{mechanism of}} the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> during droplet evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is numerically investigated using a thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with liquid-vapor phase change. A local force balance {{in the context of}} diffuse interfaces is introduced to explain the equilibrium states of droplets on chemically patterned surfaces. It is shown that, when the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is pinned on a hydrophobic-hydrophilic boundary, different contact angles can be interpreted as the variation of the length of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> occupied by each component. The stick-slip-jump behavior of evaporating droplets on chemically patterned surfaces is well captured by the LB simulations. Particularly, a slow movement of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is clearly observed during the stick (pinning) mode, which shows that the pinning of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> during droplet evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is actually a dynamic pinning process and the dynamic equilibrium is achieved by the self-adjustment of the <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> occupied by each component.
