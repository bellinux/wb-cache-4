I wrote some part of these rambling remarks on a high ridge of rock and turf overlooking a stretch of the central counties; the rise was slight enough in reality, but the immediate ascent had been so steep and sudden that one could not avoid the fancy that on reaching the summit one would look down at the stars. But one did not look down at the stars, but rather up at the cities; seeing as high in heaven the palace town of Alfred like a lit sunset cloud, and away in the void spaces, like a planet in eclipse, Salisbury. So, it may be hoped, until we die you and I will always look up rather than down at the labours and the habitations of our race; we will lift up our eyes to the valleys from whence cometh our help. For from every special eminence and beyond every sublime landmark, it is good for our souls to see only vaster and vaster visions of that dizzy and divine level; and to behold from our crumbling turrets the tall plains of equality.|$|E

(We should be sitting on a seat on the Gutsch and looking down on the Lucerne of Utopia, a Lucerne that would, I insist, quite arbitrarily, still keep the Wasserthurm and the Kapellbrucke.) You have only to mark the beauty, the simple cleanliness and balance of this world, you have only to see the free carriage, the unaffected graciousness of even the common people, to understand how fine and complete the arrangements of this world must be. How are they made so? We of the twentieth century are not going to accept the sweetish, faintly nasty slops of Rousseauism that so gratified our great-great-grandparents in the eighteenth. We know that order and justice do not come by Nature--"if only the policeman would go away." [...] These things mean intention, will, carried to a scale that our poor vacillating, hot and cold earth has never known. What I am really <b>seeing</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> clearly is the will beneath this visible Utopia. Convenient houses, admirable engineering that is no offence amidst natural beauties, beautiful bodies, and a universally gracious carriage, these are only the outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace. Such an order means discipline. It means triumph over the petty egotisms and vanities that keep men on our earth apart; it means devotion and a nobler hope; it cannot exist without a gigantic process of inquiry, trial, forethought and patience in an atmosphere of mutual trust and concession. Such a world as this Utopia is not made by the chance occasional co-operations of self-indulgent men, by autocratic rulers or by the bawling wisdom of the democratic leader.

40|$|This {{paper will}} address a practice-based {{research}} project that {{set out to}} explore how the performance space and the performers’ bodies can be transformed through embodying images, and to reflect upon the body and space as a site where intimacy is constructed and deconstructed. The initial theme was an impossible love affair between Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer, {{and in response to}} this theme it became evident that key metaphors was were spatial metaphors. Through a process of the compression of visual/physical metaphors, which are articulated through the interrelationship of the performers’ bodies, the archetypal image of the home was constructed through a stark Paper Room design. Bachelard suggests: ‘the house image would appear to have become the topography of the intimate being’. The Paper Room structure connotes a blank canvas filled with potential that evokes and provokes action. Throughout the performance the enactment of fantasies and desires, meetings and partings, the performers’ bodies transform and are transformed by the space. This gradually becomes un-homely or ‘unheimlich (Freud). Thus, a reversal of the metaphor of the ‘home’ as an intimate space to one of incessant physical and psychological eviction. This process revealed that metaphor is a ‘thought process’, as Serig states: ‘the idea that visual metaphor in artists’ practices connotes ‘thinking’ and ‘working processes’ rather than determining objects’. This thought process is defined by Bachelard’s notion of ‘reverie’ and the practice draws upon Release Technique as a process of embodiment of imagery, that leads to a complex visual expression that requires <b>seeing</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> sensing <b>more,</b> an imaginative response ‘beyond the veil of words to an intuitive apprehension’ (Perkins) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Traditional archaeological {{approaches}} {{in the central}} Negev Desert used to employ excavation techniques in post-prehistoric periods in which stratigraphy is based on architecture, while material culture forms the basis for dating assessment and chronology. Such an approach was understandable, as it focused on the most visible remains of past human habitation. However, the detailed habitation record is in the soil {{rather than in the}} walls. Moreover, ceramics and stone tools in desert cultures often have limited time resolution in terms of absolute chronology. The rural desert site of Horvat Haluqim in the central Negev yielded 2 habitation periods with the traditional methodology: (1) Roman period, 2 nd– 3 rd centuries CE; (2) Iron Age IIA, 10 th century BCE. We have conducted at Horvat Haluqim initial excavations in small building remains that were never excavated before. Our excavation methodology focuses on detailed examination of the archaeological soil in building structures, coupled with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating for chronology, and micromor-phology of undisturbed soil samples to study stratigraphy and soil contents at the microscopic scale. Here, we report prelim-inary results, concentrating on the 14 C dates. These suggest a much longer habitation history at the site during the Iron Age. The 14 C dates obtained so far from these building remains cover Iron Age I, II, III, and the Persian period. The oldest cali-brated date (charred C 4 plants) in a rectangular building structure (L 100) is 1129 – 971 BCE (60. 5 %, highest relative proba-bility). The youngest calibrated date in a round building structure (L 700) is 540 – 411 BCE (57. 9 %, highest relative probability). This excavation methodology provides additional “eyes ” to look at past human habitation in the Negev Desert, <b>seeing</b> <b>more</b> periods <b>and</b> <b>more</b> detail than was possible with traditional schemes and ceramic dating...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} examined {{mental health}} practitioners' attitudes towards, satisfaction with {{and use of}} suicide prevention contracting (SPC) techniques. Survey respondents comprised consultant psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, mental health nurses, psychologists, registered medical officers and social workers.

There was a 31 % response rate, producing 420 valid questionnaires. The results of the research re-confirm the historical trajectory of SPC, from its early beginnings as a relationship-based suicide-risk assessment technique to one that is used in contemporary practice by practitioners to meet a range of objectives. The research focused on three SPC techniques in operation in clinical practice: verbal no-suicide assurances, no-suicide agreements, and written no-suicide contracts. Analysis of the data suggests {{a number of important}} findings. The first of these is that practitioners perceive different utility among these three techniques.

Thirdly, a practitioner's gender, and formal training were significant in the perception and application of SPC techniques. Finally, suicidal behaviours and completed suicide was a clinical outcome in some situations irrespective of the use and non-use of SPC. The findings of this research are used to provide an emerging conceptual framework and associated nomenclature that inform clinical decision-making in relation to SPC. In addition, a conceptual model is presented which demonstrates that the potential for injudicious use of SPC techniques is as much precipitated by individual factors as it is by broader environmental factors.

40|$|Goal: To assist {{drivers in}} <b>seeing</b> <b>more</b> clearly <b>and</b> {{navigating}} <b>more</b> safely {{during the night}} time using Infrared and Bluetooth technology. Areas with low visibility, such as suburban neighborhoods and mountainsides that are not readily outfitted with street lights, pose a danger to both pedestrians and drivers. In these situations, using your low-beam headlights might not illuminate the road far enough to avoid dangers. Drivers can choose to use their high beams to see further, but {{at the cost of}} blinding oncoming drivers, which is unsafe for anyone on the road. In another situation, regardless of lighting conditions, the use of GPS devices are common to make one’s commute easier. However, many GPS devices, whether it is already built into the vehicle, or if it’s an external device, requires the user to avert their eyes away from the road to view a map or the upcoming turns. This process of taking one’s eyes off the road to look at the center console or the GPS device, can be distracting and dangerous. Our project aims {{to address the problem of}} (1) low visibility, by emitting and capturing infrared light (IR), light outside the visible spectrum, to better illuminate the road at night, and (2) distracted driving, by allowing the user to view the IR capture and their GPS devices in the form of a heads-up display (HUD) that will be directly situated in front of the driver.   Team Members James Slong - CpE slongj@uci. edu Ryan Barekat - CpE rbarekat@uci. edu Cesar Tejeda - EE tejedac@uci. edu Michael Nguyen - EE mvnguye 1 @uci. edu Advisor: Fadi Kurdahi Website: [URL]...|$|R
