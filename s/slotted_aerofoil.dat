40|$|Local {{scouring}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of bridge damage or collapse in river crossings. Bridge failure can cause severe damage and can result in serious injury or death. Hence, study on the control of scouring at bridge piers plays an important role in bridge design. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a <b>slotted</b> <b>aerofoil</b> shaped pier in reducing local scour, as compared to a circular shaped and aerofoil shaped pier. The piers were tested under clear-water conditions for a uration of 3 hours and the resulting scour holes were scanned using a ScanStation 2. Further to this, velocity measurements were recorded at key points around the piers using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The results showed that the <b>slotted</b> <b>aerofoil</b> shaped pier reduces local scour. The reduction of the scour hole volume was about 85...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{aerodynamic}} control devices {{have been used}} for regulating wind turbines, some of which are briefly reviewed. Leading edge slats are proposed with the twofold functions of either stabilising leading edge flow on the main aerofoil or spoiling flow when required for airbrake or torque reduction purposes. The aim of the paper is to present the theoretical basis of vortex element analyses for simulating such flows. First of all a potential flow method is presented for predicting the unstalled behaviour of a <b>slotted</b> <b>aerofoil.</b> This is extended to the vortex dynamics modelling of the fully viscous flow and applied to simulate the natural stall of the slatted aerofoil and also the deliberate use of the slat as an airbrake or spoiler...|$|E
40|$|A triple <b>slotted</b> <b>aerofoil</b> {{following}} the Handley Page 44 F design was tested at City University London T- 2 wind tunnel. The model allowed {{the study of}} a fixed triple slotted wing as well as investigation {{of the effects of}} isolated slots at different locations along the chord. PIV measurements were performed within the chord Reynolds number range in between approximately 200, 000 - 400, 000. The model was tested at an angle of attack of 22 o. Measurements of mean streamwise velocity, velocity fluctuations and shear stress were analysed. The study shows how an isolated slot is more favourable when it is placed closest to the leading edge, although slow moving fluid regions can still be found close to the trailing edge. Fully attached flow was only achievable by using all three slots. In addition, the fully slotted profile is shown to generate channel exit velocities in the order of 1. 4 Uâˆž, which highly energise the boundary layer on the suction side...|$|E
