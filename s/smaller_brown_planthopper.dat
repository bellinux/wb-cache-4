30|$|Among {{its many}} effects, global warming {{influences}} the distribution, incidence {{and severity of}} plant disease worldwide (Juroszek and von Tiedemann 2015). In rice (Oryza sativa L.), many pests and the pathogens they transmit are influenced by global warming. For example, a geographical shift in the prevalence of rice stripe virus disease, transmitted by the <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper,</b> is predicted to result from global warming in Japan (Yamamura and Yokozawa 2002). In addition, several pathogens {{are expected to be}} directly influenced by global warming. Among these are pathogens that cause agriculturally important diseases such as sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, brown spot (BS), caused by Bipolaris oryzae, and bacterial seedling rot (BSR) and bacterial grain rot (BGR), both caused by Burkholderia glumae, because the optimal temperature ranges for growth of these pathogens are relatively high (around 30  °C). Sheath blight is considered as one of the three major diseases of rice (along with blast and bacterial blight) (Zou et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2010), and many studies have been done to enhance resistance to sheath blight.

Understanding resistance mechanisms is essential to the management of this pest. Biochemical and molecular assays were performed in this study to systematically characterize deltamethrin resistance mechanisms with laboratory-selected resistant and susceptible strains of SBPH. Methodology/Principal Findings: Deltamethrin resistant strains of SBPH (JH-del) were derived from a field population by continuously selections (up to 30 generations) in the laboratory, while a susceptible strain (JHS) was obtained from the same population by removing insecticide pressure for 30 generations. The role of detoxification enzymes in the resistance was investigated using synergism and enzyme activity assays with strains of different resistant levels. Furthermore, 71 cytochrome P 450, 93 esterases and 12 glutathione-S-transferases cDNAs were cloned based on transcriptome data of a field collected population. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR screening analysis of 176 identified detoxification genes demonstrated that multiple P 450 and esterase genes were overexpressed (> 2 -fold) in JH-del strains (G 4 and G 30) when compared to that in JHS, and the results of quantitative PCR coincided with the semi-quantitative RT-PCR results.

However, {{it is not}} known whether an antiviral RNAi response is also induced in insects by reoviruses, whose double-stranded RNA genome replication is thought to occur within core particles. Deep sequencing of small RNAs showed that when the <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper</b> (Laodelphax striatellus) was infected by Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) (Reoviridae; Fijivirus), more viral-derived siRNAs accumulated than when the vector insect was infected by Rice stripe virus (RSV), a negative single-stranded RNA virus. RBSDV siRNAs were predominantly 21 and 22 nucleotides long and there were almost equal numbers of positive and negative sense. RBSDV siRNAs were frequently generated from hotspots in the 5 '- and 3 '-terminal regions of viral genome segments but these hotspots were not associated with any predicted RNA secondary structures. Under laboratory condition, L. striatellus can be infected simultaneously with RBSDV and RSV. Double infection enhanced the accumulation of particular genome segments but not viral coat protein of RBSDV and correlated with an increase in the abundance of siRNAs derived from RBSDV.

Compared with the insects in other orders, hymenopterans had small genomes, which were averagely about ~ 200 Mb. We found that the genome sizes of four insect species were different between male and female, showing the organismal complexity of insects.

Although several RBSDV proteins have been studied in detail, the functions of the nonstructural protein P 7 - 1 are still largely unknown. To investigate the role of the P 7 - 1 protein in virus pathogenicity, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were generated in which the P 7 - 1 gene was expressed {{under the control of the}} 35 S promoter. The RBSDV P 7 - 1 -transgenic Arabidopsis plants (named P 7 - 1 -OE) were male sterility. Flowers and pollen from P 7 - 1 -transgenic plants were of normal size and shape, and anthers developed to the normal size but failed to dehisce. The non-dehiscent anthers observed in P 7 - 1 -OE were attributed to decreased lignin content in the anthers. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species levels were quite low in the transgenic plants compared with the wild type.

The disease cycle can be described as follows: SRBSDV and its WBPH vector overwinter in warm tropical or sub-tropical areas; viruliferous WBPH adults carry the virus from south to north via long-distance migration in early spring, transmit the virus to rice seedlings in the newly colonized areas, and lay eggs on the infected seedlings; the next generation of WBPHs propagate on infected seedlings, become viruliferous, disperse, and cause new disease outbreaks.

Observations by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) also indicated that these two proteins colocalized in nurse cells. Knockdown of Vg expression due to RNA interference resulted in inhibition of the invasion of ovarioles by RSV. Together, the data obtained indicated that RSV RNPs may enter the nurse cell of the germarium via endocytosis through binding with Vg.

The salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), NPR 1, EDS 1 and PAD 4 were induced rapidly and to a much higher level in the resistant variety Kasalath than in the susceptible cultivar Wuyujing 3 in response to SBPH infestation. The expression level of PAL in the Kasalath rice at 12 h post-infestation (hpi) increased 7. 52 -fold compared with the un-infested control, and the expression level in Kasalath was 49. 63, 87. 18, 57. 36 and 75. 06 times greater than that in Wuyujing 3 at 24, 36, 48 and 72 hpi, respectively.

Compared with indica rice, japonica rice was more susceptible to SBPH. Antixenosis test, antibiosis test and correlation analysis were performed to elucidate the resistance mechanism. The resistant check Rathu Heenati (RHT), highly resistant varieties Mudgo and Kasalath, and resistant variety IR 36 expressed strong antixenosis and antibiosis against SBPH, indicating the close relationship between resistance level and these two resistance mechanisms in the four rice varieties. Antibiosis was the dominant resistance pattern in the resistant varieties Daorenqiao and Yangmaogu due to their high antibiosis but low antixenosis. Dular, ASD 7 and Milyang 23 had relatively strong antixenosis and antibiosis, indicating the two resistance mechanisms were significant in these three varieties. The resistant DV 85 expressed relatively high level of antixenosis but low antibiosis, whereas Zhaiyeqing 8 and Guiyigu conferred only moderate antibiosis and antixenosis to SBPH, suggesting tolerance in these three varieties. Antibiosis and antixenosis governed the resistance to SBPH in the moderately resistant accession 9311. Antixenosis was the main resistance type in V 20 A.

In the interaction process between RSV and rice, 87 genes were thought to be related to RSV resistance; these primarily included 12 peroxidase biosynthesis genes, 12 LRR receptor-like protein kinase genes, 6 genes coding pathogenesis-related proteins, 4 glycine-rich cell wall structural protein genes, 2 xyloglucan hydrolase genes and a cellulose synthase. The results indicate that the rice-pathogen interaction happened both in disease-resistant and susceptible varieties, and some genes related to JA biosynthesis played key roles in the interaction between SBPHs and rice. When rice was infected by RSV a hypersensitive reaction (HR) in the disease-resistant variety was suppressed, which resulted from an increase in peroxidase expression and down-regulation of LRR receptor-like protein kinase and pathogenesis-related proteins, while, the changes of peroxidase biosynthesis, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, cellulose synthase and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase could lead to the strengthening of physical barriers of rice, which may be an important resistance mechanism to RSV in rice...|$|R
40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper</b> (SBPH) {{and rice}} stripe virus (RSV) disease {{transmitted}} by SBPH cause serious damage to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in China. In the present study, we screened 312 rice accessions for resistance to SBPH. The indica variety, N 22, is highly resistant to SBPH. One {{hundred and eighty}} two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of N 22 and the highly susceptible variety, USSR 5, were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of resistances to SBPH and RSV. In a modified seedbox screening test, three QTLs for SBPH resistance, qSBPH 2, qSBPH 3 and qSBPH 7. 1, were mapped on chromosomes 2, 3 and 7, a total explaining 35. 1 % of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH 7. 2 and qSBPH 11. 2, conferring antibiosis against SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 and accounted for 20. 7 % of the total phenotypic variance. In addition, qSBPH 5 and qSBPH 7. 3, expressing antixenosis to SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 5 and 7, explaining 23. 9 % of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH 7. 1, qSBPH 7. 2 and qSBPH 7. 3, located in the same region between RM 234 and RM 429 on chromosome 7, using three different phenotyping methods indicate that the locus or region {{plays a major role}} in conferring resistance to SBPH in N 22. Moreover, three QTLs, qSTV 4, qSTV 11. 1 and qSTV 11. 2, for RSV resistance were detected on chromosomes 4 and 11. qSTV 11. 1 and qSTV 11. 2 are located in the same region between RM 287 and RM 209 on chromosome 11. Molecular markers spanning these QTLs should be useful in the development of varieties with resistance to SBPH and RSV...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} map the {{quantitative}} trait loci for rice stripe resistance, a molecular linkage map was constructed based on the F 2 population derived from a cross between Zhaiyeqing 8 and Wuyujing 3. Reactions of the two parents, F 1 individual and 129 F 2 : 3 lines to rice stripe were investigated by both artificial inoculation at laboratory and natural infection in the field, and the ratios of disease rating index were scored. The distribution of the ratios of disease rating index in Zhaiyeqing 8 /Wuyujing 3 F 2 : 3 population ranged from 0 to 134. 08 and from 6. 25 to 133. 6 under artificial inoculation at laboratory and natural infection in the field, respectively, and showed a marked bias towards resistant parent (Zhaiyeqing 8), indicating that the resistance to rice stripe was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). QTL analysis showed that the QTLs detected by the two inoculation methods were completely different. Only one QTL, qSTV 7, was detected under artificial inoculation, at which the Zhaiyeqing 8 allele increased the resistance to rice stripe, while two QTLs, qSTV 5 and qSTV 1, were detected under natural infection, in which resistant alleles came from Zhaiyeqing 8 and Wuyujing 3, respectively. These results showed that resistant parent Zhaiyeqing 8 carried the alleles associated with the resistance to rice stripe virus and the <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper,</b> and susceptible parent Wuyujing 3 also carried the resistant allele to rice stripe virus. In comparison with the results previously reported, QTLs detected {{in the study were}} new resistant genes to rice stripe disease.

40|$|The <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper</b> (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén, Homoptera, Delphacidae-SBPH) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{destructive}} pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Understanding on how rice responds to SBPH infestation will contribute to developing strategies for SBPH control. However, the response of rice plant to SBPH is poorly understood. In this study, two contrasting rice genotypes, Pf 9279 - 4 (SBPH-resistant) and 02428 (SBPH-susceptible), were used for comparative analysis of protein profiles in the leaf sheath of rice plants in responses to SBPH infestation. One hundred and thirty-two protein spots that were differentially expressed between the resistant and susceptible rice lines were identified with significant intensity differences (≥ 2 -fold, P < 0. 05) at 0, 6, and 12 h after SBPH infestation. Protein expression profile analysis in the leaf sheath of SBPH-resistant and SBPH-susceptible rice lines after SBPH infestation showed that proteins induced by SBPH feeding were involved mainly in stress response, photosynthesis, protein metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolic process, energy metabolism, cell wall-related proteins, amino acid metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Gene expression analysis of 24 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) showed that more than 50 % DEPs were positively correlated with their mRNA levels. Analysis of some physiological indexes mainly involved in the removal of oxygen reactive species showed that the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were considerably higher in Pf 9279 - 4 than 02428 during SBPH infestation. The catalase (CAT) activity and hydroxyl radical inhibition were lower in Pf 9279 - 4 than 02428. Analysis of enzyme activities indicates that Pf 9279 - 4 rice plants defend against SBPH through the activation of the pathway of the salicylic acid (SA) -dependent systemic acquired resistance. In conclusion, this study provides some insights into the molecular networks involved on cellular and physiological responses to SBPH infestation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper,</b> Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) {{enters the}} {{photoperiodic}} induction of diapause as 3 rd or 4 th instar nymphs. The photoperiodic response curves in this planthopper showed a typical long-day response type with a critical daylength of approximately 11 h at 25 °C, 12 h at 22 and 20 °C and 12. 5 h at 18 °C, and diapause induction was almost abrogated at 28 °C. The third stage {{was the most}} sensitive stage to photoperiod. The photoperiodic response curve at 20 °C showed a gradual decline in diapause incidence in ultra-long nights, and continuous darkness resulted in 100 % development. The required number of days for a 50 % response was distinctly different between the short- and long-night cycles, showing {{that the effect of}} one short night was equivalent to the effect of three long nights at 18 °C. The rearing day length of 12 h evoked a weaker intensity of diapause than did 10 and 11 h. The duration of diapause was significantly longer under the short daylength of 11 h than it was under the long daylength of 15 h. The optimal temperature for diapause termination was 26 and 28 °C. Chilling at 5 °C for different times did not shorten the duration of diapause but significantly lengthened it when chilling period was included. In autumn, 50 % of the nymphs that hatched from late September to mid-October entered diapause in response to temperatures below 20 °C. The critical daylength in the field was between 12 h 10 min and 12 h 32 min (including twilight), which was nearly identical to the critical daylength of 12. 5 h at 18 °C. In spring, overwintering nymphs began to emerge in early March-late March when the mean daily temperature rose to 10 °C or higher...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper</b> (Laodelphax striatellus) is an {{important}} agricultural pest that not only damages rice plants by sap-sucking, but also acts as a vector that transmits rice stripe virus (RSV), which can cause even more serious yield loss. Despite being a model organism for studying entomology, population biology, plant protection, molecular interactions among plants, viruses and insects, only a few genomic sequences are available for this species. To investigate its transcriptome and determine the differences between viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus, we employed 454 -FLX high-throughput pyrosequencing to generate EST databases of this insect. Results We obtained 201, 281 and 218, 681 high-quality reads from viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus, respectively, with an average read length as 230 bp. These reads were assembled into contigs and two EST databases were generated. When all reads were combined, 16, 885 contigs and 24, 607 singletons (a total of 41, 492 unigenes) were obtained, which represents a transcriptome of the insect. BlastX search against the NCBI-NR database revealed that only 6, 873 (16. 6 %) of these unigenes have significant matches. Comparison {{of the distribution of}} GO classification among viruliferous, naïve, and combined EST databases indicated that these libraries are broadly representative of the L. striatellus transcriptomes. Functionally diverse transcripts from RSV, endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia and yeast-like symbiotes were identified, which reflects the possible lifestyles of these microbial symbionts that live in the cells of the host insect. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that L. striatellus encodes similar innate immunity regulatory systems as other insects, such as RNA interference, JAK/STAT and partial Imd cascades, which might be involved in defense against viral infection. In addition, we determined the differences in gene expression between vector and naïve samples, which generated a list of candidate genes that are potentially involved in the symbiosis of L. striatellus and RSV. Conclusions To our knowledge, the present study is the first description of a genomic project for L. striatellus. The identification of transcripts from RSV, Wolbachia, yeast-like symbiotes and genes abundantly expressed in viruliferous insect, provided a starting-point for investigating the molecular basis of symbiosis among these organisms. </p...|$|R
