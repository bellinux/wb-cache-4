5000|$|By 1966, Lewis had <b>stopped</b> <b>drumming</b> {{altogether}} and was exclusively singing, replaced at drums by, among others, Jim Keltner. His career {{was put on}} hold {{when he entered the}} U.S. Army as a draftee in January 1967, and he served during the Vietnam War era and was stationed overseas with the Eighth Army in Seoul, South Korea, to 1968. Lewis has expressed that he was reluctant to go to Vietnam, but he credits the Army with being the time when he [...] "grew up".|$|R
5000|$|One {{night after}} the snake was done {{drinking}} its milk Allal did not <b>stop</b> <b>drumming</b> on the table but instead calling the snake towards him. Moments passed with no movement but then the snake suddenly made a move towards Allal. It then began to slither across Allal's body and then rested next to his head. He was very calm at this moment and looked right into the snake's eyes and felt almost one with the snake. Soon his eyes closed and he fell asleep in this position.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} as follows: person A turns his back to person B, who taps both hands rhythmically on A's back while saying a rhythmic, rhymed chant: Bulleri, bulleri bock, hur många horn står opp? (lit. bulleri, bulleri billy goat, how many horns are {{standing}} up?). B then <b>stops</b> <b>drumming,</b> but keeps some of his fingertips on A:s back. A then guesses how many fingers are pressed against his back. B responds with a chant corresponding to the right or the wrong answer, and the persons switch roles.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{more the}} little boy <b>stopped</b> <b>drumming</b> his heels, and shifted his stare from the old butler back to her who spoke. The cab, which had seemed to {{hesitate}} and start, as though jibbing at something in the road, resumed its ambling pace. Creed looked through the well-closed window. There before him, so long {{that it seemed to}} have no end, like a building in a nightmare, stretched that place where he did not mean to end his days. He faced towards the horse again. The colour had deepened in his nose. He spoke: ...|$|R
5000|$|Their second recording, [...] "White Trash", {{released}} in August 2001, was more successful. Its b-side was [...] "Soccerstar". They made a video for [...] "White Trash" [...] with drummer Kennedy rapping {{and it got}} so much exposure they decided he should <b>stop</b> <b>drumming</b> {{and move to the}} front of the stage to rap. They then recruited mutual friend Jared Wrennall from Balclutha, as drummer and became a five-piece. From then they started writing more of their songs with a hip hop influence. Steriogram toured New Zealand in a friend's van without any support crew, doing gigs where they could.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2011 HIM parted ways with Sire Records. In May the band began rehearsing songs for the full-length follow-up to 2010's Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice. After {{a few months of}} rehearsals, the band's drummer, Mika Karppinen, began complaining of pain in his wrists. Medical examinations concluded that he had nerve damage in his hands and arms caused by repetitive stress. Karppinen was told by his doctors to <b>stop</b> <b>drumming</b> so that he would have time to heal. During this time the band's singer, Ville Valo, was said to have filled in on drums while working on new material. Subsequent treatments were successful and after about eight months the band was able to start rehearsing with Karppinen again.|$|R
50|$|Kevin James LaBrie {{was born}} in Penetanguishene, Ontario, Canada and started playing drums at age 5.

500|$|On Memorial Day 1985, Lovering {{attended}} Murphy and Kim Deal's wedding service. In January 1986 Deal {{was hired}} to play bass in the newly formed Pixies, an alternative rock band formed by Charles [...] "Black Francis" [...] Thompson and Joey Santiago. Murphy suggested that Lovering audition for the band – who were still without a <b>drummer.</b> Lovering had <b>stopped</b> <b>drumming</b> by this point and was at first unimpressed by the trio's performance of the band's songs. However, after playing along he agreed to join. Lovering and the band wrote and rehearsed material throughout 1985 and 1986 and performed at small venues in Boston. The band decided to record 18 songs for a demo tape in 1987. Lovering co-wrote one of the tape's songs, [...] "Levitate Me" [...] (his only major writing contribution to any Pixies song) and appeared on the cassette's front cover, jogging naked with his back turned to the camera. [...] "Levitate Me" [...] later appeared on the band's first release Come on Pilgrim, which included seven other songs taken from the demo tape.|$|R

2500|$|Brakes were {{hydraulically-operated}} [...] drums, {{which were}} generally considered the Toronado's weak link.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, he <b>stopped</b> playing <b>drums</b> {{and had no}} studio band activities.

When Gackt was twenty-years old, he met guitarist You Kurosaki, his future solo career support guitarist, at a music live house, and they formed the band, Cains:Feel with biblical reference {{to the story of}} Cain and Abel. Because of the mediocre singers interest at the moment Gackt became the frontman, and the band went to record a demo tape.|$|R
50|$|Typically a {{centrifugal}} clutch and sprocket.The {{centrifugal clutch}} expands with raising spinning speed towards a drum. On this drum sits either a fixed sprocket or an exchangeable one. The clutch has three jobs to do: When the saw runs idle (typically 2500-2700 rpm) the chain does not move. When the clutch is engaged and the chain {{stops in the}} wood or another reason, it protects the engine. Most important it protects the operator {{in case of a}} kickback. Here the chain break <b>stops</b> the <b>drum</b> and the clutch releases immediately.|$|R

5000|$|We {{thought about}} quitting because {{how could we}} go on without Duane? But then we realized: how could we <b>stop?</b> <b>Drummer</b> Butch Trucks Several weeks before the gold {{certification}} of Fillmore East and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami's Criteria Studios with producer Tom Dowd {{to work on their}} third studio album. The band first began recording the album one month prior, when they laid down the initial tracks for [...] "Blue Sky". The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: [...] "Blue Sky", an instrumental titled [...] "The Road to Calico" [...] (which would eventually develop into [...] "Stand Back", with added vocals) and [...] "Little Martha", the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, [...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out".|$|R
50|$|The Norman castle {{is haunted}} by a ghostly {{drumming}} sound.

25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Lynagh {{and with}} David Campese in vintage form, Australia beat New Zealand 13-12 {{in the final}} of the 1988 Hong Kong Sevens. When Lynagh received the silver symbol of sevens supremacy from Hong Long bank taipan Williams Purves, the Royal Hong Kong Police bank struck up ‘Waltzing Matilda’, but they might have <b>stopped</b> the <b>drums</b> and trumpets after a few bars. No one heard them anyway as all but the most rabid anti-Australians in the twenty-thousand-strong throng took up the singing. It was stirring stuff.

50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would <b>stop,</b> <b>stopping</b> the <b>drum</b> along with it. The flywheel, {{driven by the}} one-way clutch, {{continued}} to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This released brake fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and releasing the brakes. As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was released and the brakes re-applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|R
50|$|Tommy Robertson {{learned of}} the status of Darwin Drums, and began {{negotiations}} to purchase the factory from Darwin. After eight months, an agreement was made. In December 1994 the factory was purchased and moved into a newly designed facility in Austin, Texas. The Fibes trademark was also purchased in December, thus reuniting the original name and product. Fibes has since <b>stopped</b> production of <b>drums.</b>|$|R
