50|$|The phase <b>shift</b> <b>process</b> {{used with}} passive phase array {{typically}} puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants. The {{sign of the}} phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam. That requires a phase impulse that degrades sub-clutter visibility performance on Doppler radar and Pulse-Doppler radar. As an example, Yttrium iron garnet phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams. That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.|$|E

In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the impact of three executive functions: updating, inhibition and <b>shifting</b> <b>processes</b> on tobacco craving and dependence. 134 tobacco consumers were included in this study: 81 moderately (Fagerström score 7). Dependence was assessed with the Fagerström test and craving with the tobacco craving questionnaire (TCQ 12). We used the Stroop test and the Hayling test to measure inhibition, the Trail Making Test to measure <b>shifting</b> <b>processes</b> and the n-back test to measure updating processes. A multivariate logistic model {{was used to assess}} which variables explained best the level of nicotine dependence. Inhibition (p = 0. 002) and updating (p = 0. 014) <b>processes,</b> but not <b>shifting</b> <b>processes,</b> were associated with higher tobacco dependence. Inhibition capacity had a significant effect on the nicotine dependence level independently of age, education, time since last cigarette, intellectual quotient, craving, updating and <b>shifting</b> <b>process.</b> Nicotine dependence level seems better explained by inhibition capacities than by craving and updating effects. The capacity to inhibit our behaviours is a good predictor of the severity of tobacco dependence. Our results suggest a prefrontal cortex dysfunction affecting the inhibitory capacities of heavy tobacco dependent smokers. Further studies are needed to investigate the application of these findings in the treatment of tobacco dependence...|$|R

This article presents the design, analysis, and control of a two-speed automatic mechanical transmission for pure electric vehicles. The shift actuator {{is based on a}} motor-controlled camshaft where a special geometric groove is machined, and the camshaft realizes the axial positions of the synchronizer sleeve for gear engaging, disengaging, and speed control of the drive motor. Based on the force analysis of <b>shift</b> <b>process,</b> the parameters of shift actuator and shift motor are designed. The drive motor’s torque control strategy before shifting, speed governing control strategy before engaging, shift actuator’s control strategy during gear engaging, and drive motor’s torque recovery strategy after <b>shift</b> <b>process</b> are proposed and implemented with a prototype. To validate the performance of the two-speed gearbox, a test bed was developed based on dSPACE that emulates various operation conditions.

40|$|In gearbox {{synchronizer}} design process, {{the most}} important parameter to be determined is the effort required {{to engage a gear}} within specified time interval (or vice versa – engaging time for the specified effort). Usually, reduction of said effort implies one of the following approaches: choosing a friction cone as large as possible, or using a multi-cone design. However, according to practical experience and investigations of <b>shifting</b> <b>process,</b> engaging effort may not be the decisive factor in shifting quality assessment. One can observe that during shifting the force exertion process often has two stages. The first stage {{is a result of the}} synchronization process itself. The existing second stage, effort amount, and instability of force observed at this stage while repeating shifts, require a thorough investigation. Therefore, the subject of the work was the <b>shifting</b> <b>process</b> stages that affect the engaging effort. The paper gives the certain characteristics of <b>shifting</b> <b>process</b> to demonstrate that there is the second stage in force exertion. The paper describes a technique for calculating the force acting on synchronizing sleeve and presents results of such calculations for several types of synchronizers. These results showed that in the case when tooth rims of a synchronizing sleeve and a gearwheel situated against each other in an adverse way, simultaneous sleeve movement and gearwheel rotation exert the second peak of the force comparable with synchronization effort (≈ 53 … 71 %). The remainder of the paper shows the ways to decrease said second force peak. Recommendations for synchronizers design improvement are given as well. The conclusion has been made that technical requirements for modern synchronizer design, apart from the maximum synchronization effort, must provide relative maximum value of the second peak of at most 1 / 3 of synchronization effort. This will ensure improved perception of the <b>shifting</b> <b>process.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the shift {{strategy}} of hydro-mechanical infinitely variable transmission. A computer simulation is carried out to investigate the shift strategy, and the simulation results are verified by the test data. There are four typical working conditions in the continuous <b>shift</b> <b>process,</b> among which the <b>shift</b> <b>process</b> from F 2 (N) to F 3 (P) plays a decisive role in shift quality. The shift strategy based on the physical parameters from F 2 (N) to F 3 (P) is lower engine rotating speed, smaller load torque, lower main circuit pressure, and larger speed valve flow rate. The shift strategy based on the shift time from F 2 (N) to F 3 (P) is to switch the third group of clutches first, then disengage {{the first group of}} clutches, and engage the second group of clutches at last.
