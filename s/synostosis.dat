50|$|Your baby's skull {{has seven}} bones. Normally, these bones don't fuse until around age 2, giving your baby's brain time to grow. Joints called cranial sutures, made of strong, fibrous tissue, hold these bones together. In {{the front of}} your baby's skull, the sutures {{intersect}} in the large soft spot (fontanel) on the top of your baby's head. Normally, the sutures remain flexible until the bones fuse. The signs of craniosynostosis may not be noticeable at birth, but they become apparent during {{the first few months of}} your baby's life. The symptoms differs from types of <b>synostosis.</b> First of all there is Sagittal <b>synostosis</b> (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the suture at the top of the head (sagittal suture) forces the head to grow long and narrow, rather than wide. Scaphocephaly is the most common type of craniosynostosis. The other one is called Coronal <b>synostosis</b> (anterior plagiocephaly). Premature fusion of a coronal suture — one of the structures that run from each ear to the sagittal suture on top of the head — may force your baby's forehead to flatten on the affected side. It may also raise the eye socket and cause a deviated nose and slanted skull. The Bicoronal <b>synostosis</b> (brachycephaly). When both of the coronal sutures fuse prematurely, your baby may have a flat, elevated forehead and brow.|$|E
50|$|Most {{examples}} of radioulnar <b>synostosis</b> are isolated (non-syndromic). Syndromes {{that may be}} accompanied by radioulnar <b>synostosis</b> include X chromosome polyploidy (e.g., XXXY) and other chromosome disorders (e.g., 4p- syndrome, Williams syndrome), acrofacial dysostosis, Antley-Bixler syndrome, genitopatellar syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, hereditary multiple osteochondromas (hereditary multiple exostoses), limb-body wall complex, and Nievergelt syndrome.Craniosynostosis (from cranio, cranium; + syn, together; + ostosis relating to bone) is {{a condition in which}} {{one or more of the}} fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification). Craniosynostosis has following kinds: scaphocephaly, trigonocephaly, plagiocephaly, anterior plagiocephaly, posterior plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, oxycephaly, pansynostosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{surgical}} intervention {{is to allow}} normal cranial vault development to occur. This {{can be achieved by}} excision of the prematurely fused suture and correction of the associated skull deformities. If the <b>synostosis</b> goes uncorrected, the deformity will progressively worsen not only threatening the aesthetic aspect, but also the functional aspect. This is especially the case in the asymmetric conditions, such as unilateral coronal <b>synostosis,</b> with compromised function of the eyes and the jaw.In addition signs of compromised neurodevelopment have been seen amongst all the synostoses, although this may also be caused by primary maldevelopment of the brain and can thus not be prevented by surgical intervention.|$|E
50|$|The {{highest rate}} of {{neurological}} problems of single suture <b>synostosis</b> are seen in patients with trigonocephaly. Surgery is performed generally {{before the age of}} one because of claims of better intellectual outcome.
