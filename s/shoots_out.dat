5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog <b>shoots</b> <b>out</b> its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E

25|$|Through-tool coolant systems, {{also known}} as through-spindle coolant systems, are systems plumbed to deliver coolant through {{passages}} inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also high-pressure coolant systems, in which the operating pressure can be hundreds to several thousand psi (1to30MPa)—pressures comparable to those used in hydraulic circuits. High-pressure through-spindle coolant systems require rotary unions that can withstand these pressures. Drill bits and endmills tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant <b>shoots</b> <b>out.</b> Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements.|$|E

The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket turns away from the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not have time to go back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E

2500|$|Jean Grey-Summers (under {{the name}} of [...] "Phoenix") appears in the {{crossover}} fighting game [...] as a playable character, voiced once again by Jennifer Hale. She is widely considered to be one of, if not, the most powerful character in the game winning many major tournaments and being played by many high level players. She has the lowest vitality of any character in the game, {{a little less than}} half of the next lowest health characters, but compensates for this by having tremendous damage output. She can teleport at distances, use telekinesis for her throw attacks, and heal her red-damage life bar with Healing Field Level 1 hyper (by getting close to enemies). Her main projectile attack is TK Shot, a cosmic fireball that varies in speed depending on the button pressed. Her one and only offensive Hyper Combo is Phoenix Rage, where she shoots a huge cosmic Phoenix raptor at her enemy, heavily burning enemy at contact. If her lifebar is emptied with the Hyper Combo gauge at maximum (5), she will transform into Dark Phoenix. Although her health is completely restored upon turning into the Dark Phoenix, her life bar depletes at a steady rate. However, her attacks become more powerful, <b>shoots</b> <b>out</b> small projectile fire feathers with normal attacks, and the Hyper Combo gauge refills at a faster rate than normal. Phoenix sports four alternate color schemes based on her classic look, her early 1990s appearance drawn by Jim Lee, which shares similarities with her appearance in Chris Claremont's X-Men Forever, and her costumes from Greg Pak's [...] and Grant Morrison's [...]|$|E
