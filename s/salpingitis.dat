5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (<b>salpingitis,</b> ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of salpingitis: acute <b>salpingitis</b> and chronic <b>salpingitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, <b>salpingitis</b> {{can also}} lead to {{infertility}} because the eggs released in ovulation can't get contact with the sperm. Approximately 75,000-225,000 cases of infertility in the US are caused by <b>salpingitis.</b> The more times one has the infection, the greater the risk of infertility. With one episode of <b>salpingitis,</b> the risk of infertility is 8-17%. With 3 episodes of <b>salpingitis,</b> the risk is 40-60%, although the exact risk depends on the severity of each episode.|$|E
25|$|In addition, damaged oviducts {{increase}} the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Thus, if one has had <b>salpingitis,</b> the risk of a pregnancy to become ectopic is 7 to 10-fold as large. Half of ectopic pregnancies are due to a <b>salpingitis</b> infection.|$|E
25|$|As {{an effect}} of an {{increased}} risk due to multiple partners, the prevalence of <b>salpingitis</b> is highest for people age 15–24 years. Decreased awareness of symptoms and less will to use contraceptives are also common in this group, raising the occurrence of <b>salpingitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Salpingitis</b> has {{a higher}} {{incidence}} among members of lower socioeconomic classes. However, this is thought of being an effect of earlier sex debut, multiple partners, and decreased ability to receive proper health care rather than any independent risk factor for <b>salpingitis.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Salpingitis</b> may be {{diagnosed}} by pelvic examination, blood tests, and/or a vaginal or cervical swab.|$|E
25|$|Over {{one million}} cases of acute <b>salpingitis</b> are {{reported}} {{every year in}} the US, but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness has gone so far that it has developed chronic complications. For women age 16–25, <b>salpingitis</b> is the most common serious infection. It affects approximately 11% of females of reproductive age.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{presentation of}} the syndrome starts with urinary symptoms such as burning pain on urination (dysuria) or an increased frequency of urination. Other urogenital problems may arise such as prostatitis in men and cervicitis, <b>salpingitis</b> and/or vulvovaginitis in women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salpingitis</b> is an {{infection}} and inflammation in the Fallopian tubes. It {{is often used}} synonymously with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although PID lacks an accurate definition and can refer to several diseases of the female upper genital tract, such as endometritis, oophoritis, myometritis, parametritis and infection in the pelvic peritoneum.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{remain the}} {{treatment}} of choice for infections caused by chlamydia (trachoma, psittacosis, <b>salpingitis,</b> urethritis and L. venereum infection), Rickettsia (typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), brucellosis and spirochetal infections (borreliosis, syphilis and Lyme disease). In addition, they {{may be used to}} treat anthrax, plague, tularemia and Legionnaires' disease. They are also used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Distal tubal {{obstruction}} is {{more often}} observed (70%) than proximal obstruction. It {{can be caused by}} hydrosalpinges, pelvic adhesions, or fusion of the fimbriae. Tubal obstruction is caused by infection, endometriosis, myomas, <b>salpingitis</b> isthmica nodosa (SIN), or dried mucus. Because the tube can spasm during the injection of the dye during a hysterosalpingogram, it can be misdiagnosed.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or <b>salpingitis</b> may occur as well as lymphangitis and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop inguinal lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in {{women and men who}} have sex with men (MSM) who may not have the inguinal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Up to 10% {{of women}} with ectopic {{pregnancy}} have no symptoms, and one-third have no medical signs. In many cases the symptoms have low specificity, and can be {{similar to those of}} other genitourinary and gastrointestinal disorders, such as appendicitis, <b>salpingitis,</b> rupture of a corpus luteum cyst, miscarriage, ovarian torsion or urinary tract infection. Clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy occurs at a mean of 7.2 weeks after the last normal menstrual period, with a range of 4 to 8 weeks. Later presentations are more common in communities deprived of modern diagnostic ability.|$|E
25|$|Infertility is {{the major}} symptom of TFI and is {{generally}} defined as a woman under 35 who has not become pregnant after 12 months {{without the use of}} contraception. Twelve months is the lower reference limit for Time to Pregnancy (TTP) by the World Health Organization. When the inability to conceive is accompanied by signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease such as lower abdominal pain, TFI may be present. A history of pelvic inflammatory disease, the laproscopic evidence of scarring and a diagnosis of <b>salpingitis</b> supports the diagnosis.|$|E
