40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} tracer inversion {{model is}} described that couples atmospheric CO 2 transport with prescribed and adjustable source/sink {{components of the}} global car- bon cycle to predict atmospheric CO 2 concentration and 13 C/ 12 C isotopic ratio taking account of exchange fluxes of atmospheric CO 2 with the terrestrial biosphere and the oceans. Industrial CO 2 emissions are prescribed from fuel production data. Transport of CO 2 is prescribed by a model, TM 2, that employs 9 vertical levels from the earth’s surface to 10 mb, a numerical time step of 4 hours, and a grid spacing of approxi- mately 8 ° of latitude and 10 ° of longitude. Horizontal advection is specified from analyzed observations of wind. Vertical advection is consistent with mass conservation of wind within each grid box. Convective mixing and vertical diffusion are determined at each time step from meteorological data. The source/sink components represent various CO 2 exchanges, some sources to the atmosphere, others sinks. The study focuses on establishing interannual variability in net terrestrial biospheric and net oceanic fluxes with the atmosphere revealed by variability in atmospheric CO 2, taking account of possible stimulation of land plant growth ("CO 2 fertilization") and oceanic CO 2 uptake, as well as industrial CO 2 emissions. Net primary production of land plants (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration are specified to vary only seasonally, {{on the basis of}} data averaged from 1982 - 1990, inclusive. NPP is determined from a vegetative index, NDVI, derived from remotely sensed radiometric data from satellites. Heterotrophic respiration is a function of surface air temperature. Oceanic exchange of CO 2 varies seasonally as specified by a coefficient of CO 2 gas exchange. Spatial varia- bility of all source/sink components is specified for each 8 ° x 10 ° grid box of TM 2, a priori, for 5 terrestrial biospheric and 5 oceanic source/sink components, and with respect to emissions of industrial CO 2. Spatial variations of terrestrial exchange are made proportional to NPP. Heterotrophic respiration similarly varies by setting its annual average for each grid box equal to NPP. Spatial variations in oceanic CO 2 exchange take account of gas exchange dependence on wind speed and temperature and, in the tropics, on a time-invariant spatially variable specification of the partial pressure of CO 2 of surface sea water, based on direct observations. Carbon-isotopic fractionation is taken into account for all chemical processes modeled. To produce an optimal fit to observations of atmospheric CO 2, the inversion model adjusts the magnitude of 7 additional source/sink components divided with respect to tropical, temperate, and polar geographic zones. There are 4 terrestrial zones, excluding a <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>zone</b> of negligible importance. There are 3 oceanic zones: one tropical, and one combined temperate/polar zone in each hemisphere. Calculations are carried out in a quasi-stationary mode that repeats a single annual cycle 4 times, and saves the results for the final year. Alternatively, the model has been run in an extended response mode that takes account of a 4 -year history of atmospheric CO 2 response to a pulse introduced {{during the first year of}} this history. Interannual variations in exchange are established by adjusting the model to predict atmospheric CO 2 concentration and 13 C/ 12 C ratio averaged for annual periods at overlapping 6 -month intervals. Net CO 2 exchange fluxes, seasonally adjusted, were determined from 1981 - 1999, inclusive, using atmospheric CO 2 data reported by Keeling et al. [2001]...|$|E

During the European Iron Fertilisation EXperiment (EIFEX, 21. 01. 25. 03. 2004), an eddy in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Polar</b> Frontal <b>Zone</b> was fertilized with Fe(II) SO 4 to follow the build-up and fate of an iron induced bloom.

Gut fluorescence was significantly higher for in-patch salps which showed no direct signs of clogging. Microscopy and detailed pigment analysis revealed that the phytoplankton composition of adjacent waters down to 500 m was reflected in the salp guts and changed with the developing bloom. Salps generally showed a higher phaeopigment to chlorophyll a ratio than found in the water masses due to digestion.

40|$|The pelagic {{tunicate}} Salpa thompsoni is {{an important}} member of Southern Ocean mesozooplankton. In the last decades, its distribution has extended southward with the declining ice coverage in certain Antarctic regions (Loeb et al 1997, Atkinson et al 2004). They especially proliferate in areas with Chlorophyll a concentrations below 1 µg L- 1 (Perissinotto et al 1998) as higher particles loads seemingly harm salp feeding (Harbison et al 1986). During the European Iron Fertilisation EXperiment (EIFEX, 21. 01. 25. 03. 2004), an eddy in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Polar</b> Frontal <b>Zone</b> was fertilized twice with Fe(II) SO 4 to follow the build-up and fate of an iron induced bloom and the various pathways of fixed carbon. The fertilized waters (in-patch) of the eddy reached maximum chlorophyll (Chl a) concentrations of ca. 2. 9 ug L- 1 from surface down to 80 m and spread over ca. 500 km 2 {{at the end of}} the experiment. Salp abundance and size decreased generally over time following their seasonal cycle but they disappeared earlier in fertilized waters. Gut fluorescence of salps was high indicating a strong grazing impact of salps in both areas at the beginning of the experiment. Furthermore, salps from in-patch stations showed significantly higher gut fluorescence than salps from out-patch stations with 0. 69 ug and 0. 28 ug Chl a Ind- 1 with 3 cm body length, respectively. Microscopy and HPLC analysis revealed that the phytoplankton composition of adjacent waters down to 500 m was reflected in the salp guts and changed with the developing bloom. However, salps generally showed a higher phaeopigment to Chl a ratio than found in the water masses due to digestion. Although production rates of fecal pellets did not alter with Chl a concentrations and ranged between 0. 5 to 1. 0 fecal pellet Ind- 1 h- 1 for in- and out-patch stations, the ratio of Phaeopigments to Chl a was significantly lower in guts and fecal pellets from in-patch compared to out-patch animals supposing a less effective digestion at higher food supply. In this study, we could show the impact of a changing diet on individual salps and discern effects on the salp population.

40|$|The biologically {{damaging}} solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (quantified by the DNA-weighted dose) {{reaches the}} martian surface in extremely high levels. Searching for potentially habitable UV-protected environments on Mars, we considered the polar ice caps that consist of a seasonally varying CO 2 ice cover and a permanent H 2 O ice layer. It was found that, though the CO 2 ice is insufficient by itself to screen the UV radiation, at ~ 1 m depth within the perennial H 2 O ice the DNA-weighted dose is reduced to terrestrial levels. This depth depends strongly on the optical properties of the H 2 O ice layers (for instance snow-like layers). The Earth-like DNA-weighted dose and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) requirements were used to define {{the upper and lower}} limits of the northern and <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> Radiative Habitable <b>Zone</b> (RHZ) for which a temporal and spatial mapping was performed. Based on these studies we conclude that photosynthetic life might be possible within the ice layers of the polar regions. The thickness varies along each martian polar spring and summer between ~ 1. 5 and 2. 4 m for H 2 O ice-like layers, and a few centimeters for snow-like covers. These martian Earth-like radiative habitable environments may be primary targets for future martian astrobiological missions. Special attention should be paid to planetary protection, since the polar RHZ may also be subject to terrestrial contamination by probes...|$|R

Most records of the giant squid (Architeuthis dux Steenstrup, 1857) come from some localities in the North Atlantic (Newfoundland, northern Europe), South Atlantic (South Africa), New Zealand and the North Paci¢c (Japan). It {{is thought to be}} a cosmopolitan species or a complex of species, but, {{in many parts of the}} world ocean, either no or a few specimens have been recorded (Clarke, 1966; Roper & Boss, 1982). In the Indian Ocean, except the occurrence of specimens in the diet of sperm whales caught o ¡ eastern South Africa and western Australia (Clarke, 1980), only one giant squid was found stranded on the small oceanic island of Saint Paul in 1874, the so-called A. sanctipauli Velain, 1875 (Species dubium; Fo « rch, 1998). In this note, we report two new observations of speci-mens at sea and the occurrence of beaks of giant squid in the diet of deep-sea sharks from di¡erent water masses of the southern Indian Ocean. Giant squid were identi¢ed from the morphology of their chitinous lower and upper beaks. Beaks of A. dux have a typical shape, the chitin is thin and lightly coloured, and often the wings and lateral walls curl up (Clarke, 1986). Lower beaks might be confused with those of Thysanoteuthis rhombus Troschel, 1857, but Architeuthis beaks grow to and darken at a larger size (Clarke, 1986).

40|$|The magnetospheric cusps are {{important}} {{sites of the}} coupling of a magnetosphere with the solar wind. The combination of both ground‐ and space‐based observations at Earth has enabled considerable progress {{to be made in}} understanding the terrestrial cusp and its role in the coupling of the magnetosphere to the solar wind via the polar magnetosphere. Voyager 2 fully explored Neptune’s cusp in 1989, but highly inclined orbits of the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn present the most recent opportunity to repeatedly study the polar magnetosphere of a rapidly rotating planet. In this paper we discuss observations made by Cassini during two passes through Saturn’s <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> magnetosphere. Our main findings are that (i) Cassini directly encounters the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> cusp with evidence for the entry of magnetosheath plasma into the cusp via magnetopause reconnection, (ii) magnetopause reconnection and entry of plasma into the cusp can occur over a range of solar wind conditions, and (iii) double cusp morphologies are consistent with the position of the cusp oscillating in phase with Saturn’s global magnetospheric periodicities.

40|$|A {{record of}} carbon dioxide for the last 400, 000 years {{revealed}} that atmospheric CO 2 decreased from a pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppmV to approximately 200 ppmV during the last glacial maximum (Petit et al., 1999). Several hypotheses as to why this happened have been suggested yet no one explanation {{has been able to}} fully account for this decrease. Deep water is the main sink for carbon in the ocean through the biological pump, where the organic matter and CaCO 3 shells of dead surface biota sink. The stored carbon in the deep ocean is 'aired' in the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> ocean, where large amounts of deep water are upwelled to the surface. Stephens and Keeling (2000) have proposed that if the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> ocean was covered with ice during the last glacial maximum, this would have prevented carbon stored in the deep ocean to be released into the atmosphere, thereby reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO 2. Stephens and Keeling (2000) created a six-box ocean to test this hypothesis and were able to produce a 67 ppmV decrease of atmospheric CO 2 from the pre-industrial concentration when only the gas exchange between the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> ocean and the atmosphere was limited. Based on the Toggweiler and Sarmiento (1985) three-box ocean model, a four-box ocean model that splits the Toggiweiler and Sarmiento polar ocean box in to a northern and southern component was created. The four-box ocean model examined the sensitivity of atmospheric CO 2 to limitations in the airsea gas exchange for the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> ocean. The four-box ocean was able to produce seventy percent of Stephens and Keeling's decrease in atmospheric CO 2 when the air-sea gas exchange was limited in the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> ocean. In addition, the four-box ocean model calculated carbon- 14 concentrations in the ocean, which provide a useful constraint on model results that was not presented in the Stephens and Keeling model.
