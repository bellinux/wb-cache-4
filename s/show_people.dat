5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best <b>show</b> <b>people</b> are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to <b>show</b> <b>people</b> {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|Hearst loved {{seeing her}} in {{expensive}} costume pictures, {{but she also}} appeared in contemporary comedies like Tillie the Toiler, The Fair Co-Ed (both 1927), and especially three directed by King Vidor, Not So Dumb (1930), The Patsy and the backstage-in-Hollywood saga <b>Show</b> <b>People</b> (both 1928). The Patsy contains her imitations which she usually did for friends, of silent stars Lillian Gish, Mae Murray and Pola Negri. King Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst wanted her to be. He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.|$|E

25|$|The LCMS {{believes}} that the Holy Scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the Law and the Gospel. The Law is all those demands in the Bible which must be obeyed {{in order to gain}} salvation. However, because all people are sinners, it is impossible for people to completely obey the Law. Therefore, the Law implies an inevitable consequence of God's wrath, judgment, and damnation. The Gospel, on the other hand, is the promise of free salvation from God to sinners. The Law condemns; the Gospel saves. Both the Law and the Gospel are gifts from God; both are necessary. The function of the law is to <b>show</b> <b>people</b> their sinful nature and drive them to the Gospel, in which the forgiveness of sin is promised {{for the sake of the}} death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{findings}} <b>show</b> <b>people</b> {{settled in}} the middle alpine region, later to be called Tyrol, when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived, after {{the last ice age}} ended around 12,000 BC. Artifacts found on the Seiser Alm date to the Upper Paleolithic era. In the valley bottoms near Bolzano, Brixen and Salorno, mesolithic hunters resting places were discovered. Stone artefacts recovered there were dated to the 8th millennia BC. Discovery of Ötzi on the Similaun glacier in 1991 proved man had already crossed the highest Alpine passes 5000 years ago. Sedentary settlements of farmers and herders {{can be traced back to}} 5000 BC. There is ample evidence of settlements in the main and side valleys during the early and middle Bronze Age (1800-1300 BC). Preferred settlement sites were sunny terraces on the valleys slopes, and hill tops in the middle heights.|$|E

500|$|Following actor Charlie Sheen's {{departure}} from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors began to circulate that Rob Lowe might leave Parks and Recreation to take Sheen's place on that <b>show.</b> <b>People</b> magazine reported that Two and a Half Men creator Chuck Lorre was [...] "seriously discussing the possibility" [...] of signing Lowe, and Sheen himself {{said he would be}} a [...] "fabulous" [...] successor. Those rumors proved unfounded, however, and were flatly denied by Michael Schur, who called it [...] "complete gibberish". Although widely considered a supporting role, Lowe's performance as Chris Traeger was submitted for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category.|$|E

The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to <b>show</b> <b>people</b> what I can really do." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Steven DeKnight, {{who wrote}} for Marsters {{when he was}} portraying Spike on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, used a {{different}} approach for Marsters when writing for him as Brainiac.

This different approach to villainy worked well for Marsters, who wanted to <b>show</b> <b>people</b> he could portray characters who were not just another [...] "Spike". Marsters describes Brainiac as [...] "a murderous robot" [...] with no remorse over his actions. According to Marsters, the character is an [...] "intellectual" [...] who is focused on what he wants. The actor {{was drawn to the}} series because of the [...] "refreshing" [...] take the producers had, as well as an appreciation for the idea of a show about Clark's journey toward becoming Superman.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Fleury {{joined a}} group that {{involved}} his former junior coach, Graham James, fellow NHL player Joe Sakic, and professional wrestler Bret Hart as a minority owner of the expansion Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League.

After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009. He filmed a pilot episode in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid: [...] "We want to <b>show</b> <b>people</b> {{that if you have a}} dream, anything is possible with a little ambition," [...] Fleury said of the show.

Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to <b>show</b> <b>people</b> that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image.
