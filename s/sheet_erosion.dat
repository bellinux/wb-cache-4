40|$|<b>Sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the transformation of agricultural slopes in the Carpathians. It is an episodic process of short duration which can take place both in the winter and summer hydrological half-years as a result of meteorological short-term and high-intensity events like short downpours, intense continuous rainfall and rapid thaws. The climate of the Carpathians is characterized by the variability of its parameters caused by the growing height of the mountain belts from the north to the south as well as by the considerable latitudinal extent of the mountain range. The summer season is crucial to annual precipitation totals. Maximum daily precipitation totals are the result of intense continuous rainfall (mainly in June and July) and short local downpours (mainly in May). In the flysch Polish Carpathians the role of <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> on agricultural slopes is different in areas characterized by mountain relief (Beskidy Mountains) and foothill relief, because the two regions have different water circulation patterns and weathered material displacement patterns. Another crucial factor that helps account for the differences in the effectiveness of <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> is vegetation cover. The lack of sufficiently long measurement series or diversification between regions of the Carpathians makes it difficult to determine the frequency of extreme <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> and their recurrence, which means it is not possible to define the quantitative criteria for establishing extreme <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> processes for the whole area of the Polish Carpathians. The aim of this paper is to examine the criteria on the basis of which extreme <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> on agricultural slopes has so far been determined as well as the effects and role of the process in the transformation of the slopes...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the relative contributions of <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> to the total soil loss associated with individual events and of changes in their relative importance during an event is important for developing more effective soil erosion prediction models and for predicting the physical and geochemical properties of the eroded sediment in relation {{to those of the}} in situ soil. It is difficult to obtain information on variations in the relative importance of <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> during an event using traditional monitoring techniques. The use of environmental radionuclides, particularly beryllium- 7 (Be- 7) and cesium- 137 (Cs- 137), as sediment tracers offers an alternative approach to obtaining this information. Because of their contrasting depth distributions, the two radionuclides provide a means of distinguishing sediment eroded from the soil surface by <b>sheet</b> or interrill <b>erosion</b> and that eroded from greater depths by rill erosion. The approach was tested using simulated rainfall experiments undertaken on two small erosion plots located in Yichuan County, Shaanxi Province, China, representative of cultivated land and uncultivated land previously under forest. The results confirmed that the development of rills within the plots was clearly marked by changes in the Be- 7 activity of the sediment eroded from the cultivated plot and changes in the Be- 7 and Cs- 137 activity of the sediment eroded from the uncultivated plot. By relating the changes in the Be- 7 and Cs- 137 activity of the eroded soil to information on the depth distribution of the two radionuclides in the soils of the two plots and the mass of soil eroded, it was possible to estimate the relative contributions of the two erosion processes to the total soil loss and their changes through an event. This information provided a basis for investigating the influence of temporal variations in the relative contributions of <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> during an event on variations in the physical and geochemical properties of the sediment eroded from the plot during the event...|$|R

40|$|Information {{is scarce}} on the spatial-scale effect on {{sediment}} concentrations in run-off. This study addressed this issue within an agricultural subwatershed of the Chinese Loess Plateau, using data observed at a hilltop plot, three nested hillslope plots, two entire-slope plots (a combination of hillslope and valley side slope) and the subwatershed outlet. Dominated by the splash and <b>sheet</b> <b>erosions,</b> the hilltop plot has a minimum C-ae (mean sediment concentration for all recorded events) of 45 kgm(- 3). Unexpectedly, the high sediment concentrations at the hilltop {{do not occur}} at high rainfall intensities or large run-off events because of the protection of surface soils by relatively thick sheet flows. Because {{of the emergence of}} rills, C-ae is as high as 310 kg m(- 3) even on the most upper hillslope. Downslope, both C-ae and ESC (extreme large values of recorded sediment concentrations) increase; such a slope length effect attenuates with increasing slope length and event magnitude as a result of insufficient sediment availability associated with rill development. Active mass wastings ensure sufficient sediment supply and thus a spatially invariant C-ae (approximately 700 kgm(- 3)) and ESC (approximately 1000 kg m(- 3)) at the scale of the entire slope and subwatershed. Detailed examination shows that most small events experience a decrease in sediment concentrations when moving from the entire slope to the subwatershed, indicating that the spatially invariant sediment concentration is valid only for large run-off events. This study highlights the control of the spatial scale, which determines the dominant erosional process, on erosional regime. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|Surface runoff {{can cause}} {{erosion of the}} Earth's surface; eroded {{material}} may be deposited a considerable distance away. There are four main types of soil erosion by water: splash erosion, <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion,</b> rill erosion and gully erosion. Splash erosion {{is the result of}} mechanical collision of raindrops with the soil surface: soil particles which are dislodged by the impact then move with the surface runoff. <b>Sheet</b> <b>erosion</b> is the overland transport of sediment by runoff without a well defined channel. Soil surface roughness causes may cause runoff to become concentrated into narrower flow paths: as these incise, the small but well-defined channels which are formed are known as rills. These channels can be as small as one centimeter wide or as large as several meters. If runoff continue to incise and enlarge rills, they may eventually grow to become gullies. Gully erosion can transport large amounts of eroded material in a small time period. Reduced crop productivity usually results from erosion, and these effects are studied in the field of soil conservation. The soil particles carried in runoff vary in size from about [...]001 millimeter to 1.0 millimeter in diameter. Larger particles settle over short transport distances, whereas small particles can be carried over long distances suspended in the water column. Erosion of silty soils that contain smaller particles generates turbidity and diminishes light transmission, which disrupts aquatic ecosystems.|$|E

By the 1970s the models had expanded to complex computer models addressing nonpoint source pollution with thousands of lines of computer code.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{understand}} better the relationship between measured soil loss rates due to <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> (SL), predicted SL rates and measured catchment sediment yields (SY) in Europe. Materials and methods: Analyses {{were based on a}} recently established database of measured annual SY for 1794 catchments, a database of 777 annual SL rates measured on runoff plots and two recent maps of predicted <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> rates in Europe (i. e. one based on empirical extrapolations of measured SL data and one based on the PESERA model). To identify regional trends, all data were grouped into eight climatic zones. Results and discussion: Measured SL rates are generally a factor of five to ten times larger than predicted SL rates and are strongly biased towards erosion-prone situations in terms of land use. Also measured SY are generally higher than predicted SL rates, especially in the Mediterranean and Alpine regions where SY is generally ten times higher than predicted SL rates. This illustrates the importance of other erosion processes contributing to SY. Regional differences in the importance of these processes and their implications are discussed. Conclusions: This study confirms previous findings indicating the relatively low <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> rates compared to SY in the Mediterranean region and illustrates the importance of other erosion processes contributing to SY in most regions of Europe. This indicates that hillslope erosion rates cannot be used directly to estimate SY, and consequently soil conservation programmes should focus more on the dominant erosion processes in each catchment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|The Mzimvubu River is {{the largest}} river in South Africa without a dam. The Department of Water and Sanitation has {{identified}} the Tsitsa River Catchment on the Mzimvubu River as a potential site for a water resource development. The soils in the Tsitsa Catchment are prone to extreme soil erosion, in particular gullying. The sediment generated from these gullies {{and other forms of}} erosion will have a detrimental effect on any water resource development. Changing climate and land use will also affect soil erosion dynamics and thus need to be considered before any development is planned in the catchment. Previous studies have mapped the gully systems in the catchment as well as used hydrological models to determine <b>erosion</b> from <b>sheet</b> and rill processes. However, these studies did not account for the effects of change in land use or climate. The mapping of the gullies was also done manually, which is extremely time-consuming and is susceptible to human error. This study aims to determine the sediment yield in the catchment under current and future climate and land use scenarios as well as develop a methodology to identify and map the gullies automatically {{in order to determine the}} rate of gully growth from a time series of images. The study had two main components, the first was to study gully erosion in the catchment. In the second section the sheet and rill aspects of erosion under various climate and land use changes were modelled. Using object-based image analysis (OBIA) on SPOT 5 images a methodology was created to automate the task of gully mapping. This was applied to two SPOT 5 data sets one from 2007 and the other from 2012 in order to determine the rate of gully growth over the five-year period. Various accuracy assessments were also conducted to assess the accuracy of the methodology. It was determined that the methodology had an overall accuracy of 98 % for the 2012 image and 99 % for the 2007 image. There was an overall increase in gully erosion in the catchment by 28 % in the five-year period. The estimated sediment yield generated from the gullies ranged between 7 and 14 t/ha/yr. It was concluded that OBIA resulted in faster processing times and more objective classification results. The second part of the study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to determine the sediment yield from <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion.</b> SWAT only considers sheet and rill aspects of erosion and disregards gully erosion thus both methods needs to be incorporated into the study in order to understand the complete dynamics of soil erosion in the catchment. SWAT was used to model the current land use and climate scenario using land cover data and observed weather data for the 2007 - 2012 period. On average 0. 18 t/ha/yr of sediment is generated in the catchment from <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion.</b> Using climate data from 1969 and projected to 2100, future sediment yield from <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> was estimated. The effects of possible land use change on <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> was also estimated by changing the land use component in SWAT into various crops that may be cultivated in the catchment over the next century. The results of the land use change showed that the current land use is optimal for minimal <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> and converting to maize crops will have the greatest impact on sediment yield This study aimed to understand the dynamics of soil erosion under current and changing land use and climate scenarios. It was concluded that the majority of the sediment is derived from gully erosion, which accounts for up to 70 times more sediment yield annually than <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion.</b> Gully formation and propagation in the catchment is of critical concern to any land or water developments proposed for the Tsitsa Catchment.

Generally, where water erosion rates on disturbed upland areas are greatest, rills are active. Flow depths in rills are typically of the order of a few centimeters (about an inch) or less and along-channel slopes may be quite steep. This means that rills exhibit hydraulic physics very different from water flowing through the deeper, wider channels of streams and rivers.|$|E

Consequently, {{there is a need to}} develop a scale-explicit understanding of sediment erosion yields, from microplot to hillslope through to plot, to surmount actual erosion modelling flaws and to improve guidance for erosion mitigation. The main objective of this study was to compare sediment yields from small and large plots installed under different environmental conditions and to interpret these results in terms of the main mechanisms and controlling factors of <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion.</b> Fifteen 1 x 1 m(2) and ten 2 x 5 m(2) plots were installed on a hillslope in the foothills of the Drakensberg, South Africa. Data of runoff, sediment concentration (SC), soil loss (SL) and rainfall characteristics obtained during the 2009 - 2010 rainy season at the two spatial scales and from different soils, vegetation cover, geology and topographic conditions were used to identify the main controlling factors of <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion.</b> Scale ratios for SC and SL were subsequently calculated to assess the level of contribution of rain-impacted flow (RIF) to overall <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion.</b> The average runoff rate (n?=? 17 events) ranged between 4. 9 +/- 0. 4 ?L?m- 2 on 1 ?m 2 and 5. 4 +/- 0. 6 ?L?m 2 on 10 ?m 2, which did not correspond to significant differences at P?<? 0. 05 level. Sediment losses were significantly higher on the 10 ?m 2 plots, compared with the 1 ?m 2 plots (2. 2 +/- 0. 4 vs 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 ?g?L- 1 for SC; 9. 8 +/- 1. 8 vs 3. 2 +/- 0. 3 ?g?m- 2 for SL), which illustrated a greater efficiency of <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion</b> on longer slopes. Results from a principal component analysis, whose two first axes explained 60 % of the data variance, suggested that <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion</b> is mainly controlled by rainfall characteristics (rainfall intensity and amount) and soil surface features (crusting and vegetation coverage).

Identification of the first year of exposure by erosion from anatomical criteria was therefore critical. The 29 samples taken were prepared for anatomical analysis and cross-dated. Anatomical analysis of the samples showed a reduction in the lumen area of earlywood tracheids following root exposure and also, in most cases, a slight increase in growth rings. Moreover, {{at the end of the}} ring, latewood tissue and visible annual borders were very clearly defined by several rows of thick-walled tracheids.

Because there are different mechanisms of <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion,</b> from raindrop detachment and transport by raindrops interacting with flow (RIFT), to detachment and transport by flow, that require a certain slope length to be operative, {{this study examined the}} impact of slope length on SOC and nutrient losses. Field experiments were conducted on crusted soils in the Sahel region of Africa. Three replicates of micro-plots (1 m ? 1 m), plots (10 m long ? 5 m width) and long plots (25 m ? 6 m) were installed for each crust type in the area (structural, STRU; desiccation, DES; gravel, GRAV; and erosion, ERO) and followed for each rainfall event in the 2012 rainy season. Sediment, SOC content in sediments and selected nutrients (NO 3 ?; PO 43 ?) in the runoff were analyzed to evaluate the annual losses by <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion.</b> SOC losses decreased significantly with increasing slope length from 0. 24 g C m ? 1 on micro-plots to 0. 04 g C m? 1 on plots and to 0. 01 g C m? 1 on long plots and similar trends were observed for NO 3 ? and PO 43 ? losses. This suggested a strong scale dependency of <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion</b> with the efficiency of transport by saltation and rolling by RIFT decreasing significantly with increasing slope length, by 6 folds in average between 1 and 10 m, with values between 1. 8 on DES crusts and 19 on STRU crusts. These results on the relationship between soil crusting and <b>sheet</b> <b>erosion</b> should be further used to mitigate against the loss of SOC through the implementation of improved soil conservation techniques, as well as to improve soil erosion and/or SOC models...|$|E
5000|$|The area of Bazman is {{affected}} by rain <b>erosion.</b> <b>Sheet</b> floods {{such as those that}} occurred in 1976 are principal agents. Together with other kinds of erosion such as frost and salt weathering, these have formed a pediplain terrain with inselbergs being left, especially where harder rocks are found. Pebbles eroded from Bazman have been transported to the terrains of the Jaz Murian depression south of Bazman. The effects of this erosion have mantled the volcano with debris locally known as [...] "dasht", reaching distances of over 30 km from the vent. With the exception of the Ziyarat valley on Bazman's southern flank, the area around Bazman is arid and uninhabited.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> {{rates have}} been well studied in rain-rich central and south Ethiopia. We {{conducted}} runoff plot experiments in the semi-arid north Ethiopian Tigray highlands to investigate whether erosion rates are within the same order of magnitude, to measure the effects of various land uses and covers, and to examine {{the application of the}} (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to the Ethiopian highlands. Average soil loss rate by <b>sheet</b> and rill <b>erosion</b> was 9. 7 (+- 7. 8) Mg ha– 1 y– 1 (42 plot-years), with 3. 5 Mg ha– 1 y– 1 in exclosures and forest, and 17. 4 Mg ha– 1 y– 1 in rangeland. Especially on arable land, the measured rate (9. 9 Mg ha– 1 y– 1) was well below the average erosion rate elsewhere in Ethiopia (42 Mg ha– 1 y– 1), which is attributed to (1) precipitation depth and total rain intensity, which are lower in north Ethiopia, (2) the widespread use of stone bunds, which decrease runoff length and velocity, and (3) often high rock fragment cover at the soil surface in arable land. The cover-management C-factor of RUSLE for tef (Eragrostis tef) was lower than in central Ethiopia (C = 0. 07 against 0. 25), probably due to earlier sowing than in the rain-rich regions of Ethiopia. Further values of C in the study area were 0. 21 for arable land under wheat and barley; 0. 42 for degraded rangeland, and 0. 004 for forest and exclosures. Exclosures and forests also trapped upslope eroded sediment. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{urban areas}} resting {{on top of}} {{unsaturated}} pyroclastic soils (e.g. TBJ) or close to the streams are prone to mass wasting processes and collapse. The problems experimented in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador are the failure of infrastructure like water pipelines, housing developments and roads), also sand/silt/debris flowslide and debris avalanche and <b>erosion</b> (<b>sheet</b> run off, vertical, lateral, planar, rill, gully and underground erosion). The intention of the present research is to understand the behavior and characteristics of a problematic pyroclastic soil (TBJ) for future application in the land use and have a better planning for the mitigation. Field monitoring prove to be important to recognize the external factors that affect the saturation of the pyroclastic soil.|$|R
