2500|$|Emily Deschanel {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Temperance Brennan just before {{production}} began on the Bones pilot. After Deschanel finished the film Glory Road, the film's producer Jerry Bruckheimer recommended that she audition for Bones. Deschanel impressed Hart Hanson at her audition with her assertiveness. In a tense moment in the audition scene, David Boreanaz <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to Deschanel; and Deschanel held her ground rather than retreating as most of the other actresses did. Hanson remarked that, in such a situation, [...] "90% of actors would take a step back". Deschanel was subsequently cast in the role.|$|E
2500|$|The {{landing at}} Caval was a tense one {{though there was}} no fighting, Perry {{stationed}} sentries at the gates of the royal kraal to help with escape should it be necessary. Crack-O denied that his people had done anything wrong, so he touched his ears and his tongue, with his sword, as a gesture of truthfulness. Governor Roberts asked Crack-O if he would attend the [...] "Great Palaver" [...] at Little Bereby and he accepted. Next Perry sailed his squadron for Little Bereby on December 11 and arrived on December 14 and landed his fifty marines and 150 sailors. The meeting was held in a house about fifty yards from the kraal gates, during which Roberts began discussing with Crack-O the Mary Carver and the Edward Barley affairs. It was apparent that the king was not telling the truth, so Commodore Perry <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to Crack-O to advise him to stop lying and a scuffle ensued. The chief attempted to drag Perry to his spear, but the commodore threw off his attacker, who then left the house as fast as he could. But before getting out the door, a marine sergeant opened fire with his musket and hit the king while two others bayoneted him. Simultaneously the native interpreter ran {{out of the house and}} skirmishing erupted between the American sentries and some Bereby riflemen.|$|E
60|$|This answer made Dan Baxter boil with rage, and he <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> {{and shook}} his fist in Tom's face.|$|E
50|$|This same <b>step</b> pattern, <b>step,</b> <b>close,</b> <b>step,</b> with a {{timing of}} quick quick slow was given as the {{definition}} of Country-Western Two-Step in 1983.|$|R

60|$|The captain <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up, but {{the sailor}} {{stood his ground}} and grinned.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stepped</b> <b>closer.</b> Suddenly {{he leaped}} into swift and terrible violence. Then with a lunge {{he drove the}} knife into Gulden's burly neck.|$|E
60|$|Relaxing his bowstring, he {{returned}} the arrow to the quiver and, throwing the bow about his shoulder, <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to the pinioned beast.|$|E
60|$|In her earnestness she <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to him, {{repelled}} yet {{fascinated by}} the sudden transition of his moods. That he would fight for her was at once horrible and wonderful.|$|E
60|$|She <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> {{up to him}} {{and rested}} her hand lightly upon his shoulder.|$|R

6000|$|... "But you are not," [...] {{came from}} Dick as he <b>stepped</b> <b>closer.</b> [...] "Oh, but I'm {{glad to get}} out of that hole!" [...] he added. [...] "And glad to fall among friends once more." ...|$|E
60|$|Again he <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to her. His evil {{face was}} convulsed with rage and desire. Like a wild beast he sprang upon her, {{and with his}} strong fingers at her throat forced her {{backward}} upon the berth.|$|E
60|$|The splendid leader <b>stepped</b> <b>closer,</b> his round, {{protruding}} amber eyes, which Gale {{could now}} plainly see, intent upon that fatal red flag. Like automatons {{the other four}} crowded into his tracks. A few little slow steps, then the leader halted.|$|E
60|$|That stung him. Quivering {{with the}} passion that obsessed him, he <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up to her.|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{looked in}} the direction, <b>stepping</b> <b>close</b> {{to the edge of}} the cliff as he did so.|$|R
5000|$|... {{this action}} may, in turn, cause a split of the {{right-most}} index page on <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the root; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I don't know where," [...] and now Dick <b>stepped</b> <b>closer,</b> as {{the round}} and {{freckled}} face of Rosy Delaney peered forth from {{a hole in}} the canvas end. [...] "He went to bed when I did, and now he's missing." ...|$|E
60|$|They had {{now only}} a few {{cartridges}} left, and these they divided between them. Then Dave stirred up the fire a little and placed the burning sticks so they would {{last as long as}} possible. Father and son {{looked at each other and}} suddenly <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> and embraced.|$|E
6000|$|Charley {{wiped his}} own eyes, which were rather blurred with moisture, and <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to the casement. [...] "Mr. Venn is asking Christian Cantle to sing," [...] he replied, [...] "and Christian is moving {{about in his}} chair {{as if he were}} much frightened at the question, and his father has struck up a stave instead of him." ...|$|E
60|$|As Arthur {{leaped out}} of the car a man {{appeared}} upon the <b>steps,</b> <b>closing</b> the door softly behind him.|$|R
60|$|It was Dan Baxter, as impudent and {{hard-faced}} as ever. He came a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> {{and fairly}} glared at Tom.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up to him, and {{bending over}} {{him as he}} sat there, crushed by realization, she lowered her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{would dare}}," [...] he said. [...] "I would dare love Tara of Helium; but I would not dare defile her or any woman with kisses {{that were not}} {{prompted}} by love of her alone." [...] He <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to her and laid his hands upon her shoulders. [...] "Look into my eyes, daughter of The Warlord," [...] he said, [...] "and {{tell me that you}} do not wish the love of Turan, the panthan." ...|$|E
60|$|Tarzan <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> {{and leaned}} over to examine it--it was the dead body of a naked warrior from whose chest {{protruded}} a short spear. Then he searched carefully every square foot of the remaining floor space and at last returned to the body again where he stooped and smelled of the haft of the weapon that had slain the black. A slow smile touched his lips--that and a slight movement of his head betokened that he understood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, {{come down}} to the house," [...] said the rancher, and led the way without {{speaking}} until he halted by the door. There he placed his finger on a small hole in the wood at about the height of a man's head. Jean saw it was a bullet hole and that a few gray hairs stuck to its edges. The rancher <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> to the door-post, so that his head was within an inch of the wood. Then he looked at Jean with eyes in which there glinted dancing specks of fire, like wild sparks.|$|E
60|$|I {{suddenly}} stood still, {{with my eyes}} riveted on his face. He <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up to me, {{and lowered}} his voice suddenly.|$|R
50|$|It was {{notable for}} being the {{occasion}} of the Kearny incident, which brought the United States one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to war with Germany.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Sam, edging a <b>step</b> <b>closer,</b> [...] "was {{the thought}} that {{tortured}} me, {{the thought that}} a friendship so delightfully begun...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah mother, mother!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} again--as {{if there were}} so many things {{to say that it was}} {{impossible}} to choose. But now he <b>stepped</b> <b>closer,</b> bent over her and in spite of the publicity of their situation gave her a quick expressive kiss. The foreign observer whom I took for granted in beginning to sketch this scene would have had to admit that the rigid English family had after all a capacity for emotion. Grace Dormer indeed looked round her to see if at this moment they were noticed. She judged with satisfaction that they had escaped.|$|E
60|$|Before the men lowered Tom from Marc's back I <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> {{and put my}} face {{within six}} inches of the lion's. He {{promptly}} spat on me. I had to steel my nerve to keep so close. But I {{wanted to see a}} wild lion's eyes at close range. They were exquisitely beautiful, their physical properties as wonderful as their expression. Great half globes of tawny amber, streaked with delicate wavy lines of black, surrounding pupils of intense purple fire. Pictures shone and faded in the amber light--the shaggy tipped plateau, the dark pines and smoky canyons, the great dotted downward slopes, the yellow cliffs and crags. Deep in those live pupils, changing, quickening with a thousand vibrations, quivered the soul of this savage beast, the wildest of all wild Nature, unquenchable love of life and freedom, flame of defiance and hate.|$|E
60|$|Segregated in {{the heart}} of the camp, Smoke came upon what was evidently Snass's fire. Though {{temporary}} in every detail, it was solidly constructed and was on a large scale. A great heap of bales of skins and outfit was piled on a scaffold out of reach of the dogs. A large canvas fly, almost half-tent, sheltered the sleeping- and living-quarters. To one side was a silk tent--the sort favored by explorers and wealthy big-game hunters. Smoke had never seen such a tent, and <b>stepped</b> <b>closer.</b> As he stood looking, the flaps parted and a young woman came out. So quickly did she move, so abruptly did she appear, that the effect on Smoke was as that of an apparition. He seemed to have the same effect on her, and for a long moment they gazed at each other.|$|E
5000|$|... 30 July 2008: Sébastien Bassong {{came one}} <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> {{to being a}} Newcastle player when a fee was agreed between Newcastle United and Metz.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{not harm}} {{you in the}} least," [...] said Giant, and now, {{attracted}} by something in the strange man's appearance, he went several <b>steps</b> <b>closer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{care that}} you don't get {{the worst of}} it, Merwell. Now let that boy go." [...] And Dave came a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> and clenched his fists.|$|R
