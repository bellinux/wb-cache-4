We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver.

[...] In order to rectify this, MacNeish began to involve experts outside of archaeology in many of his field studies.

2500|$|The academy was {{originally}} located at Benton, Wisconsin, [...] {{further to the}} northeast, and a sandstone structure was erected there for boarding school purposes, built {{in the form of}} a hollow quadrangle, after a plan in the European style by the founder, who was architect as well as superintendent of all the public buildings with which he was connected. In 1807, the new place was bought, as the position offered inducements superior even to the costly new structure. This building was of sandstone from a quarry on the estate built in 1845. It was four stories in height, with an observatory of three additional stories, which, from the elevated position of the building, offered a fine view of plains and the broad Mississippi. Adjoining the main building was another, erected as a hall for commencement day assemblies, concerts, lectures, and <b>so</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>and</b> capable of seating 2,500 persons. An extensive cabinet of philosophical and astronomical apparatus is connected with the house, a large share of which was donated from the private resources of the founder.

The entire range of buildings was heated by steam, the machinery having been in constant use at least eight months of the year.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993 Minnesota {{passed a}} {{provision}} that added sexual orientation to the state's human rights law. The provision has been characterized by its supporters as protecting “gay and lesbian teachers and students from discrimination”. In early 2003 Rep. Lindner claimed that the provision was a shield {{for the promotion of}} [...] homosexuality, “In some of the schools, we've got children as young as three, in pre-school, on up through the years that are being taught homosexual practices. And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and <b>so</b> <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators have told them that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things to happen to them, but I don't hate any of them. I do love them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got to be that way. But it's my understanding that gays have hundreds and even thousands of partners over a lifetime.” His remarks were seen as offensive by many Minnesotan homosexuals who said “most gays and lesbians are in committed relationships.” [...] They also took issue with Lindner's suggestion that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.|$|E
