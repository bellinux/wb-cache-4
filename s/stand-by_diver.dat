25|$|In some jurisdictions the <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver</b> must be {{supplied}} from an air source which {{is independent of}} that supplying the working divers, {{as the cause of}} an emergency may be failure or contamination of the main air supply to the working diver.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{skills are}} {{considered}} by some agencies to be {{beyond the scope of}} entry level divers, but other agencies consider some or all of them {{an essential part of the}} entry level diving skill set, as this is more compliant with the concept of buddy diving, and a required part of the skill set for a <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver.</b>|$|E
25|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} {{length of}} rope or webbing with a clip at one or both ends, which the <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver</b> uses to clip the unresponsive diver to his harness to free up both hands during a recovery. This can be useful if he needs to climb a structure, shotline or {{topographical}} feature, and the umbilicals can not be safely used to lift the divers due to snags or sharp edges.|$|E
25|$|Relatively complex {{technical}} diving operations may {{be planned}} and run like an expedition, or professional diving operation, with surface and in-water support personnel providing direct assistance or on stand-by {{to assist the}} expedition divers. Surface support might include surface <b>stand-by</b> <b>divers,</b> boat crew, porters, emergency medical personnel, and gas blenders. In-water support may provide supplementary breathing gas, monitor divers during long decompression stops, and provide communications services between the surface team and the expedition divers. In an emergency, the support team would provide rescue and if necessary search and recovery assistance.|$|R
25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time {{on the deck of}} a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional <b>stand-by</b> <b>divers</b> may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|R

50|$|Professional divers {{are usually}} trained in diver rescue for {{the modes of}} diving they are {{certified}} in, {{as part of the}} work of a professional diver is as <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver</b> to the working diver. The level and quality of training and required skill for certification may vary depending on the jurisdiction and relevant code of practice. During professional diving operations there will usually be a competent diver on stand-by at the surface control point, or in the water with the working diver, or both. The surface <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver</b> should be ready for immediate deployment for a rescue if this is deemed necessary by the diving supervisor, who is responsible {{for the safety of the}} dive team and for managing a rescue. Appropriate equipment based on the operational hazards and risk should be available on site. The bellman is the in-water standby diver in wet and dry bell operations.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are generally}} at less risk from silt {{out as they}} {{are connected to the}} surface by an umbilical and can not get lost, but they may become disorientated, and unable to work effectively. It is also more likely for them to have an umbilical snag in bad visibility, and if assistance is required from the <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver,</b> this is more difficult in a silt out.|$|E
50|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} {{length of}} rope or webbing with a clip at one or both ends, which the <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver</b> uses to clip the unresponsive diver to his harness to free up both hands during a recovery. This can be useful if he needs to climb a structure, shotline or {{topographical}} feature, and the umbilicals can not be safely used to lift the divers due to snags or sharp edges.|$|E
5000|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} lanyard or strap {{carried by}} a surface {{supplied}} <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver</b> {{to be used to}} tether an unresponsive diver to the standby diver during a rescue. It is attached at one end to a D-ring on the stand-by diver's harness, and has a clip at the other end which may be secured to a D-ring on the casualty's harness to allow the rescuer the use of both hands during the return to the bell or surface.|$|E
50|$|Diver rescue, {{following}} an accident, {{is the process}} of avoiding or limiting further exposure to diving hazards and bringing a diver to a place of safety where the diver cannot drown, such as a boat or dry land, where first aid can be administered and from which professional medical treatment can be sought.Rescue skills are considered by some agencies to be beyond the scope of entry level divers, but other agencies consider some or all of them {{an essential part of the}} entry level diving skill set, as this is more compliant with the concept of buddy diving, and a required part of the skill set for a <b>stand-by</b> <b>diver.</b>|$|E
