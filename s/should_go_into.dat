The document that the Philadelphia Convention presented was technically only a revision of the Articles of Confederation.

25|$|The {{most widely}} used, {{complete}} ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water. Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used {{nothing more than}} snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> making modern Valencian paella.|$|E
25|$|And {{they told}} us, the Inquisitor {{would have us}} separated, because I was weak, and I <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a cooler room; but Sarah should abide there. I {{took her by the}} arm, and said. The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks... they did not part us till ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{observations}} of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns {{about the validity of}} the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7cal/(mol·K). Experiments confirmed the former prediction, but found that molar heat capacities of diatomic gases were typically about 5cal/(mol·K), and fell to about 3cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures. Maxwell noted in 1875 that the disagreement between experiment and the equipartition theorem was much worse than even these numbers suggest; since atoms have internal parts, heat energy <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the motion of these internal parts, making the predicted specific heats of monatomic and diatomic gases much higher than 3cal/(mol·K) and 7cal/(mol·K), respectively.|$|E
25|$|When the Emancipation Proclamation {{went into}} effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically {{recruited}} by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money {{to cover the cost of}} anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great draft riot in New York City in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the city's Democratic political machine, not realizing it made them liable for the draft. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.|$|E

He was very fond of her, and worried when she participated in sports or was late returning for tea.|$|E
500|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had filmed {{from the internet}} from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. [...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting for}} their legal appeals to be heard, the CPUSA leaders became {{convinced}} {{that the government would}} undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers. To ensure continuity of their leadership, they decided that four of the defendants <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hiding and lead the CPUSA from outside prison. The defendants were ordered to report to prison on July2, 1951, after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and their legal appeals were exhausted. When July arrived, only seven defendants reported to prison, and four (Winston, Green, Thompson, and Hall) went into hiding, forfeiting $80,000 bail ($ in [...] dollars). Hall was captured in Mexico in 1951, trying to flee to the Soviet Union. Thompson was captured in California in 1952. Both had three years added to their five-year sentences. Winston and Green surrendered voluntarily in 1956 after they felt that anti-communist hysteria had diminished. Some of the defendants did not fare well in prison: Thompson was attacked by an anti-communist inmate; Winston became blind because a brain tumor was not treated promptly; Gates was put into solitary confinement because he refused to lock the cells of fellow inmates; and Davis was ordered to mop floors because he protested against racial segregation in prison.|$|E

2500|$|After {{leaving the}} Navy, Powell {{considered}} becoming an architect. His old professor, S. Lane Faison, strongly discouraged him. [...] As Powell later, recalled, Faison said, [...] "That's stupid. You <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> art history. It's {{the only thing}} you were ever good at." [...] Powell enrolled at Harvard University, where he obtained a Master of Arts from the Fogg Museum in 1970. He entered the doctoral program in art history at Harvard in 1970. While working on his degree, he served as a teaching fellow. Powell's dissertation was on the work of the early American painter Thomas Cole, and he received his doctorate in 19th-century American and European art history in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} months of his {{undergraduate}} education, Borlaug attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Charles Stakman, a professor and soon-to-be head of the plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled [...] "These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust, a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley crops. He had discovered that special plant breeding methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> forest pathology. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead. He subsequently enrolled at the University to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a master of science degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942.|$|E

2500|$|John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, {{stressed}} that western Virginians {{were committed to}} slavery as “essential to American liberty.” But he would not run away from devotion to the Union. “This government that we {{are called upon to}} destroy has never brought us anything but good. No injury has it ever inflicted on us. No act has every been put upon the statute book of our common country, interfering with the institution of slavery in any shape, manner or form, that was not put there by and with the consent of the slave-holding States of this Union…” If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere. Thomas Jefferson's grandson, George Wythe Randolph, now a Richmond lawyer, made a secessionist speech, observing that although the Republicans had captured the United States Government “in strict accordance with Constitutional forms”, it was merely sectional. “The Government, then…is constitutionally revolutionized, and requires a counter-revolution to restore it.” But “Let [...] go with us into a Southern Confederacy, and receive protection from Northern industry, and they will be what they ought to be—the manufacturers and miners of a great [...] nation.” We <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the Confederacy, “we are told it will bring war. On the contrary it will tend to avert war…Neutrality is impossible and would be dishonorable.” ...|$|E
