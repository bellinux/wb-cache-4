40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most noxious industrial gases. Its removal from natural gas is particularly required for reasons of health, odour problems, safety and corrosivity problems. H 2 S causes an irritating, rotten egg smell in concentrations above 1 ppm, and at concentrations above 10 ppm the toxicological exposure limits are exceeded. Many methods have been developed over the years for the removal of H 2 S from gaseous emissions. H 2 S removal, with subsequent sulphur recovery, is at present mostly preferred using a train of Claus process, Tail Gas Treating Unit and Amine Treating Unit. Some of the disadvantages of these methods for gas treatment are that they require relatively large investment and operational costs (e. g. special chemicals, equipment corrosion, high pressures and temperatures) and they require special operational safety and health procedures. Continual search for more economical removal methods has led to investigations into microbiological solutions for H 2 S removal. One of the most common technologies for biological treatment of sour gas is the THIOPAQTM process. It removes H 2 S from gaseous streams by absorption into a mild alkaline solution followed by oxidation of the absorbed sulfide to elemental sulphur by naturally occurring micro organisms. On the other hand, the Shell Claus Off-gas Treating (<b>SCOT)</b> <b>process</b> can be viewed as the industry standard classical process for small scale gas treatment. The purpose of this study is to simulate the biological oxidation of H 2 S gas process (THIOPAQTM) and <b>SCOT</b> <b>process</b> using the software HYSYS. In addition, these processes are compared qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of economic considerations. The comparison revealed that the biological process is safe, simple, and is cost competitive with respect to the SCOT proces...|$|E
40|$|Strict {{environmental}} regulations has pushed sulfur emissions from {{natural gas and}} crude oil refining plants to very low levels. The current and most widely used method for reducing those emissions is the Claus sulfur recovery process, which {{is not sufficient to}} satisfy stringent air pollution requirement as the typical standards limit sulfur emission from sulfur recovery plants to 250 ppm. Hydrogen sulfide, which is a byproduct of natural gas and crude oil processing plants, is very poisonous gas and its presence requires great deal of attention in order to meet {{environmental regulations}} and pipeline specifications. The most widely used method to treat the acid gas is by absorbing it by amine solvent in an amine sweetening unit followed by sulfur recovery unit. This is essentially recover up to 98 percent sulfur from the acid gas feed. However, with more strict regulations additional processes are required to treat the tail gas by the addition of tail gas treatment unit. The overall sulfur recovery from the integrated Claus sulfur recovery and tail gas treatment units is in the excess of 99. 9 percent. ProMax process simulation software was used to model the integrated sulfur recovery process and tail gas treatment unit. The model was then compared and validated against industrial data and a close match was found. Several operating parameters and conditions was then investigated and optimized in order to determine their sensitivity on the performance of the system. Those parameters include but not limited to factors such as the ratio of H 2 S/SO 2 in the tail gas, CO 2 slippage, steam stripping ratio, and Claus converters temperature. The addition of <b>SCOT</b> <b>process</b> raised the sulfur recovery efficiency to 99. 93 % with some modification to operational parameters that have the most influence on the process. The output of the project is to provide a platform for effectively managing the operations of the sulfur recovery process in terms of improving sulfur recovery while minimizing energy and operating cost in order to meet sulfur emission regulations...|$|E
30|$|It is {{instructive}} {{to describe this}} notion from a SCOT point of view before describing it with ANT concepts. According to {{the basic principles of}} <b>SCOT,</b> the <b>process</b> mentioned could be described as problem re-definition aimed at providing successful closure in terms of development and the relevant social groups involved in the process. In the famous article that introduced this concept, the authors Pinch and Bijker (1999) point out that the phenomenon of problem re-definition is crucial for providing closure in heterogeneous social groups with different—and usually conflicting—interests and orientations. One specific form of “new” technology that represents a solution for some of the involved groups could achieve successful closure if other relevant social groups also see the new artifact as a solution according to their specific interests and orientations (Pinch and Bijker 1999 : 44 ff).|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my thesis {{is to examine the}} {{processes}} and problems of risk governance within the functioning of a socio-technical system in a hierarchical organization. I explore the actual problems of operators of the Campus Security Report System and the solutions they deploy as different groups of people. The thesis examines the governance of risk-related events as found within people’s daily life drawing on culture theory, risk society and risk management approaches, and attempts to evaluate the relationships between risk, risk management and organisational culture. The research starts from the exposition of risk management ideas, focused on the daily risks happening in schools precisely because they are ‘everyday’, often quite mundane, yet potentially posing as much organisational challenge as major disasters which can, quite literally, cause organisational collapse. The thesis focuses not only on the concept of culture theory to explore the interaction of risk management existing across an organisational culture but also relies on the ideas of the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approach to explore the dynamic of managing daily risks in a hierarchical organisation. The main areas to focus on are: • Explore how unpredictable risks are managed • Examine the ways in which systems are modified in response to changing risk • Examine the ways in which managers and users interact and how hierarchical and local cultural practices work together or in different directions • Examine what are seen as hard to control risks and how these are reported • Examine the play of groups and their interests in shaping the system and how problems are dealt with • Examine the relationship between leaders/designers and users of the system and how this shapes the acceptability of risk. My thesis suggests that if managers ignore the factor of culture to manage risk, even with the help of technology, they may not only experience the reduplication of risk but also create new risks for an organisation or managers once again. In order to avoid such unacceptable phenomena when governing risk one of the possible ways may be to rely on the functioning of <b>SCOT</b> as a <b>process,</b> this would probably effectively empower the socio-technical system’s ability to manage risk in a more socially robust way in risk society.
