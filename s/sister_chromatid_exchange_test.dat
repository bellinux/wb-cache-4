40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether DNA damage increased in subjects possibly exposed to high amounts of antineoplastic agents. METHODS: The level of genetic damage was determined in peripheral mononuclear blood cells with the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>test,</b> the alkaline elution technique, and the cytokinesis block micronucleus test. RESULTS: The supposed increased {{exposure of the}} study subjects {{was caused by a}} malfunction of a safety hood resulting in leakage of air during preparation of an infusion of an antineoplastic drug. Two months after a new safety hood was installed, the frequencies of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges of exposed nurses (n = 10) were still significantly increased when compared with a matched control group (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05, one sided Wilcoxon test, respectively). In a second examination seven months later, the frequency of micronuclei had significantly decreased to control values (p < 0. 05, one sided Wilcoxon test, n = 6). Moreover, the study subjects who smoked (n = 8) had significantly increased frequencies of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05, one sided U test, respectively). No differences in the rate of DNA damage could be detected with the alkaline elution technique. CONCLUSIONS: Control measures on the level of biological effect should be performed regularly to ensure maximum safety precautions for workers potentially exposed to genotoxic agents...|$|E
40|$|Semipermeable {{membrane}} devices (SPMDs) are passive samplers {{capable of}} concentrating hydrophobic chemicals from water, sediments, soil and air. They consist of layflat polymeric membrane such as polyethylene containing {{a thin film}} of synthetic lipid such as triolein. The transport of hydrophobic chemicals through the membrane into the lipid is governed {{by the process of}} passive diffusion. Therefore, SPMDs sample chemicals in a way similar to organisms. This thesis deals with the application of SPMDs in the monitoring of concentrations and effects of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment. SPMDs were exposed to various pesticides (organochlorines, synthetic pyrethroids, dinitroanilines, amides) in laboratory flow-through experiments to study the uptake kinetics of organic chemicals from water. To compare the uptake of model compounds by SPMDs and aquatic organisms, the membrane samplers were exposed to chemicals side-by-side with bivalves. Mixtures of chemicals accumulated by SPMDs and mussels were tested in standard toxicity and genotoxicity assays (Microtox, Mutatox, invertebrate toxicity tests, the Ames test, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>test).</b> These studies showed that the uptake pattern of organic compounds by SPMDs and aquatic organisms was similar, and the passive samplers accumulated levels of chemicals sufficient for standard bioassays. To further validate the method, SPMDs were deployed in a number of polluted water sources in Lithuania. Bioassay-directed fractionation and chemical analytical methods were used to identify pollutants sampled (PAHs, PCBs, organochlorines) and their effects were evaluated in bioassays. SPMDs proved to be useful tools in monitoring of organic pollutants under the field conditions. Criteria for bioassays to be integrated with the SPMD technique were defined {{based on the results of}} these studies. Some important factors in the integration of SPMDs and bioassays (toxicity of SPMD-inherent oleic and sediment-associated inorganic sulfur) were considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} mutagenicity of fluroxene {{was investigated}} by the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test using lymphocytes in peripheral blood from patients before and after anaesthesia. Twenty-five female patients, aged 21 - 77 yr (median 36. 5 yr) were anaesthetized for gynaecological operations with fluroxene in nitrous oxide for 60 - 220 nun (median 110 min). The number of SCE per cell was the same before and immediately after anaesthesia. In 10 patients, SCE were examined 3 days later and no increase was observed. In rune of the other patients, SCE rates were identical before and after anaesthesia and 1 and 5 days later. It was {{concluded that there was}} no indication, from this test, of a mutagenic effect of short-term exposure to anaesthetic concentrations of fluroxene in nitrous oxide The possibility of a health hazard from anaesthetic agents has been discussed extensively for the last decade (reviews by Spence and Knill-Jones, 1978; Cohen, 1980; Vessey and Nunn, 1980). Experimen-tal and epidemiological studies have indicated indi-rectly that working in an environment contaminated by waste anaesthetic gases may be a health hazard, but a casual relationship has never been established. Recently, laboratory tests on mutagenicity have been used in investigations of inhalation anaesthe-tics (Baden et al., 1977; White et al., 1979; Baden and Simmon, 1980; Basler and Rohrborn, 1981). The <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>test</b> is based on examination of the exchange of DNA material be-tween the two chromatids in the chromosomes in mammalian cells. An increased number of such sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) reflects the influ-ence of mutagens (Perry and Evans, 1975; Latt et al., 1979). Previous in vitro studies of inhalation anaesthetics by this test showed only the vinyl-containing compounds fluroxene, ethyl-vinyl ether and divjnyl ether increased SCE, suggesting that the vinyl moiety might be important in this capacity (White etal., 1979). The SCE test may also be useful for evaluation of exposure to potential mutagens in vivo (Latt et al. ...|$|E

The GSM signal has been studied at specific absorption rates (SAR) of 0. 3 and 1 W/kg. The exposures were carried out in a waveguide system under strictly controlled conditions of both dosimetry and temperature. The same temperature conditions (37. 0 +/- 0. 1 degrees C) were realized in a second waveguide, employed to perform sham exposures. The induction of DNA damage was evaluated in leukocytes by applying the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) /comet assay, while structural chromosome aberrations and <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> were evaluated in lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin.

For the comet assay, this work deals with the effectiveness of tissue dissociation, storage of cells in lysing buffer and in liquid nitrogen, different electrophoretic conditions, neutralisation and fixation of slides, interindividual variation between samples, and responsiveness of four tissue types to ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS). The main conclusions are: (i) dissociation of solid tissues in a phosphate buffer supplemented with 200 mM N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone provides cells with an acceptable background DNA damage; (ii) freezing of cells or tissues in liquid nitrogen generally leads to an increase in DNA breakage, especially for liver, gill and kidney tissue; (iii) storage of slides in the lysing solution for up to one week gives minor changes in comet tails; (iv) differences in protocols for neutralisation and fixation may influence the results; (v) high intra- and interindividual variations in comets (length and DNA content) may obscure the interpretation of comet results; (vi) blood, gill, liver and kidney all showed a statistically significant increase of DNA damage after exposure to 50 mg EMS/l; (vii) electrophoresis at low voltage for longer periods is to be preferred to high voltage and short electrophoresis times. The simplicity and sensitivity of the comet assay make it an adequate test system for biomonitoring of chronic low level exposure.

The new data corroborate that in vivo genotoxicity of River Rhine water is at present lower than in 1978. The Comet assay is a useful addition but does not provide a substitute for the SCE endpoint in these in vivo genotoxicity studies. Prolonging the exposure time of Eastern mudminnows to River Rhine water from 11 to 42 days did not give a significant increase in SCEs and DNA damage (Comet assay) in gill cells. Mol. Mutagen. 2012.

40|$|Oral {{contraceptives}} {{are highly}} efficient and easily administered drugs; however, {{it must not}} be forgotten that they are composed of chemical substances which can be classified as potential carcinogens. Testing of a substance for genotoxicity represents a reliable approach both to evaluate the genetic hazard and to obtain information on its possible tumorigenic (cancerogenic) properties. The present study was undertaken to evaluate through carefully planned and controlled investigations the in vitro cytogenetic effects of oral contraceptives (ethynilestradiol and norgestrel mixed in the proportion 1 : 5) using three different concentrations, with two different durations of treatment (48 and 72 h), on two types of human cells (lymphocytes and fibroblasts) {{and a series of}} short-term <b>test</b> procedures: <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> (SCE), micronucleus <b>test</b> (MN), and chromosome aberrations (CA). In addition, the FISH procedure and in vitro anaphase and metaphase preparation analyses were performed. In contrast to CA and SCE frequencies, the frequency of MN in treated blood lymphocytes showed higher values by comparison with the controls, although the difference was statistically significant only for the lowest concentration (P = 0. 016). When using pancentromeric alphoid probes, the FISH procedure gave positive signals in more than 85...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, an {{increase}} of pollutants of diverse origin (industrial, military, mining, etc.) was recorded in several areas of Sardinia Island. We report {{the results of a}} multidisciplinary and complementary study based on cytogenetic and physiological analyses. The data obtained show the effects of the environmental impact on six sheep flocks (Sardinian breed) grazing on natural pasturelands next to possible polluted areas and compared to three herds grazing in different areas far from those potentially contaminated and used as control. <b>Sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> (SCE) <b>test</b> was used as cytogenetic test to analyze chromosomal damages and it was performed on peripheral blood samples collected from 129 adult sheep (age &# 62; 4 years) randomly selected from polluted (92 animals) and control (37 animals) areas. Two types of cell cultures were performed: without (normal cultures) and with the addition of 5 -BrdU. SCE-mean values estimated over 35 cells counted for each animal were 8. 65 &# 177; 3. 40, 8. 10 &# 177; 3. 50, 8. 05 &# 177; 3. 08, 7. 42 &# 177; 3. 34, 9. 28 &# 177; 3. 56 and 8. 38 &# 177; 3. 29 in the exposed areas, whereas the average values were 7. 86 &# 177; 3. 31 in the control group. Significant increases (P &# 60; 0. 01) of SCEs were found in three investigated areas of Southern Sardinia. Furthermore, sheep of the same flocks were characterized for blood redox homeostasis in order to define the potential targets of oxidative damage and to identify biomarkers of the extent of animal exposure to environmental contaminants. The plasma levels of Asc, Toc and Ret were found to be significantly lower (P &# 60; 0. 001) in exposed sheep (I, II, IV and V) than in the control group. TAC as well as GPx and SOD activities were higher in control than in the exposed groups (P &# 60; 0. 001). Finally, plasma levels of N-Tyr, PC, and LPO were significantly lower (P &# 60; 0. 001) in the control group than in the exposed groups...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a substrate to study homologous recombination between adjacent segments of chromosomal DNA. This substrate, designated lambda tk 2, consists of one completely defective and one partially defective {{herpes simplex virus}} thymidine kinase (tk) gene cloned in bacteriophage lambda DNA. The two genes have homologous 984 -base-pair sequences and are separated by 3 kilobases of largely vector DNA. When lambda tk 2 DNA was transferred into mouse LMtk- cells by the calcium phosphate method, rare TK+ transformants were obtained that contained many (greater than 40) copies of the unrecombined DNA. Tk- revertants, which had lost most of the copies of unrecombined DNA, were isolated from these TK+-transformed lines. Two of these Tk- lines were further studied by analysis of their reversion back to the Tk+ phenotype. They generated ca. 200 Tk+ revertants per 10 (8) cells after growth in nonselecting medium for 5 days. All of these Tk+ revertants have an intact tk gene reconstructed by homologous recombination; they also retain various amounts of unrecombined lambda tk 2 DNA. Southern blot analysis suggested {{that at least some}} of the recombination events involve unequal <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges.</b> We also <b>tested</b> three agents, mitomycin C, 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate, and mezerein, that are thought to stimulate recombination to determine whether they affect the reversion from Tk- to Tk+.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> and labelling patterns in H 3 thymidine labelled second division (post isotope incorporation) chromosomes of Vicia faba has demonstrated that: (1) The frequency of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> per chromosome {{is proportional to}} chromosome length. (2) The time of availability of colchicine may have a slight effect on the prospects of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> events. However, overall, colchicine has no {{significant effect on the}} frequency of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> exchanges; on the incidence of isolabelling or on the type of iso-labelling (3) The distribution of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> per chromosome follows a Poissonian form. The prospects of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> events at either the first or second interphases are equal and independent. (4) The ratio of single to twin <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> is consistent with the expectation that; <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> occur independently of the tritium dose, and that chromosomal sub-units rejoin non-randomly, i. e. they exhibit polarity and are dissimilar in an analagous manner to the DNA double helix. (5) A high frequency of chromosomes show isolabelling, the probability of which increases with chromosome length and/or exchange frequency. (6) Twin and single isolabelling segments have been noted, however the ratios obtained do not fit those for <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> and the origin of isolabelling remains unexplained. Mitotic cycle determinations using the labelled mitosis wave method and the double labelling method have been carried out for Vicia faba and Spironema fragrans root tips.
