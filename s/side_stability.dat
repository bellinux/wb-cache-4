So far various concepts of stability analysis, including Laypunov stability [15, 16], Mittag-Leffler stability [17], exponential stability [18] and Hyers–Ulam stability, have been introduced. Among all these concepts, Hyers–Ulam type stability analysis has been considered a relatively easy and simple way of studying the stability of solutions to fractional order implicit differential equations (FOIDEs). Ulam and Hyers introduced this concept of stability analysis in the mid of 19 th century for functional problems; see [19, 20]. Many mathematicians generalized this concept in different directions; see [21 – 25]. For recent contribution on this area we refer to the work in [26, 27].|$|E
30|$|The {{introduction}} of the rail and wheel could be separated into two periods. In the first period, {{the speed of the}} trains was relatively low and the rail and wheel contact was analyzed statically. Many of the research studies in this era led to a series of theories that were all based on the Hertz contact theory and would hypothesize that the contact area had an oval shape [7]. In 1926, the two-dimensional rolling theory with friction was introduced by Karter [12] to be used in railway appliances dynamics. Johnson and Vermoulen [13] have extended their theory to include an ideal surface with creep and without rotation. In this theory, the contact surface of the rolling parts was divided into two areas (slip and adhesion). Haling et al. [14] have introduced improvements for the approximate theory of oval contact with the net linear tripping. Kalker demonstrated a new approximate method that resembled Karters’s model [15]. Moreover, Kalker [16] used numerical theories and methods based on the finite element method. Xia and Gave [17] demonstrated a model to analyze the <b>side</b> <b>stability</b> in the arch, using the recoil rate and the damping of the rail and its infrastructure. Zhandel [11] worked on the wear forecasting of the wheel in comparison with the results of field measurements. Telliskivi and Olofsson [18] used the Metallurgical point of view and the concept of wear number to obtain the wear amount of the line and rail. Diana and Brownie [19] analyzed the effects of the wear of the rail and wheel on dynamic characteristics. Braghin and Louis [20] investigated the wear amount of the wheel profile using a mathematical model. Ranger [21] analyzed the <b>side</b> <b>stability</b> of the wagon with high speed in the arches. Turner [22] used a disk on disk instrument to determine the effect of speed and the percentage of trip on the wear of rail and wheel.|$|E

For large repulsive interspecies contact interaction the first species may spatially {{separate from the}} second species thus forming a demixed configuration, which can be spatially-symmetric or symmetry-broken. In the spatially-symmetric case, one of the the species occupies the central region, whereas the other species separates into two equal parts and stay predominantly out of this central region.
