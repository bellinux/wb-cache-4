40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear response arising <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> under in-plane uniaxial compression of a rolled magnesium alloy sheet using a crystal plasticity finite-element method, {{focusing on the}} effects of twinning and detwinning, and discuss the mechanism that causes the nonlinear response to be more pronounced under uniaxial compression than under uniaxial tension. In the simulation, we employed a twinning and detwinning model recently proposed by the authors. From numerical experiments, we confirmed that, as already noted in previous studies, detwinning activity {{plays an important role in}} the nonlinear response <b>during</b> <b>unloading.</b> However, we also found that the basal slip could become very active <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> because of the dispersion of crystallographic orientations caused by twinning activity during loading, which is another factor in the pronounced nonlinear response <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> under uniaxial compression. We conclude that the nonlinear response <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> is more pronounced under uniaxial compression than under uniaxial tension because of these two factors [...] i. e., the detwinning activity and the pronounced basal slip activity [...] which are not present under uniaxial tension...|$|R

40|$|A crystal-plasticity finite-element {{analysis}} of the loading–unloading process under uniaxial tension of a rolled magnesium alloy sheet was carried out, and the mechanism of the inelastic response <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> was examined, focusing {{on the effects of}} basal and nonbasal slip systems. The prismatic and basal slip systems were mainly activated during loading, but the activation of the prismatic slip systems was more dominant. Thus the overall stress level during loading was determined primarily by the prismatic slip systems. The prismatic slip systems were hardly activated <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> because the stress level was of course lower than that during loading. On the other hand, because the strength of the basal slip systems was much lower than that of the prismatic slip systems, the basal slip systems would be easily activated under the stress level <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> in the opposite direction when their Schmid’s resolved shear stresses changed signs because of the inhomogeneity of the material. These results indicated that one explanation for the inelastic behavior <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> was that the basal slip systems were primarily activated owing to their low strengths compared to that of the prismatic slip systems. Numerical tests using the sheets with random orientations and with the more pronounced texture were conducted to further examine the mechanism...|$|R

40|$|At the macroscale, the {{magnetization}} {{and shape}} of nickel-manganese-gallium (Ni-Mn-Ga) can be modified by magnetic-field-induced and stress-induced twinning. As applications predicated on small feature sizes are developed, the mobility of twin boundaries in confined volumes becomes increasingly more important for controlled shape change. The relationship between nanoscale deformation and twin boundary motion provides the motivation for evaluating the nanomechanical properties of Ni-Mn-Ga. Using instrumented nanoindentation, the nanomechanical properties of Ni-Mn-Ga were evaluated {{as a function of}} the orientation of the crystallographic c direction: in-plane versus out-of-plane. The reduced elastic modulus for c oriented out-of-plane (124 ± 5 GPa) was 33 % greater than for c oriented in-plane (93 ± 3 GPa). Load-displacement curves from indentations on in-plane regions exhibit pop-in during loading and greater non-linear recovery <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> compared to out-of-plane regions. The difference in elastic recovery <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> may be attributed to pseudo-elastic twinning.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in muscle activity when subjects {{are asked to}} maintain a constant cadence <b>during</b> an <b>unloaded</b> condition. Eleven subjects pedaled for five loaded conditions (220 W, 190 W, 160 W, 130 W, 100 W) and one unloaded condition at 80 rpm. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of six lower limb muscles, pedal forces and oxygen consumption were calculated for every condition. Muscle activity was defined by timing (EMG onset and offset) and level (integrated values of EMGrms calculated between EMG onset and EMG offset) of activation, while horizontal and vertical impulses were computed to characterize pedal forces. Muscle activity, pedal forces and oxygen consumption variables measured <b>during</b> the <b>unloaded</b> condition were compared with those extrapolated to 0 W from the loaded conditions, assuming a linear relationship. The muscle activity was changed <b>during</b> <b>unloaded</b> condition: EMG onset and/or offset of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus medialis, and gluteus maximus muscles were delayed (p < 0. 05); iEMGrms values of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior muscles were higher than those extrapolated to 0 W (p < 0. 05). Vertical impulse over the extension phase was lower (p < 0. 05) while backward horizontal impulse was higher (p < 0. 05) <b>during</b> <b>unloaded</b> condition than those extrapolated to 0 W.

40|$|Kinematics of {{the human}} {{masticatory}} system during opening and closing of the jaw have been reported widely. Evidence has been provided that the opening and closing movement of the jaw differ from one another. However, different approaches of movement registration yield divergent expectations with regard to a difference in loading of the temporomandibular joint between these movements. Because of these diverging expectations, {{it was hypothesized that}} joint loading is equal during opening and closing. This hypothesis was tested by predicting loading of the temporomandibular joint <b>during</b> an <b>unloaded</b> opening and closing movement of the jaw by means of a three-dimensional biomechanical model {{of the human}} masticatory system. Model predictions showed that the joint reaction forces were markedly higher during opening than during closing. The predicted opening trace of the centre of the mandibular condyle was located cranially of the closing trace, with a maximum difference between the traces of 0. 45 mm. The hypothesis, postulating similarity of joint loading <b>during</b> <b>unloaded</b> opening and closing of the jaw, therefore, was rejected. Sensitivity analysis showed that the reported differences were not affected in a qualitative sense by muscular activation levels, the thickness of the cartilaginous layers within the temporomandibular joint or the gross morphology of the model.

Finite element modeling (FEM) was {{used to analyze the}} stress evolution <b>during</b> <b>unloading.</b> The FEM results showed that the stress at the interface evolved from compressive to tensile status during the withdrawal of indentation load, and the interfacial debonding was induced at a critical tensile stress, which is consistent with the pop-out observed.

40|$|The {{deformation}} behavior <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> {{was examined}} under uniaxial tension in a mild steel sheet (body-centered cubic metal), an aluminum alloy sheet (face-centered cubic metal), and a magnesium alloy sheet (hexagonal close packed metal). A crystal plasticity finite-element method {{was also used}} to investigate {{the difference in the}} deformation behavior among on the materials. The nonlinearity <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> was the largest in the magnesium alloy sheet, and the mild steel sheet showed a larger nonlinearity than the aluminum alloy sheet. On the other hand, the apparent elastic moduli determined from the linear approximation of unloading curves were not always consistent with the characteristics observed in the nonlinearity, and this inconsistency became pronounced as the degree of nonlinearity increased. It was found that the degree of nonlinearity would have a strong correlation with the strain rate sensitivity, suggesting that the apparent elastic modulus was not suitable to model the unloading behavior for materials with high strain rate sensitivity. The crystal plasticity analysis demonstrated that the nonlinearity was much larger in the magnesium alloy sheet than in the other two sheets as observed in the experimental results. The simulation results suggested {{that one of the reasons}} that gave rise to the nonlinearity <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> would be the difference in the critical resolved shear stresses among the slip systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{phenomenon}} called unloading failure, {{in which}} the initiation and growth of cracks occurs during the removal of compressive stresses, has been observed in both uniaxial compression testing and Hertzian indentation testing of brittle materials. We have conducted finite element simulations of uniaxial compression experiments on single crystal quartz (specimens in which unloading failure was observed) to determine: (1) the mechanism responsible for unloading failure in brittle materials, (2) the dependence of this mechanism on friction between the specimen and loading platens, (3) the cause for the selection of specific fracture planes on which the unloading cracks propagate. The simulation results indicate that a slip-stick mechanism which is highly dependent on interface friction {{is responsible for the}} generation of tensile stress states leading to failure <b>during</b> <b>unloading.</b> The results also show that elastic anisotropy of a single crystal specimen leads to the self-selection of preferential failure planes <b>during</b> <b>unloading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Unloading {{skeletal}} muscle results in atrophy and weakness. Inhibition of calpain activity <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> reduced atrophy, but {{the impact on}} force generation has not been determined. Our hypothesis was that inhibition of calpain, through muscle-specific overexpression of calpastatin, would prevent the disruption of sarcomere structure and decreased specific force (kN/m 2) observed <b>during</b> <b>unloading.</b> Calpastatin-overexpressing (cp) and wild-type (wt) mice were subjected to 3, 9, or 14 days of hindlimb suspension (HS). Compared with soleus muscles of non-suspended control mice, soleus muscles of wt mice showed a 25 % decline in mass after 14 days of HS while maximum isometric force (Po) decreased by 40 %, resulting in a specific Po that was 35 % lower than control values. Over the same time period, muscles of cp mice demonstrated 25 % declines in both mass and Po but no change in specific Po. Consistent with the preservation of specific force during HS, soleus muscles of cp mice also maintained {{a high degree of}} order in sarcomere structure, in contrast to wt muscles that demonstrated misalignment of z-lines and decreased uniformity of thick filament lengths. Susceptibility to lengthening contraction-induced injury increased with the duration of HS and was not different for muscles of cp and wt mice. We conclude that inhibition of calpain activity <b>during</b> <b>unloading</b> preserves sarcomere structure such that the isometric force-generating capability is not diminished, while the effects of unloading on lengthening contraction-induced injury likely occur through calpain-independent mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for {{the determination of the}} film-only hardness of thin films deposited on substrates by nanoindentation. The method is suitable for tests in low load range where the substrate only deforms elastically.

Exercise training is one intervention that {{has been shown to}} confer favorable improvements in LV mass and function <b>during</b> <b>unloading.</b> However, the format and intensity of exercise required to induce optimal cardiac improvements has not been investigated. PURPOSE: This randomized, controlled trial was designed to 1) comprehensively characterize the time course of unloading-induced morpho-functional remodeling, and 2) examine the effects of high intensity exercise training on cardiac structural and functional parameters <b>during</b> <b>unloading.</b> METHODS: Twenty six subjects completed 70 days of head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) : 17 were randomized to exercise training (ExBR) and 9 remained sedentary. Exercise consisted of integrated high intensity, continuous, and resistance exercise. We assessed cardiac morphology (left ventricular mass; LVM) and function (speckle-tracking assessment of longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain and twist) before (BR- 2), during (BR 7, 21, 31, 70), and following (BR+ 0, + 3) HDBR. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2 max) was evaluated before (BR- 3), during (BR 4, 25, 46, 68) and following (BR+ 0) HDBR. RESULTS: Sedentary HDBR resulted in a progressive decline in LVM, longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain, and an increase in twist. ExBR mitigated decreases in LVM and function. Change in twist was significantly related to change in VO 2 max (R= 0. 68, p< 0. 01).

A range of supportive devices are used in rehabilitation to prevent shoulder subluxation, including hemi-slings and firm supports, such as arm troughs, however, {{there is little evidence}} regarding their efficacy. AIM: To determine whether a modified lap-tray during sitting and a triangular <b>sling</b> <b>during</b> standing is more effective than a hemi-sling in preventing shoulder subluxation, pain, contracture and upper limb activity limitation after stroke. DESIGN: A prospective, randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Three inpatient rehabilitation units in Australia and Norway. POPULATION: Forty-six acute stroke survivors within 3 weeks of stroke who were at risk of subluxation. METHOD: The experimental group used a modified lap-tray while sitting and a triangular sling while standing to support the affected arm for four weeks. The control group used a hemi-sling while sitting and standing. The primary outcome was amount of shoulder subluxation on X-ray. Secondary outcomes were upper limb activity, pain and contracture. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} groups in terms of shoulder subluxation (MD - 3 mm, 95 % CI - 8 to 3). There was a trend for the experimental group to develop less pain at rest (MD - 0. 7 out of 10, 95 % CI - 2. 2 to 0. 8) and during shoulder external rotation (MD - 1. 7 out of 10, 95 % CI - 3. 7 to 0. 3) and a trend towards having less contracture of shoulder external rotation (MD - 10 deg, 95 % CI - 22 to 2). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of other contractures and activity of the upper limb. CONCLUSION: A lap-tray during sitting combined with a triangular <b>sling</b> <b>during</b> standing is no more effective than a hemi-sling in preventing subluxation, pain, contracture and activity limitation in acute stroke survivors at risk of shoulder subluxation.
