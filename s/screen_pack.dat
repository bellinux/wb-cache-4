40|$|Virtual reality systems make {{compelling}} outreach displays, {{but some}} such systems, like the CAVE, have design features that make their use {{for that purpose}} inconvenient. In {{the case of the}} CAVE, the equipment is difficult to disassemble, transport, and reassemble, and typically CAVEs can only be afforded by large-budget research facilities. We implemented a system like the CAVE that costs less than $ 30, 000, weighs about 500 pounds, and fits into a fifteen-passenger van. A team of six people have unpacked, assembled, and calibrated the system in less than two hours. This cost reduction versus similar virtual-reality systems stems from the unique approach we took to stereoscopic projection. We used an assembly of optical chopper wheels and commodity LCD projectors to create true active stereo at less than a fifth of the cost of comparable active-stereo technologies.

The same pulse tube was used for all the experiments and measured 4. 76 mm in diameter and 46. 2 mm in length. A commercial linear compressor with a swept volume of 4 cm 3 was used in these experiments. The operating conditions were held constant at a mean pressure of 2. 0 MPa and a frequency of 54 Hz. Using finite difference software called REGEN 3. 1, developed at NIST, and recent experiment results, we optimized a series of regenerators based on dimensions, materials and <b>screen</b> <b>packing.</b> The values used for calculating the thermal conduction through stacked screens by REGEN 3. 1 were based on recent experimental results from NIST.

The valve settings for both orifices were adjusted to minimize the no-load temperature for all regenerators. A cooling capacity curve from 0 to 3 W was also determined. The performance of the pulse tube refrigerator using the different regenerators is discussed. The experimental results from the various regenerators are evaluated and compared with their corresponding numerically calculated coefficient of performance (COP) and regenerator design as determined by REGEN 3. 1...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Opportunistic {{screening}} for genital chlamydia infection is being introduced in England, but {{evidence for the}} effectiveness of this approach is lacking. There are insufficient data about young peoples' use of primary care services to determine the potential coverage of opportunistic screening in comparison with a systematic population-based approach. AIM: To estimate use of primary care services by young men and women; to compare potential coverage of opportunistic chlamydia screening with a systematic postal approach. DESIGN OF STUDY: Population based cross-sectional study. SETTING: Twenty-seven general practices around Bristol and Birmingham. METHOD: A random sample of patients aged 16 - 24 years were posted a chlamydia <b>screening</b> <b>pack.</b> We collected details of face-to-face consultations from general practice records. Survival and person-time methods were used to estimate the cumulative probability of attending general practice in 1 year and the coverage achieved by opportunistic and systematic postal chlamydia screening. RESULTS: Of 12 973 eligible patients, an estimated 60. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 58. 3 to 62. 5 %) of men and 75. 3 % (73. 7 to 76. 9 %) of women aged 16 - 24 years attended their practice at least once in a 1 -year period. During this period, an estimated 21. 3 % of patients would not attend their general practice but would be reached by postal screening, 9. 2 % would not receive a postal invitation but would attend their practice, and 11. 8 % would be missed by both methods. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic and population-based approaches to chlamydia screening would both fail to contact a substantial minority of the target group, if used alone. A pragmatic approach combining both strategies might achieve higher coverage...|$|R

For the friction factor, a correlation C_f=A/Re was obtained; here the coefficient A was related to the packing number ω defined by the ratio of n-layer thickness to n-times the single-layer thickness of the screen. Consequently, {{it was found that the}} permeability of the screen wicks could be predicted considerably well from the expression presented in this study and increased steeply with the increase in the packing number ω, which showed the degree of hold-down pressure for the screen wicks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Visualization of glyphs has a {{long history}} in medical imaging but gains much more power when the glyphs are {{properly}} placed to fill the <b>screen.</b> Glyph <b>packing</b> is often performed via an iterative approach to improve the location of glyphs. We present an alternative implementation of glyph packing based on a Delaunay triangulation to speed up the clustering process and reduce costs for neighborhood searches. Our approach does not require a re–computation of acceleration structures when a plane is moved through a volume, which can be done interactively. We provide two methods for initial placement of glyphs to improve the convergence of our algorithm for glyphs larger and glyphs smaller than the data set’s voxel size. The main contribution of this paper is a novel approach to glyph packing that supports simpler parameterization and can be used easily for highly efficient interactive data exploration, in contrast to previous methods. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe PVC screens {{of recent}} {{monitoring}} wells (MWs) have thin slots {{and a low}} open area, usually in the 2 – 8 % range. The MW <b>screen</b> and filter <b>pack</b> may cause important head losses which are not taken into account when interpreting the data of permeability tests performed using the MW. The equivalent hydraulic conductivity K of usual PVC screens was defined by hydraulic tests in a water tank, which have shown that gas micro-bubbles, a common problem in MWs and filter packs, contribute to increase the parasitic head losses. Closed-form equations and numerical models are used to explain by how much a field permeability test in a MW under evaluates an aquifer K value due to parasitic head losses in the <b>screen</b> and filter <b>pack.</b> The MW can properly measure the local soil K value {{only if it is}} markedly lower than the maximum MW value as obtained in a water tank. The MW measuring capacity can reach 5 × 10 − 3 m/s for large slots and deaired water, but is most often between 10 − 5 and 10 − 4 m/s for small slots in field conditions, and it can be only 10 − 6 m/s for poorly designed and installed MWs. The limited measuring capacity may yield artificial permeability scale effects as often registered in environmental studies...|$|R
