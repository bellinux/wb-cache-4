5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, <b>since</b> <b>a</b> rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the start of the war, a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden <b>since</b> <b>a</b> number of Egyptian aircraft were flying over this area.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible.

5|$|Creative Scotland is the {{national}} agency {{for the development of}} the arts in Scotland. It superseded the Scottish Arts Council, which was formed in 1994 following a restructuring of the Arts Council of Great Britain, but had existed as an autonomous body <b>since</b> <b>a</b> royal charter of 1967. In addition, some local authorities and private interests have also supported to the arts, although this has been more limited since local government reorganisation in 1996. Independent arts foundations that promote the visual arts include the Royal Scottish Academy, founded in 1826 and granted a Royal Charter in 1837.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of Bolding, the team went {{on the road to}} face Iowa on November 17, with newly {{returned}} B.J. Monteiro starting in place of Melquan Bolding. When down 49–50with 11.7seconds left, Bill Clark took an off-balance 3-point shot which spun in, putting the team up 52–50and sealing their second victory of the regular season. This was Duquesne's first ever victory at a Big Ten arena, and its first victory against a Big Ten school <b>since</b> <b>a</b> win over Illinois in 1973.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, <b>since</b> <b>a</b> normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, <b>since</b> <b>a</b> person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone <b>since</b> <b>a</b> June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. <b>Since</b> <b>a</b> similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore was named the game's most valuable player. Moore had a sack, a tackle for a loss, a blocked punt and a forced fumble. His performance was representative by a successful defensive effort by the Virginia Tech Hokies, who blocked two punts, had three interceptions, and limited Alabama to only seven points and 50 rushing yards. Tech's 31-point margin of victory was the biggest bowl-game win in school history, and Alabama's loss was their biggest in a bowl game <b>since</b> <b>a</b> loss in the 1972 Orange Bowl.|$|E

The Astrodon are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. Utahraptor, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an Astrodon with teamwork. When Red's mate climbs onto the dead Astrodon, the corpse rolls in the mud, trapping the male under {{the bulk of the}} animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving <b>since</b> <b>a</b> Utahraptor cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.|$|E
