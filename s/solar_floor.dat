40|$|Purpose / Context – To analyse the {{association}} between night-time temperature in the bedroom and morning blood pressure (BP). Methodology / Approach - Data were obtained from field surveys conducted from November 2014 to March 2015 on indoor temperature, home BP, sleep, and personal attributes. One hundred and twelve participants (73 households) were classified into three groups by the window glazing and {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>solar</b> <b>floor</b> heating system in their homes. Group 1 was single glazing and no <b>solar</b> <b>floor</b> heating system. Group 2 was double glazing and no <b>solar</b> <b>floor</b> heating system. Group 3 was double glazing and a <b>solar</b> <b>floor</b> heating system. Results – The night-time temperature in the bedroom and morning temperature in the living room in Group 3 were higher than those of Groups 1 and 2. After adjusting for personal factors, a 1 °C decrease of night-time temperature was significantly associated with a 0. 61 mmHg increase of morning systolic blood pressure (SBP) in Group 1, and a 0. 92 mmHg increase of morning SBP in Group 2. The temperature in Group 3 did not show a significant association with morning SBP. Key Findings / Implications – There was no effect on morning BP when the night-time temperature was over 18 °C, whereas on mornings below 18 °C SBP increased as the temperature decreased. Originality - The findings of this study may help improve indoor thermal environments to control hypertension and prevent cardiovascular disease, and thus reduce the medical costs associated with cardiovascular disease...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the numerical {{study of a}} solar-assisted ground-source heat pump system for building heating {{and the production of}} domestic hot water. An experimental study has been carried out and has allowed to validate the numerical model of the process. Two variants of the process are studied. These two variants use the solar energy for the domestic hot water (DHW) heating and for the injection of heat into the ground. In addition, the first variant also uses solar energy to heat the building thanks to a direct <b>solar</b> <b>floor</b> (DSF) and has a solar collector’s surface more important. While taking into account the electric consumption of the circulation pumps, results show that the global electric consumptions of these two variants are identical and have a value equal to 31 kWh per square meter of building surface. Nevertheless, with heat injected into the ground which represents 54 % of the heat extracted, the first variant can be a solution to better balance the thermal ground loads...|$|E

40|$|To get a {{systematic}} {{assessment of a}} residential building heating system’s environmental performance, the impacts that occur throughout the different stages of the system’s life-cycle (raw materials acquisition and processing, construction, use, maintenance, and end-of-life) need to be identified and quantified. The environmental impacts that occur during the construction and end-of-life phases for heating systems are not well known. Once those impacts are known along with the impacts from the other building life-cycle stages, residential heating system designs could be evaluated for their environmental impacts, areas or processes of significant impact could be targeted for improvements, and alternate designs could be compared. This analysis is best performed using life cycle assessment (LCA) which identifies each component of a system (all resource input streams and potential emission or waste sources), and applies mass-balance calculations (where inputs equal outputs) to them. This paper focuses on an LCA framework for analysis of residential heating systems. The choice of study boundary, activity selection and detail, and direct vs. supply chain impacts are addressed.

An accurate building heat balance model is developed through a detailed thermal network with distributed parameter elements and lumped elements, accurate representation of interior radiant exchanges and a floor internal heat source with variable depth within the slab. Frequency domain and finite difference techniques were used to perform analysis of the transient response of the heating system. It is shown that a combined feedback and feedforward controller when used with weather predictions one day ahead can practically provide perfect control. However, the appropriate building transfer functions must be estimated. Various control strategies involving room air temperature and operative temperature control with different thermostat setpoint profiles were investigated and it was demonstrated that control of floor radiant heating based on operative temperature constitutes a preferred approach...|$|R
40|$|Impacts {{of solar}} shortwave {{radiation}} are not {{taken into account}} in the standardized design methods in the current radiant system design guidelines.

Unless you plan carefully, your decorating scheme will interfere with the efficiency of your {{passive solar design}}, and the heat and sunlight will harm your furnishings. Floors, wall, furniture, fabrics, window treatments and accessories — the basic elements in any decorating plan — need {{to be thought of}} in terms of your passive <b>solar</b> design. <b>Floors</b> The <b>floor</b> of your <b>solar</b> home exposed to the sun {{is an important part of}} the passive design. It acts as a mass material, absorbing sunlight, conducting surface heat into its mass and holding onto that heat. The best thermal mass materials have dark colored, rough, matte surfaces. They may include concrete, brick, slate, ceramic tile and marble. Concrete, for example, can be stained before it is poured, or it can be patterned and colored to look like brick or slate giving you an economical, functional and attractive floor. Wall to wall carpeting should not be used on a thermal mass floor. Area rugs can be used if they are kept small. Remember to turn them so fading and wear will be even. Navahos, kilims and dhurries "weather" well. Straw or sisal mats are excellent choices. They soften the thermal mass floor, do not fade or interfere with heat flow and can absorb excess humidity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{identify}} the direction of an incident Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) via induced nuclear recoil. Our method is based on spectroscopic interrogation of quantum defects in macroscopic solid-state crystals. When a WIMP scatters in a crystal, the induced nuclear recoil creates a tell-tale damage cluster, localized to within about 50 nm, with an orientation to the damage trail that correlates well with {{the direction of the}} recoil and hence the incoming WIMP. This damage cluster induces strain in the crystal, shifting the energy levels of nearby quantum defects. These level shifts can be measured optically (or through paramagnetic resonance) making it possible to detect the strain environment around the defect in a solid sample. As a specific example, we consider nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, for which high defect densities and nanoscale localization of individual defects have been demonstrated. To localize the millimeter-scale region of a nuclear recoil within the crystal due to a potential dark matter event, we can use conventional WIMP detection techniques such as the collection of ionization/scintillation. Once an event is identified, the quantum defects {{in the vicinity of the}} event can be interrogated to map the strain environment, thus determining the direction of the recoil. In principle, this approach should be able to identify the recoil direction with an efficiency greater than 70 % at a false positive rate less than 5 % for 10 keV recoil energies. If successful, this method would allow for directional detection of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils at solid state densities, enabling probes of WIMP parameter space below the <b>solar</b> neutrino <b>floor.</b> This technique could also potentially be applied to identify the direction of particles such as neutrons whose low scattering cross-section requires detectors with a large target mass.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of a {{european}} project dealing {{with the issue of}} transport safety improvement in fog conditions, a new experimental building is being constructed on the FUL campus, {{in the southern part of}} Belgium. This building hosts a climatic chamber in which a given indoor climate is to be maintained (temperature and relative humidity) whatever the external climate. Control of the internal climate will be performed by means of a specific HVAC plant. The general environmental context of the project led to the selection of non conventional solutions for the plant: solar collectors (both thermal and photovoltaic) are associated with a reversible heat pump in order to either heat or cool the building. In some circumstances, simultaneous heating and cooling of different rooms of the building will be necessary and possible. Energy distribution within the building will be made possible by different systems: - floor heating and/or cooling - cooling or heating ceiling - ventilation and Air handling Unit The paper reports on the use of building and HVAC system simulation in order to support the design of the plant.

50|$|Cooling load {{profiles}} for UFAD {{systems and}} overhead systems are different, mainly {{due to the}} thermal storage effect of the lighter-weight raised floor panels compared to the heavier mass of a structural floor slab. The mere presence of the raised floor reduces {{the ability of the}} slab to store heat, thereby producing for the system with a raised floor higher peak cooling loads compared to the system without a raised floor. In the OH system, particularly in perimeter zones, part of the incoming solar heat gain is stored in the floor slab during the day, thus reducing peak zone cooling loads, and released at night when the system is off. In a UFAD system, the presence of the raised <b>flooring</b> transforms the <b>solar</b> absorbing massive <b>floor</b> slab into a lighter weight material, leading to relatively higher peak zone cooling loads. A modeling study based on EnergyPlus simulations showed that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19% higher than an overhead cooling load and 22% and 37% of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively.|$|R
