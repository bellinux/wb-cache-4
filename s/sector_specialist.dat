40|$|The {{combination}} {{of public and}} private medical practice is widespread in many health systems and has important consequences for health care cost and quality. However, its forms and prevalence vary widely and are poorly understood. This paper examines factors associated with public and private sector work by medical specialists using a nationally representative sample of Australian doctors. We find considerable variations in the practice patterns, remuneration contracts and professional arrangements across doctors in different work <b>sectors.</b> Both <b>specialists</b> in mixed practice and private practice differ from public <b>sector</b> <b>specialists</b> with regard to their annual earnings, sources of income, maternity and other leave taken and number of practice locations. Public <b>sector</b> <b>specialists</b> are likely to be younger, to be international medical graduates, devote a higher percentage of time to education and research, {{and are more likely to}} do after hours and on-call work compared with private <b>sector</b> <b>specialists.</b> Gender and total hours worked do not differ between doctors across the different practice types.

40|$|Superannuation fund {{investment}} arrangements {{have become}} increasingly complex {{over the past two}} decades due, inter alia, to the growth in <b>sector</b> <b>specialist</b> investment management and the increase in the number of available asset classes and sector products. At the same time, corporate resources devoted to superannuation issues have reduced due to a greater focus on core business activity and reducing costs. These factors, together with a failure of superannuation funds, on average, to capture the full advantages of sector specialisation, have driven the growth of implemented consulting, i. e., the sensible outsourcing of the specialist aspects of implementing these complex investment arrangements. This paper covers these trends in the superannuation industry and how investment arrangements can be effectively implemented using a manager-of-managers approach. ...|$|E

In addition, competition from other VC firms will affect a firm’s specialization choice in the sense that its relative standing among competitors will influence a startup’s decision to accept its investment.
