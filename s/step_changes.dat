Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during <b>step</b> <b>changes.)</b> There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} way {{to encode}} negative numbers {{is to use}} the least-significant bit for sign. This is notably done for Google's protocol buffers, and is known as a zigzag encoding for signed integers. Naively encoding a signed integer using two's complement means that &minus;1 is represented as an unending sequence of for fixed length (e.g., 64-bit), this corresponds to an integer of maximum length. Instead, one can encode the numbers so that encoded 0 corresponds to 0, 1 to &minus;1, 10 to 1, 11 to &minus;2, 100 to 2, etc.: counting up alternates between nonnegative (starting at 0) and negative (since each <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> the least-significant bit, hence the sign), whence the name [...] "zigzag encoding".

In contrast to the principle of grouping, contrasting features are typically in close proximity eliminating the need to link distant, but similar features.|$|E
