25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E
500|$|Tytell {{writes that}} Pound {{was in his}} element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last {{provided}} for, and was allowed to read, write and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, {{and turned it into}} his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of Sophocles's Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: [...] "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he has fewer not more than before his incarceration." ...|$|E
500|$|The fair {{organizers}} did not await {{congressional approval}} to begin planning the coin. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison {{came up with}} the concept for the designs. On December7, 1922, Commission of Fine Arts chairman Charles Moore wrote to Buffalo nickel designer and sculptor member of the commission James Earle Fraser, [...] "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. [...] They {{are going to have a}} 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal... It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the designs having been settled upon, the [...] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. It {{does not}} <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there is {{anything}} definite about that. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did; I {{ought to}} have stopped you," [...] Kit agreed. [...] "For a moment, it did not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you were looking for}} Miss Osborn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't try me too high," [...] she begged. [...] "Not now, precious." [...] And, indeed, even as I spoke, it did <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the night}} was pretty still.|$|R
500|$|Silent Alarm {{does not}} contain a solitary lyrical centre and simply observes people's lives. Okereke wanted to leave {{individual}} listeners space {{to make their own}} conclusions, but has admitted that the record [...] "operates in the realm of cultural politics". Much of the songwriting is inspired by the style of confessional poetry authors like Anne Sexton and musicians Thom Yorke and Björk. In general, Silent Alarm tries to make clear an existential pointlessness in life. With hindsight, Okereke noted themes of [...] "helplessness and weariness" [...] because of the album's focus on how he was feeling between the agesof18and20. Professor John Sutherland has pointed out literary elements, often similar to Sylvia Plath's work, in the lyricist's writing. Discussing the opening track [...] "Like Eating Glass", he explained, [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> whoever did the lyrics must have read some of her work. It has the same rather jagged, surprising imagery. It could sit fairly comfortably in a poetry anthology." [...] The recurring line [...] "We've got crosses on our eyes" [...] is inspired by cartoon characters who have crosses on their eyes when they die. Okereke tried to convey the feelings in a failing relationship, [...] "of being completely disorientated", using childhood metaphors.|$|E
6000|$|The judge laughed impatiently. [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{this young}} Mr. Breckon hasn't much {{advantage}} of Ellen in what Lottie calls closeness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right, Fred. D'you know, it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'm a {{far more}} selfish and despicable brute than I used to think myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew what}} I was about," [...] said Owen. [...] "It didn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{she had the}} least right to come down on us that way and ask for explanations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] {{continued}} Captain Jabez, [...] "I don't {{want to hurt}} nobody's feelin's, and I wouldn't say {{one word}} {{that would make the}} smallest infant think less of itself than it did afore I spoke, but it does <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> that there proposition of yours is a good deal like the California man's offer to the New York man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, my good friend, {{you have}} been among the theologians," [...] said the elephant. [...] "I doubt if I am clever enough to argue with you. I can only say it does not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lodloe," [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Petter. [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{have heard}} the Rockmores mention that name. Is it a Germantown family?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he is {{sharing with}} them already," [...] said Christie, glancing bitterly round the cabin; [...] "sharing everything--ourselves, our lives, our tastes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mappin's doing a {{good deal}} of the Company's work. However, it looks as if we meant to dig the ore out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes, miss! Now I understand. I've {{had such}} {{people come in}} past years. But it didn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you looked of a sort to require blood-turning. What's the complaint? The wrong kind for this, I'll be bound.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that's</b> {{finding out}} {{considerable}} in one day," [...] and then I explained {{how it was}} little Frenchie was able to move about York Town as he had, after which Uncle 'Rasmus asked in a hopeful tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{accounts}} to-night. It's {{beginning to}} <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{both of us}} might have been happier if I hadn't thought about them so much. After all, I dare say it isn't wise to give economic questions the foremost place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Betsy doubtfully, [...] "it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if {{you ever}} manage to get there the Metal Monarch will make you, too, his prisoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good. But it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} want of harmony between your present mood of {{self-sacrifice}} and your past mood of self-preservation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{she must}} be a devilish impudent girl,’ says Edwin Drood. ‘And so, Pussy, you have passed your last {{birthday}} in this old house.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems strange," [...] she remarked innocently, [...] "that {{he should}} have been so shy. He didn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way when I knew him at home in Massachusetts, you know. He {{travelled}} about so much in later years, too, didn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Phoebe meditated a few moments; then looking up, said, 'I {{beg your}} pardon, Robin, {{but it does}} <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> {{if you think that}} this kind of life is not good for Lucilla, it cannot be right to {{sacrifice}} your own higher prospects to enable her to continue it.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Rue St. Méry {{exhibited}} proofs of {{the late}} contest, for some distance, but nowhere had the struggle been so fierce as at the house just mentioned. The church had been yielded the last, {{but it did not}} <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there had been as sharp fighting near it, as at the other place.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{this will}} be a {{particularly}} safe home when your dangerous self is removed," [...] began Coventry, with an aggravating smile of calm superiority.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this: It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you need}} looking after. We can't stay here indefinitely. Hadn't {{you better get}} back to Vancouver before your English friends ruin you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{consider}} it when I've {{a little more}} to go on. It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'm learning things. And now I think I'll get to sleep; my head's aching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, {{leaning over}} the iron rail at the stair-head-'it <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> Sam, <b>that</b> {{imprisonment}} for debt is scarcely any punishment at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It did not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the man laughed," [...] Pen said, [...] "And as for lobsters, I {{thought he}} would have liked to eat me after the lobsters. He shook hands with me, and gripped <b>me</b> so, <b>that</b> he bruised my glove black-and-blue. He is a young surgeon. He comes from Clavering. Don't you {{remember}} the gilt pestle and mortar in High Street?" ...|$|R
60|$|One {{reason for}} unwillingness {{to do so}} is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity. I do not know how much {{attachment}} you may have toward our race. It does not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to them, at all events.|$|R
6000|$|... "George, it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you're upset," [...] said Dick, presently. [...] "I seem to {{remember}} you as a cool-headed fellow whom nothing could disturb. Has the army changed you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{ought to}} see these notes," [...] said Jock. [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there is a clue here to that {{difficulty}} he mentions in that published paper of his." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] {{interrupted}} Dr. Spencer, [...] "it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{we could}} not do better than get up our S. P. G. demonstration {{on the day of}} the stone--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep back!" [...] {{cried out}} our hero, still mighty hoarse. [...] "Keep back! If you <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> with <b>that</b> stick I'll fling you overboard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said he, [...] "that I {{see signs of}} {{weakening}} in the social boom. That man considers us exactly as we considered our lodging-house keeper in London. Now, it doesn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> that sample person you was talking about, who is {{a cross between a}} rich farmer and a poor gentleman, would go into the lodging-house business." [...] I couldn't help agreeing with Jone, and I didn't like it a bit. The gentleman hadn't said anything or done anything that was out of the way, but there was a benignant loftiness about him which grated on the inmost fibres of my soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, not much. I {{can just}} see the island--the big one--still in the same place. It <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> sir, <b>that,</b> for calms, this here sea is a devil of locality." ...|$|R
