50|$|The {{development}} of a robust riverine warfare capability during the Vietnam War produced the forerunner of the modern special warfare combatant-craft crewman. In 1966 River Patrol Force (Task Force 116) operated River Patrol Boats (PBR) conducting counterinsurgency operations in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. A SEAL Platoon was assigned {{to each of the}} five River Squadrons inserted and extracted from their patrol area by PBRs. In July 1968 Light <b>SEAL</b> <b>Support</b> Craft (LSSC) began replacing PBRs as their primary support craft. Mobile Support Teams (MST 1-3) provided combat craft support for SEAL operations, as did patrol boat, river (PBR) and patrol craft, fast (PCF) sailors. In February 1964, Boat Support Unit One was established under Naval Operations Support Group, Pacific to operate the newly reinstated patrol torpedo fast (PTF) program and to operate high-speed craft in support of NSW forces. In late 1964 the first PTFs arrived in Da Nang, Vietnam. In 1965, Boat Support Squadron One began training patrol craft fast crews for Vietnamese coastal patrol and interdiction operations. As the Vietnam mission expanded into the riverine environment, additional craft, tactics, and training evolved for riverine patrol and <b>SEAL</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

Orchard decided to support Peter MacKay over Jim Prentice due to the latter's implicit support for a United Alternative (merger of the party with the Canadian Alliance (CA) party).

50|$|In {{a double}} seal Back to Back, the barrier liquid in the cavity {{between the two}} seals is pressurized. Thus if the primary seal fails, the neutral liquid will leak into the pump stream instead of the {{dangerous}} pumped fluid escaping into the atmosphere. This application is usually used in gas, unstable, highly toxic, abrasive, corrosive, and viscous fluids. These are detailed in API Piping Plan standards #53a, 53b, 53c; or 54. Plan 74 may also be considered a double seal piping plan, although it is used exclusively when describing a dry gas barrier <b>seal</b> <b>support</b> system. The barrier fluid used in a Plan 74 system is simply a gas, not a liquid. Typically, nitrogen is used as its inert nature makes it advantageous due to mixing with the process stream being sealed.|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 145 - 152 Dry {{gas seals}} {{have been applied}} in process gas {{centrifugal}} compressors for more than 20 years. Over 80 percent of centrifugal gas compressors manufactured today are equipped with dry gas seals.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) has only recently addressed gas seal system design in its Standard 614 (1999).

This paper presents the philosophy of one centrifugal compressor and dry gas seal original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in regard to gas seal system design standards. These standards are based on over 20 years of experience in the area of gas seal system design, drawing form actual field experience of thousands of compressors.

This study has simulated the existing design and proposed design of seal with use Aluminum (1060 alloy) as a material of seal for both cases. In addition it has been simulated three different materials for the proposed design of seal (Aluminum, ductile iron, steel).

40|$|Lecturepg. 35 Improvement in the {{efficiency}} of enhanced oil recovery techniques at the Kuparak, Alaska, oil field required replacement of reciprocating pump with a larger capacity centrifugal pump. During the specification of a high speed two-stage centrifugal pump, the mechanical seals and <b>seal</b> <b>support</b> system were identified as key factors for a successful installation. While not all encompassing, the mechanical seal pressure velocity (PV) parameter, does allow the user to gauge the duty level of a mechanical seal. Since low leakage mechanical seals typically operate with a very small fluid film between the stationary and rotating faces, significant friction and heat may be generated when the pressures and rubbing velocities become high. Thus, the higher the PV parameter, the more crucial the physical seal design and material selection become to minimize heat and maintain an acceptable life. Although the pump and seal manufacturer had successful seal experience up to PV = 2. 1 million (psi-ft/min), the chosen pump configuration resulted in a PV = 2. 7 million, or 30 percent above the previous experience. Venturing beyond the current state-of-the-art seal, PV parameter necessitates an extensive qualification program to ensure that pump reliability and process safety management practices were met. To accomplish these objectives, a stringent set of seal qualification requirements were prepared by the contractor and end user to satisfactorily demonstrate: No catastrophic failures during normal and transient operation, A predicted seal life in excess of one year, and a maximum leakage rate of 150 ml/hr. A total of 600 operating hr were accumulated, including 75 start/stops to prove the robustness of the mechanical seals. Analytical verification, test lab results, and field operating experience are presented. In addition, a method for grading {{the success of the}} test program results against the desired design criteria is included...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 77 Increasing {{environmental}} awareness {{and the ongoing}} need for improved reliability has seen {{an increase in the}} number of water reinjection installations, both onshore and offshore, and in particular in recent years, the use of double pressurized seal solutions. While these double seal solutions have presented a generally satisfactory solution, there are notable instances of problems often associated with the reliability of the supporting pressurization system. This has been particularly so in formation and produced water injection installations in the Middle East. Similarly, in offshore applications, the introduction of comingled service caused by environmental pressures on operators to reinject produced water has caused the traditional single seal solutions to become increasingly unreliable and to lose favor. Until recently, the only available solution has been the pressurized dual seal with all of the additional cost associated with a complex sealing system. However, by the application of ?active lift? technology, originally developed for gas compressors, operators are now seeing the advantage of simple nonpressurized tandem seal arrangements. With these seals, unpressurized barrier fluid is ?pumped? across the inboard seal faces into the process fluid using active lift technology, providing a clean environment within which the seal can operate. These active lift seals have now been developed and applied to a level whereby suction pressures of 70 bar/ 1000 psi and beyond can be handled, providing all of the benefits of a pressurized dual seal, without the complexity and cost of pressurized solution. While active lift technology has been applied to pumps for several years, it has traditionally been associated with low pressure environments. Advances in active lift characteristics have now allowed the technology to be applied on increasingly demanding applications, eliminating the need for complex <b>seal</b> <b>support</b> systems...|$|E
