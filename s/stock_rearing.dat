50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Glamorgan was almost entirely agriculture based. With the industrialisation of the county, farming became of far less importance, with industrial areas encroaching into farming lands. In Glamorgan, from the late 19th century, there was a significant reduction away from arable land towards pasture land. There were two main factors behind this trend; firstly the increase in the population of the county required more milk and other dairy produce, in an age before refrigeration. Secondly there was an employment shortage in farming due to the call of better paid industrial work, and pastoral land was less work intensive. <b>Stock</b> <b>rearing</b> became prominent with breeds such as Hereford, Devon and Shorthorn cattle being bred in the Vale of Glamorgan, while the unenclosed wilds of the Gower saw Welsh Ponies bred on the commons.|$|E

40|$|Young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> is an {{important}} factor on dairy farms. However, the costs of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> are often unknown while most costs are contributed to the dairy cows. In addition to that, most farmers have great difficulties in estimating the costs of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing.</b> Previous research shows that the costs of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> can be up to € 1540 per successfully bred heifer or 13 % of the cost price of milk (Mohd Nor et al., 2012). In order to calculate the young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs on Dutch dairy farms, 43 farms were visited and a calculation of their young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs was made using JonKos, a module designed by WUR Livestock Research, DLV and WUR Business economics (WUR Livestock Research et al., 2011). The average costs of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> on dairy farms according to this research project were € 1559 per successfully reared heifer. Young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> farms had lower average rearing costs than dairy farms (€ 1273 versus € 1606 resp.), although this proved not to be significant (p= 0. 056; B=- 0. 294). The total hours spent on young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> had a significant effect on the total young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs per heifer on dairy farms (p= 0, 049; B= 0. 326). In addition, a rise in the average age at first calving did lead to a significant rise the costs of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> per 100 kg milk (p= 0, 01; B= 0, 426). The farmers that participated in this research project estimated their rearing costs to be € 994 per successfully reared heifer, thereby underestimating the young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs by € 312 per heifer. There was no significant relation between the calculated young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs on a farm and the estimation by the farmer, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} farmers that participated in this project were not able to make an educated guess of their young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs.

40|$|An {{important}} part of a dairy farm is the rearing of young stock. This {{has to be done}} accurately, not only because the new dairy cows will replace the old ones, but also as a lot of money is involved. This has become clear in previous research, which has shown that the successful rearing of one heifer costs € 1. 540. This is 13 % of the cost price of milk. 9 To gain more understanding in young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs, 40 farms from the Veterinary Centre Zuid-Oost Drenthe were visited. During this visit, calculations of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs were made with the spreadsheet Jonkos from, among others, WUR Livestock Research. In this study, the average of the young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> costs on the visited farms was € 1. 967 per heifer, with costs ranging from € 919 to € 3. 307. It was also shown that increased scaling is beneficial for costs. An increase in scaling factors researched led to a lower total young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> cost per heifer. An increase in milk production (β=- 0, 337; P= 0, 028), the number of dairy cows (β=- 0, 360; P= 0, 037) or the number of young stock (β=- 0, 435; P= 0. 009) were all significant factors leading to reduction of costs. The age at first calving (AFC) was vice versa: a increase in AFC lead to a significant rise in the rearing costs per heifer (β= 0, 551; P= 0, 001). Comparing the net returns from the heifers with the AFC (P= 0, 109) also showed a remarkable result, namely that there was no significant link between the two. This is surprising, as a lot of farmers claim to experience otherwise. The net returns of the heifers compared with the score of the veterinarian was shown to be almost significant (P= 0, 054), suggesting that a higher level of management skills may lead to an increase in the net returns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Driven by {{consumer}} demands, European {{legislation has}} suggested {{the use of}} HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) as the quality risk management programme for the whole dairy chain. Until now, an exception has been made for primary producers, but as regulations evolve, on-farm HACCP-like programmes {{should be ready to}} assure food safety as well as animal health and animal welfare. In our field experiment, the HACCP-concept was used to combine both optimal farm management and formalisation of quality assurance in an on-farm situation in the Netherlands. The process of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> was chosen, since its importance {{for the future of the}} farm is often underestimated. Hazards and their associated risk factors can be controlled within the farm-specific standards and tolerances, as targets can be controlled by corrective measures and by implementation of farm-specific worksheets. The veterinarian is pivotal for the facility-based HACCP team, since he/she has knowledge about on-farm risk assessment and relations between clinical pathology, feed and farm management. The HACCP concept in combination with veterinary herd health and production management programmes offers a promising approach to optimise on-farm production processes (i. e., young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing)</b> in addition to a structural approach for quality risk management on dairy farms. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: As farmers do {{not often}} keep {{a record of}} the {{expenditures}} for rearing, an economic tool that provides insight into the cost of rearing is useful. In the Netherlands, an economic tool (Jonkos) has been developed that can be used by farmers to obtain insight into the cost of rearing on their farm. The first objective {{of this study is to}} calculate the total cost of rearing young stock in Dutch dairy herds using Jonkos. The second objective is to compare the calculated total cost of rearing with the farmers' own estimation of the cost of rearing (the perceived cost). Findings: Information was available for 75 herds that reared their own young stock and who had used the Jonkos tool. The perceived cost of rearing young stock was only available for 36 herds. In the 75 herds, the average herd size was 100 dairy cows. The average calculated total cost of rearing a heifer was € 1, 790. The average perceived total cost of rearing a heifer (including labour and housing costs) was € 1, 030. Conclusion: Most Dutch farmers in the study underestimated the total cost of rearing. The Jonkos economic tool has the advantage that herd-specific information can be entered as input values. The output of the tool can improve the awareness of farmers about the total costs of rearing. This awareness can lead to a higher priority of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> and consequently to an improved quality of young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} Dutch Smart Dairy Farming {{project is}} to develop {{decision}} support models for operational support in farm management. This project started in 2012 and involves collaboration between several institutions and companies in the dairy chain. The project has three focus areas: animal health, fertility and feeding. The objective of the 'animal health' focus area is to optimise young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> {{as a basis for}} extending the life of cows. Lowering the annual replacement rate, which is currently about 30 %, has a significant positive impact on financial results. The main objectives of this young <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> project were to develop state-of-the-art tools which would help the farmer to optimise growth and development of young stock. Milk feeders and water drinkers combined with weighing scales were used for data collection at individual calf level. Daily data about milk intake, milk feeder visits, water intake and body weight were used to build detection models that generate alerts when measured values deviate and indicate a possible health problem. Body weight measurements were also used to determine the growth rate of a calf and to produce an alert if this deviated too much from a desired growth rate. All alerts were translated into messages with work instructions for the farmer. Weekly feedback from the farmer indicated that almost 60 % of the messages were correct. It is suggested that the large number of wrong messages (false positives) can be reduced by applying more advanced analysis techniques...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{neighbouring}} tell sites of Hârşova-tell and Borduşani-Popină in South-eastern Romania. Both sites are located 20 km apart, respectively on a errace on the right bank of the Danube River, and on the sland of Balta Ialomiţei. They delivered occupations from he Gumelniţa culture, dated to {{the second half of}} 5 th illennium cal BC. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions on Balta Ialomiţei depict a mosaic landscape of riparian forests, coppices, meadows and marshes, while the most elevated non-floodable riverbanks hold a strong forest component. These Chalcolithic communities subsisted on a diversified economy, focused to a large extent on aquatic resources but depending also heavily on <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> and agriculture. Evidence for agriculture was recovered at both sites, including cultivation of cereals and pulses, while the animal domestic economy involved cattle, caprines and pig husbandry. The main questions addressed in this study deal with <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> practices, more specifically the role of riverbanks resources in herding strategies and the extant to which the island of Balta Ialomiţei may have sustained domestic animal stocks. This was addressed through stable isotope analysis of animal skeleton remains. At both sites, results revealed an unexpectedly high contribution of C 4 plants to the diet of cattle and caprines, while no contribution was observed in wild herbivores. This is interpreted as reflecting local occurrence of ruderal C 4 plants, which would have been more abundant around the settlements as well as in cultivated fields. No significant contribution of pulses could be detected in the diet of cattle, caprines and pigs. Domestic pigs had a higher trophic status than their wild counterparts, possibly due to the feeding on aquatic resources largely exploited by the human communities. This would therefore suggest their maintenance by the village. These findings suggest a great proximity of domestic stocks to the settlements and corroborate the scheme described from archaeobotany, also describing a local agriculture. However, no direct relationship could be securely advanced between local <b>stock</b> <b>rearing</b> and agriculture. All together these results may help for a better definition of the occupation of territory by Gumelniţa communities and the scale of the pastoral system. Gumelniţa tell sites have been described as being part of larger pastoral systems including other places with complementary functions.
