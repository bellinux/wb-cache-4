25|$|Synthetic replicas {{can be made}} {{to avoid}} the use of {{original}} samples when they are not suitable or available for SEM examination due to methodological obstacles or legal issues. This technique is achieved in two steps: (1) a mold of the original surface is made using a <b>silicone-based</b> dental elastomer, and (2) a replica of the original surface is obtained by pouring a synthetic resin into the mold.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of human head lice infestation {{is a process}} for removing head lice parasites from human hair {{and it has been}} debated and studied for centuries. However, the number of cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s, reaching hundreds of millions annually. There is no product or method which assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment. However, {{there are a number of}} treatment modalities that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments, natural products, combs, shaving, hot air, and <b>silicone-based</b> lotions.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid <b>silicone-based</b> material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 – 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicone-based</b> {{lubricants}} {{are usually}} formulated {{with fewer than}} four ingredients and do not contain any water. Silicone lubricants offer a different feel from water-based personal lubricants. <b>Silicone-based</b> lubricants are not absorbed by skin or mucus membranes, and consequently last longer than water-based lubricants. Many different silicone lubricants are commercially available with varying quality and performance. Not all <b>silicone-based</b> lubricants are certified latex-safe, but <b>silicone-based</b> lubricants have not been shown to {{increase the risk of}} HIV transmission during anal intercourse, as some water-based lubes have.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicone-based</b> greases {{are cheaper}} than fluoroether-based greases. They are {{relatively}} inert and {{generally do not}} affect reactions, though reaction mixtures often get contaminated (detected through NMR near δ 0). <b>Silicone-based</b> greases are not easily removed with solvent, but they are removed efficiently by soaking in a base bath.|$|E
50|$|DOT 5 is a <b>silicone-based</b> {{brake fluid}} (contains at least 70% by {{weight of a}} diorgano polysiloxane).|$|E

50|$|Silicone-based: Uses {{silicone}} {{for longer}} lasting wear and without fading. <b>Silicone-based</b> can be thinned with {{certain types of}} formula additives, for lighter coverage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicone-based</b> {{lubricants}} are {{not usually}} recommended for use with sex toys or other products that are made from silicone because the formula may dissolve the surface making it sticky to the touch, and cause disintegration of the item over time. This damage may create {{a breeding ground for}} bacteria. In most cases a warning is listed on the product label. <b>Silicone-based</b> lubricant is also used in the manufacture of pre-lubricated condoms, due to its long-lasting properties and superior latex compatibility.|$|E
50|$|Waterless inks are {{heat-resistant}} and {{are used}} to keep <b>silicone-based</b> plates from showing toning in non-image areas. These inks are typically used on waterless Direct Imaging presses.|$|E
50|$|The {{adhesive}} {{applied to}} a tape is often a critical determining factor for a given masking situation. There are three thin types of adhesives (with many chemical variations of each): rubber-based, acrylic-based, and <b>silicone-based.</b> Rubber-based adhesives generally provide the greatest adhesion, but the lowest temperature resistance. Acrylic-based adhesives offer a wide temperature range, providing adhesion from sub-freezing temperatures up to 275-325 °F (about 150 °C). <b>Silicone-based</b> adhesives provide the highest temperature resistance, with some tapes (such as some polyimide films and glass cloth tapes) allowing for intermittent use up to 500 °F (260 °C).|$|E
5000|$|Aquapel is a rain {{repellent}} glass treatment created by PPG Industries. It is a competitor {{to the more}} widely known Rain-X product, but unlike Rain-X, is not a <b>silicone-based</b> compound. Aquapel Glass Treatment consists of fluorinated compounds which create a chemical bond with glass surfaces, causing water to bead up and roll off. Because of this chemical bond with glass, Aquapel is reported to last much longer than <b>silicone-based</b> {{rain repellent}}s. Aquapel has gained popularity in microfluidic based biochemistry, specifically the Drop-Seq method pioneered by the McCarroll lab at Harvard.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} barrier contraceptives, water or <b>silicone-based</b> {{lubricants}} are {{safe to use}} with any female condom. Oil {{should not be used}} with a female condom made of latex.|$|E
50|$|Textured {{coatings}} {{are applied}} by roller or trowel to an approximate thickness of 1.5 to 3 mm, {{and are usually}} acrylic or <b>silicone-based</b> for waterproofing and long term durability. They produce an even, flat-textured, finish.|$|E
5000|$|TMS is a {{contaminant}} in the atmospheres of spacecraft, {{where it}} {{arises from the}} degradation of <b>silicone-based</b> materials. Specifically, it is the volatile product from the hydrolysis of polydimethylsiloxane, which are generally terminated with trimethylsilyl groups: ...|$|E
50|$|Wet Lubricants is a {{brand of}} {{personal}} lubricants produced by Wet International, part of Trigg Laboratories in Las Vegas. The line includes a variety of water-based and <b>silicone-based</b> lubricants, as well as massage oils and shaving creams.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Grease {{is used to}} {{lubricate}} glass stopcocks and joints. Some laboratories fill them into syringes for easy application. Two typical examples: Left - Krytox, a fluoroether-based grease; Right - a <b>silicone-based</b> high vacuum grease by Dow Corning.|$|E
50|$|Silicone {{contamination}} of electrical switch contacts {{can lead to}} failures by causing an increase in contact resistance, often late {{in the life of}} the contact, well after any testing is completed. Use of <b>silicone-based</b> spray products in electronic devices during maintenance or repairs can cause later failures.|$|E
50|$|A later {{study has}} {{validated}} {{the findings of}} the Population Council for some water-based products' hyper-osmolality causing some human's cells damage, and better biocompatibility with low-osmolality water-based products and <b>silicone-based</b> products but failed to corroborate polyquaternium 15 having a role that binds HIV to rectal cells or increase HIV replication.|$|E
50|$|Using an {{appropriate}} durable, leak-proof, space-filling glue {{is one of}} the main challenges for the solution. Many local groups are experimenting with different glues to find the best solution for both costs and quality. It was usually found that <b>silicone-based</b> or polyurethane glues work best. The inventor, Alfredo Moser, used a polyester resin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicone-based</b> {{lubricants}} {{are often}} used by consumers in applications where other common consumer lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, would damage certain products, such as latex rubber condoms and gaskets on dry-suits. It {{can be used to}} lubricate fountain pen filling mechanisms and threads. It is used to seal and preserve O-rings in flashlights, plumbing, waterproof watches, and air rifles. Silicone grease is widely used to lubricate threads of water submersible flashlights used for diving and spearfishing. This grease improves water resistance of the flashlights and protects threads from wearing out. Silicone grease is used with waterproof devices as it has a very thick body and doesn't dissolve in water, as most spirits and other liquids would. <b>Silicone-based</b> lubricants are also commonly used for remote control hobbies, or for the insulation of CPU sockets when overclocking at very low temperatures.|$|E
50|$|It {{began when}} Geoff McHenry broke into Project Rising Spirit and rescued Angelo Mortalli, whose <b>silicone-based</b> blood gave him {{incredible}} strength and computer-like mental powers, a discovery that his creators {{found out the}} hard way when he killed them during his escape. Months later, the organization known as the H.A.R.D. Corps took an interest in Bloodshot’s activities.|$|E
5000|$|Manes are {{shortened}} and pulled, then combed to lay flat, {{and often}} are [...] "banded" [...] with small rubber bands. Horses are given basic show clipping of ears, legs, muzzle and bridle path, polish {{is often used}} on hooves, and <b>silicone-based</b> sprays on the hair coat, but excess glitz and oil on the horse is frowned upon.|$|E
5000|$|Waterproof: Can be used wet, {{such as in}} the shower. Although {{marketed as}} waterproof, most should not be submerged. The ones {{designed}} for underwater usage may be used in the swimming pool, bath or shower, or any other wet place. The waterproof vibrators are recommended to be used with a water compatible lubricant, such as <b>silicone-based</b> lubricant.|$|E
50|$|DOT 5.1, like DOT 3 and DOT 4, is a {{polyethylene}} glycol-based fluid (contrasted with DOT 5 {{which is}} <b>silicone-based).</b> Polyethylene glycol fluids are hygroscopic and will absorb {{water from the}} atmosphere, which is necessary to prevent sheer and undiluted water in the braking system, which is very corrosive, also water droplets can freeze in the pipes, thus blocking the system.|$|E
50|$|Halogen-free {{pentaerythritol}} esters {{are also}} environmentally friendly alternative to conventional electrical transformer fluids, being both readily biodegradable and non-hazardous in water. They advantageously replace polychlorobiphenyl (PCB), and even <b>silicone-based</b> or fluorinated hydrocarbons, as dielectric fluid in transformers. Their low volatility and high flash point {{give them an}} excellent resistance to ignition in case of major electrical failure and transformer rupture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicone-based</b> defoamers are {{polymers}} with silicon backbones. These {{might be}} delivered as an oil or a water based emulsion. The silicone compound {{consists of an}} hydrophobic silica dispersed in a silicone oil. Emulsifiers are added {{to ensure that the}} silicone spreads fast and well in the foaming medium. The silicone compound might also contain silicone glycols and other modified silicone fluids.|$|E
50|$|Many {{plastics}} {{are considerably}} sensitive to atomic oxygen and ionizing radiation. Coatings resistant to atomic oxygen {{are a common}} protection method, especially for plastics. <b>Silicone-based</b> paints and coatings are frequently employed, due to their excellent resistance to radiation and atomic oxygen. However, the silicone durability is somewhat limited, as the surface exposed to atomic oxygen is converted to silica which is brittle and tends to crack.|$|E
50|$|Oil-based {{lubricants}} can weaken latex {{and reduce}} the effectiveness of condoms, latex gloves, or dental dams as either forms of birth control or for protection from sexually transmitted diseases, so water- or <b>silicone-based</b> lubricants are often used instead. The use of an artificial lubricant can make sexual intercourse less painful for a woman, but {{does not address the}} underlying cause of the vaginal dryness itself.|$|E
50|$|The Phoenurse™ {{is made of}} a dumbbell-shaped {{polyurethane}} sheath and comes with an insertion tool, a water- or <b>silicone-based</b> lubricant, sanitary towels, and disposal bags. It is manufactured by the Tianjin Condombao Medical Polyurethane Tech. Co. Ltd. and is approved {{for sale in the}} European Economic Area. The Phoenurse female condom is also available in Brazil, Sri Lanka, China, Kenya, and Mexico. It has not been approved by the FDA.|$|E
50|$|The first mass-produced viscous {{couplings}} for {{a permanent}} 4WD off-road-capable vehicle was in the AMC Eagle, which was produced from 1980 to 1988 model years. The AMC Eagle's single-speed model 119 New Process central differential used a viscous coupling filled with a liquid <b>silicone-based</b> material. It linked {{the front and rear}} differentials for quiet and smooth transfer of power to the axle with the greatest traction, on wet or dry pavement.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic replicas {{can be made}} {{to avoid}} the use of {{original}} samples when they are not suitable or available for SEM examination due to methodological obstacles or legal issues. This technique is achieved in two steps: (1) a mold of the original surface is made using a <b>silicone-based</b> dental elastomer, and (2) a replica of the original surface is obtained by pouring a synthetic resin into the mold.|$|E
5000|$|Kipping {{undertook}} much of {{the pioneering}} work into the development of silicon polymers (silicones) at Nottingham. He pioneered {{the study of the}} organic compounds of silicon (organosilicon) and coined the term silicone. [...] His research formed the basis for the worldwide development of the synthetic rubber and <b>silicone-based</b> lubricant industries. [...] He also co-wrote, with Perkin, a standard textbook in organic chemistry (Organic Chemistry, Perkin and Kipping, 1899).|$|E
50|$|Jig-A-Loo is a <b>silicone-based</b> {{lubricant}} and water-repellent spray. The manufacturer {{states that}} it contains no oil, grease, wax, petroleum distillates or detergent and that it doesn't stain or smell after application. It is indicated for use on wood, metal, glass, rubber, leather, fabrics and most plastics. It {{has been used in}} the commercial and industrial sectors in Canada since 1958, and was launched in 1998 to the Canadian mass retail market, and globally in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Silanes, {{which are}} {{chemical}} compounds of hydrogen and silicon that are {{analogous to the}} alkane hydrocarbons, are highly reactive with water, and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating polymers of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as silicones, are much more stable. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>silicone-based</b> chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.|$|E
