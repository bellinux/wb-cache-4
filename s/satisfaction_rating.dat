5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E

25|$|La Trobe {{has lost}} funding disproporionately across its departments. For instance, the History Department at the {{university}} was once {{by far the largest}} of any institution in Australia; however, funding restrictions have led to a significant reduction in its size. Similarly, in 1999, the Music Department was closed due to funding cuts; in 2004 the Geology Department was excised even though it had the highest graduate <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> in the country. The university's African Research Institute, the only major African studies centre in Australasia, was closed at the end of 2006. In 2008, the university cut the Philosophy and Religious Studies Program at the Bendigo campus, the change resulted in the stream only being taught as a minor.|$|E

25|$|After the election, Rob Kerin vacated the {{position}} of opposition leader. The party selected conservative Iain Evans (son of former politician Stan Evans) for the role, with moderate Vickie Chapman (daughter of former politician Ted Chapman) as deputy leader. The only other contestant had been Isobel Redmond, who ran because she was concerned by some speculation that the Evans deal may have been stitched up by federal Liberal counterparts Christopher Pyne and Nick Minchin. Preferred premier ratings in July 2006 showed Rann on 71 percent with Evans on 15 percent. Only 27 percent of Liberal Party supporters saw Evans as the preferred premier. Continuing low support for the new Liberal leadership saw Martin Hamilton-Smith replace Evans in April 2007, however this move saw Liberal support decline further to a three-year low according to an Advertiser poll conducted {{a month after the}} leadership change. Over half of polling respondents were unable to name the leader of the Liberal Party. This contradicted Newspolls quarterly polling indicating the Rann Labor government slipping to a two-party preferred figure of 57 percent down four percent, with a preferred premier rating of 52 percent down 14 percent for Rann and a first-time rating of 21 percent for Martin Hamilton-Smith. Poll results also show Rann's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> was below 60 percent {{for the first time since}} coming to office at 58 percent, with Hamilton-Smith receiving a 33 percent satisfaction rate.|$|E
2500|$|The Social Weather Stations {{public opinion}} group has {{conducted}} quarterly surveys tracking the net <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> ("satisfied" [...] rating minus [...] "dissatisfied" [...] rating") of President Arroyo. She began her presidency {{in the first}} quarter of 2001 with a net <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> of +24. Her rating first dipped into the negative {{in the first quarter}} of 2003, making Arroyo the only president to achieve a negative net <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> in SWS opinion polling. Her rating rebounded well into the positive in 2004, in time for the presidential election where she won election to a new six-year term. However, net satisfaction sunk back into negative territory in the fourth quarter of 2004, and has remained negative since, dipping as low as −38 in the second quarter of 2008.

30|$|According to this figure, nine {{locomotives}} {{are needed}} for serving all trains. The total traveling time of this solution is 65.93 [*]h, total traveling distance is 3586.7 [*]km and the total waiting time is 6.15 [*]h. Also, the order of servicing is changed to maximize the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rate</b> of trains with high degree of priority. Considering the ten high class trains, the summation of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rate</b> for this solution is 30.7, while this rate for the solution of Figure[*] 2 is 27.1. So, the algorithm tries to change the servicing arrangement of trains to earn more value of satisfaction. For example, for train 7 which is considered as high priority train, the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rate</b> was 0.27 in previous solution and increased to 0.61 in the new solution by changing to arrival time of locomotive and servicing arrangement. Hence, the suggested algorithm for serving the trains tries to maximize the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rate</b> of high priority trains considering the other objectives, namely, traveling time, distance and waiting time.|$|R

However, it did little to revive the political fortunes of Cowen's government. After Fianna Fáil performed badly in the elections of 5 June 2009, losing half its European Parliament seats, Fine Gael tabled a motion of no confidence against Cowen on 9 June. He survived the vote by a thin margin of 85–79. Support for the government continued to fall: on 3 September 2009, an Irish Times /TNS mrbi poll, opinion poll reported that Cowen's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>rating</b> had dropped six points to 15 percent, with 77 percent of voters saying they were dissatisfied with the way he was doing his job.|$|E
