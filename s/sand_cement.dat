The show explored the emergence of machismo culture from themes of war heroism, exploitation, and violence, and machismo's relation to the seven deadly sins. Its central work, The Altarpiece, is an ink and wax print triptych in a gold leaf frame that visualizes war through its depiction of a World War II-era Berlin bunker. Civilians were forced to build the depicted bunker, which held private artworks from the Boros Collection as of the exhibition. ArtAsiaPacific wrote that the bullet holes {{on the walls of}} the bunker symbolized the wounds of Germany's involvement in the war. The magazine compared the work's format to that of early Christian art and considered the work [...] "an allegory for the political strategy of covering up the past for a more favorable present" [...] (revisionism). Tunisian Americans (2012) invoked the burial of American soldiers from the 1942 Tunisia Campaign, occupying foreign territory even in death. Grindballs, Hardballs, and Bangballs (2015) captured <b>sand,</b> <b>cement,</b> and pollen inside bubble wrap to reflect the masculine impulse to exploit the environment. A Short Story of Salt and Sun (2013), an ink and wax painting, comes from a print of a Tunisian resort's eroded wall to reflect on the inescapable erosion of man's creations and the decline of tourism in Tunisia. Artforum Stephanie Bailey wrote that Kaabi-Linke was both concise and sincere", with a [...] "severity" [...] offset by the [...] "lightness" [...] with which she navigates topical issues.

Comparing with uncemented <b>sands,</b> <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> have higher strength and stiffness, lower strains to yield and higher dilatancy. The stress-dilatancy relationship of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> is not the one-to-one type. Because of the differences in mechanical behavior between <b>cemented</b> and uncemented <b>sands,</b> a framework for describing the behavior of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> was established first, under which an extended Mohr-Coulomb model for <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> was proposed. Based on Rowe 2 ̆ 7 s relation, a stress-dilatancy relation for <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> was derived and then adopted as a flow rule in the proposed model. Both friction angle and cohesion in the model vary according to soil state and strain history. Upon satisfactorily simulating the triaxial test data on two artificially <b>cemented</b> <b>sands,</b> the proposed model was implemented into the CONPOINT program. Through numerical analysis, it has been found that, at low confining pressures, cementation greatly changes the stress and strain distributions in the plastic zone around the cavity; while at high confining pressures, the changes in stress and strain are not obvious as those at low confining pressure. ...|$|R

This thesis also wants to determine the characteristic of the <b>cement</b> <b>sand</b> brick with OPF fiber content in term of compressive strength, density and water absorption. From the results, it shows that the mix proportion 1 : 5 : 1 (OPF 1. 0) was the optimum ratio of OPF fiber content because it give the highest compressive strength which is 8. 000 Mpa at 28 days. The results indicate that the compressive strength of <b>cement</b> <b>sand</b> bricks with OPF fiber content is decreased as the OPF fiber content increased in the mix ratio. In addition, the mix proportion 1 : 5 : 1 (OPF 1. 0) gives the highest density result which is 1658. 08 kg/m 3 and the lowest water absorption result which is 9. 83 %. Generally, the properties of OPF <b>cement</b> <b>sand</b> brick are slightly lower that plain <b>cement</b> <b>sand</b> brick (OPF 0). The density of <b>cement</b> <b>sand</b> bricks with OPF fiber content was decreased with the increasing additional of OPF fiber content and it is decreasing linearly with the increasing of OPF fiber content.

It can be concluded that the usage of OPF has a great potential in the production of <b>cement</b> <b>sand</b> brick and also in the construction industry.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted on the static liquefaction behaviour of very loose lightly <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> Undrained and drained triaxial compression tests, one dimensional consolidation, high stress compression, and unconfined compression tests were performed on artificially prepared lightly cemented loose samples with cement-sand ratios of 2, 4 and 6 %. Additional tests were also conducted on uncemented samples prepared at the same initial void ratio as the cemented samples. Besides the influence of degree of cementation, the effects of void ratio and confining pressure on the liquefaction potential of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> were examined. The aim {{of this study is to}} make significant contribution to the understanding of static liquefaction failures in lightly <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> It is shown that cementation could increase the initial stiffness and yield strength of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> but its effect might decrease considerably after the peak strength because of destruction of the cementation bond. The response of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> at lower <b>cement</b> contents was very similar to the response of loose sands and behaviour approached the response of medium to dense sands with increase in the degree of cementation. It is also shown that degree of cementation has a significant influence on liquefaction resistance. Even though the presence of small amounts of cementation did not prevent liquefaction failure, the liquefaction resistance of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> generally increased for higher degrees of cementation. The consolidation, high stress compression and unconfined compression tests demonstrated the effect of cementation in increasing both the stiffness and strength of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> The unconfined compression strength increased approximately linearly with the increase in cement content.

40|$|Bond {{breakages}} provide all-important {{information for}} construction of a mechanistic picture of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the bond breakages in <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> utilizing acoustic emission technique. In the first part of this study, bond breakages in <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> subject to isotropic loading, unloading, and triaxial shearing are characterized by the measurement of acoustic emission (AE) using piezoelectric AE transducers. In all these different loading stages, the AE that is initiated by bond breakages can be detected. The AE rate demonstrates a great resemblance to the associated stress-strain response. In addition, the secant Young’s moduli decrease with an increase in the corresponding cumulative AE and the decreasing trend reflects the different stress-strain responses. These observations suggest an intimate relationship between the bond breakages and the mechanical response in <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> Bond breakages and the associated AE rates are mild in the beginning of shearing and then increase to initiate yielding and ultimately a local weakness, i. e., the formation of shear banding. After shear banding becomes mature, the bond breakage and the resulted AE rate render a distinct drop. If the shearing rate is slower, the test sample becomes stiffer and the measured AE is less when compared with a case subject to a higher shearing rate. Bond breakages are captured during the sampling process of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands,</b> i. e., under an unloading-reloading cycle, and the major portion of the bond-breakage events occur during reloading. These bond breakages eventually weaken the sample and lead to lower stiffness. In the second part of this study, a MEMS accelerometer, MEMSA (1 kHz – 3 kHz), and a commercially available piezoelectric AE transducer, PZT (125 kHz – 750 kHz), are used to capture the AE responses in uncemented and <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> during triaxial compression tests, with particular emphasis on the former one. The AE rates measured in the <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> by both sensors demonstrate a similar trend and show a great resemblance to the stress-strain response.
