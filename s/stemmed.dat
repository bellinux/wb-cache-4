40|$|<b>Stem</b> cell {{research}} and therapy are progressing these days dramatically. <b>Stem</b> cell therapy holds enormous treatment potential for many diseases which currently have no or limited therapeutic options. Unfortunately, this potential {{also comes with}} side-effects. In this review, {{the positive and negative}} effects of regulation of <b>stem</b> cells will be explained. <b>Stem</b> cells are undifferentiated cells which able to develop into many different cells of types in the body during early life and growth. There are five types of <b>stem</b> cells: embryonic <b>stem</b> cells, induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> cells, somatic <b>stem</b> cells, fetal <b>stem</b> cells and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells. <b>Stem</b> cell transplantation is one form of <b>stem</b> cell therapy, it comes with different techniques sourced, and those are autologous and allogeneic transplantation <b>stem</b> cells. In an autologous transplant, a patient's blood-forming <b>stem</b> cells are collected, meanwhile, in an allogeneic transplant, target cells are replaced with new <b>stem</b> cells obtained from a donor or donated umbilical cord blood. Its abilities to maintain the phenotype, self-renewing and differentiate itself into specialized cells, give rise to <b>stem</b> cell as an innovation for the treatment of various diseases.

Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
