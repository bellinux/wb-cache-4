5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to less {{expensive}} vessels to modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the same basic design.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. Director Stephen Frears was unfamiliar with his previous work and had to be convinced by other production staff to cast him.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid {{invasion}} of Asia Minor in 782 {{was one of}} the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire. The invasion was launched as a display of Abbasid military might {{in the aftermath of a}} series of Byzantine successes. Commanded by the Abbasid heir-apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there. As Harun did not intend to assault Constantinople and lacked ships to do <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} his {{flagship}} and transfer to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrians quickly inflicted serious damage on Re d'Italia and Palestro, eventually sinking both ships. After Palestro withdrew, the Austrian ironclads turned their attention to the 3rd Division, including Re di Portogallo.|$|E

He briefly attempted to engage the Austrian wooden ships in the rear, but was driven off by heavy fire from three steam frigates.|$|E
5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1458, Alfonso V of Aragon, Skanderbeg's most {{important}} and helpful ally after the stipulation of the Treaty of Gaeta, died. In 1448, as gesture of friendship with Alfonso, Skanderbeg sent a detachment of Albanian troops commanded by General Demetrios Reres to Crotone to quell a rebellion against Alfonso. The next year, many of these men were allowed to settle four villages in Sicily which Alfonso controlled. Upon hearing of his ally's death, Skanderbeg sent emissaries to the new King of Naples, Ferdinand I, to give condolence for his father's death, but also to congratulate him on his accession to the throne of Naples. The succession was not without turbulence, however: René d'Anjou laid claim to the throne since his family had controlled Naples before Aragon had taken control of it, and also because Ferdinand was Alfonso's illegitimate son. The Southern Italian nobility, many of Angevin background, supported René d'Anjou over the Aragonese Ferdinand. Among them was Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini, the Prince of Taranto, and Jacopo Piccinino, a famed condottieri who had been invited by the Angevins. Francisco Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was wary of a French presence in Italy, sided with Ferdinand and sent his nephew, Alessandro Sforza, to command his army in southern Italy. Pope Calixtus, a Spaniard who wished to see his compatriot in control of Naples, was {{in no position to}} help the weak Ferdinand, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to Skanderbeg for help. However, by that time, Piccinino and his men had conquered all of southern Italy except Naples, Capua, Aversa, Gaeta, Troia, and Barletta, where Ferdinand was besieged.|$|E

As a fourteen-year-old goalkeeper on trial at Queen's Park Rangers, Gatting {{was told that he}} was too short and fat to make the grade. Gatting also went on an unfrutiful trial with fellow Londoners Arsenal. That being <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to cricket for his sporting future and QPR signed the other trialist that day, Phil Parkes.|$|E
25|$|After {{making a}} name for himself, he was scouted by Ajax. They invited the 15-year-old Benayoun and his family to the Netherlands. By his 16th birthday, he was the Ajax youth team's highest scorer and best player, and Ajax duly offered Benayoun a {{four-year}} professional contract. However, Benayoun {{and his family had}} not settled very well in Amsterdam, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his back on the contract and returned to Israel after just eight months.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few days}} in Tangier, Ibn Battuta set out for a trip to the Muslim-controlled {{territory}} of al-Andalus on the Iberian Peninsula. King Alfonso XI of Castile and León had threatened to attack Gibraltar, so in 1350, Ibn Battuta joined a group of Muslims leaving Tangier with the intention of defending the port. By the time he arrived, the Black Death had killed Alfonso and the threat of invasion had receded, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the trip into a sight-seeing tour, travelling through Valencia and ending up in Granada.|$|E
25|$|With {{his novels}} {{providing}} scant income, Thompson turned to {{other forms of}} writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows Mackenzie's Raiders (1959), Cain's Hundred (1961) and Convoy (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the TV series Ironside (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films The Undefeated (1969) and Nothing But a Man (1970).|$|E

25|$|Diagnosed with {{abdominal}} {{cancer in}} 1941, Matisse underwent surgery {{that left him}} chair and bed bound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to {{a new type of}} medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with gouache by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity—an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.|$|E
25|$|When McGowan's men {{finally gave}} way, Cooke's brigades {{collapsed}} {{from east to}} west although Cooke's own brigade was farthest {{from the end of the}} line and withdrew in better order than the other survivors who managed to escape. The Confederates who did not become casualties or prisoners retreated toward the Appomattox River, moving mostly in disorder toward Amelia Court House. The South Side Railroad, the final Confederate supply line to Petersburg, had been permanently severed by the Union Army. Most of Miles's men were too exhausted to pursue the Confederate fugitives. Besides, Miles understood that Sheridan had ordered his men to drive the enemy toward Petersburg, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his division in that direction and allowed them to rest.|$|E
25|$|When Blücher {{heard about}} Olsufiev's disaster, he ordered Kaptzevich and Kleist {{to turn around}} and make a night march back to Vertus. Sacken, who had marched west to Trilport, was ordered to return to Montmirail. Yorck was {{requested}} to meet Sacken near Montmirail while holding open an escape route over the Marne at Château-Thierry. After the battle, Napoleon found himself squarely {{in the middle of the}} overextended Army of Silesia. If he advanced to the east, he would merely push the corps of Kaptzevich and Kleist back. A move to the west held the possibility of trapping and destroying the forces under Sacken and Yorck, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> west. Napoleon ordered Marmont with Lagrange's division and the I Cavalry Corps to hold Étoges and keep Blücher under observation. At 7:00 pm the emperor directed Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two cavalry divisions to occupy Montmirail. They were to be joined there in the morning by Ricard's division and the divisions under Ney and Mortier. The Battle of Montmirail was fought the next day against Sacken and Yorck.|$|E

25|$|Their illicit trading {{networks}} disrupted, {{the overseas}} traders banded together against the perceived intensification of the Ming anti-pirate campaign. Wang Zhi {{emerged as the}} leader of the most prominent of these armed bands after Xu Dong exited the scene. The Xu brothers had placed Wang Zhi in charge of their fleets, finances, and foreign contacts, so Wang did not have much trouble taking over the whole syndicate. He settled on the Gotō Islands of Japan after the Ming made him an outlaw. There he called himself the King of Hui (徽王) and established good relations not only with the local daimyo Matsura Takanobu, but also with regional hegemons like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōuchi Yoshitaka. Despite his great power, Wang Zhi initially sought to appease the Ming government in hope of getting the maritime prohibitions relaxed, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the rival pirate leaders that he captured over to the authorities. Instead, the Ming authorities tightened the restrictions in 1551, banning even fishing boats from going out to sea. Indignant, Wang Zhi set his pirate fleets upon the Chinese coast.|$|E
25|$|Giorgio Petrosyan {{started his}} career as a -54kg/119lb bantamweight at the age of sixteen and {{defeated}} a local Italian fighter in his February 2002 debut, breaking his toes while doing <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> professional shortly after and would compete almost exclusively under Muay Thai rules for the next five years. In his first title fight on November 9, 2003, he scored a third round knockout over Gionata Zarbo to be crowned the Muay Thai Association (MTA) Italian national champion. Steadily moving up in weight and competition level, he captured the MTA European -65kg/143lb Championship by outpointing Fabio Pinca in 2004 before making his only successful defence of the belt in February 2005 with another points win over Shemsi Beqiri in his home town of Gorizia. He fought to a draw with three-time Lumpinee Stadium champion Pinsinchai in Bologna, Italy on April 10, 2005 but soon returned to the win column and defeated Olivier Tchétché by second round technical knockout in a WMC Intercontinental Welterweight (-66.7kg/147lb) Championship match in Nova Gorica, Slovenia on June 25, 2005.|$|E
25|$|Wei Yan and Fei Yi {{then took}} {{command of the}} troops left behind. Fei Yi also wrote a letter, which was signed by both of them and would be read out to all the officers. He offered {{to return to the}} main camp and help Wei Yan explain the {{situation}} to Yang Yi. He also said that Yang Yi was a civil official who was less experienced in handling military affairs, so Wei Yan stood a chance of becoming the new commander. Wei Yan then let Fei Yi leave, but he immediately regretted his decision and went after Fei Yi, but could not catch up with him in time. He then sent his subordinate to meet Yang Yi and the others, but was shocked to discover that the various encampments were preparing to retreat in accordance with Zhuge Liang's final orders. Wei Yan wanted to continue the campaign against Cao Wei even though Zhuge Liang had died, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> furious when he heard of the retreat. He intended to block the Shu forces from retreating, so he led his force towards the south – ahead of the main army under Yang Yi's command – and sealed the return route by destroying the gallery roads leading back to Shu.|$|E
