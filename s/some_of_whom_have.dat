5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
5|$|Rivalries were renewed in 1999–2000 {{following}} Manchester City's promotion back to {{the second}} tier. Stockport County beat Manchester City at Maine Road {{for the first time}} in history (1999–2000) thanks to goals from former City youngster Alan Bailey and County legend Tony Dinning. Manchester City were famously defeated once more by Stockport County in 2001–02, when 2 late goals from John Hardiker handed bottom of the table Stockport victory, and in the process City were prevented from gaining 100 points in their quest for the Division One title. Stockport County and Manchester City met six times between 1997 and 2002, with Stockport County winning three times, losing once and drawing twice. The defeats suffered at the hands of County clearly touched a raw nerve with many Manchester City supporters, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> celebrated County's downfall on the 'bluemoon' forum. The rivalry with City is made all the more complex by the fact that Stockport is a hotbed for Manchester City support.|$|E

The authors found that galactose metabolites were significantly elevated in the infants drinking milk over those drinking soy.

25|$|Additionally, {{there are}} around 60,000 non-Jewish African {{immigrants}} in Israel, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> sought asylum.

25|$|St. Bartholomew's {{is one of}} only a few {{state schools}} to {{participate}} in the Combined Cadet Force (a programme sponsored by the Ministry of Defence), with around 200 cadets between the ages of 14 and 18 taking part in weekly training sessions, activities, and residential trips. It {{is also one of the}} few state schools to play the sport of lacrosse. The school has produced many talented players, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> gone on to represent England and Wales.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Dolf and Wenda {{were asked}} by a {{relative}} to guide a safari to Kenya and Tanzania. This became the start of an annual event that would last until 1990. The trips were soon organized by a travel agency {{and a group of}} regularly participating people, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> become intimate friends of the guiding couple. Each trip was carefully prepared, with a bibliography sent to the participants. Afterwards {{a list of all the}} observed mammals and birds was distributed additionally.|$|E

25|$|The {{house has}} been through several {{different}} owners since that subdivision, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> made some changes. In 1940 the porches were removed, replaced with a patio in the rear and the millstone in front, and a large entryway cut inside between the east rooms on the first floor. Later owners have respected the house {{as part of the}} county's history; however sometime between the Register listing and 2009 the portions of the chimneys originally exposed on the exterior's first story have been covered in clapboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislation}} {{also includes}} controversial changes in teacher evaluations, tenure and pensions. Hundreds of teachers, administrators {{and public education}} supporters have protested against the legislation at the capital of Louisiana, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> canceled classes to attend demonstrations. Many participants have begun circulating petitions to recall Jindal and Republican House Speaker Chuck Kleckley. In April 2012, a Louisiana Public Broadcasting program examined possible conflicts between aspects of the Jindal education reform plan and the federal desegregation orders still in place {{in many parts of}} Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Jíbaro music came to {{be marketed}} on {{commercial}} recordings in the twentieth century, and singer-poets like Ramito (Flor Morales Ramos, 1915–90) are well documented. However, jíbaros themselves were becoming an endangered species, as agribusiness and urbanization have drastically reduced the numbers of small farmers on the island. Many jíbaro songs dealt accordingly with the vicissitudes of migration to New York. Jíbaro music has in general declined accordingly, although it retains its place in local culture, especially around Christmas time and special social gatherings, {{and there are many}} cuatro players, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> cultivated prodigious virtuosity.|$|E

25|$|In 1961 Rotherham United {{played in}} the first League Cup Final, when they lost 3–2 to Aston Villa in two legs, they won the first 2–0, but lost the second 3–0. Yorkshire clubs compete in the English {{football}} league system. While they {{are by no means}} the most dominant footballing county, Yorkshire has produced several national league winners, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> won the title more than once, including Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United.

25|$|The zero moment point (ZMP) is the {{algorithm}} used by robots such as Honda's ASIMO. The robot's onboard computer {{tries to keep}} the total inertial forces (the combination of Earth's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor reaction force (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no moment (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over). However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory. ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, WISH-TV {{became the}} first {{television}} station in the market to provide extensive live coverage of a major local news event, when it covered the deadly explosion at the Fairgrounds Coliseum. WISH-TV's newscasts were the highest-rated in the Indianapolis market from the mid-1980s until WTHR overtook it for the #1 position in 2002. The station's ratings success was largely attributed to the longevity of most of its news staff, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> been at the station for over 20 years. Mike Ahern was the station's main weeknight news anchor {{as well as the}} de facto face of its newsroom for more than 30 years (the longest tenure of anyone in Indianapolis television history); he joined channel 8 as a reporter in 1967 and was promoted to lead anchor in 1974, where he remained until his retirement from the anchor chair on December 1, 2004 (Ahern later hosted sister station WNDY's now-cancelled interview program One on One). Debby Knox joined Ahern as co-anchor on the weeknight newscasts in 1980 and remained with the station until she retired on November 26, 2013. Stan Wood served as the station's main weather forecaster from the 1960s until 1991, while Patty Spitler served as anchor of the noon newscast and entertainment reporter from 1982 to 2004. Lee Giles, who left the station in 2004, was one of the longest-tenured news directors in local broadcasting.|$|E

As with any other prolonged contact with humans, instinct loss soon sets in, so Lindesfarne must of necessity limit her participation to only one day per week (usually on Sundays).
