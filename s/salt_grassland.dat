40|$|The {{saltmarsh}} {{is a type}} of wetland. Wetlands {{are classified}} {{on the basis of their}} hydrology, vegetation and substrate. One classification system proposed by Cowardin et al., (1979) and used by the USFWS classifies wetlands into five ecological systems. Estuarine emergents fall into two of these systems, the Estuarine and Marine. The Estuarine wetland is described as tidal wetlands in low-wave-energy environments, where the salinity is greater than 0. 5 parts per thousand (ppt) and is variable owing to evaporation and the mixing of seawater and freshwater. Marine wetlands are described as tidal wetlands that are exposed to waves and currents of the open ocean and have a salinity of greater than 30 ppt. A saltmarsh, as defined by Beeflink (1977), is a “natural or semi-natural <b>salt</b> tolerant <b>grassland</b> and dwarf brushwood on the alluvial sediments bordering saline water bodies whose water level fluctuates either tidal or nontidally”. The flora comprise of erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes dominated by salttolerant perennial plants (Cowardin et al. 1979). Structure and function of a saltmarsh are influenced by tide, salinity, nutrients and temperature. The saltmarsh can be a stressful environment to plants and animals, with rapid changes occurring in these abiotic variables (Gosselink 1980; Gosselink et al. 1974).

This paper provides a first estimate of C stores and CO 2 efflux within the <b>salt</b> pan, <b>grassland</b> and woodland of Ntwetwe Pan in the Makgadikgadi Basin, Botswana. C fluxes and stores associated with cyanobacteria-salt crusts are also determined.

Most of the C is found as carbonate, with organic C comprising 4. 6 - 10 % of total C. CO 2 efflux increased with temperature and also increased for a few hours after flooding of the pan surface. Crusts were a small net contributor to CO 2 efflux in the dry season but could be a net CO 2 sink in the wet season. The biogeochemistry of the sediment is likely to facilitate rapid conversion of organic C from aquatic organisms, biological crusts and algal mats into inorganic carbonates.

40|$|Background: Plants play {{a pivotal}} role in soil stabilization, with {{above-ground}} vegetation and roots combining to physically protect soil against erosion. It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled. Question: We hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity. Methods: We tested this hypothesis in <b>salt</b> marsh <b>grasslands,</b> dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e. g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30 -cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume. Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness (R 2 = 0. 55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion-prone (R 2 = 0. 44) than erosion-resistant (R 2 = 0. 18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species·m− 2, the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly (R 2 = 0. 92). Plant species richness {{was a significant predictor of}} root biomass (R 2 = 0. 22). Step-wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{used the}} stable isotope ratios ¹⁵N/¹⁴N and ¹³C/¹²C to clarify the spatial and {{temporal}} patterns of small mammal derpredation by wide-ranging raptors across a <b>salt</b> marsh and <b>grassland</b> landscape. To determine whether clear isotope signals existed for the two adjoining habitats, and if these differences could allow for {{an assessment of the}} seasonal habitat origins of depredated rodents, primarily the vole, Microtus californicus, we investigated the nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios for three sets of data. First, to establish potential differences in isotope signatures between the two habitats, we collected plant species consumed by the vole. Second, we analyzed bone collagen from voles originating from known locations along a gradient from marsh to grassland. Finally, the signatures of these unpredated voles were then used to categorize isotope values of vole remains found in the pellets of their raptor predators. Results indicated that mean δ 15 N and δ 13 C were both higher in marsh plants than in grassland species. Although both isotopes showed a trophic level increase from plant to bone collagen, nitrogen provided the more informative signature when attempting to distinguish the habitat origins of voles. We found that the δ 15 N values of unpredated voles were significantly related to the distance of the specimen along the marsh-grassland interface, with higher values in the marsh habitat. Analysis of the depredated bones found in raptor pellets indicated that a greater percentage of voles originated in grassland during the spring/summer season (88 %), as compared with the fall/winter period (60 %). Finally, we compared this pattern of habitat and season-specific predation to another measure of predation risk, the relative encounter rates of raptors foraging for voles, and found that the two estimates were similar except during the winter season. This study demonstrates the usefulness of stable isotope analysis for elucidating seasonal patterns of predation across a complex landscape...|$|R
40|$|Three {{adjacent}} {{areas in}} the Urdaibai Estuary (NW Spain) comprising a reclaimed salt marsh, a natural salt marsh and a regenerated salt marsh were sampled in order to study edaphic processes and changes in organic matter (OM) composition related to reclamation and regeneration of soils and sediments in estuarine environments. For this, a general analytical description of the soil and sediment profiles was carried out and the OM was characterized using solid state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The reclaimed salt marsh displayed very different characteristics from the natural salt marsh throughout the whole profile, indicating an important degree of change in soil quality and, particularly, in OM composition caused by the reclamation. At this reclaimed site, characterized by oxic conditions {{and a lack of}} tidal influence, transformation of the former <b>salt</b> marsh to <b>grassland</b> resulted in input of OM richer in carbohydrates and with a lower contribution of aromatic compounds than the OM in the salt marsh soils. On the other hand, the edaphic characteristics of the regenerated marsh were {{similar to those of the}} natural marsh and the vegetation cover was the same. However, the natural marsh accumulated twice the amount of organic carbon at the surface as the regenerated marsh. Furthermore, the natural marsh contained more aromatic material, as detected with NMR and the Py-GC/MS results indicated a greater presence of microbial material. These differences indicate that the regenerated marsh has not completely recovered its natural characteristics, despite the long period (more than 40 y) since the beginning of the regeneration process. We propose the composition of soil OM as a suitable long term indicator of reclamation and regeneration processes in the salt marsh environments.
