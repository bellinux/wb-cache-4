40|$|Abstract Background Many {{proposed}} <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> can efficiently compare protein sequence {{to further}} infer protein structure, function and evolutionary information. They {{share the same}} idea of using k -word frequencies of protein sequences. Given a protein sequence, the information on its related protein sequences hasn't been used for protein sequence comparison until now. This paper proposed a scheme to construct protein 'sequence space' which was associated with protein sequences related to the given protein, and the performances of <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> were compared when they explored the information on protein 'sequence space' or not. This paper also presented two <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> for protein: gre. k (generalized relative entropy) and gsm. k (gapped similarity measure). Results We tested <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> based on protein 'sequence space' or not with three data sets. This not only offers the systematic and quantitative experimental assessment of these <b>statistical</b> <b>measures,</b> but also naturally complements the available comparison of <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> based on protein sequence. Moreover, we compared our <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> with alignment-based measures and the existing <b>statistical</b> <b>measures.</b> The experiments were grouped into two sets. The first one, performed via ROC (Receiver Operating Curve) analysis, aims at assessing the intrinsic ability of the <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> to discriminate and classify protein sequences. The second set of the experiments aims at assessing how well our measure does in phylogenetic analysis. Based on the experiments, several conclusions can be drawn and, from them, novel valuable guidelines {{for the use of}} protein 'sequence space' and <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> were obtained. Conclusion Alignment-based measures have a clear advantage when the data is high redundant. The more efficient <b>statistical</b> <b>measure</b> is the novel gsm. k introduced by this article, the cos. k followed. When the data becomes less redundant, gre. k proposed by us achieves a better performance, but all the other measures perform poorly on classification tasks. Almost all the <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> achieve improvement by exploring the information on 'sequence space' as word's length increases, especially for less redundant data. The reasonable results of phylogenetic analysis confirm that Gdis. k based on 'sequence space' is a reliable measure for phylogenetic analysis. In summary, our quantitative analysis verifies that exploring the information on 'sequence space' is a promising way to improve the abilities of <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> for protein comparison. </p...|$|R

The use of large number of bosons renders additional studies of chaos possible, that can provide a direct comparison with similar classical studies of chaos. We intend to provide complete quantum chaotic dynamics at zero angular momentum {{in the vicinity of the}} arc of regularity and link the results of the study of chaos using <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> with those of the study of chaos using classical <b>measures.</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>measures</b> of chaos are applied on the spectrum and the transition intensities of 0 + states in the framework of the interacting boson model. The energy dependence of chaos is provided for the first time using <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> of chaos. The position of the arc of regularity was also found to be stable in the limit of large boson numbers. The results of the study of chaos using <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> are consistent with previous studies using classical measures of chaos, as well as with studies using <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> of chaos, but for small number of bosons and states with angular momentum greater than 2.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [10771175, 10471114]The {{question}} of establishing <b>measure</b> theory for <b>statistical</b> convergence {{has been moving}} closer to center stage, since a kind of reasonable theory is not only fundamental for unifying various kinds of statistical convergence, but also a bridge linking the studies of <b>statistical</b> convergence across <b>measure</b> theory, integration theory, probability and statistics. For this reason, this paper, in terms of subdifferential, first shows a representation theorem for all finitely additive probability measures defined on the σ-algebra A of all subsets of N, and proves that every such measure can be uniquely decomposed into a convex combination of a countably additive probability <b>measure</b> and a <b>statistical</b> <b>measure</b> (i. e. a finitely additive probability measure μ with μ(k) = 0 for all singletons {k}). This paper also shows that classical <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> have many nice properties, such as: The set S of all such measures endowed with the topology of point-wise convergence on A forms a compact convex Hausdorff space; every classical <b>statistical</b> <b>measure</b> is of continuity type (hence, atomless), and every specific class of <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> fits a complementation minimax rule for every subset in N.

Segmentation with 40 P was especially robust in first-order <b>statistical</b> <b>measures,</b> for which it showed a median ICC of 0.94 compared with 0.86 for FH and 0.87 for FLAB. The reason for the higher reproducibility of 40 P in first-order <b>statistical</b> <b>measures</b> is probably partly due to the inherent robustness of first-order <b>statistical</b> <b>measures,</b> as noted by others in CT [20] and PET studies [4, 7]. Furthermore, since 40 P depends mainly on inclusion of the most active voxel in the region, and the calculation of the remaining volume is done automatically, it will not differ significantly between operators.|$|R

However, recent thorough investigation by Pinnow and Helfrich revealed significance of measure factors for the partition sum.

In order to examine this remarkable idea, we performed extensive ab initio simulations for a fluid membrane.
