Juss), nutmeg (Monodora myristica (Gaertn.) Dunal, physic-nut (Jatropha curcas. L.), castor-oil (Ricinus communis L.), synthetic insecticide: monocrotophos and the untreated check. The monocrotophos was applied at 400 g a. i. /ha. The treatments were applied at the tillering stage and at the panicle initiation stage. The {{results showed that the}} monocrotophos and a number of the plant seed kernel extract treatments significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the % deadhearts and % whiteheads caused by <b>stem</b> <b>borers.</b> The yield of the rice culture in the two years trials were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in monocrotophos treated plants and in a number of the plants extracts treated plants than the control. Comparatively, neem seed and physic-nut seed kernel extracts were superior to the other plant extracts in controlling <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> and influencing yields of the crop. The results suggest, that aqueous and acetone extracts of neem seed kernel and physic nut seed kernel can be used by upland rice farmers to control <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> and obtain higher crop yields.

Varieties Dent and Sakatifu had more windows, deadhearts, exit holes, tunnels and longer tunnel lengths than varieties Flint and Sammaz 14. The Furadan treatment reduced the borers infestation and increased the yield of the QPM varieties. Varieties Sakatifu and Dent were found to be more susceptible with tunnel lengths of 8. 17 and 5. 53 cm respectively.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of carbofuran in controlling lowland rice <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in traditional farming systems was studied {{by looking at}} {{its impact on the}} whole rice agroecosystem. Levels of infestation, rice yield, damage to the plant, parasitism rates, and distribution of damage were compared after medium, high, and no (control)  dosages were applied to lowland rice fields near Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Although larvae were found to be more numerous in control plots, the damage attributable to them was not significantly different. Their spatial distribution, however, differed radically. The authors concluded that carbofuran might affect pest populations at two different levels: by discouraging or preventing rice <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> from laying their eggs on rice, and by delaying or eliminating natural enemies attacks on rice <b>stem</b> <b>borers.</b> Both levels were determined by comparing the distribution of damage in treated fields with untreated fields. In the treated fields, distributions of larvae seemed to reflect initial grouping of eggs, producing a random distribution of groups, while in the control fields larvae were found in random distribution of individuals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Maize is {{a staple}} food crop for most {{households}} in Nigeria and is grown {{in almost all}} agroecological zones. Unfortunately maize yield is too low {{to keep pace with}} the rate of population growth, leading to serious food insecurity and poverty. The low yield is associated with incidences of <b>stem</b> <b>borers.</b> The impact of intercropping maize with bambara groundnut in the management of African maize stalk borer, (Busseola fusca, Fuller Lepidoptera:Noctuidae) were assessed in Nigeria during 2009 / 2010 farming seasons. The results showed that maize plots intercropped with bamabara groundnut significantly reduced the larval densities, number of stem bored and percentage dead heart compared to maize monocrop in both seasons respectively. Buildups of natural enemies of the borer were observed to be higher in plots that were intercropped than in the control/sole and contributed in the reduction of <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> infestations. Equally, the total grain yields were significantly higher under plots that were intercropped compare to plots under monocrop. Intercropping system has the additional advantage of higher land productivity than the monocrop. In conclusion intercropping maize with bambara groundnut improved; biodiversity of the ecosystem, <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> management and increased maize yield...|$|R

40|$|Six {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the savanna and forest areas of Côte d'Ivoire to study the influence of <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> on maize crop yield components and production. Statistical models showed {{the effect of the}} oldest preimaginal instars of 2 <b>stem</b> <b>borers,</b> #Eldana saccharina$ Walker (#Pyralidae$) and #Busseola fusca$ (Fuller) (#Noctuidae$). Plant destruction was mainly caused by early attack of #B. fusca$. Attack by both borers on or about the 60 th d alter emergence induced plant sterility. <b>Stem</b> <b>borers</b> had no direct effect on number of grains per cob-carrying plant : the level of this yield component was set according {{to the level of the}} previously determined components through a compensation phenomenon. The last yield component, average weight of grain, decreased with attack by #E. saccharina$ occurring on or about the 80 th d after emergence. Effects of borer aggregation, maize variety, and maize streak virus incidence were studied. The statistical model of crop loss, which explains 81. 7 % of the variation in yield, was validated from the results of 3 trials that were not included in the regression analysis. It enables one to estimate accurately crop losses in most of Côte d'Ivoire with only 2 samplings during the growing season, on the 40 th and 80 th d after emergence. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
