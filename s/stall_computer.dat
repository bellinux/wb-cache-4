40|$|A Navier-Stokes problem solver, {{developed}} by L. N. Sankar, {{is modified to}} provide dynamic, interactive graphical presentations of predicted flow field solutions about a NACA- 0012 airfoil section oscillating in pitch, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of dynamic graphics applications {{in the study of}} complex, unsteady flows. Flow field solutions in the form of pressure coefficient and stream function contour plots about an airfoil experiencing dynamic stall are plotted utilizing an IRIS 3000 -series workstation and Graphical Animation System (GAS) software, {{developed by}} Sterling Software for NASA. These full cycle solutions in conjunction with dynamic surface pressure distribution plots and integrated lift, pitching moment and full cycle solutions, in conjunction with dynamic surface pressure distribution plots and integrated lift, pitching moment and drag coefficient data, are compared to existing experimental data in order to provide an indication of the validity of the code's far-field solution. Full procedural documentation is maintained in order to provide an efficient analysis tool for use in future oscillating airfoil studies planned by the NASA-Ames Fluid Mechanics Laboratory and the Naval Postgraduate School Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

50|$|Whenever feasible, {{registers}} {{and other}} circuits appear in duplicate. Their contents are continuously compared so that inconsistencies between {{the data in}} the identical units give an indication of faulty operation, and <b>stall</b> the <b>computer.</b> At this point, the instruction may be repeated. The pulse code used in the Univac System is so designed that all characters contain an odd number of pulses. At several strategic points within Univac, every character is checked for an odd number of pulses. An indication is given whenever an even number of pulses is detected, and the <b>computer</b> <b>stalls.</b> Other types of checking circuits cause Univac to stall when other types of errors occur.|$|R

The computer receives input from the AOA sensors {{and a variety of other}} flight systems.

40|$|Operating {{in natural}} wind field, the {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines {{are subject to}} cyclical variation of aerodynamic loads. This cyclical loads fluctuation {{is a result of}} two aerodynamic phenomenon: the first one is the advancing and retreating blade effect; the second one is related to the cyclical variation of induced velocity at the rotor plane. In these operating conditions, the correct prediction of this load variation is necessary to predict some important parameters linked to the fatigue and stability of free yawing turbines. The main objective of the present study is the evaluation of the azimuthal variation of normal force at different radial positions. To model the problem, the blade element momentum theory is used and wind turbine is supposed operate in yaw conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients are corrected using Chaviaropoulos and Hansen model {{to take into account the}} phenomenon of <b>stall</b> delay. A <b>computer</b> code was developed to obtain the numerical values and results are compared with measurements performed in the NASA Ames wind tunnel. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of radiation detector materials, capable of operating at room temperature, has been studied. The advantage of such materials {{is that they}} {{do not need to be}} cooled to reduce thermally generated leakage currents. Therefore, systems utilising these detectors can be smaller and more portable than ones containing HpGe and Si(Li) detectors which need to be cooled using liquid nitrogen to reduce leakage current. Three materials, silicon, cadmium telluride and mercuric iodide, have been investigated. The silicon photodiode showed very good energy resolution down to photon energies of 13. 4 keV, but its low detection efficiency restricts its use to energies below 200 keV for direct detection. Cadmium telluride produced energy spectra with worse energy resolution, due mainly to charge collection, leakage current and fabrication. But, cadmium telluride was able to produce spectra up to 661. 6 keV with reasonable efficiency and resolution. Mercuric iodide produced spectra with energy resolution on a par with the silicon photodiode but with a higher detection efficiency. Mercuric iodide crystals have been produced at Surrey using the polymer assisted transport growth method. A large crystal with dimensions exceeding 1 cm 3 has also been produced. Due to problems with {{application of}} electrical contacts no useful spectra were obtained with these devices. The importance of the polymer in the starting material was investigated. The addition of polyethylene was found to favour the growth of platelets. The size of the platelets was also found to increase with increasing proportion of polymer in the <b>stalling</b> mix. A <b>computer</b> simulation enabling the performance of semiconductor radiation detector materials to be predicted is also presented. The model follows processes from photon interactions in the detector through to charge collection. Energy spectra may be produced from the output of this model and energy resolution and detection efficiency may be analysed as a function of detector thickness, applied bias and photon energy. This model could be used to optimise performance of radiation detectors...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950 s Martins Bank was {{the largest}} British {{clearing}} bank not to have its head office in the country’s financial capital, London. Instead its affairs were directed from Liverpool, some 200 miles away in the North West of England. At a time when significant regional differences still existed between banks, Liverpool and the surrounding region were widely considered Martins’ strongholds. However it was in London, where Martins could trace its origins back to 1563 and the sign of the grasshopper in Lombard Street, that Martins had been working closely with British computer manufacturer Ferranti to seek a computerised solution to a growing crisis in banking: a shortage of space and staff. In response to this crisis, in January 1960, Martins became the first British bank to perform its branch bookkeeping operations on a computer when it successfully ran a current account programme on a bureau machine at Ferranti’s London computer centre. Buoyed by its initial success Martins pressed on ahead and ordered a Ferranti Pegasus II that was installed in its own newly designed computer centre adjacent to its Liverpool head office. This early foray into the nascent field of banking automation drew the attentions of two social scientists from Liverpool University, Enid Mumford and Olive Banks. Mumford and Banks approached the bank and sought permission to use it for case study research into the effects of computer automation on white-collar workers; a hitherto unexplored area. Permission was granted, but Mumford and Banks’ relationship with the bank was an uneasy one as Martins encountered a series of political, organisational and technical problems that caused automation progress to <b>stall</b> several times. <b>Computer</b> centre accounting was eventually reliably operational for a first Liverpool branch at the end of 1961, but take on of subsequent branches was slow as Martins maintained a pace of just one branch per year over the following four years. In 1967 Mumford and Banks published the findings from their research in a monograph entitled The Computer and the Clerk, which protected Martins’ reputation under a pseudonym of ‘The Royal Exchange Bank’. By revisiting this contemporary interpretation, and revaluating it alongside a number of other written sources and post-hoc oral testimonies, I offer a fresh analysis that compares the geography of British banking with a geography of computers in use in the 1960 s. I conclude that Martins’ wholly typical requirement to situate its first computer centre within sight of its head office, coupled with its relatively small size and pioneering position at the forefront of banking automation, left it vulnerable to a number of hard and soft issues from which it needed considerable time to recover. By the time Martins had recovered, switched suppliers, and opened another computer centre in London in 1965, other banks already had their eyes on its geographic assets. Before {{the end of the}} decade, {{as a consequence of the}} 1968 ‘merger’ with Barclays, the Martins’ name had disappeared from view as the spread eagle replaced the sign of the grasshopper on British streets in Liverpool, London and beyond. ...|$|R
