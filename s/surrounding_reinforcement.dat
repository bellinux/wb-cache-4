New {{methods in}} {{reinforcement}} learning like policy gradients and batch reinforcement learning {{as well as}} {{a better understanding of the}} strengths and limits of particular combinations of reinforcement learning and function approximation have allowed for a significant step forward, when it comes to stable and efficient learning on real systems. Due to this progress, old research questions could been answered and completely new arise. With the goal of giving some insights into where the field of reinforcement learning is heading, this paper briefly presents the history of reinforcement learning, continues with a short (subjective) discussion of the present state of the art and finally comes up with ideas for new research directions. A special focus is put on the implications of these developments to neural computation. 1 A Very Brief History of Reinforcement Learning The early optimism <b>surrounding</b> <b>reinforcement</b> learning (RL) was severely tested, as it became clear, that the transition from learning in small discrete state space...|$|E

40|$|This thesis evaluates a {{particular}} ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) system {{in order to}} determine its capabilities and limitations in locating defects in concrete structures; specifically tunnel linings, bridge decks, and pavements. The device, a phased-array ultrasonic tomography (UST) system that utilizes shear waves, is a significant advancement in NDT systems. Consequently, there is a need in structural engineering to verify new technologies by assessing their flaw-detecting capabilities in a variety of structural applications. The UST technique does not currently have a testing methodology that is field-ready. In order to develop a methodology, the system was evaluated based on its ability to detect simulated defects, then taken to the field to evaluate natural structural defects on public tunnels, pavements, and airport runways. Types of concrete defects the system is used to detect and localize include air- and water-filled voids, vertical cracks, horizontal delaminations, and abnormalities such as clay lumps. The device is also used to determine reinforcement depth and spacing as well as concrete thickness measurements. This research concludes that the UST system is exceptional at locating horizontal delaminations ranging from 0. 05 - 2. 0 mm (0. 002 - 0. 079 in.), and is able to differentiate between fully debonded and partially-bonded areas. Vertical cracks could only be detected once they begin to form parallel to the testing surface; however, omission of surface details was found to be a strong indicator of crack presence. Backwall surfaces up to a depth of 762 mm (30 in.) were successfully and accurately determined. Air- and water-filled voids as well as reinforcement details such as layout and depth were also successfully determined and located. With the exception of some medium-sized clay lumps (with a diameter of approximately 102 mm, or 4 in.) <b>surrounding</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> all clay lumps tested were also highly successful...|$|E

30|$|Based on a {{parametric}} {{study on}} crack widths, it is shown that crack development and spacing {{are affected by}} bar size and the effective concrete area <b>surrounding</b> the <b>reinforcement.</b> As the reinforcing ratio falls, the behavior becomes dominated by {{a small number of}} large cracks. Whereas for typical reinforcing ratios (0.01 and 0.015), cracking occurs in a more progressive manner and is better distributed, and hence some variation in crack width along the member should be expected. As the reinforcing ratio becomes larger, cracking remains distributed but crack widths may be expected to be more uniform since cracking stresses vary very little. In all cases considered, for reinforcing ratios ρ =  0.01 and higher, cracks form at bar stresses below 482  MPa (70  ksi). Consequently, in a concrete section with reinforcing ratio ρ =  0.01 or higher, regardless of reinforcing grade, the crack width and crack spacing will be similar.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recently, many {{researchers}} on humanoid robotics {{are interested in}} Quasi-Passive-Dynamic Walking (Quasi-PDW) {{which is similar to}} human walking. It is desirable that control parameters in Quasi-PDW are automatically adjusted because robots often suffer from changes in their physical parameters and the <b>surrounding</b> environment. <b>Reinforcement</b> learning (RL) can be a key technology to this adaptability, and {{it has been shown that}} RL realizes Quasi-PDW in a simulation study. To apply the existing method to controlling real robots, however, requires further improvement to accelerate its learning, otherwise the robots will break down before acquiring appropriate controls. To accelerate the learning, this study employs off-policy natural actor-critic (off-NAC), and applies it to an acquisition problem of Quasi-PDW. The most important feature of the off-NAC is that it reuses the samples that has already been obtained by previous controllers. This study also shows an adaptive method of the learning rate. Simulation as well as real experiments demonstrate that fast and stable learning of Quasi-PDW of an unstable biped robot can be realized by our modified off-NAC. I...|$|R

A significant factor is the corrosion of steel reinforcement. At present there is little field experience and other data available.

It {{is based on the}} evidence that the rate of diffusion of chlorides is influenced by internal damage to the concrete <b>surrounding</b> the <b>reinforcement.</b> This may be due to localized stresses resulting from external loading or through concrete shrinkage. Usually, the net effect is that the time to initiation of active corrosion is shortened, leading to greater localized corrosion and earlier reduction of ultimate capacity and structural stiffness.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{since their}} discovery by Lij ima in 1991 [1], {{are considered a}} new generation of reinforcement [2]. Their "nano" size structure makes them potentially free of defects, which provides them with excellent physical properties [3, 4]. There are two main nanotube types: single wall nanotubes (SWNT), which are made of a single wall tube; and multiwall nanotubes (MWNT), which consist in several concentric walls, one inside the other. In a composite, one the most important factor is the interfacial tension between matrix and reinforcement. In general, the loads in a composite structure are introduced through the matrix and then are transferred to the reinforcement through the interface [5]. Therefore, the interface can be defined as the region <b>surrounding</b> the <b>reinforcement</b> where this stress transfer takes place. The properties of the composite depend on the properties of this regíon and its ability to transfer the load efficiently. This work proposes a new formulation to predict the mechanical properties of nanotube-reinforced composites. The formulation is based on the mixing theory [6]. It obtains the properties of the composite from the mechanical performance of its constitutive materials: matrix, carbon-nanotube and the interface that bonds both of them.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interface layers in {{composite}} materials {{exist as a}} natural consequence of material processing or are intentionally introduced into the composite to improve the chemical and physical properties of the composite. These interface layers surrounding the typically fiber reinforcements of the composite can be small, as in the interface between tungsten wire reinforcement and steel, or quite large, as in vapor deposited boron fibers in epoxy. The fiber size has a direct influence on the macroscopic structural properties of the composite as does {{the existence of the}} interface layer <b>surrounding</b> the <b>reinforcement.</b> The static structural properties due to the reinforcements can be characterized through ex-perimental testing. This should be adequate for non-primary structural composites but composites are now commonly used as primary structural components in both static and dynamic environments. Static and dynamic properties are therefore essential to the proper design of the composite structure. The pertinent quantity of interest in dynamic analysis is the dynamic stress concentration, a ratio of the dynamical stress on the reinforcement to the stress without the reinforcement. The dynamical stress concentrations are the ap-propriate area for studying fiber-reinforced composites and the interfacial layers must be included in order to properly model the dynamical interaction with the substructure of the composite. As an added benefit of the analysis, ultrasonic inspection benchmarks for non-destructive testing of the reinforced composites are produced from the dynamical stress concentration analysis. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforcement}} corrosion in Reinforced Concrete (RC) is a {{major reason}} of degradation for structures and infrastructures throughout the world leading to their premature deterioration before design life was attained. The effects of corrosion of reinforcement are: (i) {{the reduction of the}} cross section of the bars, and (ii) the development of corrosion products leading to the appearance of cracks in the concrete cover and subsequent cover spalling. Due to their intrinsic complex nature, these issues require an interdisciplinary approach involving both material science and structural design knowledge also in terms on International and National codes that implemented the concept of durability and service life of structures. In this paper preliminary FEM analyses were performed in order to simulate pitting corrosion or general corrosion aimed to demonstrate the possibility to extend the results obtained for a cylindrical specimen, reinforced by a single bar, to more complex RC members in terms of geometry and reinforcement. Furthermore, a mechanical analytical model to evaluate the stresses in the concrete <b>surrounding</b> the <b>reinforcement</b> bars is proposed. In addition, a sophisticated model is presented to evaluate the non-linear development of stresses inside concrete and crack propagation when reinforcement bars start to corrode. The relationships between the cracking development (mechanical) and the reduction of the steel section (electrochemical) are provided. Finally, numerical findings reported in this paper were compared to experimental results available in the literature and satisfactory agreement was found...|$|R

Although FRP has existed for many years, there is still much about it that needs to be understood before it is to be accepted as a building material in civil engineering structures. The objective of the current work is to investigate the buckling of FRP laminated plates. The buckling load of an FRP laminated plate depends on a variety of variables, including aspect ratio, thickness of the laminate, fiber orientation of the laminae that make up the laminate, and the boundary condition. These variables were related to the buckling load of laminated plates by analyzing a number of laminated plates using the commercially available ANSYS finite element software.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A non-linear finite element model has been developed to analyse reinforced concrete structures taking into account : (1) non-linear concrete behaviour under biaxial stress, (2) progressive cracking of the concrete, and (3) interaction between the reinforcement and the concrete matrix commonly known as bond. Three dimensional reinforced concrete components are analysed by an approximate two dimensional plane stress model. Bond {{is considered to be}} a concentric layer <b>surrounding</b> the <b>reinforcement</b> modelled by a 6 noded rectangular 'shearing' element. The concrete is represented by 8 noded isoparametric membrane elements and the reinforcement by 3 noded isoparametric bar elements. The finite element model uses, an incremental iterative solution technique known as the 'Initial stress method' and a special solution technique to allow for cracking of the concrete. stiffnesses within elements are evaluated by numerical integration using Gaussian Quadrature, with elastic moduli stored at the sampling positions. The bond model is based upon an assumed non-linear relationship between bond stress and slip in which the localised ultimate bond stress' is a function of both the lateral pressures exerted by the concrete on the reinforcement and the radial contraction of the bar' due to Poisson's effect. Allowance is also made for the deterioration of bond when the slip exceeds a tolerance value. The concrete model is a non-linear elastic fracture model based upon the 'Equivalent uniaxial strain approach' as developed by Darwin and Pecknold (1974). Cracking of the concrete is assumed to be 'smeared' within the concrete element. Reinforced concrete components which have been analysed include; the ordinary pullout test, double ended pull out test, a transfer test, and a beam-column intersection. A small experimental programme was conducted to obtain reliable data as to the nature of the bond stress and reinforcement strain distributions in the double-ended pullout test, the transfer test and the beam-column intersection. To determine the reinforcement strain distributions, plain round bars or ribbed reinforcement bars in the case of the beam-column, were embedded in the concrete specimens with electrical strain gauges attached.

Both Normal Concrete (NC) and Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) were and concrete, grout, and mortar used as infill material. Generally, in this research, twelve specimens are prepared for full scale testing with different parameters. The size of hollow brick was 250 mm x 1250 x 100 and the number of rebar was 12 mm diameter.

It was found that addition of super plasticizer in beam with SCC performed better under flexural loading than NC. This behavior also allows the concrete to have a more homogeneous mix, resulting to better bonding between bricks, grout, and steel reinforcement.

The inspection systems were part of a program for the California Department of Water Resources. The effort included the identification of the location and amount of corrosion damage to the tendons, identification of the cause of corrosion, and the technology for inhibiting corrosion. Several NDE methods for inspecting and quantifying damage to steel reinforced concrete water pipes were investigated and presented to the DWR for their consideration. The additional methods included Ground Penetrating RADAR, Electro- Potential Measurements, Infrared Technology, Pipe Inspection Crawlers (designed to travel inside pipelines and simultaneously report on the pipe condition as viewed by ultrasonic methods and video cameras from within the pipeline.)

Group 1 was composed of 59 cases in which less than 30 total CFU was recovered from the four test samples. The average duration of surgery for this group was 1. 8 h.

50|$|Upon Montcalm’s {{arrival in}} Montreal, he was {{immediately}} apprised {{of the situation}} {{along the border with}} British North America. Concerned by the number of British troops amassing near the border, Montcalm left to visit Fort Carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, began to prepare troops at Fort Frontenac for a potential assault on Oswego, a British fort across Lake Ontario. Montcalm’s assemblage of troops at Fort Carillon distracted the attention of the British, and upon receiving positive reports from scouts, Vaudreuil and Montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort. When Montcalm arrived back at Fort Frontenac, he found a force of 3500 men assembled, being regular French troops, Canadian militia, and Native Americans. On August 9, the forces crossed the lake and rapidly besieged the English fort. By the morning of August 13, the French had set up nine cannons and began to fire towards the fort while <b>reinforcements</b> <b>surrounded</b> the opposite side. The English commander was killed during the offensive, and the fort was quickly surrendered soon thereafter. 1700 prisoners were taken, including 80 officers, as well as money, military correspondence, food provisions, guns, and boats, and the fort burnt and razed to the ground. Montcalm’s first victory in North America came relatively quickly and easily, and signified to the British that the French now had a capable general heading their army. Despite the victory, Montcalm held reservations concerning the offensive strategy employed by Vaudreuil, and questioned the military value of the Canadian militias. This {{marked the beginning of the}} increasingly antagonistic relationship between Vaudreuil and Montcalm.|$|R
