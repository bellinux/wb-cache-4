Through the use of UV <b>resistant,</b> <b>sound</b> <b>resistant,</b> electric resistant acrylic the enclosure provides a simple means of guaranteeing better data acquisition without the requirement of complex protective mechanisms. The acrylic material used for the design resists UV wavelengths up to 500 nm. The design is also dependant on its adaptability and the ease of manufacturing and use. By machining 14 acrylic sheets and applying magnetic strips to the edges, as well as cutting 12 steel beams, 7 different enclosure sizes can be assemble. There is one smaller box that is 6 inches in height, 4 that are 12 inches in height and {{a wide variety of}} widths and lengths, and two that are 18 inches in height. Because of the design they can also be changed to a new size any point. The enclosure improves the performance of testing on the nanometer level because small influences on the experiment can greatly affect the data collected.

40|$|Coagulase {{negative}} Staphylococci (CoNS) {{are recognized}} as an important cause of nosocomial infection, especially in neonates and patients with indwelling prosthetic devices. The CoNS resistance rate to oxacillin has been increasing. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of oxacillin resistance is essential {{in order to determine}} the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This study aimed to prove that latex agglutination test and oxacillin <b>resistant</b> <b>screening</b> agar base (ORSAB) medium can be used for rapid detection of oxacilllin resistant CoNS (ORCoNS). Latex agglutination test and ORSAB medium compared with the conventional method was conducted in this study toward 30 clinical isolates of CoNS for the detection of ORCoNS. Mc Nemar test was used to analyze the data. The study result revealed that there was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in terms of ORCoNS detection between the latex agglutination test and ORSAB medium on the one hand, and the conventional method on the other. It is concluded that latex agglutination test and ORSAB medium can be used for rapid detection of ORCoNS.

Screening swabs (swabs of the nose, throat, perineum, and infected sites) were inoculated onto the new ORSA medium and into an enrichment broth (Muller-Hinton broth supplemented with NaCl and oxacillin). After 24 h of incubation, the enrichment broth was subcultured onto one ORSA plate and one lipovitellin Chapman salt agar plate. The sensitivities {{for the detection of}} MRSA were calculated for each medium alone and for the media in combination. A low sensitivity (74 %) was obtained when ORSA medium was used alone as a primary culture, whereas the sensitivity was 88 % when a single selective enrichment broth was used. Among the 414 blue colonies observed on ORSA plates, only 47 % were found to be MRSA, 40 % were coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 % were Enterococcus species, and 2 % were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The optimal incubation time for the ORSA plates {{was evaluated}}. On primary culture, 38 % of the blue MRSA colonies were visible only after 48 h of incubation (no blue colonies were not seen after 24 h of incubation), whereas 94 % of the colonies were already visible at 24 h when ORSA plates were used for subcultures. In conclusion, the advantage of the novel ORSA medium is the ease of recognition of mannitol-fermenting bacteria, but further identification tests are needed to confirm the identification of S. aureus. An enrichment broth is still needed to ensure a good sensitivity for the recovery of MRSA, and an incubation time of 48 h is required for primary culture on ORSA medium...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} was to investigate phenotypically the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin Resistance S. aureus (MRSA) in ruminants and animal handlers in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Materials and methods: A total of 937 samples (900 nasal and skin swabs of cattle and 37 humans samples) were collected in Maiduguri metropolis. The samples were inoculated onto mannitol salt agar (MSA) and blood agar, and the cultrue plates were incubated at 37 oC for 24 h. The S. aureus colonies showing golden yellow color on MSA were primarily identified as S. aureus, which were then subjected for catalase and coagulase tests. All S. aureus were finally screened for the presence of MRSA on oxalate <b>resistant</b> <b>screening</b> agar (ORSAB) medium. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the MRSA were measured by disc diffusion method. Results: The overall prevalence of S. aureus was 44. 3 % (n= 414 / 937). The MRSA could be detected in 12. 1 % (n= 113 / 937) samples. Considerign different species, S. aureus could be isolated from 137 (45. 6 %), 148 (49. 3 %) and 119 (39. 7 %), 11 (29. 7 %) cattle, sheep, goat and humans, respectively. In ruminants, 27. 7 % (n- 83 / 300) bulls were positive for S. aureus. Similarly, 10. 7 % (n= 32 / 300) and 22. 3 % (n= 67 / 300) were positive for S. aureus in rams and bucks, respectively. On the other hand, 18 % (n= 54 / 300), 38. 7 % (n= 116 / 300) and 17. 3 % (n= 52 / 300) samples from cows, ewes and does were positive for S. aureus. The highest MRSA could be isolated from ewes (9. 3 %; n= 28 / 300) follwed by bulls (7 %; n= 21 / 300) and bucks (6. 7 %; n= 20 / 300). In humans, 13. 5 % (n= 5 / 37) samples were positive for MRSA.

30|$|Colistin {{resistance}} in Enterobacteriaceae especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli {{is driving the}} evolution of pan drug <b>resistant</b> strains. <b>Screening</b> a library of 13 plant nutraceuticals led to the identification of acetyl shikonin and ursolic acid, which exhibited synergy with colistin against extremely drug resistant (XDR) clinical strains of E. coli (U 3790) and K. pneumoniae (BC 936). Ursolic acid caused a significant colistin MIC reversal of 16 -fold in U 3790 and 4 -fold in BC 936 strains. Ursolic acid also potentiated the bactericidal effect of colistin against both U 3790 and BC 936 by causing ~[*] 4 to 4.5 log fold decline in CFU of both clinical isolates in a time kill assay. At 2 × minimum effective concentration, ursolic acid was non-toxic to zebrafish as evidenced by brain and liver enzyme profiles and by histopathology studies. In combination with colistin, ursolic acid reduced bacterial bioburden of U 3790 /BC 936 by 1 – 1.58 log fold from the infected muscle tissue of zebrafish. Mechanistic explorations via studies on real time efflux, membrane potential and intracellular accumulation of dansyl chloride tagged colistin revealed that colistin efflux is inhibited by ursolic acid. In addition, ursolic acid also enhanced outer membrane permeability which probably facilitates colistin’s attack on outer and inner membranes. Our study shows that ursolic acid synergizes with colistin by inhibiting colistin efflux in Enterobacteriaceae that helps to curtail colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.|$|R

According to these two methods, which concurred in 95 % of cases, S. epidermidis (80 - 82 % of the isolates) was the most frequently identified species, followed by S. haemolyticus (6 - 7 % of the isolates). The susceptibility to oxacillin was also evaluated by macrodilution MIC, Automicrobic VITEK system and agar screen, and 76, 78 and 79 of the 100 isolates, respectively, were found resistant to this antibiotic. All oxacillin-resistant isolates according to Automicrobic VITEK were confirmed <b>resistant</b> by agar <b>screen.</b> A 48 h incubation was required to determine oxacillin resistance in 11 of 79 isolates with agar screen and in 10 of 76 isolates with macrodilution MIC. Automicrobic VITEK system may represent a useful method for rapid identification to a species level and early recognition of oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{pathogenic}} bacteria, frequently found in dif-ferent environmental samples. The prevalence of multidrug resistant isolates has become an alarming concern for both patients and their surroundings. The present study was carried out to record prevalence of P. aeruginosa in surface water of Dhaka city and to screen their antibiotic re-sistance pattern. The study was also extended to typing of resistant isolates according to extended spectrum beta lactamase production. Hereby, Kirby-Bauer method was applied to test antibiotic sensitivity according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Then, the Ampicillin <b>resistant</b> isolates were <b>screened</b> for ESBL production by Double Disk Synergy Test (DDST). In these pros-pects, 52 water samples were tested, of which 32 were found positive for P. aeruginosa isolates. Hundred percent of the positive isolates were found to Ampicillin (AMP) resistant followed by 93. 7 % to both Tetracycline and Gentamycin and 71. 8 % to Co-triimoxazole. P. aeruginosa is com-pletely susceptible to third generation antibiotics ciprofloxacin, Imipenem and Aztreonam followe...|$|R
40|$|Out of 1 989 wild accessions sown in seed {{boxes for}} screening, only 1 003 wild accessions with good {{germination}} were screened against brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) under greenhouse conditions. The collection comprised of accessions from 11 wild species and African cultivated rice. The germplasm was screened for BPH following standard seed box screening technique in the greenhouse. As many as 159 accessions {{were identified as}} resistant during the year 2012 based on one year screening. A selected set of BPH <b>resistant</b> accessions were <b>screened</b> again during 2013. Based on the two years screening, seven accessions of O. nivara (AA), one accession of O. officinalis (CC), seven accessions of O. australiensis (EE), five accessions of O. punctata (BB and BBCC) and nine accessions of O. latifolia (CCDD) were confirmed to be resistant to BPH. So far no BPH resistance genes have been identified and designated from O. nivara and O. punctata, hence these may act as new sources of resistance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Acinctobacter {{species are}} common non fermentative gram {{negative}} bacilli isolated in clinical laboratory most frequently encountered species. Acinetobacter resistance is develop due to acquired resistance. Because of frequent multidrug resistance isolates carbapenems have become important for treating resistant strains. There {{is a need}} for rapid screening & detection of MBL in Acinetobacter to modify the treatment. The present study was aim to determine the resistance of A. baumanii complese to various classes of drugs and to carbapenems and MBL production. Samples such as urine, blood, sputum, pus & body fluids. All samples were processed as per CLSI guidelines. Meropenem <b>resistant</b> strains were <b>screened</b> for carbapenemase and MBL production. Out of 92 Acinetobacter 85 (92. 39 %) were Acinetobacter baumanii. More than 80 % resistance is seen in 3 rd generation Cephalosporins. Out of 21 meropenem resistant strains 14 were carbapenemase positive and 3 were MBL producers. Our study shows raising trend of multidrug resistance and carbapenem. This will help in early detection and better treatment modalities...|$|R
