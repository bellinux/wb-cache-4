5|$|The Weinreb–Nahm ketone {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry to make carbon–carbon bonds. It {{was discovered in}} 1981 by Steven M. Weinreb and Steven Nahm as a method to synthesize ketones. The original reaction involved two subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitutions: the conversion of an acid chloride with N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine, to form a Weinreb–Nahm amide, and <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent. Nahm and Weinreb also reported the synthesis of aldehydes by reduction of the amide with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride (see amide reduction).|$|E

25|$|Echinostomiasis can be {{controlled}} {{at the same time}} as other food-borne parasite infections, using existing control programmes. Interrupting the parasite’s lifecycle by efficient diagnosis and <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> of infected individuals, and preventing reinfection, may help to control this disease. As echinostomiasis is acquired through the consumption of raw or undercooked infected food, cooking food thoroughly will prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|The Chronicle was {{compiled}} in Moscow by anonymous editors, {{drawing on a}} network of informants throughout the Soviet Union.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{floaters}} treated during a treatment session {{depends on the}} type of floater(s) and the laser energy required to treat the floater(s) (that is, to convert the floater material into a gas). During treatment, the ophthalmologist will monitor the level of laser energy used for each shot, as well as the total amount of energy delivered to the eye. In order to ensure safe, effective treatment with minimal patient discomfort, if these energy levels fall outside a predetermined range then any remaining floaters will need to be treated in a <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> session.|$|E
25|$|People {{had come}} to see Moses as a bully who disregarded public input, but until the {{publication}} of Caro's book, they had not known many details of his private life—for instance, that his brother Paul had spent much of his life in poverty. Paul, whom Caro interviewed shortly before the former's death, claimed Robert had exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert's favor shortly before her death. Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms with their mother over a long period and she may have changed the will of her own accord, and implies that Robert's <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> of Paul may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.|$|E
25|$|While {{a sophomore}} at Princeton, Alito {{received}} a low lottery number, 32, in the Selective Service drawing on December 1, 1969. In 1970, he {{became a member of}} the school's Army ROTC program, attending a six-week basic training camp that year at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Alito was a member of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton, which was formed in October 1972 at least in part to oppose Princeton's decisions regarding affirmative action. Apart from Alito's written 1985 statement of membership of CAP on a job application, which Alito says was truthful, there is no other documentation of Alito's involvement with or contributions in the group. Alito has cited the banning and <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> of ROTC by the university as his reason for belonging to CAP.|$|E

It has since been speculated that Froome may have had the parasitic infection {{for much of his}} adult life and during his early cycling career. The discovery and <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> of the illness has been used to explain Froome's rapid rise in form during 2011. On 16 September 2011, Froome signed a new three-year contract with Sky. He was part of the Great Britain team that helped Mark Cavendish win the world road race championship. In October, Froome finished third overall in the first edition of the Tour of Beijing, 26 seconds behind overall winner, Tony Martin.|$|E
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for mastopexy are few: aspirin use, tobacco smoking, diabetes, {{and obesity}} are medical and health conditions {{associated with increased}} incidences of nipple necrosis. In resolving the perceived ptosis {{of a woman with}} encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of ptosis present in the explanted breasts; likewise the assessment of the effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For the woman who is at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> of cancer; the risks and benefits will be discussed in that setting.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson {{subsequently}} {{sought a}} third opinion regarding his {{back at the}} Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. In response, then-Canucks Head Coach Alain Vigneault publicly speculated whether Hodgson was simply {{having a hard time}} being cut and was trying to [...] "roll the [...] in another direction." [...] Despite having been cleared earlier to play in the pre-season by two sets of doctors, the Cleveland Clinic judged him unfit to play for a month. Previously undetected nerve damage in one leg was also revealed. Due to Hodgson's misdiagnosis, which was not corrected until a year later, <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> and rehabilitation was designed for a bulging disc, which further aggravated his real injury – a muscle strain.|$|E

40|$|In field {{experiments}} {{the control}} of blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides, Huds.) in oilseed rape using clethodim (Select EC 240) and cycloxydim (Focus Ultra) with and without <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatments</b> with propyzamide (Kerb FLO) was tested at 6 locations in North and South Germany with assumed resistance problems. The field experiments were accompanied using molecular analysis leaf samples from the plots to seize the occurrence of black-grass with the Leu 1781 haplotype and to determine {{the frequency of the}} genotypes. The goal of the trials was to correlate the successes of blackgrass control with the occurrence of hetero- and homozygous resistant genotypes. It was shown in greenhouse trials that clethodim selects the haplotype Leu 1781 more weakly (and it shows a higher partial efficacy) than cycloxydim and that heterozygous plants have a lower resistance factor than homozygous plants. The question raised whether the frequency of heterozygous plants has influence on increased efficacy of clethodim under field conditions. At 5 sites target-site resistance was detected. At one location the high proportion of heterozygous plants correlated positive with relative higher control using Select EC 240 (80 %) compared to Focus Ultra (0 %). At two locations with high proportion of homozygous resistant plants Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra <b>treatments</b> without <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatments</b> with Kerb FLO were not sufficient in solo variants. The <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatments</b> with Kerb FLO provided partly, but not sufficient control of black-grass. At one location no resistance was identified. The effect of Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra to control black-grass were comparable high in all variants with and without <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatments</b> of Kerb FLO. The investigations showed clearly a higher degree of control by plants with the haplotype Leu 1781 by the active substance clethodim and pointed out the fact that the frequency of resistant genotypes (homo vs. heterozygous resistant plants) has a clear influence on the resistance selection. The use of DIMs at locations suspected to be resistant should be assured only with the help of propyzamide and nonchemical measurements (e. g. ploughing, crop rotation). The results also indicate {{that it is necessary to}} assess resistance mechanisms in resistance research individually depending on the active ingredients, inheritance and weed species...|$|R
2500|$|In 1984 a Western Australian scientist, Dr Barry Marshall, {{discovered}} {{the link between}} Helicobacter pylori (at that time known as Campylobacter pylori) and gastritis. This {{was based on a}} series of self-experiments that involved gastroscopy and biopsy, ingestion of H. pylori, regastroscopy and biopsy and <b>subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> with tinidazole. His only option was self-experimentation: ethical measures forbade him from administering H. pylori to any other person. In 2005, Marshall and his long-time collaborator Robin Warren were awarded Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, [...] "for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease".|$|E
2500|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{is often}} cited as causing osteoarthritis of the hip at a comparatively young age. [...] Dislocated load bearing surfaces lead to increased and unusual wear. [...] Although there are studies that contradict these findings. [...] (see [...] ) Peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery {{can be used to}} realign the hip joint in some adolescents and adults. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>treatment</b> with total hip arthroplasty (hip replacement) is complicated by a need for revision surgery (replacing the artificial joint) owing to skeletal changes as the body matures, loosening/wear or bone resorption. Hip resurfacing is another option for correcting hip dysplasia in adults. It is a type of hip replacement that preserves more bone, and may work for younger hip dysplasia patients.|$|E
