40|$|Gravure {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{processes}} for printing on <b>shrink</b> <b>films,</b> the reason being its consistency for longer runs. However, such printing is accompanied by new challenges. The presence of gels, black specks and other contaminations in these films does not allow the surrounding area to print, thus resulting in print void. The occurrence of this defect in a considerable amount or size on the area of interest leads to the rejection of printed stock that involves wastage of inks, solvents and time. The research involves the investigation of the effect of gravure process variables on the minimization of print voids in <b>Shrink</b> PVC <b>film.</b> The gravure process variables viz. viscosity, pressure, speed and hardness were identified for the indirect laser cylinder. It was established that hardness had a significant impact on minimizing the voids, while viscosity-hardness interaction played another important role.

40|$|Gravure {{printing}} delivers intricate print {{quality and}} exhibit better feasibility for printing long run packaging jobs. PVC and PETG {{are widely used}} <b>shrink</b> <b>films</b> printed by gravure process. The variation in ink transfer from gravure cells on to the substrate results in print mottle. The variation is inevitable and requires close monitoring with tight control on process parameters to deliver good dot fidelity. The electrostatic assist in gravure improves the ink transfer efficiency but is greatly influenced by ESA parameters such as air gap (distance between charge bar and impression roller) and voltage. Moreover, {{it is imperative to}} study the combined effect of ESA and gravure process parameters such as line screen, viscosity and speed for the minimization of half-tone mottle in <b>shrink</b> <b>films.</b> A general full factorial design was performed for the above mentioned parameters to evaluate half-tone mottle. The significant levels of both the main and interactions were studied by ANOVA approach. The statistical analysis revealed the significance of all the process parameters with viscosity, line screen and voltage being the major contributors in minimization of half-tone mottle. The optimized setting showed reduction in halftone mottle by 33 % and 32 % for PVC and PET-G respectively. The developed regression model was tested that showed more than 95 % predictability. Furthermore, the uniformity of dot was measured by image to non-image area (ratio) distribution. The result showed reduction in halftone mottle with uniform dot distribution...|$|R

40|$|PVC and PET-G (Glycol {{modified}} polyethylene terephthalate) {{have the}} highest consumption in the shrink sleeve market due to its high shrink abilities and cost effectiveness. The reproductions of fine tone details on these films are challenging as the occurrence of graininess and image-noise results in print defect such as print half-tone mottle. The presence of print half-tone mottle is visually disturbing leading to wastage of ink, substrate and time. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effect of gravure process parameters viz. ink viscosity, press speed, impression hardness and line screen and develop statistical model for print half-tone mottle in <b>shrink</b> <b>films.</b> The base line for print half-tone mottle was determined by conducting production runs on press with a defined set of process parameters and the target was set to minimize it from the baseline. The half-tone area was scanned and processed through SFDA algorithm to calculate print half-tone mottle. The design of experiments (DOE) was generated for above-mentioned process parameters and was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significant factor affecting the print half-tone mottle. The analysis revealed line screen, viscosity and hardness as significant factors in minimizing print half-tone mottle. The results showed minimization of print half-tone mottle by 28 % for both PVC and PET-G films. Furthermore, regression model was developed and validated for print half-tone mottle and a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 8696 and 0. 879 was achieved for PET-G and PVC respectively. The proposed model is helpful in determining the impact of gravure process parameters and prediction of print half-tone mottle in <b>shrink</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R
50|$|COC is {{commonly}} extruded with cast or blown film {{equipment in the}} manufacture of packaging films. Most often, due to cost, COC is used as a modifier in monolayer or multilayer film to provide properties not delivered by base resins such as polyethylene. Grades of COC based on ethylene show a certain amount of compatibility with polyethylene and can be blended with PE via commercial dry blending equipment. These films are then used in consumer applications including food and healthcare packaging. Key COC enhancements can include thermoformability, shrink, deadfold, easy tear, enhanced stiffness, heat resistance and higher moisture barrier. Common applications include <b>shrink</b> <b>films</b> and labels, twist films, protective or bubble packaging, and forming films. Another noted application which often relies on a high percentage of COC in the end product is pharmaceutical blister packaging.|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} following T 1 {{transformation of}} foams, during which certain foam <b>films</b> <b>shrink</b> and others grow, was modelled. Variation in surface tension due both {{to change in}} surfactant concentration and viscous drag was taken into account. Surfactant transfer was also taken into account, which was assumed to take place between connected films and {{to be caused by}} the Marangoni effect. Two models were considered in the first instance, one treating the two sides of <b>shrinking</b> <b>films</b> to be identical and another treating them to be different. Numerical results show plausible behaviours in certain parameter regimes, however with several potential issues. In particular, in one model, singularity was observed above a certain value of the surfactant mass transport coefficient, while such an event was avoided in the other model, as large tension differences between adjacent films are then suppressed. Analysing the results and comparing the models, with a view to applying them to a hexagonal honeycomb foam (rather than just to an isolated set of films), led to a possibility of further improvement; namely incorporating an inter-system surfactant transfer and variation in both surface tension and surfactant concentration along individual films, on top of the mechanisms already considered. Inter-system surfactant transfer was readily incorporated into a third model, which again displayed plausible behaviour...|$|R
