25|$|If the two {{countries}} have <b>separate</b> <b>currencies,</b> this {{does not affect the}} model in any way—purchasing power parity applies.

25|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{countries}} and territories using the CFA franc has changed as some countries began introducing their own <b>separate</b> <b>currencies.</b> A couple of nations in West Africa have also chosen to adopt the CFA franc since its introduction, {{despite the fact that}} they were never French colonies.|$|E
25|$|Three British {{overseas}} territories {{use their own}} <b>separate</b> <b>currencies</b> called pounds which are at par with the pound sterling. The governments of these territories print their own banknotes which in general may only be used within their territory of origin. Bank of England notes usually circulate alongside the local note issues and are accepted as legal currency.|$|E
50|$|The Armenian dram is {{also used}} in the de facto {{independent}} Republic of Artsakh. A <b>separate</b> <b>currency,</b> the Artsakh dram, which circulates together with the Armenian dram was introduced during 2005.

50|$|Fixed {{rates are}} those that have direct {{convertibility}} towards another currency. In case of a <b>separate</b> <b>currency,</b> {{also known as a}} currency board arrangement, the domestic currency is backed one to one by foreign reserves. A pegged currency with very small bands (< 1%) and countries that have adopted another country's currency and abandoned its own also fall under this.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf rupee, {{also known}} as the Persian Gulf rupee (XPGR), was {{introduced}} by the Government of India as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act of 1 May 1959. This creation of a <b>separate</b> <b>currency</b> was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India's foreign reserves by gold smuggling.|$|R
25|$|The {{currencies}} of the British {{overseas territories}} of Gibraltar, The Falkland Islands and Saint Helena/Ascension — namely the Gibraltar pound, Falkland Islands pound and Saint Helena pound — are pegged one-to-one to the pound sterling but are technically <b>separate</b> <b>currencies.</b> These territories issue their own coinage, {{again with the}} same denominations and specifications as the UK coinage but with local designs, as coins of the Gibraltar pound, coins of the Falkland Islands pound and coins of the Saint Helena pound.|$|E
25|$|Although Central African CFA francs and West African CFA francs {{have always}} been at parity and have {{therefore}} always had the same monetary value against other currencies, they are in principle <b>separate</b> <b>currencies.</b> They could theoretically have different values from any moment {{if one of the}} two CFA monetary authorities, or France, decided it. Therefore, West African CFA coins and banknotes are theoretically not accepted in countries using Central African CFA francs, and vice versa. However, in practice, the permanent parity of the two CFA franc currencies is widely assumed.|$|E
25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate <b>separate</b> <b>currencies</b> for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union attempts were made to maintain a common currency (the Russian ruble) among CIS states. Armenia joined this rublezone. However it soon became clear that maintaining a currency union in the unstable political and economical circumstances of the post-Soviet states would be very difficult. The rublezone effectively collapsed with the unilateral monetary reform in Russia, 1993. [...] As result the states that were still participating (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia) were 'pushed out' and forced to introduce <b>separate</b> <b>currencies.</b>|$|E
