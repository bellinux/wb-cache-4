40|$|Microgrid {{planning}} {{is very important}} for generation and transmission expansion planning in electrical power system. This is an option for co-streamlining of era and transmission extension arranging. In distribution system, all connected microgrids transfer energy from its central to local sources for the network reliability satisfaction and also it satisfies the power quality required by local loads. The main objective is to minimize the power losses in the transmission planning by using distributed generators in 30 <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> and 52 <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> Newton Raphson method is applied for load flow analysis to get the voltage and load angle for each bus in 30 <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> and 52 <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> An optimization technique is used for getting optimal values in this transmission planning. Differential evolution algorithm technique is used as optimization technique in this planning.

40|$|Abstract—Bus {{communication}} system was established mainly using Sim Events module {{in the software}} of Matlab/Simulink.

25|$|The {{designers}} included no {{capability to}} upgrade the original CPU as the 68000 is soldered to the motherboard {{and there is no}} other connection for upgrade. Despite this, unofficial CPU upgrades include the Motorola 68010, 68020 (at up to 25MHz), and 68030 (at up to 50MHz). The processor is upgraded not by replacing the 68000, but rather by fitting a connector over the CPU and commandeering the <b>system</b> <b>bus.</b> However, this approach caused instability problems with some board designs, prompting custom modifications for stable operation. As a result, such CPU expansions were largely unpopular.|$|E

25|$|The Nintendo 64's central {{processing}} unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300. Popular Electronics said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers. Except for its narrower 32-bit <b>system</b> <b>bus,</b> the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster (and more compact) 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space (which is at a premium on the Nintendo 64's cartridges).|$|E
25|$|When {{the size}} of the array to be sorted {{approaches}} or exceeds the available primary memory, so that (much slower) disk or swap space must be employed, the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important, and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in RAM may become impractical. In this scenario, the total number of comparisons becomes (relatively) less important, and the number of times sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk can dominate the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Thus, the number of passes and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons, since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at <b>system</b> <b>bus</b> speed (or, with caching, even at CPU speed), which, compared to disk speed, is virtually instantaneous.|$|E
