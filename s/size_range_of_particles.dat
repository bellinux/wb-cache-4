The gas flow field, the electric field, and the particle field with diffusion charging considered {{were included in the}} numerical model, which was implemented by using the commercial FLUENT software. Collection efficiency was calculated by using the Deutsch-Anderson equation, in which the parameters were provided from the numerical solutions. The simulated results indicate that the effect of diffusion charging on the wire-plate ESP particle collection increases with the decreasing particle diameter, as well as applied potential, particularly for PM 10. Moreover, with the increasing applied potential, collection efficiency of PM 10 is obviously improved, and the effect extent first increases and then decreases with particle size increasing, but also, the <b>size</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle,</b> which is significantly affected by the diffusion charging, becomes smaller.

XRD and optical band gap data have been obtained to confirm the nanosize of these materials. It is also observed that the particle size depends on the molar concentration of the capping agent. A decrease in formation rate of nanoparticles {{gives rise to a}} larger final particle size for all the studied synthesis conditions. As the particle size depends on the molar concentration of the doping agent, a decrease in the size of particle is observed with the increase of molar concentration of the capping agent.

The optical band gap values of ZnS nanoparticles have changed from 3.83 to 4.59 eV by increasing the molar concentration of the capping agent.

The purpose of this study was, for the first time, to investigate the deposition rates <b>of</b> fungal <b>particles</b> in a chamber of 20. 4 m 3 simulating indoor environments by: 1) releasing fungal particles into the chamber, in sufficient concentrations so the particle deposition rates can be statistically analysed; 2) comparing the obtained deposition rates with non-bioaerosol <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> similar sizes, investigated under the same conditions; and 3) investigating the effects of ventilation on the particle deposition rates.

40|$|Iron is {{the primary}} source for {{discolouration}} problems in the drinking water distribution system. The removal of iron from groundwater is a common treatment step {{in the production of}} drinking water. Even when clear water meets the drinking water standards, the water quality in the distribution system can deteriorate due to settling <b>of</b> iron (hydroxide) <b>particles</b> or post-treatment flocculation of dissolved iron. Therefore it is important to remove dissolved and particulate iron to a large extent. This paper describes the study towards the current iron removal processes and experimental work towards improving removal of dissolved and particulate iron. The study was carried out at groundwater treatment plant Harderbroek, consisting of aeration, rapid sand filtration and tower aeration. The research contains two parts: 1) a <b>particle</b> fingerprint <b>of</b> the treatment, resulting in a quantification <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> breaking through the rapid sand filtration. 2) Small column experiments on the oxidation and filterability of iron. The fingerprint showed that operational events such as switching on/off of filters and backwashing {{have a significant impact on}} the volume concentration <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> breaking through the filter. A frequency plot <b>of</b> the different <b>size</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> indicates that mainly the filterability <b>of</b> the middle <b>size</b> <b>ranges</b> (2 – 7 ?m) <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> was influenced by switching a filter on/off.

Dosing caustic soda resulted in a significant increase of the oxidation rate and improved the removal of iron(II) in the column. Crushed limestone filtration gave promising results, but the contact time applied was too short to completely oxidize iron(II) ...|$|R

Aiming to reduce this gap we developed a flow cytometer called CytoBuoy for autonomous in situ operation, for instance in a moored buoy with wireless data transfer.

The results indicated that, besides the similar compositional dependence of heat of formation as in bulk alloys, the heat of formation of alloy nanoparticles exhibits notable size-dependence, and there exists a competition between size effect and compositional effect on the heat of formation of immiscible system. Contrary to the positive heat of formation for bulk-immiscible alloys, a negative heat of formation may be obtained for the alloy nanoparticles with a small size or dilute solute component, which implies a promotion of the alloying ability and phase stability of immiscible system on a nanoscale.

Methods: In this investigation, CPEGC triblock dendrimers were synthesized and then imidazole groups were conjugated {{onto the surface of}} the G 1, G 2 and G 3 of the obtained dendrimers. In order to study the type of the interactions between the functionalized dendrimers and a drug molecule, Naproxen which contains acidic groups, was examined as a hydrophobic drug in which the interactions would be of the electrostatic kind between its acidic groups and the lone pair electrons of nitrogen atom in imidazole groups. The quantity of the trapped drug and also the amount of its release were measured with UV spectrometric method in pH 1, 7. 4 and 10. The average diameter of the nanocarriers was measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique Results: The <b>size</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> was determined to be 16 - 50 nm for different generations.

Side scatter and fluorescence parameters could predict dispersed PSP sizes down to 200 nm, but the forward scatter parameter was not discriminatory. Confocal microscopy of flow-sorted fractions confirmed that dispersed PSPs appeared as a single sharp peak on fluorescence histograms, whereas agglomerated PSPs were detected as smaller adjacent peaks. Particles as small as 200 nm could also be detected by flow cytometry after they were first phagocytized by J 774 A. 1 murine macrophages. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that these PSPs were internalized within the cytoplasm. MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and calcein–AM (acetoxymethyl ester) assays showed {{that they were not}} cytotoxic. Internalized PSP size correlated to both cellular side scatter (R 2 = 0. 9821) and fluorescence intensity (R 2 = 0. 9993). Furthermore, PSPs of various sizes could be distinguished when J 774 A. 1 cells were loaded with a single size of PSP and mixed with cells containing other sizes.

The experimental results indicate that full conversion of coarse micron sized to nanoparticles, even after 36 h of ball milling, was not possible. Multi modal SiC particle size distributions which included SiC nanoparticles were produced after the milling process, leading to the incorporation <b>of</b> a <b>size</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> SiC <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> from about 50 nm to larger than 10 μm, into the molten A 356 aluminum alloy. The <b>particle</b> size <b>of</b> the milled powders and the amount of released heat from the reaction between the carrier agent and molten aluminum are inferred as two crucial factors that affect the resultant part tensile properties and microhardness...|$|R
