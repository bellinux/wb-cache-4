5000|$|It is {{a typical}} [...] "sylvia" [...] warbler, similar in size but slimmer than <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler.</b> The adults have a plain grey back and paler grey underparts. The bill is fine and pointed, with brown legs and red eyes. The {{striking}} male has a black head and, usually, a black throat, separated by a white malar streak ("moustache"). Females have a pale throat, and the head is grey rather than black. Their grey back has a brownish tinge. The song is a slower, deeper rattle than that of <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This bird {{seems to}} be related to the <b>Sardinian</b> warbler-Menetries' <b>warbler</b> {{superspecies}}. They all have white malar areas, the heads being dark above in adult males, and naked eye-rings. These three species are related to a superspecies consisting of Rüppell's warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above.(Shirihai et al. 2001, Jønsson & Fjeldså 2006 [...] )The subalpine warbler is divided into two distinct subspecies groups, which may possibly be sufficiently diverged to qualify as two separate species (Shirihai et al. 2001). The two groups have differing male plumages, distinctive calls, and are allopatric; further study is needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{geographical}} {{variation in the}} <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> conforms to some extent with Gloger's rule, though not as strongly as in some other typical warblers. The validity of leucogastra and norissae is not accepted by some authors, and valverdei has been described very recently. On the other hand, leucogastra might {{be more than one}} subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Menetries's warbler or Ménétries's warbler (Sylvia mystacea) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of Southwest Asia {{belonging to}} the genus Sylvia. The name of the species commemorates Édouard Ménétries, the French zoologist who described the species in 1832. It {{is closely related to}} the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanocephala) of the Mediterranean basin and is similar to it in appearance.|$|E
50|$|Many {{rare and}} scarce liverworts, {{mosses and lichens}} occur within the ghylls or ravines. Peregrines, black redstarts and fulmars breed on the cliffs. Dartford warblers, stonechats and yellowhammers breed on the gorse-covered hillsides. Many {{migrants}} pass through the site in spring and autumn and usually includes a few rarities such as <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler,</b> red-rumped swallow, and Pallas's leaf warbler, which have all occurred in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Like most Sylvia species, it has {{distinct}} {{male and}} female plumages. The adult male is a small typical warbler with a grey back, black head, white malar streaks ("moustaches"), and, uniquely among typical warblers, underparts heavily streaked with black. The female is mainly grey above, with a greyer head, and whitish with only light spotting. The Cyprus warbler's song is fast and rattling, and {{is similar to that}} of the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} Cyprus warbler {{it forms a}} {{superspecies}} with dark throats, white malar streaks and light remiges fringes. This in turn {{is related to the}} species of Mediterranean and Middle East Sylvia warblers that have a naked eye-ring, namely the subalpine warbler, <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> and Ménétries's warbler. Both groups have a white malar area, but this may not form a clear streak in the latter group; above the white, the heads of males are uniformly dark.|$|E
5000|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> was by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 in the 13th edition of the Systema naturae. He coined the binomial name Montacilla melanocephala. The current genus Sylvia was introduced in 1769 by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. The genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland sprite, related to silva, a wood. The specific melanocephala is from Ancient Greek melas, [...] "black", and kephale, [...] "head".|$|E

50|$|Together with Menetries' warbler the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a superspecies. Both have white malar {{areas and}} light throats, and {{otherwise}} black heads in adult males, {{as well as}} a naked ring around the eye. The subalpine warbler, which seems the superspecies' closest relative, has a dark throat and breast and a dark gray upper head in males, but otherwise shares these characters. These three species are related to a dark-throated superspecies consisting of Rüppell's warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanocephala) is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} typical warbler from the Mediterranean region. Like most Sylvia species, it has distinct male and female plumages. The adult male has a grey back, whitish underparts, black head, white throat and red eyes. Plumages are somewhat variable even in the same locality, with the intensity of a reddish hue on upper- and/or underside varies from absent to (in some subspecies) pronounced. The female is mainly brown above and buff below, with a grey head. The Sardinian warbler's song is fast and rattling, and is very characteristic of the Mediterranean areas where this bird breeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers of}} Isoplexis species {{appear to be}} adapted for bird pollination. It was once thought that the {{original}} pollinators of Isoplexis and the other Canarian bird pollinated plants (such {{as members of the}} genera Canarina and Lotus) were sunbirds which had become extinct on the Canary Islands; this might explain why Isoplexis species are rare and considered endangered species (Vogel 1954; Vogel et al. 1984; Valido et al. 2004). However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), and the Canary <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanocephala leucogastre) (Olesen 1985, Ollerton et al. 2008), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans (Ollerton et al. 2008), and a hexose-dominated sugar ratio in the composition of the nectar (Dupont et al. 2004).|$|E
50|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies S. m. mystacea is dark greyish {{above and}} whitish below {{with a white}} submoustachial stripe and a pink throat and breast. It has a dark cap which is dull black at the front but becomes paler further back and merges into the grey nape unlike the Sardininan warbler which has an entirely jet-black cap. Menetries's warblers have rather plain tertial feathers unlike the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> which has tertials with more obvious dark centres and pale edges. The western subspecies S. m. rubescens is paler grey above than the nominate and the pink on the underparts is paler or absent entirely. The eastern subspecies S. m. turcmenica is paler grey above and paler pink below than the nominate and has longer wings than both the other subspecies. Male Menetries's warblers become browner outside the breeding season with a less dark cap.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} AMP is an {{important}} habitat for many species of fish (about 300), birds (up to 80 species), reptiles and also mammals. Apart from the monk seal, the red coral (Corallium rubrum), Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae), Audouin's gull (Larus audouinii), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), and the wild goat of Gioura (Capra aegagrus), are few of the most characteristic rare species to be found. Some of the birds to be seen are the eagle (Hieraetus fasciatus), the cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and the white gull (Larus cacchinans), and, nesting among the rocks, the Apus capus and Apus melba, the rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayeri), etc. The existing flora also favours the presence of species of the family Sylvidae, e.g. the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanocephala) and the blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla). Underwater fauna is also varied, with many benthic and fish species. Various species of dolphins and some whale species {{may be seen in}} the region, such as the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas), the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and the Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris).|$|E
50|$|Krumovitsa Important Bird Area {{supports}} 136 bird species. Sixty-four are {{species of}} European conservation concern (SPEC), {{two of them}} being included in category SPEC 1 as globally threatened, 18 in SPEC 2, and 44 in SPEC 3 as species threatened in Europe. The area is of global importance, {{as it is a}} representative biome for the Mediterranean zone. Seven biome-restricted species, typical for the Mediterranean zone out of nine established in Bulgaria, occur there: black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica), olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum), subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans), <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanocephala), rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer), masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) and black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala). Krumovitsa {{is one of the few}} places in Bulgaria where the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) still can be observed. Krumovitsa provides suitable habitats for 46 species, included in Annex 2 of the Biodiversity Act, which need special conservation measures. Thirty-eight of them are listed also in Annex I of the Birds Directive and more than half of them breed in the region in significant populations. The region of the Krumovitsa is one of the most important sites in the country on a European Union scale for the breeding black stork (Ciconia nigra), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and olive-tree warbler.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Rock {{through which}} the path passes {{is one of the}} richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is {{relatively}} sparsely vegetated and includes species such as White Asparagus, Common Asphodel, Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland - a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds. The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and black bryony, while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler,</b> wren and woodcock. Barbary partridges {{can be seen in the}} more open areas adjoining the path. Europe's largest lizard, the ocellated lizard, also lives in the vicinity, along with Iberian wall lizard, Algerian sand racer and Moorish gecko.|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic habitat {{change and}} {{assisted}} colonization are promoting range expansions of some widespread species with potential consequences for endemic fauna. The recent colonization of Cyprus by breeding Sardinian Warblers Sylvia melanocephala has raised concerns {{that it might}} be displacing the closely related and endemic Cyprus Warbler Sylvia melanothorax. Habitat associations of both species were examined using models of abundance within the 95 % density kernel of the Sardinian Warbler's range and also outside this range for Cyprus Warbler. Within the Sardinian Warbler's range, the two species were associated with subtly different scrub habitats. Outside the Sardinian Warbler's range, the Cyprus Warbler differed again in its habitat association, but this probably resulted from marked differences in habitat extent and availability {{in different parts of the}} island rather than from competitive displacement, as none of the habitat or land-use elements differentially associated with Cyprus Warblers was positively associated with <b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler</b> occurrence. This suggests that the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler</b> has exploited a different niche, rather than displacing the endemic species, and has perhaps benefitted from changing land-use patterns, particularly recent fallows and abandoned agriculture, in contrast to the stronger association of Cyprus Warblers with semi-natural scrub. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Wildfires are {{the most}} {{extensive}} and severe disturbance affecting the shrublands where Sardinian and Dartford Warblers (Sylvia melanocephala and S. undata) abound. Estimating the long-term use of burned habitats by these species (i. e. their time-window of occurrence) is fundamental to understanding their regional distribution and to plan possible conservation measures for the near- threatened Dartford Warbler. In this study, we describe the post-fire time-window of occurrence and cover preferences of the two warblers using an abundance dataset, gathered by point counts over 22 consecutive years, and a density dataset, resulting from territory mapping of four different plots for up to 8 years. Both datasets span before and after fire. The two species colonized burned areas {{as soon as the}} second year after fire. The Dartford Warbler showed its highest abundance between 4 and 9 years after fire and disappeared after 16 years or more. The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler</b> had a peak of abundance at 9 years, but the study was not long enough to record its local extinction. Partial least squares regression showed that abundance at points and plot density of the Dartford Warbler were positively related to the plant cover between 0. 25 and 1 m, whereas vege- tation between 0. 5 and 4 m was important for the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler.</b> The Dartford Warbler, therefore, depends on the existence of dense and low shrublands, that are often the result of past firesPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|On the {{breeding}} of the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> Sylvia melanocephala in {{the centre of}} Mallorca. The results are presented of a breeding study in a small 3. 5 hectare patch of woodland surrounded by non-irrigated crop lands in the centre of Mallorca during the springs of 2004 and 2005. The minimum number of territories during the two years was 7, with some pairs having two clutches (May and June). These figures imply a very high density, equating to 20 pairs per 10 ha, {{which may be the}} norm for the entire island. The high density {{may be related to the}} subdued territorial behaviour observed in the males...|$|E
40|$|Global warming may a¡ect the physiology, distributions, {{phenology}} and {{adaptations of}} plants and animals. In Israel, minimum summer temperatures increased {{by an average of}} 0. 26 8 C per decade {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. Bergmann’s rule predicts that, in warm-blooded animals, races from warm regions are smaller than races from cold regions. Numerous studies have reported general correla-tions between body mass in fossil animals and independently established palaeoclimatic changes from various parts of the world in accordance with this rule. Using museum specimens, I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of ¢ve resident passerine species in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999. The body mass of four species (the graceful warbler Prinia gracilis, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> Sylvia melanocephala, but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata) declined signi¢cantly during this period. Tarsus length also declined signi¢cantly during this period for two species (the graceful warbler and the house sparrow). Body condition (body mass-to-tarsus length ratio) decreased in the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler,</b> the yellow-vented bulbul and the crested lark. It is suggested that the above declines in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann’s rule. The above explanation does not exclude the possibility that other factors, such as a decrease in food availability, contributed to the decline in body mass. These declines may have serious implications for community structure and competition among bird species and may a¡ect the survival of small passerines...|$|E
40|$|The Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea) is an {{invasive}} species which {{has recently been}} found to be locally abundant in eastern Liguria (Italy). The song production of this bird was recorded over the course of an entire year (2011) and evaluated using both aural information and applying innovative automatic processing metrics. Our findings revealed that the Red-billed Leiothrix has loud vocalizations that are heard for most of the year, including in July and August when other birds are silent. Its song production has been estimated to amount to 37 % of the sounds uttered by the entire bird community. The next most vocal species are the European Robin (36 %), the Common Blackbird (18 %), the Subalpine Warbler (5 %) and the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler</b> (1 %). The Red-billed Leiothrix {{can be seen as a}} new acoustically dominant species and, consequently, a potential modifier of the soundscape patterns of the indigenous bird community. The modification of acoustic traits in the repertoire of both indigenous species and the Red-billed Leiothrix is to be expected according to a co-evolution hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Observations of the ornithochoral {{dispersion}} of the Mediterranean Buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). Between May 24 th and June 3 rd of 1994 {{a total of}} 5 1 / 2 hours were devoted to the systematic observations of the birds coming to eat {{the fruit of the}} Mediterranean buckthorn (Rhmnnus alaternus) on a property in the center of Mallorca. Of the 5 species of bird who are potential consumers (and dispersers) of the fruit, only 2 were seen eating them: the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia rnelanocephala) and Marmora's warbler (Sylvia sarda). Thirty-five of the recorded feeding visits were of the S. melanocephala, involving the removal of 43 fruits. Only 3 of the visits were of the S. sarda (1 fruit caten in each of them), but {{it should be noted that}} the density of this species in the area studied seems considerably lower than that of the first. ' The short duration of the visits of the S. melanocephala, and especially the fact that in over half of them the bird left without swallowing the last fruit handled, suggests that this warbler is using the fruit to supplement the diet of its young...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} species replacement during ecological successions is a long-standing and open debate. In this study, {{we examined the}} distribution of the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> Sylvia melanocephala along two grassland-to-forest gradients, one in a high-diversity area (Albera-Aspres chain in Catalonia: eight Sylvia warbler species) and one in a low-diversity area (Mount Hymittos in Greece: four species). In Catalonia, distribution models suggested that the apparent exclusion of S. melanocephala from the open and forest ends of the gradient may be explained entirely by the preference of S. melanocephala for mid-successional shrublands. However, a joint analysis of both data sets revealed that: 1) S. melanocephala was more evenly distributed along the vegetation gradient in Greece, suggesting ecological release in the low-diversity area; and 2) a distribution model assuming interspecific competition (based on the distribution of Sylvia species showing a negative co-occurrence pattern with S. melanocephala) had a significantly higher predictive ability than a distribution model based on habitat variables alone. Our study supports the view that species turnover along ecological gradients generally results from a combination of intrinsic preferences and interspecific competition [Current Zoology 57 (3) : 307 – 317, 2011]...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler</b> Sylvia melanocephala is the commonest Sylvia warbler in shrubland with a Mediterranean climate {{with mild}} winters (Shirihai et al. 2001). It uses {{a wide range}} of habitats, such as scrublands and maquis, open forests {{containing}} bushy undergrowth, as well as agricultural areas and urban gardens (Cody & Walter 1976, Shirihai et al. 2001). It can breed in forests or maquis that have recently burned (Pons & Prodon 1996) although these {{have been found to be}} lower-quality habitats (Herrando & Brotons 2001). They are a site-tenacious, territorial and monogamous species during the breeding period (Cramp 1985). Although some data exist on the breeding densities and territory size for the species, there is none on home range. Territory is defined as a defended area, dominated and/or exclusive, where the bird drives off his congeneric neighbours or warns them of his territorial status (Maher & Lott 1995); home range is defined as the area traversed by the individual in its normal activ-ities of food gathering, resting, mating and caring for young. The home range of the congeneric Sylvia atricapilla, studied by a capture–recapture method, is seven times bigger than its territory (Ferry et al. 1981). On the other hand, the information on territorial interspecific overlaps in the genus is divergent (Cod...|$|E
40|$|Cluster N is {{a cluster}} of {{forebrain}} regions found in night-migratory songbirds that shows high activation of activity-dependent gene expression during night-time vision. We have suggested that Cluster N may function as a specialized night-vision area in nightmigratory birds and {{that it may be}} involved in processing light-mediated magnetic compass information. Here, we investigated these ideas. We found a significant lateralized dominance of Cluster N activation in the right hemisphere of European robins (Erithacus rubecula). Activation predominantly originated from the contralateral (left) eye. Garden warblers (Sylvia borin) tested under different magnetic field conditions and under monochromatic red light did not show significant differences in Cluster N activation. In the fairly sedentary <b>Sardinian</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanocephala), which belongs to the same phyolgenetic clade, Cluster N showed prominent activation levels, similar to that observed in garden warblers and European robins. Thus, it seems that Cluster N activation occurs at night in all species within predominantly migratory groups of birds, probably because such birds have the capability of switching between migratory and sedentary life styles. The activation studies suggest that although Cluster N is lateralized, as is the dependence on magnetic compass orientation, either Cluster N is not involved in magnetic processing or the magnetic modulations of the primary visual signal, forming the basis for the currently supported light-dependent magnetic compass mechanism, are relatively small such that activity-dependent gene expression changes are not sensitive enough to pick them up...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{change and}} {{associated}} habitat loss and species invasions {{are two of}} the greatest threats to global biodiversity. In Europe, changes in farmland management practices driven in part by the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have caused dramatic declines in associated biodiversity. This thesis studied avian land-use associations to understand the relative importance of different habitat and landscape elements to the farmland bird community, with particular emphasis on priority species for conservation, in Cyprus, a recently acceded EU Member State, as a case study for the eastern Mediterranean. Results provide the first evidence base to inform CAP agri-environment measures in the region. A wide range of habitats and land-uses were important for bird species and assemblages and local habitat diversity was of key value. Farmland habitats, particularly viticulture and groves, and remnant scrub were the most important, demonstrating the high value of heterogeneous farmland mosaics to breeding and wintering avian biodiversity in Cyprus. The area of land under agriculture in Cyprus has substantially decreased, with much of this attributable to declines in marginal low-intensity crops on which much avian biodiversity depends. Building development appears to be one important driver behind these trends. Changes observed in the distributions of <b>Sardinian</b> <b>Warbler</b> Sylvia melanocephala, a recently established breeder in Cyprus, and the endemic Cyprus Warbler Sylvia melanothorax are more likely mediated by changing land-use patterns relating to grazing intensity of scrub, as {{there was no evidence of}} competitive displacement. The complex Mediterranean farmland mosaic was created by traditional farming practices that are usually economically marginal. Agri-environment mechanisms to support this heterogeneity are necessary for effective conservation of priority species and bird biodiversity in the eastern Mediterranean...|$|E
