40|$|Abstract. A new {{technology}} of high efficiency concasting based on inner-outer couple cooling of molten steel in a mould has been advanced, {{that is to}} set an inner cooling apparatus, U shape pipes, in a mould. The flow status of molten steel in mould with inner cooling apparatus is analyzed by using fluid dynamics analysis software FLUENT, and compared with that without inner cooling apparatus. It is found that the inner U-shape cooling apparatus can make molten steel flow with a lower impact depth which is favourable to inclusion in <b>steel</b> <b>floating</b> up...|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of AFD-23—a one-section, <b>steel,</b> <b>floating</b> Drydock built at Jacksonville, FL., by George D. Auchter Co.—was begun late in 1943 and completed in December 1944. The small, non-self-propelled auxiliary floating drydock was then towed to the Chesapeake Bay for duty at the United States Coast Guard base at Curtis Bay, Md., where she began docking small naval combatant ships—up {{to the size}} of destroyer escorts—for hull repairs. Redesignated AFDL-23 on 1 August 1946, she was moved to Hawaii in the 18 months immediately following the end of the war. By 1 January 1947, AFDL-23 was laid up with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Pearl Harbor.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. This thesis {{presents}} a three-dimensional static analysis and design procedure for a floating {{offshore wind turbine}} support platform constructed of reinforced concrete. Results from a global performance analysis, which considers the dynamic interactions of wind and wave loading, from a conceptual case study by the American Bureau of Shipping are used to infer the equivalent static loading applied to the finite element model. Results from the analysis and applicable load combinations obtained from relevant design guidelines are used to design a floating concrete platform structure that includes precast and cast-in-place components as well as post-tensioning. The proposed concrete platform is a tri-floater, semi-submersible structure that consists of a cylindrical central core column to support the wind turbine tower, stabilized by the three buoyancy columns and a rigid pontoon base. The floating reinforced concrete support platform is shown to be an economically viable option when compared to <b>steel</b> platforms. <b>Floating</b> offshore wind turbine technology {{is a relatively new}} multi-disciplinary field of engineering where current design concepts primarily utilize <b>steel</b> <b>floating</b> support platforms. Reinforced concrete is advantageous over steel because of the durability of concrete exposed to a marine environment. Construction recommendations are discussed, as are social and economic considerations for floating offshore wind turbines. Civil Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Manning’s n, denoted as n, quantifies a channel’s {{roughness}}. In any flow scenario, channel roughness {{can play}} {{a large role in}} the rate at which water conveys through the channel. A higher value of Manning’s n indicates that a channel is rough and thereby creates more friction as the water moves through the channel. This friction causes a loss in energy and consequentially a reduction in flow velocity. A smaller n value has the opposite effect. The Manning’s n value for common materials, such wood or cement can be found in literature. The observed channel material is Portland cement concrete. For the purpose of this exploration a Manning’s n of 0.013, the value associated with <b>float</b> <b>finish</b> concrete, was used.|$|R

50|$|These {{platforms}} {{are built}} on concrete or steel legs, or both, anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters. Such platforms are, {{by virtue of their}} immobility, designed for very long term use (for instance the Hibernia platform). Various types of structure are used: steel jacket, concrete caisson, <b>floating</b> <b>steel,</b> and even <b>floating</b> concrete. <b>Steel</b> jackets are structural sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed.

These magnetic floats have become standard equipment where strength, corrosion resistance and buoyancy are necessary. They are manufactured by welding two drawn half shells together.

40|$|The use of {{traditional}} lime plaster in restoration of old buildings {{is motivated by}} both technical and historic reasons. The plasterer deals daily with a multivariable problem where the variables are related in such a complex way {{that we are not}} even close to finding converging solutions by traditional scientific methods. The decisions and actions of the craftsman will have an influence on both the surface structure and the inner structure of the lime plaster. The present paper will focus on the time between application of mortar and working on the surface to make a <b>floated</b> <b>finish.</b> In total, 32 lime plaster surfaces have been analysed. Half of them have been worked on after they have stiffened up and half of them have been worked on while they are still fresh. The results clearly show that the time between application of mortar and working the surface is a critical parameter. If you wait until the right time, you receive a more homogeneous and compact material with an open surface and a higher frost resistance.
