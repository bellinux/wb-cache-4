40|$|Abstract. In this Paper III, {{the last}} one of the series, {{additional}} evidences are given that the fluxes of solar high energy particles, with energies higher than 100 MeV (the solar cosmic rays), are a very {{important component of the}} “Sun–climate " relationship (see also Paper I and Psper II). It is known that the total solar irradiance and the galactic cosmic rays produce an integral climate effect of cooling in sunspot minima epochs and warming in <b>sunspot</b> <b>maxima</b> epochs. Contrariwise, the powerful solar corpuscular events cause cooling predominantly during the epochs of their high levels. By this reason subcenturial global and regional temperature quasi-cyclic changes with duration of approximately 60 years could be tracked during the last 150 years of instrumental climate observations. This paper shows that this subcenturial oscillation is very important in the group sunspot number data series since the Maunder minimum up to the end of 20 th century. Only a relatively short period, closely before and during the last centurial Gleissberg-Gnevishev’s minimum (AD 1898 - 1923), when this cycle is totally absent, is an exception there. Thus the solar eruptive activity make the total "Sun–climate " relationship essentially more complicated as it could be expected if only the total solar irradiance and the galactic cosmic rays variations ar...|$|R

The speed distributions of some selected classes of mass ejections are significantly different.

The speed distributions from each year of SMM observations show significant changes, with the annual average speeds varying from 157 (1984) to 458 km/s (1985). These variations are not simply related to the solar activity cycle; the annual averages from years near the <b>sunspot</b> <b>maxima</b> and minimum are not significantly different. The widths, latitudes, and speeds of mass ejections determined from the SMM observations are only weakly correlated.

40|$|In the Lake Victoria basin hydrology, trend {{analysis}} has mainly {{been limited to}} {{the mean of the}} hydrological variable without explicit consideration of extremes, which are very crucial in understanding the behaviour of disastrous hydrometeorological events. Since the effects of climate change are unleashed, more through the occurrence of extremes, analysis of both monotonic and cyclic trends in hydrological extremes is very crucial. The presence of a significant linear trend, in a long-term hydrometeorological record of extremes, may provide evidence of a shift from the natural trend to that which is enhanced by, for example, anthropogenic forcing. In addition, cyclic trends analysis of hydrological extremes provides information on the cyclic behaviour of the extreme anomalies that have occurred over and above the natural climate variability and may link them to past consequences and their drivers. Analysis of long term records of extremes for rainfall, temperature and streamflows for selected stations in the Lake Victoria basin, were carried out based on a linear trend test, to detect significant monotonic trends, and quantile perturbation analysis, to detect significant temporal extreme anomalies. In addition, correlations between change in rainfall extremes and that for the other extremes, as well as <b>sunspot</b> <b>maxima,</b> were investigated. The findings indicated that extremes in the Lake Victoria basin are, generally, experiencing positive linear trends. Albeit positive trend was generally demonstrated, the presence of significant linear trend was manifested in the extremes of the data obtained from the stations located in the northern and eastern parts of the Lake Victoria basin. This may suggest that the monotony in the positive trend is a result of an ever increasing and consistent external enhancement of the natural climate agitation. The latter has implications for flood risks if the trend persists in the near future. The cyclic analysis of the behaviour of extremes indicated that the 1940 s and the 1970 s experienced significantly low extremes. Furthermore, the higher significant anomalies for the 1990 s, compared to that for the 1960 s, may suggest a more intense enhancement of the change in the natural variability in the recent climate. Correlation between change in the extremes for rainfall and that of the minimum daily temperature was demonstrated to be stronger (c. f. <b>maximum</b> temperature and <b>sunspot</b> <b>maxima)</b> implying that if such correlation persists in the future then change in the extremes of daily minimum temperature can be used as an indicator for the change in rainfall extremes. The investigation of the correlations between climate indices/solar activity and hydrometeorologcal extremes suggests that oceanic and solar influences are part of the explanation of the variability observed in rainfall and temperatures extremes in the Lake Victoria basin. status: publishe...|$|R

An internal dynamo due to the cyclic variation of nuclear energy generation inside the core of the sun is responsible for the solar activity cycle was suggested and thus the internal magnetic field is also variable. Again the changes in the nuclear energy generation induce structural changes that result in variations of the global solar parameters i. e., luminosity, radius and temperatures etc. From the analysis of total solar irradiance (TSI) data during the year from 1970 to 2003 we have found five phases within the solar activity cycle.
