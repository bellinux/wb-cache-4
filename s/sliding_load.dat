For dry <b>sliding</b> low <b>load</b> and speed combinations were chosen to correspond to the mild wear region below the Welsh T 1 transition. Lubricated tests were conducted under flooded conditions using Esso Technical White Oil alone and with a 0. 1 % stearic acid additive, for load and speed ranges that produced substantial amounts of asperity contact and thus a boundary lubricated regime of wear. The test material in all cases was AISI 52100 steel, for unlubricated <b>sliding</b> subjected to <b>loads</b> from 5 to 50 N and a range of speeds from 10 - 3 to 1. 0 ms- 1, and for lubricated <b>sliding</b> <b>loads</b> of 50 to 123 N and for speeds of 10 - 2 to 1. 0 ms- 1. Unlubricated wear debris was found to be a mixture of -Fe_ 2 O_ 3 and -Fe. Unlubricated wear was found to occur via a thin film logarithmic oxide growth followed by agglomeration into thicker oxide plateaux 2 to 10 m in thickness. Lubricated wear occurred via thick film diffusion controlled oxide growth producing homogeneous oxide plateaux 0. 1 to 0. 2 m in thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identified the presence of a surface film on pins worn in White Oil with stearic acid, which is thought to be iron stearate.

We find that (i) perpendicular load {{does not lead to}} stable ferroelectric switching in contrast to the load applied in the sliding contact load regime, due to nontrivial differences between the strain distributions in both regimes: ferroelectric switching for the perpendicular load mode is impaired by a strain gradient inversion layer immediately underneath the AFM tip; while for the <b>sliding</b> <b>load</b> regime, domain inversion is unimpaired within a greater material volume subjected to larger values of the mechanically induced electric field that includes the region behind the sliding tip; (ii) beyond a relatively small value of an applied force, increasing mechanical pressure does not increase the flexoelectric field inside the film, but results instead in a growing volume of the region subjected to such field that aids domain nucleation processes; and (iii) the flexoelectric coefficients of the films are of the order of few nC/m, which is much smaller than for bulk BaTiO 3 ceramics, indicating that there is a “flexoelectric size effect” that mirrors the ferroelectric one...|$|E
40|$|To {{validate}} {{the design process}} and {{ensure the safety of}} an important structure with sliding supports, a finite element-based force identification technique and a strain measurement point selection procedure have been presented in part I of this paper. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed force identification technique and measurement point selection procedure are now verified in part II of this paper through numerical investigations on a steel plate support structure. The relationship between the orthogonal property of the selected measurement points and the condition number of the identification equation and the effectiveness of the sequential orthogonal searching algorithm are examined through Monte Carlo simulation. Two cases on force identification of the steel plate structure are then presented: one case concerns concentrated sliding force acting either at node or inside grid, and the other case pertains uniformly distributed <b>sliding</b> <b>load</b> covering a fixed area. For both cases, the strain measurement points of fairly good orthogonal property are firstly determined using the proposed measurement point selection procedure. The positions and magnitudes of initial and final forces are then identified using the proposed force identification technique with or without measurement noise included. The identification results obtained from both cases show that the proposed force identification method can effectively locate and identify the concentrated sliding force and the uniformly distributed <b>sliding</b> <b>load</b> covering a fixed area with no information required on the initial position and magnitude of the sliding force. It is also illustrated that the increase of the number of measurement points can improve the accuracy of identification results. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
