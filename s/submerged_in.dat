5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently <b>submerged.</b> <b>In</b> oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E

5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|A damaged {{electric}} {{tower in}} Kenedy County resulted in power outages {{for thousands of}} people. At {{the height of the}} storm, an estimated 64,000people were without power in south Texas. Portions of Texas State Highway Loop 281 were <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> floodwaters, leaving $50,000 (1999USD) in damage. Damage in Corpus Christi were estimated at $100,000 (1999USD). In Duval County, 200 homes were damaged by flooding and large areas of agricultural land were flooded. Damage in the county amounted to roughly $2million (1999USD). Five other F0 tornadoes touched down in the state. Damage to homes and businesses in Corpus Christi was estimated up to $500,000 (1999USD); agricultural damage reached $1million and another $500,000 (1999USD) was reported in losses. Slick roads from Bret's heavy rains caused the collision of a truck and a tractor, killing four people. Damage amounted to $15million (1999USD) throughout southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> water {{for a long period of}} time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in good use was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park. Batman: The Ride survived, mainly because of its elevated station and corrosion-resistant support structure, which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> {{darkness}} for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now {{thought to have been}} fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of Apatosaurus suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 March, Triton spotted Guam and {{observed}} activity on shore via her periscope. Petty Officer Edward Carbullido (pictured), who had been born on Guam but had not returned home for 14 years, was asked to identify his parents' house through the periscope while the boat remained <b>submerged</b> <b>in</b> Agat Bay. Triton then changed course for the Philippines, the midpoint of her around-the-world voyage. Carbullido was subsequently able {{to go home to}} Guam for Christmas Day 1960 on a 60-day leave, with the cost of his flight paid for by selling a magazine article on Tritons circumnavigation written by Captain Beach, and with the assistance of Pan American Airways.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four 12-inch/40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft.
