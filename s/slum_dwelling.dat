50|$|As poverty {{becomes more}} {{concentrated}} in urban areas, one increasingly common phenomenon is {{the expansion of}} urban slums. Often built illegally {{in response to a}} lack of more permanent housing, slums have a specific set of problems associated with them. For instance, the lack of property rights and instability associated with a <b>slum</b> <b>dwelling</b> may mean that the resident would not be willing to invest in WASH services for a building that may not survive a storm, or from which she may be evicted. In addition, “New urban areas may be very heterogeneous—both ethnically and in terms of wealth distribution. They may face a constant influx of new migrants.” Such heterogeneity may make it difficult to coordinate efforts to build and maintain a shared sanitation system for slum neighborhoods.|$|E
50|$|For social historians Hay’s {{observations}} were {{typical of the}} time and reflected a dynamic change in the interaction between social problems, social thought and social action from the 1880s onwards and his work must be understood in the context of that change. As the population of Britain’s cities grew, so too did the problem of housing the poor. <b>Slum</b> <b>dwelling,</b> the public health and public order issues that were associated with overcrowded and insanitary housing challenged the minds of philosophers, sociologists, charities, philanthropists, local government and national government for decades. Were the poor morally blameworthy for their own condition? Why were there slum dwellings? How were the poor to be housed and who had the responsibility for housing them? These were questions that went to heart of how the late Victorians and Edwardians understood the very nature of society. The proposed solutions evolved and illustrate that in studying the intellectual and social history of the period, it is difficult to establish a causal nexus between social thought and social action.|$|E

40|$|Background: Urban {{population}} growth in developing countries especially in India is at a rapid pace {{in the past few}} decades. Growth of urban population is always accompanied by the growth of population in urban slums, which poses threat to the health of urban population, particularly, the health of the children. Objective: The present study aims to study whether the <b>slum</b> <b>dwelling</b> affects the child morbidity, low weight at birth, infant mortality, child malnutrition and anemia.   Methods: Until NFHS- 3, there was paucity of data on slums to analyze for a larger area and compare it with non-slum population. However, NFHS- 3 provides data from slums in eight cities and is used for the present study. The child health aspects considered here are: prevalence of diarrhea among children, prevalence of fever among children, prevalence of cough among children, infant death, low birth weight, malnutrition among children and anemia among children. Results: Slum children belong to lower socioeconomic strata than children from non-slum areas. Children living in slum areas are 1. 3 times, 1. 5 times and 1. 2 times more likely to suffer from diarrhea, cough and fever respectively than children living in non-slum areas. Multivariate results also showed that slum children have higher odds for low weight at birth (1. 4 times) and child anemia (1. 2 times) compared to non-slum children. Conclusion: <b>Slum</b> <b>dwelling</b> children are at a disadvantageous side in terms of child morbidity, anemia and weight at the time of birth.  </p...|$|E

It formed part of Disraeli's social reform initiative aimed at the [...] "elevation of the people" [...] (the working class), a policy stated in his 1872 speeches at Manchester and Crystal Palace, and associated with his doctrine of One Nation Conservatism.

40|$|Background: Urbanization is {{increasing}} around the world, and in India this trend has translated into {{an increase in}} the size of <b>slum</b> <b>dwellings.</b> <b>Slum</b> environments may {{have a negative effect on}} human health, in particular women’s health. The objective of the study is to determine factors associated with Indian women’s health in slum environments. Methods: The relationship between women’s health, measured by BMI, and demographic, behavioural, and socioeconomic factors was statistically modelled. A multiple linear regression was performed, using data from the India National Family Health Survey. Results: Increasing BMI is significantly and positively associated with: frequency of watching television, having diabetes, age, wealth index, and residency status in the areas of New Delhi, Andhra Pradesh or Tamil Nadu. Conclusion: While belonging to a scheduled tribe was not associated with changes in BMI, unadjusted rates suggest that tribal status may be worthy of deeper investigation. Among slum dwellers, there is a double-burden of under-nutrition and over-nutrition. Therefore a diverse set of interventions will be required to improve the health outcomes of these women...|$|R
