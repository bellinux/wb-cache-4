He places the orb down and leaves Picard on the <b>Stargazer</b> bridge. The orb lights up once more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the <b>Stargazer</b> in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the <b>Stargazer</b> powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious {{at the sight of the}} orb, which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E

Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the <b>Stargazer.</b>|$|E

Riker tells Picard about the orb; Picard seems to understand and fires his phaser at the orb, causing it to explode. After a few moments, Picard hails the Enterprise and requests a transport.

[...] After Picard fails to get the reference, Data (Brent Spiner) reminds him that nine years ago, at Maxia, he was attacked by an unidentified aggressor which he destroyed. Bok angrily shouts that ship in question was Ferengi. The ship is identified as the U.S.S. <b>Stargazer,</b> Picard's former command. Bok explains that he found the ship as a derelict and offers it to Picard for free. Picard explains that at Maxia, the <b>Stargazer</b> was heavily damaged before Picard executed an action which would {{come to be known as}} the [...] "Picard Maneuver". Using the warp drive, Picard ordered a short warp jump directly resulting in the enemy vessel's light speed based sensors briefly detecting the ship in two places at once and allowing Picard to win the battle. Due to the damage, the crew of the <b>Stargazer</b> abandoned ship after the battle.|$|E
500|$|The Constellation-class {{starship}} first {{appears in}} [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] as a desktop model in Picard's ready room. Rick Sternbach constructed the model by kitbashing Ertl kits {{of the movie}} Enterprise, using parts from other models such as the VF-1 Valkyrie to add detail. Greg Jein used Sternbach's and Andrew Probert's designs to create the four-foot shooting model of the USS <b>Stargazer</b> for [...] "The Battle". In the original script, the <b>Stargazer</b> {{was to be a}} redress of the movie-era Constitution-class Enterprise model that first appeared in Probert and Sternbach persuaded the producers not to reuse the movie Enterprise model, and the [...] "Constellation"-class label was chosen so that it could match LeVar Burton's lip movement to redub dialogue.|$|E
500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the <b>Stargazer</b> during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} <b>Stargazer</b> crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For me, it was a real creative stretch and it felt great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E

500|$|Story editor André Bormanis {{explained}} in a web chat just before the airing of the episode that they had sought to ensure that Jean-Luc Picard was Captain who made first contact with the Ferengi officially; Bormanis commented that he thought the episode was funny. The Ferengi made their first appearance in the [...] episode [...] "", having been created by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry and producer Herbert Wright. The events of the episode [...] "" [...] established that it was Picard on board the USS <b>Stargazer</b> at the Battle of Maxia that made the official first contact with the race {{on behalf of the}} Federation.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the first}} time that Ronald D. Moore wrote a Q-based episode, and he was excited by the idea of giving Picard a near death {{experience}} and Q appearing to the Captain as if he were God. His plan for [...] "Tapestry" [...] was to follow a similar path to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, but with Q playing a similar role to the three ghosts in Dickens' story. Moore envisaged three stages to the story, one where Picard is attacked and needs an artificial heart, another with Picard as a child and a third based on the USS <b>Stargazer.</b> He pitched the idea to executive producer Michael Piller, who wasn't enthusiastic about the premise. The combination of that disapproval and the expected cost of filming because of the additional sets required meant that the episode had to be trimmed.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the <b>Stargazer</b> using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
