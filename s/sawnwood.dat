50|$|Major {{agricultural}} products include cassava (tapioca), corn, cocoa, millet, palm oil, peanuts, rice, rubber, sorghum, and yams. In 2003, livestock production, {{in order of}} metric tonnage, featured eggs, milk, beef and veal, poultry, and pork, respectively. In the same year, the total fishing catch was 505.8 metric tons. Roundwood removals totaled slightly less than 70 million cubic meters, and <b>sawnwood</b> production was estimated at 2 million cubic meters. The agricultural sector suffers from extremely low productivity, reflecting reliance on antiquated methods. Agriculture has failed {{to keep pace with}} Nigeria's rapid population growth, so that the country, which once exported food, now imports a significant amount of food to sustain itself. However, efforts are being made towards making the country food sufficient again.|$|E
50|$|Algeria’s {{agricultural}} sector, which {{contributes about}} 8 {{percent of gross domestic}} product (GDP) but employs 14 percent of the workforce, is unable to meet the food needs of the country’s population. As a result, some 45 percent of food is imported. The primary crops are wheat, barley, and potatoes. Farmers also have had success growing dates for export. Cultivation is concentrated in the fertile coastal plain of the Tell region, which represents just a slice of Algeria’s total territory. Altogether, only about 3 percent of Algerian territory is arable. Even in the Tell, rainfall variability has a significant impact on production. Government efforts to stimulate farming in the less arable steppe and desert regions have met with limited success. However, herdsmen maintain livestock, specifically cow and sheep in the High Plateaus region. Algeria’s climate and periodic fires are not conducive to a thriving forestry industry. However, Algeria is a producer of cork and Aleppo pine. In 2005 roundwood removals totaled 7.8 million cubic meters, while <b>sawnwood</b> production amounted to only 13 million cubic meters per year. Algeria’s fishing industry does not take full advantage of the Mediterranean coast, in part because fishing is generally done from small family-owned boats instead of large commercial fishing trawlers. However, the government is attempting to boost the relatively small catch—slightly more than 125,000 metric tons in 2005—by modernizing fishing ports, permitting foreigners to fish in Algerian waters, and subsidizing fishing-related projects.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} <b>sawnwood</b> {{supply in}} the Finnish sawmilling industry using the database approach. The analyses help to understand the supply and demand of <b>sawnwood</b> between customers and sawmills. In the analyses two databases were {{used to examine the}} supply of <b>sawnwood.</b> In addition, the following three criteria were used: 1) quantity, 2) price and 3) quality. The study focused on a sample of 63, 774 sales of over 19 million m 3 <b>sawnwood</b> from 1995 to 2000. Quality in the thesis is defined in terms of dimensions, quality classes, end moisture contents and user segments. The coniferous species in the sample were Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Additionally, time series data about the consumption of coniferous <b>sawnwood</b> from the years between 1961 and 2002 was used in the study. The most essential new result of the thesis was that the features of <b>sawnwood</b> as a commodity product were clear in the sample from 1995 to 2000. Nevertheless, the marketing and the operations of the Finnish sawmilling industry at the time emphasised the features related to special and customer products. In 2002, the global consumption of coniferous <b>sawnwood</b> (CSW) was 283 million m 3. The same year in Finland, the consumption of <b>sawnwood</b> increased to 1. 02  m 3 per capita, the highest in the world. Finland experienced a structural change in the <b>sawnwood</b> consumption between the periods of 1961 - 1996 and 1997 - 2002. From 1995 to 2000, <b>sawnwood</b> supply and sales from Finnish sawmills were largely limited to only a few volume dimensions. For pine, 20 % of the number of dimensions encompassed 91 % of volume and 90 % of value. For spruce, 20 % of the number of dimensions covered 82 % of volume and 83 % of value. The Pareto principle assumption applied to the distribution of <b>sawnwood</b> dimensions from the quantity (m 3) and value (€) perspectives. There was a <b>sawnwood</b> market trend towards smaller batch sizes. It was observed that the end moisture content class MC 18 % has a dominant position – over 90 % – in the end moisture content distribution. The results supported the view that <b>sawnwood</b> supply consists mainly of a limited number standard products. Dimensions had big differences specific to country and species of timber. The basis price system worked by dimension, quality class and species with a defined basis of pine 50  ×  150  mm U/S or similar. This system was used in the pricing of <b>sawnwood</b> in the Finnish sawmilling industry in 2000. In the analyses, the supply of <b>sawnwood</b> was divided according to end moisture content classes, countries, dimensions and segments. In the supply analyses, standard dimensions and qualities were linked with the standard moisture content classes as MC 18 %. The results showed that the supply was greatest for standardised <b>sawnwood.</b> The supply and demand for special qualities increased particularly for pine. There was a correlation between <b>sawnwood</b> export countries, moisture content classes and end-user segments. The results showed that <b>sawnwood</b> user segmentation was still unfinished. The thesis seeks to present such methods that give relevant information to sawmills and other segments of the forest cluster. These useful methods include logistic regressions and other statistical tools. Applying these tools can give new insight into business management as well as the dynamics of the demand for <b>sawnwood</b> and other wood products. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|India is a {{fast growing}} economy {{with a high}} rate of gross {{domestic}} product that has improved the local spending power and has turned the country into a potential player in the global economy. In terms of wood products, India has been a net importer and currently is one the largest consumers of hardwood <b>sawnwood</b> in the world. The demand for <b>sawnwood</b> is rapidly growing in India and due to this situation, the country is a potential destination for Finnish and foreign exporters able to reach this market. The research attempted to increase the understanding {{of the importance of the}} demand for <b>sawnwood</b> in India. Thus, the purposes of this study are to: 1) provide a general description about the market environment of <b>sawnwood</b> in India and its situation at global level; 2) model and estimate potential factors impacting the demand level for Indian imports of sawnwood; 3) draw general conclusions about key opportunities and challenges for Finnish and major foreign exporters of <b>sawnwood</b> in the Indian market. Despite there is valuable information published about India’s wood market, empirical research on the Indian <b>sawnwood</b> market is scarce and unreliable. Hence, based on descriptive and explanatory methods, this study gathered secondary data from official and international sources for background and statistical information. The purpose was to analyze the <b>sawnwood</b> market through empirical modelling. Thus, econometric time-series modeling, for the period of 1992 - 2013, was used to explain the demand for imports of <b>sawnwood</b> in the Indian market by testing the conventional demand model, for income and price variables, and ad hoc models, for several explanatory variables. In addition, Engle and Granger, MacKinnon and Johansen methods were used to test cointegration among variables. The results suggest that the demand for imports of <b>sawnwood</b> is positively related to consumer income and negatively to prices. In addition, it depends on other factors such as population density, unemployment and economic openness. However, based on the elasticity estimates, the Indian <b>sawnwood</b> demand seems to be income and price elastic. The knowledge obtained in this study provides a valuable tool for foreign wood-based industries searching for market prospects to export their products as well as for public authorities involved in formulating forest and economic policies. However, further modelling is left for future research in this area...|$|E

The analysis was carried out with the data collected on roundwood and <b>sawnwood</b> over 33 years (1970 – 2003) using the long run restricted ECM. The statistical significance of the ECM terms for roundwood (- 1. 110) and <b>sawnwood</b> (- 1. 772) validates the existence of relationship among the variables. This suggests the short run dynamic effect of the changes in export quantities of roundwood are determined by one-year lagged export quantity of roundwood & domestic output-consumption ratio of roundwood, domestic output-consumption ratio of roundwood and domestic-international price ratio of roundwood, while that of <b>sawnwood</b> is determined by lagged values of the official exchange rate, domestic consumption-output, domestic consumption-output and world export-output ratios of the <b>sawnwood.</b> Efforts to boost timber export from Nigeria needs to incorporate policy measures that will improve {{the quantity and quality of}} timber products in order to meet the local and foreign demands. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the recent}} {{development}} and {{current state of}} Russian forest sector are reviewed in order to evaluate its significance in a global scale. The main {{emphasis is on the}} utilisation and management of Russian forest resources and on the recent development in roundwood and <b>sawnwood</b> exports, which currently comprise over 50 per cent of the total forest product export from Russia. Since the beginning of the 1990 s, Russian forest sector has undergone a deep structural change. The privatisation of forest industry, institutional changes, liberalisation of forest product s prices and intensified participation in international trade have strengthened Russia s role as an important wood procurement region as well as a noteworthy producer of low value-added forest products such as <b>sawnwood.</b> Due to economic and political reforms such as the devaluation of rouble in 1998, fellings and exports of roundwood and <b>sawnwood</b> have begun recovering after the drop in the early 1990 s. In 2002, fellings in Russia totalled 165 million cubic metres whereas roundwood and <b>sawnwood</b> exports reached 37. 7 million and 9 million cubic metres, respectively. In Europe, Russia has become an important actor in <b>sawnwood</b> markets. In German <b>sawnwood</b> market, for example, the market share of Russia is the largest of <b>sawnwood</b> importing countries. Roundwood trade with Finland and Sweden, the largest European importers of Russian roundwood, has increased during the transition period and comprises nowadays approximately one fifth of industrial use of roundwood in both the countries. Currently, Russia is negotiating for participating in World Trade Organisation, the new Forest Code is under construction and Russian Federation tries to attract investments in forest sector. Furthermore, the economic growth in Russia is rapid and it will evidently increase the domestic demand for forest products. Vast forest resources in Russia provide a solid base for increasing forest industry capacity in the area. On the other hand, many obstacles such as lack of infrastructure, heavy bureaucracy and undeveloped financial institutions, some to mention, still exist in Russia. In the future, it is nevertheless likely that Russian forest sector will progress towards a more significant role both in national and international business...|$|E

40|$|Domestic timber {{consumption}} in Central Africa, which is predominantly fed with <b>sawnwood</b> of informal origin, is important both economically and socially. No {{one has yet}} addressed the information {{needed in order to}} develop the conditions that will improve the legality of timber trade and practices. This report aims to fill that gap by reviewing the demand and supply of different wood products in the Cameroonian domestic market (Yaoundé and Douala) in order to identify the opportunities that would promote the consumption of <b>sawnwood</b> and furniture of legal origin, which would strengthen the sustainable management of timber resources and encourage long-term, green economic growth. Private and public demands for timber are mainly for three uses: construction material for the building and public works (BPW) sector, for frames and for furniture. These demands are expressed at four marketing levels: 1. The urban markets: Approximately 830, 000 m 3 of <b>sawnwood</b> are sold per year, mainly in the form of planks, formworks, laths and rafters. This sector's characteristics have undergone little change over the last decade, with identical products, prices and species each year. The average price of 1 m 3 charged in the urban markets for all <b>sawnwood</b> categories combined is about XAF 80, 000. Products that are declared to be of legal origin (as they come from industrial mills) represent between 12 and 18 % of the volume sold. However, between 15 and 34 % of customers reported that they would purchase legal timber if their income increased by between 20 and 100 % in the next 5 years. In addition, half of the buyers interviewed stated that they would pay 10 % more in order to acquire timber from legal origins. This estimate depends on the occupation of the buyer, the product bought and the timber species of the product. Finally, the interviewed buyers stated that they could bear a 45 % increase in current <b>sawnwood</b> prices before substituting them with alternative products. So, demand would exist even if the supply price of timber increased in urban markets, which would at least improve the legality and the quality of certain types of <b>sawnwood</b> in the short and medium term. 2. The joinery workshops: A total of 515 interviewed workshops produce about 130, 000 items of furniture per year, for a total volume of 22, 000 m 3 of timber after fourth transformation and a turnover of more than XAF 8 billion. Cabinets, beds and doors are the best-selling products, in terms of value and volume. Urban consumers are interested in getting the best prices for wooden furniture. There is a lack of interest in sourcing <b>sawnwood</b> of legal and sustainable origin; only 19 joinery workshops met a demand for wood of legal origin in 2015 for a total sale of just 61 items of furniture. 3. The furniture shops: From January to October 2015, 166 shops surveyed sold 22, 282 items of furniture, corresponding to a sawn volume of 5788 m 3 and a turnover of XAF 3. 33 billion. Beds were the main piece of furniture sold by these shops. The legality of the material used for the manufacturing of furniture sold in the shops is an extremely rare concern for buyers in Yaoundé and Douala. Since their creation, only 10 % of the sampled shops have reported any demand for wood from legal sources. During the survey period, the shops sold only 78 items of furniture to buyers who were concerned about the legality of the raw material. 4. Public contracts: National and international public agencies have almost not developed a strategy towards promoting the legal origin of the timber used in public contracts. Yet between July 2015 and June 2016, 1029 calls to tender including timber works were published in the Journal of Public Contracts of Cameroon, for 2134 sites for construction or renovation of public infrastructure. Classrooms make up the majority of this category of tenders. This public demand for <b>sawnwood</b> is close to 13, 000 m 3 per year, making the Government of Cameroon the main buyer of <b>sawnwood</b> and furniture in the domestic market. To meet these different demands, there are four supposedly legal sources of <b>sawnwood</b> and furniture in the Cameroonian domestic markets: 1. Community forests (CF) : after the provisions of the Forest Act of 1994, the CF were successful in the early 2000 s but ultimately had a low impact viii on legal production of <b>sawnwood,</b> due to the many procedures imposed by the government. On the basis of the annual permits granted by the government and under the assumption of a legal production of 60 m 3 /year/CF, the total production of the CF has never reached 10, 000 m 3 of timber per year. The cost price of 1 m 3 of <b>sawnwood</b> charged by a CF and sold in the market is at least XAF 150, 000. 2. The timber exploitation permit (PEBO) allows for the exploitation of about 160 m 3 of <b>sawnwood</b> each. After having been suspended for nearly a decade, the ministry in charge of forests launched two calls to tender in 2012 for 159 PEBOs, out of which only 51 were successful, indicating a maximum volume of 8000 m 3 of potentially exploitable timber. Implementing the PEBO procedures is expensive as the cost price of 1 m 3 of timber is estimated at XAF 280, 000. This explains why many PEBO holders were not engaged in production, at least for the domestic market. 3. Industries: Tracking the sales of <b>sawnwood</b> in the urban markets of Yaoundé and Douala in 2009 – 10 showed that approximately 145, 000 m 3 of timber came from industrial sawmills. Yet, very few industrial mills stated that they were active on the domestic market. Their sales in this market remain focused on white wood of nonexportable quality. However, even for these lowquality products, company prices in the urban markets are 30 to 50 % higher than current <b>sawnwood</b> prices. There is also a large quantity of scrap from industrial sawmills, {{for which there is no}} monitoring on the part of these companies. 4. Wooden furniture imports have doubled since 2007, reaching a turnover of XAF 5. 3 billion in 2015, which corresponds to 10, 000 m 3. This trend indicates an inability of the domestic producers to meet new demands, due to a lack of equipment and technical and commercial training. There are two major obstacles to the emergence of a domestic market of legally <b>sawnwood</b> in Cameroon. Buyers' acceptance to purchase <b>sawnwood</b> at higher prices due to the legalization of the sector will not be sufficient to cover the current cost prices of legally <b>sawnwood,</b> whether they come from the CF, the PEBO or industries. The maximum production of <b>sawnwood</b> of legal origin today can only meet the needs of a few consumers. The legalization of the national market of timber in Cameroon therefore faces a double constraint of price and volume. Reducing the cost of production of legal <b>sawnwood</b> for the domestic market is the approach most often mentioned and tested to some extent. This supplyside support policy is difficult to implement for many reasons linked to the cost of implementation of the PEBO, bad governance, which spoils CF or the lack of interest by the timber industries in this market that is considered to be less profitable. However, measures have been considered and tested by the government to force companies into increasingly supplying urban markets, particularly from their allotted concessions. A complementary approach of supporting private and public demands of <b>sawnwood</b> of legal origin could be promoted. Some consumers are already willing to pay more to acquire legal products, including products and species that are currently identified. Increasing the income of the middle class will only reinforce this trend in the medium term. Finally, the Cameroonian government is promoting the idea of requiring the supply of legal timber in all public markets that would have a significant impact not only on the general public, but also on the global economy.

40|$|Ability {{to predict}} the <b>sawnwood</b> demand {{provides}} competitive advantage for <b>sawnwood</b> producers. It helps <b>sawnwood</b> producers to better manage the supply against the demand in the markets they operate in. This thesis studied <b>sawnwood</b> demand forecasting based on machine learning approaches. The goal {{of the study was}} to examine how well different machine learning models are able to predict <b>sawnwood</b> demand and how does the performance of the models differ in different markets? The final model is an ensemble of machine learning models which takes the weighted sum of the predictions produced by five different machine learning algorithms: the K nearest neighbours, the Random forest, the Support vector with radial basis function kernel, the Support vector machine with polynomial kernel and the Neural network. Six different variables were given as input features for the model. The performance of model was evaluated based on a case study in which four different data sets were used for testing the prediction accuracy of the model. The performance of the models was measured with three error metrics the MAPE, the MAE and the RMSE. In addition, the developed ensemble model was compared with the individual learning algorithms and a naive forecast. The results show that the Ensemble estimator outperforms the five individual learning algorithms and the Naive forecast measured in all three error metrics when the errors are calculated as the average of the four data sets. However, when the results are compared at the individual data set level, the Ensemble estimator performs the best only on four out of the twelve cases. The results indicate that a single method cannot provide the best answer in all of the cases. In addition, the performance of the models vary when the results are compared by taking the moving average of the predicted values. The error rates decrease more for more advanced learning algorithms like the Support vector machines, the Neural network and the Ensemble estimator. This indicates that these models are able to capture the trend component better from the data sets. Finally, the study shows that there are differences how well the models can predict the <b>sawnwood</b> demand in different markets. The effect of the data sets' characteristics on the prediction accuracy of the models decreases for more advanced models, when the data sets are aggregated...|$|E
40|$|Discrepancies in {{bilateral}} trade statistics for forest products have recently attracted attention as potential indicators of illegal trade practices. For example, if exporters understate quantities to evade export taxes or quotas, then {{one might expect}} reported exports {{to be less than}} reported imports. Discrepancies in trade statistics can exist for reasons {{that have nothing to do}} with illegal activities, however, such as measurement error and shipment lags. Any attempt to infer evidence of illegal activities from statistical discrepancies must control for these other explanations. The author estimates the discrepancies between reported imports and exports for bilateral flows of <b>sawnwood</b> traded by Romania and other European countries. The author also examines whether these discrepancies reflect illegal activities by the traders. The mean discrepancy for <b>sawnwood</b> exported by Romania during 1982 - 97 was significantly different from zero for coniferous <b>sawnwood</b> but not for nonconiferous <b>sawnwood.</b> Yet the sign of the discrepancy for coniferous sawnwood-reported exports tended to be greater than reported imports-implies that illegal trade activities were more likely occurring in Romania's trading partners than in Romania. An econometric analysis of {{bilateral trade}} statistics for Romania and other European countries finds evidence that measurement error, shipment lags, and intentional underreporting all play a role in explaining discrepancies for both types of <b>sawnwood.</b> The econometric model is not sufficiently reliable, however, for estimating the portion that was due solely to illegal activities or determining whether those activities occurred primarily in Romania or in its trading partners. Moreover, given that it is based on observed discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics, it fails to detect illegal trade activities that occur simultaneously in both importing and exporting countries. For these reasons, econometric methods appear unlikely to be of practical use in revealing illegal trade activities in the Romanian forest sector.

40|$|Strip clear-cutting (or the Palcazú Forest Management System) is {{a natural}} forest {{management}} system where narrow strips are clear-cut with harvest cycles of every 40 Â years. We assessed the economic sustainability of this system by calculating net present values (NPVs) {{at the time of}} a second harvest in two strips clear-cut in 1989, in the Peruvian Amazon. NPVs were calculated under three growth models or scenarios: (1) realistic (all light environments), (2) optimistic (higher light as could be achieved under intensive forest management), and (3) growth potential (fastest growing individuals). For each scenario, we calculated the production and value of timber products (<b>sawnwood,</b> roundwood, and charcoal), and their cost of harvesting, processing and transport. For comparison purposes, these calculations were also done for a deferment-cut treatment, applied in 1989 to half of one of the two strips. The three growth models predicted a production of 1. 88 to 22. 43 Â m 3 /ha of <b>sawnwood,</b> 81 to 92 Â pieces/ha of roundwood, and 11 to 19 Â ton/ha of charcoal from clear-cut strips. The total value of these products ranged from $ 3112 to $ 10, 511 /ha, assuming that <b>sawnwood</b> was purchased at certified prices. The total cost of harvesting, processing, and transport of timber products ranged from $ 3020 to $ 6167 /ha. Net earnings ranged from -$ 75 /ha to +$ 4344 /ha. The net present value (NPV) of the clear-cut strips with certified <b>sawnwood</b> ranged between -$ 54 /ha and +$ 1271 /ha at a 5 % discount rate, and between -$ 73 /ha and +$ 78 /ha at a 15 % discount rate, the most realistic rate for Peru. These values were much lower than +$ 131 to +$ 540, the range of NPV at 15 % discount rate for the deferment-cut treatment with certified <b>sawnwood.</b> The strip clear-cutting system is not economically sustainable due to slow tree growth, low income from timber products, and high costs for this system.

This paper {{examines}} the long-run influence of exchange rate changes on the Finnish <b>sawnwood</b> price in the United Kingdom (UK) using quarterly data for the period 1978 – 1994. The degree of influence was measured by a pass-through coefficient (PT) obtained from a markup pricing relation of a system model. The model, which included export demand and price equations, was estimated with the cointegration method of Johansen. The results indicated a large PT, which means that exchange rate changes are reflected almost proportionately in Finnish export price expressed in pounds sterling. Thus, the Finnish price of <b>sawnwood</b> in pounds has lowered {{as a result of}} depreciation of the Finnish markka (FIM). This has improved Finnish competitiveness and market share in the UK. Appreciation of the FIM has had the opposite effect. It seems that Finnish exporters have made use of depreciations and devaluations of the FIM to maintain and increase their market shares but not necessarily their markups. For Finland, which {{is in the process of}} joining the European economic and monetary union (EMU), knowing the size of the PT is also important in assessing the economic impact of membership...|$|E
40|$|The study {{tests the}} {{potential}} of machine learning models to analyse and forecast global bilateral trade flows of soft <b>sawnwood</b> by countries. The empirical trade flow data including annual import and export quantities and prices of soft <b>sawnwood</b> from 2000 to 2014 is obtained from FAOStat. We compare forecasting results from three methods, which can be classified as machine learning models: support vector machines (SVM), Neural networks and Random forests that is an ensemble of decision trees. The {{significant changes in the}} global <b>sawnwood</b> markets in the North America, Asia and Western Europe after the financial and economic crises of 2008 - 2009 raise the question to update the modelling of trade flows. The information on the global trade flow developments are important for decision makers involved in strategic planning and forecasting at the European Union-, national- or industry level. The aim {{of this study is to}} test methods previously quite rarely applied in the forest sector market modelling, but which could be helpful for analysts to visualize and examine a large amount of bilateral trade data to have a view on ongoing changes and to assess next years’ developments. The results also support the Finnish Forest Sector Outlook Studies, which are published biannually by the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke). As an example we present empirical results for Finland and for some of its main competitor countries and export destinations. 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of {{internal and external}} European timber trade {{is the purpose of}} this survey, in order to provide a precious tool in the decision-making process for the European enterprises of the timber sector; particularly those that import raw material of <b>sawnwood</b> (furniture sector, building activities etc), but also those that process round wood and export their products or think about exports. The analysis can also contribute to the determination of suitable policies of the member- countries of EU for the above- mentioned sector. The {{analysis of}} a 39 year time series (1964 - 2002), the creation of indicators, and the determination of forecasting models for the imports, exports, production, apparent consumption and <b>sawnwood</b> self-sufficiency indicators for the EU 25, result that the above variables show augmentative tendencies in volume, a reduction of product price at 35. 6 %, for the last decade and a self-sufficiency indicator of 93 %, while countries such a...|$|E

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{secondary}} wood processing {{are assumed to}} evolve over time and to affect the requirements set for the wood material and its suppliers. The study aimed at analysing the industrial operating modes applied by joinery and furniture manufacturers as <b>sawnwood</b> users. Industrial operating mode {{was defined as a}} pattern of important decisions and actions taken by a company which describes the company's level of adjustment in the late-industrial transition. A non-probabilistic sample of 127 companies was interviewed, including companies from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland. Fifty-two of the firms were furniture manufacturers and the other 75 were producing windows and doors. Variables related to business philosophy, production operations, and supplier choice criteria were measured and used as a basis for a customer typology; variables related to wood usage and perceived sawmill performance were measured to be used to profile the customer types. Factor analysis was used to determine the latent dimensions of industrial operating mode. Canonical correlations analysis was applied in developing the final base for classifying the observations. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to build a five-group typology of secondary wood processing firms; these ranged from traditional mass producers to late-industrial flexible manufacturers. There is a clear connection between the amount of late-industrial elements in a company and the share of special and customised <b>sawnwood</b> it uses. Those joinery or furniture manufacturers that are more late-industrial also are likely to use more component-type wood material and to appreciate customer-oriented technical precision. The results show that the change is towards the use of late-industrial <b>sawnwood</b> materials and late-industrial supplier relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} Finnish forest {{industry}} products remains {{good in the}} world markets both {{this year and next}} year, with the exception of printing and writing papers. The production and export volumes of wood products, pulp, and cardboard increase, whereas the average unit prices of exports remain mainly close to the last year’s levels. Only the export price of pulp is expected to rise more rigorously this year. In 2018, development will be rather similar to this year, although the growth in the production and export volumes of Finnish forest industry is forecast to slow down slightly from this year. The revenues from paper exports continue to decline, but the decline is counterbalanced by the export earnings from <b>sawnwood,</b> plywood, cardboard and pulp. The sharp growth in pulp production and export volumes are attributable to the full implementation of new production capacity in Finland in the coming year. The exports prices of forest industry products are not expected to change significantly. In wood products industry, the production and exports volumes of <b>sawnwood</b> and plywood will grow from last year. The Finnish <b>sawnwood</b> exports will be record high again this year, and the exports will continue to grow next year as well. This year, China will become the main target country for Finnish <b>sawnwood</b> exports, both in terms of volume and value. In addition to spruce <b>sawnwood,</b> the exports of pine <b>sawnwood</b> are growing to China, to which pine <b>sawnwood</b> flows have been directed from the troubled North African market. Although the decline in the export price of pine <b>sawnwood</b> is expected to gradually fade, the difference between the export prices of pine and spruce <b>sawnwood</b> will remain substantial this year, which is reflected negatively in the profitability of pine <b>sawnwood</b> production. In 2018, the production and exports of plywood will grow from the current year, which is due to the continued growth in construction in Europe and investments especially in LVL production in Finland. Although paper account for more than one third of the export earnings of the Finnish forest industry, the declining trend in paper production and export volumes will continue this year and next year. This is mainly attributable to the falling demand for printing and writing paper in the world markets and reduced production capacity in Finland. Instead, the demand for other paper assortments is growing in packaging as well as in hygiene and household use. The positive drive of the global economy and trade increases the need for packaging, which enhances the demand for cardboard. The growth in production capacity in Finland enables the expansion of cardboard production and exports both this year and next year. Despite the increase in demand, the export price of cardboard will rise only slightly. The introduction of new capacity and the conversions of paper machines into cardboard production will inflate supply in Europe and create pressure on the market prices. With the new capacity, the production and exports of pulp will grow this year and next year. Growth will be more pronounced in 2018, when the new investments will be in full production. The importance of China as export destination for Finnish pulp is growing year-on-year and China’s share of pulp exports is already one third. The unit price of Finnish pulp exports fluctuates strongly along with world market prices, and according to price development {{in the first half of}} this year, the export price of pulp is to rise this year after a fair drop experienced last year. Next year, the export price of pulp is expected to fall slightly as softwood and hardwood pulp production is expanding worldwide. As the prices of the main raw materials are expected to develop moderately, the profitability of the pulp and paper industry is expected to remain at a good level both this year and next year. The growth in the production and export volumes of the forest industry products will increase the commercial fellings to 63. 6 million cubic metres this year and to 65. 0 million cubic metres next year. The growth in the use of roundwood in Finland is mainly satisfied by expanding the use of domestic wood. Roundwood imports are expected to decrease below 9 million cubic meters this year but to grow again next year. Due to the healthy demand for spruce <b>sawnwood,</b> the stumpage price of spruce sawlogs will rise most strongly this year. The increasing use of spruce and pine pulpwood in cardboard and pulp production will raise their stumpage prices this year. No major changes in stumpage prices are expected to occur next year. In non-industrial private forestry, the gross stumpage earnings rose to EUR 1. 8 billion last year and they are is estimated to grow to EUR 1. 9 billion this year, thanks to the increasing fellings and rising stumpage prices. Also next year, the stumpage earnings are expected to rise. In non-industrial private forestry, the operating profit per hectare is EUR 126 in 2017 and EUR 129 in 2018. The use of forest energy is still far short of laid goals. The cheap emission allowances, the low world market price of coal, and the uncertainty related EU policies that may affect the profitability of forest biomass in energy use will shift investment decisions to the future and hamper the greater growth in forest energy. On an annual level, weather conditions also have a strong influence on the use of forest energy. In 2017, the use of forest chips is estimated to grow by two per cent, and next year, the use is expected to increase further to 8. 5 million cubic meters. This year, the average purchase price of forest chips at plant will remain at last year's level and next year the price will rise only slightly. The production of wood pellets in Finland will recover this year after the sharp decline in production volumes last year. Although production volumes in both the wood products and pulp and paper industries are projected to increase this year and next year, the number of employees in the forest industry will decrease according to the statistics on the beginning of this year. Although there are sectoral differences, automation and general growth in productivity will reduce the need for labour, and employment in the forest industry will decline by a couple of per cent this year. In forestry and despite the growth in commercial fellings, the employment is also expected to decline this year. The introduction of e-commerce in wood trade, the overcapacity in harvesting, and the use of foreign labour in forest management will decrease the demand for domestic labour. In 2017, employment in forestry is estimated to fall to 21, 000. Next year, both in the forest industry and in the forestry, the number of employees will remain at this year's level...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the Brazilian exports of <b>sawnwood</b> of non-coniferous, veneer sheets and plywood, from 1961 to 2002. The data {{regarding}} the three studied products, <b>sawnwood</b> of non-coniferous, veneer sheets and plywood, were joined through the method of Fisher so that an econometric evaluation of the market of the three products could be carried out. Supply and demand models of the Brazilian exports were specified. The results were satisfactory and they match with the literature. The supply of exports presented a positive answer {{in relation to the}} exporter's remuneration, to the production, {{to the use of the}} installed capacity (cycles of domestic economical activity) and to the tendency, and negative in relation to the internal demand. The demand for the Brazilian exports was influenced positively by the world income, participation index and tendency, and negatively for the relative price. The low elasticity-price of the found demand can have implications in the conservation of the Brazilian forest resources because the exporters can increase the prices, reduce the amounts and still increase the incomes. </p...|$|E
