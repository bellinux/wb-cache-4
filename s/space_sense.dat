40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{effective}} corn {{plant population}} and <b>spacing</b> <b>sensing</b> system {{may provide a}} key layer of field variability information useful for crop management. An algorithm was developed to count corn plants and to estimate plant location and intra−row spacing in segmented images of 6. 1 −m (20 −ft) long row sections. Images were scanned to detect and determine the boundaries of top projected corn plant canopy objects using a chain code methodology. Plant objects were fused together based on a multi−step process that took into account the spatial structure of the crop row. Position, roundness, and area of plant canopies were used to distinguish between corn plants and weeds. Estimates of plant counts in row sections were compared with manual counts across three growth stages, three populations, and three tillage treatments. Overall, the system estimated the number of plants with an RMSE of 1. 49 plants per row section, which corresponds to 6. 2 % RMSE or 3210 plants/ha (1300 plants/acre). No evidence of significant differences in mean plant spacing estimates was detected although significant, albeit small, increases in spacing variance were detected. These results demonstrate the importance of canopy shape and size analysis {{in the implementation of}} a machine vision plant population and intra−row <b>spacing</b> <b>sensing</b> system...|$|R

An abstract data structure together {{with a set of}} operation UNION is then implemented on the segment tree data structure. The solution of the visibility problem relies mainly on a two-way scan conversion process and the hidden line problem is formulated as a set union problem. The worst case complexity of the presented algorithm is O(sn log s) where n is the number of polygons and s is a resolution. The algorithm is output sensitive in the image <b>space</b> <b>sense.</b> In certain situations priority order is given or easily computable and resolution of raster space is very high.

40|$|International audienceWe {{examine the}} general regularization model {{which is based}} on total-variation for the {{structural}} part and a Hilbert-space norm for the oscillatory part. This framework generalizes the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi and the Osher-Sole-Vese models and opens way for new denoising or decomposition methods with tunable norms, which are adapted {{to the nature of the}} noise or textures of the image. We give sufficient conditions and prove the convergence of an iterative numerical implementation, following Chambolle's projection algorithm. In this paper we focus on the denoising problem. In order to provide an automatic solution, a systematic method for choosing the weight between the energies is imperative. The classical method for selecting the weight parameter according to the noise variance is reformulated in a Hilbert <b>space</b> <b>sense.</b> Moreover, we generalize a recent study of Gilboa-Sochen-Zeevi where the weight parameter is selected such that the denoised result is close to optimal, in the SNR sense. A broader definition of SNR, which is frequency weighted, is formulated in the context of inner products. A necessary condition for maximal SNR is provided. Lower and upper bounds on the SNR performance of the classical and optimal strategies are established, under quite general assumptions...|$|E
