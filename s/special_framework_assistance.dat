40|$|Greece has {{the most}} {{extensive}} coastline among all Mediterranean countries {{and a large number}} of islands, some of which are quite small. Its coastal zone has significant value from both a socio-economic and ecological viewpoint. However, in the last decades the coastal zones face continuous deterioration, as a result of increasing pressures for development. The protection and proper management of coastal areas in Greece should be a priority. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) offers a proper framework for organizing action in coastal areas in a broader framework of a strategy towards sustainable development. However, so far, coastal issues are dealt with in the context of general environmental protection and land-use planning policies. Recently a <b>Special</b> <b>Framework</b> for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development for Coastal Areas has been adopted to guide public policy, providing a policy platform towards ICZM. The article aims at an overview of existing policies, institutional arrangements and policy instruments vis-à-vis the problems of the Greek coastal areas.

These are examined against a background of recent developments at the EU level for ICZM along with the experience gained from initiatives at the national level...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{and provides}} an overview of the main theme of this volume and explores the possibility of localizing humanitarian <b>assistance</b> <b>frameworks</b> with regard to East African pastoralists. It is incorrect to depict the livelihood of East African pastoralists without considering humanitarian assistance and its secondary effects. However, too little {{attention has been paid to}} the issue. Many studies have revealed that humanitarian assistance is not necessarily a neutral, impartial, and apolitical act. In addition, cultural diversity has not yet been examined thoroughly in humanitarian research, although humanitarian assistance is not an acultural practice. To respond to cultural diversity and current reality of the transformation, I introduce the “articulation-sphere approach, ” which focuses on the intermediate realm between the local and the universal. This approach may not only show us an initial sign of the self-help efforts of the victims themselves after disasters, but also opens up the possibility of localizing universal humanitarian <b>assistance</b> <b>frameworks</b> from below. With this approach, I reexamine the personal, temporal, and spatial <b>frameworks</b> of humanitarian <b>assistance</b> in East African pastoral societies. Subsequently, I also give an overview of the articulation of the primary <b>frameworks</b> of humanitarian <b>assistance</b> and East African pastoralism. Lastly, I show the perspective and significance of the articulation sphere approach...|$|R

Subsequently, we show how this framework can be used to construct on all the applicable networks a spanning subgraph, denoted by BSG, that possesses several special properties. This spanning subgraph constitutes the basic tool for the development of algorithms for three fundamental communication problems on interconnection networks, namely, the multinode broadcasting, and the single-node and multinode scattering. The algorithms are developed in the store-and-forward, all-port, and bidirectional communication model and are analyzed according to the constant cost model...|$|R

We show an intricate cheating strategy for this sequence, {{which leads to a}} bias of 1 / 4. This indicates that a bias of 1 / 4 might be optimal in such protocols, and also demonstrates that a cleverer proof technique may be required to show this optimality...|$|R

Under natural conditions on (a_n,b_n) this equation has a unique stationary solution, and its support is non-compact. We show that, in general, its law has a heavy tail behavior and we study the corresponding directions. This provides a natural construction of laws with heavy tails in great generality.

The flexibility of the framework can be characterized by some vectors, which represent equivalence classes of the edges. A necessary and sufficient condition for the rigidity of the braced rhombic face zonohedra is posed. A real mechanical construction, based on two simple elements, provides a CAD prototype of these new mechanisms...|$|R
