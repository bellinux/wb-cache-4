40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{mechanism}} of ischemic neuronal injury {{is not fully}} resolved. The present view is that vascular occlusion per se does not fully account for the extent of neurological dysfunction. We previously hypothesized that platelet <b>secretory</b> <b>products</b> might contribute to neuronal injury in the central nervous system. Our preliminary studies using organotypic rat spinal cord cultures exposed to human platelet and its <b>secretory</b> <b>products</b> revealed that platelet products had neurotoxic properties. Methods: Further studies, using the same methods, were conducted, {{with the addition of}} several refinements such as use of gel-filtered platelets (as opposed to washed platelets) and adding additional relevant controls including platelet membranes, red blood cells, and washed rat platelets. Results: Exposure of spinal cord explant cultures to platelet <b>secretory</b> <b>products</b> resulted in reduced number of neurons per ventral horn compared with control. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that platelet <b>secretory</b> <b>products</b> have neurotoxic properties. This effect was seen with platelet secretion obtained from physiological platelet concentrations. It appears possible that more abundant release of platelet products at the site of thrombus formation could have pathological significance in vivo.

40|$|The origin, {{development}} and ultrastructure of secretory cavities in leaf of Ginkgo biloba {{and its relation}} to the <b>secretory</b> <b>products</b> were studied by optical and electron microscope. The results indicated that the formation pattern of the secretory cavities was schizo-lysigenous in nature. First, some original central secretory cells in the center of secretory cavities expanded, dissolved then moved aside schizogeneously forming an intercellular space. Later the central and peripheral secretory cells continued to dissolve making the intercellular space larger. This process continued until the central secretory cells degenerated, autolyzed and separated off into cavities. It has been assumed that the <b>secretory</b> <b>products</b> in the <b>secretory</b> cavities of Ginkgo biloba were synthesized mainly in the plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However it was our observation that the Mitochondrion, Golgi Body and Cytoplasm were also involved in the synthesis and translocation of the secretions.

5000|$|Biotinylated cell surface {{proteins}} from a lacritin-responsive cell were incubated with lacritin {{under conditions}} of physiological salt. Those that bound lacritin were sequenced by mass spectrometry. Few bound. The most prominent was syndecan-1 (SDC1). In confirmatory pull-down assays, binding was not shared with family members syndecan-2 or syndecan-4, indicating that the protein core (and not the negatively charged heparan sulfate side-chains) was the main site of binding. Further analysis narrowed the site to syndecan-1's N-terminal 51 amino acids, and subsequently to the N-terminal sequence GAGAL that is conserved in syndecan-1's from different species. [...] GAGAL promotes the alpha helicity of lacritin's C-terminal amphipathic alpha helix and likely binds to the hydrophobic face. [...] Syndecan-1 binds many growth factors through its long heparan sulfate side-chains. Yet, long heparan sulfate chains interfere with lacritin binding. Since syndecans are always decorated with heparan sulfate, this means that heparanase must be available to partially or completely cleave off heparan sulfate, allowing lacritin to bind. Indeed, no binding was detected from cells lacking heparanase after siRNA depletion. [...] Binding was restored by spiking in exogenous heparanase or heparitinase. Thus, heparanase regulates lacritin function as an 'on-switch'. Exposed 3-O sulfated group(s) on heparanase-cleaved heparan sulfate (that likely interacts with the cationic face of lacritin's C-terminal amphipathic alpha helix), and an N-terminal chondroitin sulfate chain (likely also binds to the cationic face) appear to contribute to binding. Point mutagenesis of lacritin has narrowed the ligation site. This novel heparanase mechanism appears at first glance to be poor for ocular health since heparanase release from invading lymphocytes in the corneal stroma is inflammatory. Yet heparanase is a normal <b>secretory</b> <b>product</b> of the corneal epithelium.|$|E

This concurrent induced release provides further evidence of the existence of a very close association between newly synthesized intracellular membrane glycerolipid with the secretion of the <b>secretory</b> <b>product.</b> This relationship was tested previously by using two mechanistically different inhibitors in the same cells. This study also shows that <b>secretory</b> <b>product</b> is released from that normally secreted in soluble form by the constitutive pathway of these cells.

The release, since it appears to be specific, may provide a means for isolating and characterizing the dynamic membranes.

40|$|Addition of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin {{to adult}} bovine chromaffin cells {{maintained}} in primary culture causes permeabilization of cell membrane {{as shown by}} the release of intracellular 86 Rb+. The alpha-toxin does not provoke a spontaneous release of either catecholamines or chromogranin A, a protein marker of the secretory granule, showing the integrity of the secretory vesicle membrane. However the addition of micromolar free Ca 2 + concentration induced the co-release of noradrenaline and chromogranin A. In alpha-toxin-treated cells, the released chromogranin A could not be sedimented and lactate dehydrogenase was still associated within cells, which provides direct evidence that <b>secretory</b> <b>product</b> is liberated by exocytosis. By contrast, permeabilization of cells with digitonin caused a Ca 2 +- dependent but also a Ca 2 +-independent release of <b>secretory</b> <b>product,</b> a dramatic loss of lactate dehydrogenase, as well as release of <b>secretory</b> <b>product</b> in a sedimentable form. Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis from alpha- toxin-permeabilized cells required Mg 2 +-ATP and did not occur in the presence of other nucleotides.
