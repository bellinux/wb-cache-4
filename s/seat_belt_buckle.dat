50|$|The 1986 James Hardie 1000 is {{unfortunately}} also {{remembered for}} the death of Sydney privateer Mike Burgmann. On lap 5, Burgmann's Holden VK Commodore SS Group A and the privateer Jaguar XJS of his friend Garry Willmington were neck and neck over the notorious second hump on Conrod Straight at approximately 260 km/h when the front of the Commodore got airborne (as cars did coming over the hump at that speed, more so for cars on the right hand side or outside part of the track which is where Burgmann was). The front of the Commodore moved slightly to the left and Burgmann, who was only a part-time racer, tried to correct by turning the wheel to the right. Unfortunately for Burgmann, the front tyres suddenly gripped when they landed and the car then turned into and hit the tyre barrier {{at the bottom of the}} well-known curved bridge at the end of Conrod with unabated speed causing the entire front end to be pushed back to the firewall. The car's roll cage did its job and the cabin survived the violent impact mostly intact. However, when officials reached the car they found Burgmann in what would normally be the back seat of the vehicle. While his driving seat had remained intact the force of the impact had broken the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> which caused his body to be thrown out of the seat. Mike Burgmann became the first driver to die while competing in the Bathurst 1000 when he was pronounced dead on arrival at Bathurst Hospital.|$|E
50|$|For 1986, {{and like}} {{everyone}} else who ran the Holdens, the Burgmann team had upgraded the Commodore to the racing SS Group A specification. For the Endurance Championship he co-drove the car with Series Production racer Mal Rose. At Bathurst Burgmann qualified the car in 27th place. After a good start in which he'd already picked up almost 10 places, he suffered a broken windscreen on lap 3. On lap 5, Burgmann was attempting to pass the V12 Jaguar XJS of fellow Sydney racer and close friend Garry Willmington while coming over the second hump on Conrod Straight and traveling at over 260 km/h. The front of the Commodore got airborne (as cars did coming over the hump at that speed) and the front moved slightly to the right. Burgmann, who was only a part-time racer, tried to correct by turning the wheel to the right.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringInertial {{release of}} the RCF- 67 side release buckle is {{investigated}} in this thesis through review of the literature, finite element modeling, and experimental testing. A finite element (FE) model is developed using the explicit non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA. The propensity of the buckle to unlatch under various combinations of acceleration pulse amplitudes, durations, and belt tension is simulated and profiled. The non-linear modal response of the spring {{is found to be}} significant contributor. The results are correlated and compared against experimental test data within the literature. Rate sensitive foam is added to the buckle model to demonstrate prevention of inertial release through addition of a damping element. The FE model predicts the performance of the buckle with high fidelity and granularity {{both before and after the}} rate sensitive foam is added. Laboratory impact sled testing is performed on both configurations to further corroborate the results of the model. A "whipping" effect is observed in the buckle housing acceleration data and high speed video which causes oscillation in the acceleration of the housing, where peak accelerations are also higher and pulse durations are longer measured at the buckle CG compared to those measured on the rigid mounting structure. The wealth of experimental and computational data found in the literature, combined with that obtained in this study, allows for insightful conclusions to be drawn regarding the unlatching potential of the RCF- 67 buckle as well as the effectiveness of adding rate sensitive foam to this buckle design. This modification to add damping provides a simple, inexpensive, and effective means of rendering a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> safe under severe crash conditions where it may not otherwise perform as intended. Applicability to automotive <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> design in general is expanded on. LS-DYNA and the associated methodology used in this study proves effective in analyzing a buckle design for prevention of inertial release based on limited test data...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a device}} that applied a sustained increase in accelerator pedal back force whenever drivers exceeded a preset speed criterion without <b>buckling</b> their <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> This force was removed once the belt was fastened. Participants were 6 commercial drivers who operated carpet-cleaning vans. During baseline, no contingency was in place for unbuckled trips. The pedal resistance was introduced via a multiple baseline design across groups. On {{the first day of}} treatment, the device was explained and demonstrated for all drivers of the vehicle. The treatment was associated with an immediate sustained increase in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> compliance to 100 %. Occasionally, drivers initially did not buckle during a trip and encountered the force. In all instances, they buckled within less than 25 Â s.

40|$|Objective: Investigate the {{combined}} effects of <b>belt</b> geometry, <b>seat</b> substructure, and <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> pretensioners and load limiters on rear seat occupant injury risk. Methods: An instrumented Hybrid III 5 th percentile adult female dummy {{was subjected to}} simulated frontal impacts (Îv = 45. 8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27. 1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, {{and the use of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> pretensioners with load limiters. Results: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on submarining. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> pretensioners with load limiters reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent submarining. The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented submarining in one case but could not prevent submarining with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and submarining. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash <b>belt</b> fit, antisubmarining <b>seat</b> pans, <b>belt</b> <b>buckles</b> positioned near the seat bight, and <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> with pretensioners and load limiters for rear seat occupants. These data can be used to inform the design of a system of restraints to reduce injuries to rear seat occupants. Â© 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
500|$|On September 6, 1956, Raymond {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in Westport, Connecticut. Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake's 1956 Corvette at twice the [...] speed limit, he hit a tree and was killed. Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances {{as a result of the}} weather. Driving in the convertible with its top down, Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall. Drake was thrown clear of the crash, but Raymond, with his <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>buckled,</b> died instantly. Speculation surrounds the nature of his death, with some, Drake included, believing Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death, which led Drake to say Raymond [...] "had been trying to kill himself". Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond's personal life. Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs, and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation: [...] "Committing suicide strikes me as an odd way for a man of Raymond's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance". Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert's biography, [...] "probably out of consideration to Raymond's surviving family". Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond [...] "hit the accelerator by mistake" [...] instead of the brake. Raymond is buried in St. John's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.|$|R
5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFEÂ® system. Whenever PRE-SAFEÂ® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible belt tensioning is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt,</b> the <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the belt tensioning on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic belt tensioning which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|R
