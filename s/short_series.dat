She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage's newfound friendship, because Rin and Ian's romantic relationship served as the focus of the story.|$|E

5|$|While Jardine won {{the series}} as captain, he contributed just 199 runs {{at an average}} of 22.11 in the Tests, and 628 runs (average 36.94) in all {{first-class}} cricket in Australia. Jardine only played in the first Test of the <b>short</b> <b>series</b> which followed in New Zealand, due to rheumatism. All the players enjoyed the short tour although rain ruined the cricket, and Jardine was observed to show signs of paranoia towards all things Australian. Pelham Warner, although he later stated that he disapproved of Bodyline bowling, praised Jardine's captaincy on the tour and believed that he was cruelly treated by the Australian crowds. He further believed that Jardine was convinced that the tactics were legitimate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{visitors}} {{stayed to}} prospect for and mine deposits of copper, gold, lead, and silver. These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver. One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane {{and the other}} was a one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's work site and named the claim the Keane Wonder Mine. This started a minor and short-lived gold rush into the area. The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at Rhyolite, Skidoo and Harrisburg, were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as Leadfield also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a <b>short</b> <b>series</b> of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s (decade) but soon declined after the Panic of 1907.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Return {{series to}} broad asset classes often possess {{histories}} of unequal length {{as well as}} the presence of smoothing. Covariances typically revert to using the common, though <b>shorter,</b> <b>series</b> length while covariances for smoothed series are necessarily biased downward. These pose serious problems which, if left unresolved, will generate suboptimal and misleading allocations across asset classes. This paper discusses and draws together elements of the underlying theory in proposing an informationally efficient covariance estimator. This estimator is then compared to conventional covariance estimates in an empirical application using data from seven asset classes typically considered by institutional investors. Specifically, we show that covariance estimates are sensitive to both truncated estimates involving <b>shorter</b> <b>series</b> and the effects of smoothing which, if left unattended, will produce significantly biased allocations and higher portfolio risk...|$|R
