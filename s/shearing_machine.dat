40|$|In {{this paper}} the Kamat-Riley (K-R) event-based Monte Carlo {{simulation}} method {{was used for}} reliability analysis of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Shearer</b> <b>machine</b> consists of six subsystems; water, haulage, electrical, hydraulic, cutting arms and cable systems in a series network configuration. A shearer in the Tabas coal mine was selected as case study and its all failure data were collected and used for reliability analysis of subsystems. With negligible assumption of time to repair, a flowchart was built for programming the simulation process. The Matlab mathematical programming software was used for reliability simulation process. Finally the reliability plot of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> was achieved and upper and lower bound reliability were calculated. The results illustrate that the reliability of <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> reduces to zero {{in a period of}} 100 h. There is a 50 % chance that the shearer will not fail for the first 12 h of operation. Validerad; 2013; 20130815 (behzad...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flying <b>shear</b> <b>machine</b> {{is widely}} used in {{continuous}} rolling mill production line, and its performance is largely depended on the transmission system. Here a model is established with multiple backlashes, time-varying mesh stiffness and error excitation to investigate the dynamics performance of the transmission system during the process. Also, effects of parameters are discussed. It’s believed {{that it will be}} helpful for the design of the flying <b>shear</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
50|$|Direct shear {{tests can}} be {{performed}} under several conditions. The sample is normally saturated before the test is run, but can be run at the in-situ moisture content. The rate of strain can be varied to create a test of undrained or drained conditions, depending whether the strain is applied slowly enough for water in the sample to prevent pore-water pressure buildup. Direct <b>shear</b> test <b>machine</b> is required to perform the test. The test using the direct <b>shear</b> <b>machine</b> determinates the consolidated drained shear strength of a soil material in direct shear.|$|R

Direct <b>shear</b> digital <b>machine</b> used was model 30 -WF 6016 T 2 (Wykeham Farrance) attached to data logger which records all parameters automatically during a testing operation. Strain controlled test was the type that was carried out with the sample sets. The machine applied strain {{at the rate of}} 0.5  mm/min. The direct <b>shear</b> test <b>machine</b> is equipped with strain gauges transducers to measure both horizontal and vertical deformations from the start {{to the end of the}} test. It has facility to determine both the peak and residual shear strength of soil, but the latter was not determined for the specimens in this study. Normal load applied were 50, 100, and 150  kg.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis focuses on the description of particulate materials and their mechanical behaviors {{with a focus on}} flow properties. Great emphasis is placed on measuring the shear properties using a Jenike <b>shear</b> <b>machine,</b> on the correct procedure for standardized measurement and evaluation using Mohr's circles. The {{theoretical part}} focuses on the characterization of particulate matter using a variety of methods available, such as visual, separation, sedimentation, surface methods and methods of scanning field and flow. The practical part is focused on the determination of flow characteristics and surface finishing of finely ground limestone Omyacarb VA with various grain sizes. The surface was modified using stearic acid and calcium stearate. Attention was paid to the influence of the concentration of surface-regulating substances on the flowability of the material. The flowability of commercially supplied material was compared with lab modified materials and the determination of the theoretical content of stearic acid or calcium stearate was accomplished. Shear properties were measured using the Jenike <b>shear</b> <b>machine.</b> The material was further tested by laser diffraction and SEM with EDS particle surface analysis and elemental surface mapping...|$|R

A number of improvements were made during the stewardship of these two men; in 1893 an artesian bore was put down and 24 Wolseley <b>shearing</b> <b>machines</b> were installed at the shearing shed, which was also used by other property owners.

50|$|During 1887, Herbert Austin joined, {{as chief}} engineer, Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited, {{incorporated}} in Sydney, {{a new business}} linked to R G Parks & Co, to make Wolseley's machinery in his workshops at Goldsbrough Mort & Co.

This company was wound up in 1889 and ownership transferred to a new British company, The Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company incorporated in London with a capital of £200,000. Operations remained in Australia, Austin studied the machinery while it was in use on sheep stations and made further patented improvements.

40|$|Longwall mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{continuous}} and productive mining methods. Efficiency of this method is directly affected by the involved machineries and systems. The drum shearer plays an important role in the face productivity and the mine life. Therefore, monitoring of this machine can lead the whole extraction operation to a high level of production and safety. There are several reliability-related measures for evaluation of the mining equipment. Availability, utilization, production efficiency and overall production effectiveness are the most important measure which can help us in this way. In this paper, the production and failure data of a drum <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> in Parvade coal mine in Iran have been collected from whole of one longwall panel during a two-year period. The mentioned reliability-related measures have been calculated based on the total uptime and downtime of the machine. The results showed that, the studied drum shearer is in good availability level. However, it has average production efficiency, very low utilization and very low overall equipment effectiveness. Also, high waiting and idling time raises from other machineries during the extraction process, was recognized as the main reason for the current low productivity of <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> in mine.

They can be helpful against small bursts, but are likely incapable of absorbing the energy from the largest events. Examples of physical barriers that have been used on longwalls include conveyor belting secured between the shields and the face conveyor, and metal plate burst protectors installed on <b>shearing</b> <b>machines.</b> Miners can also be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), such as helmets, face shields, or body armor, though such devices can only protect miners from small events.|$|R

50|$|Looking {{for other}} {{products}} to even out the workload, Herbert Austin {{became interested in}} motor cars and built {{two different types of}} three-wheelers in his own time.

50|$|A bench shear, {{also known}} as a lever shear, is a bench mounted shear with a {{compound}} mechanism to increase the mechanical advantage. It is usually used for cutting rough shapes out of medium-sized pieces of sheet metal, but cannot do delicate work. For the small shear, it mostly designed for a wide field of applications. Light weight and easy efficient operation, yet very sturdy in construction. The cutting blades fitted are carefully and accurately ground to give easy, clean quick cuts, and free of burrs. These special features help the operators save a great deal of their energy. But some <b>shearing</b> <b>machines</b> can cut sheet bar and flat bar up to 10mm. It is electrically welded together to make it a sturdy stable unit capable to withstand highest stresses due to heavy duty usage. The footplates are reinforced with bracing angles so that they give firm stability to the <b>shear.</b> The <b>machine</b> is provided with section knives with sliding blades which can be adjusted by hand to make 90 cuts on angles and T-sections of different sizes as well as with openings for cutting round and square bars.|$|R
