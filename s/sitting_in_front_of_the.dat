5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, finding that they would {{converse}} {{with each other and}} vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided {{that there would be no}} inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E

25|$|Paul D, one of {{the slaves}} from Sweet Home—the {{plantation}} where Baby Suggs, Sethe, Halle, and several other slaves once worked—arrives at Sethe's home and tries to bring a sense of reality into the house. In attempting to make the family forget the past, he forces out the spirit. He seems successful at first; he even brings housebound Denver {{out of the house}} {{for the first time in}} years. But on the way back, they encounter a young woman <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, calling herself Beloved. Paul D is suspicious and warns Sethe, but she is charmed by the young woman and ignores him. Gradually, Paul D is forced out of Sethe's home by a supernatural presence.|$|E

25|$|In 1938 the Rosenwald Fund {{provided}} {{money for}} Alston {{to travel to}} the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the Farm Security Administration, gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life. These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed Tobacco Farmer, the portrait of a young black farmer in white overalls and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at Atlanta University.|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} {{opens with a}} shot of the Griffin family, they are seen <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{television}} watching a parody of several Aaron Sorkin shows, including Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, entitled The Kitchen. Once the scene ends, the power unexpectedly goes out, to which Stewie responds by asking [...] "What are we in, Iraq?" [...] Reminiscent of the previous Star Wars-inspired episode, [...] "Blue Harvest", Meg insists her father tell another story about Star Wars. Peter then begins to retell the film Black Snake Moan before being interrupted by Stewie and Chris.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} have the film open with the statement [...] "Hell is a teenage girl" [...] to reflect the [...] "horrors" [...] of puberty and that [...] "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women". Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought {{that was such a}} sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [...] is stunning.|$|E

500|$|Central and {{parallel}} to the SDSU student protest movement was an 8 foot high wooden construction fence that encircled the a new campus building. Students quickly put up protest messages, paintings, and cartoons urging students to rally, vote, and challenge the school president. Citing a need to [...] "clean up" [...] the campus during graduation of 1991, President Day attempted to paint over the now symbolic construction fence wall. The night before the attempted wall paint over by President Day, a large police force arrested eight students peacefully <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall. The next morning, word quickly gathered on campus about the arrests and dozens of student rushed to {{sit in front of}} the wall ultimately stopping the painters.|$|E
500|$|When Homer is {{escorted by}} the hired goons into {{what appears to}} be Burns' conservatory, a Burns-headed bird is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen, which then flies away. This is a {{reference}} to the cockatoo in Citizen Kane. The episode features an incidental music, a sample of [...] "Classical Gas" [...] by Mason Williams played by Lisa on a request from Lenny. Before Mr. Burns shuts off the power to the town in response to the strike, he says, [...] "From Hell's heart I stab at thee" [...] which is a reference to Captain Ahab's curse, from the novel Moby-Dick. The workers' resistance to the power outage, and Mr. Burns's response, is a parody of How the Grinch Stole Christmas.|$|E
500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an optical device {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E

2500|$|Upon arriving, {{they find}} their door is open, {{suggesting}} a burglar {{is inside the}} house. Bart fetches Homer a makeshift weapon made from a cinder block tied to a chain that he calls [...] "The Defender". Homer swings it around to threaten the burglar, but when the family smells apple pie, they discover it is actually Homer's mother, Mona Simpson. Mona says that her days of activism are over, and that she is staying for good. When she asks if Homer will forgive her, a shaken Homer angrily replies that he will not, {{because of all the}} times she left him as a child. Homer explains that he feels hurt and abandoned when Mona is not around, and does not want to feel that way again. Later that night, Mona tries to explain to Homer she has changed her ways, but, again Homer does not listen. Afterwards, Homer realizes he should have listened to his mother, and makes her a card as an apology: when he goes downstairs to apologize, he sees her <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, and asks if she is asleep. When he then notices and questions that she is [...] "sleeping with her eyes open", her head slumps down and Homer realizes that she has died.|$|E
2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or {{had anything to do with}} the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
