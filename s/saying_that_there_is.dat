25|$|In other words, on average, 80% of {{the times}} that upper and lower {{thresholds}} are calculated by this method, the true mean is both below the upper threshold and above the lower threshold. This {{is not the same}} thing as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an 80% probability that the true mean lies between a particular pair of upper and lower thresholds that have been calculated by this method; see confidence interval and prosecutor's fallacy.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{formulations}} of the conjecture. Showing {{that they are}} equivalent is difficult and was a main topic of number theory {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. The modularity of an elliptic curve E of conductor N can be expressed also by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a non-constant rational map defined over Q, from the modular curve X0(N) to E. In particular, the points of E can be parametrized by modular functions.|$|E

At a 2007 Greenpeace event in Anchorage, Alaska, Panettiere defended aboriginal whaling, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a difference between commercial whaling and the whaling practiced by aboriginal tribes in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that Sanders {{believes}} God’s knowledge of the future is “limited” as some critics have charged. Rather, Sanders holds that what is referred to as “the” future is not an ontological reality—it does not exist. If it is does not exist then there is literally “no thing” or actuality for God to know. Open theists are not <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a reality about which God is ignorant (which would be limited omniscience). The denial that God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events has been the single most controversial aspect of open theism.|$|E

25|$|Using the {{standard}} definition from universal algebra, a free complete lattice over a generating set S {{is a complete}} lattice L together with a function i:S→L, such that any function f from S to the underlying set of some complete lattice M can be factored uniquely through a morphism f° from L to M. Stated differently, for every element s of S we find that f(s) = f°(i(s)) and that f° is the only morphism with this property. These conditions basically amount to <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a functor from the category of sets and functions to the category of complete lattices and join-preserving functions which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from complete lattices to their underlying sets.|$|E
25|$|The GEAC cleared Bt brinjal for commercialization on 14 October 2009. Following {{concerns}} {{raised by}} some scientists, farmers and anti-GMO activists, {{the government of}} India officially announced on 9 February 2010 that it needed more time before releasing Bt brinjal, with Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no overriding urgency to introduce Bt brinjal in India. On 17 February 2010, Jairam Ramesh reiterated that the Centre had only imposed a moratorium on the release of transgenic brinjal hybrid, and not a permanent ban, saying that “until we arrive at a political, scientific and societal consensus, this moratorium will remain”. Companies with any seeds of Bt brinjal will have to register the details with the government, and the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) was made responsible for storage of all the Bt brinjal seeds in India. Independent testing labs are currently being set up.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{are divided}} {{over whether the}} {{deception}} {{played a major role}} in the German response. Most, such as historian Ben McIntyre, agree that Ironside added to the general picture of confusion for the German commanders. McIntyre quotes senior Allied figures, such as John Masterman (chair of the Twenty committee) and Hugh Astor (MI5), who attributed the delayed German response in part to Ironside. Michael Howard [...] dismisses the impact of the operation <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "no evidence that anyone took them seriously".|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} mostly positive reviews upon release. John Highcliffe of The Games Machine {{praised the}} historical {{accuracy of the}} game, stating that gamers with an interest with the era would enjoy the game. However, Highcliffe expressed concern over {{the slow pace of}} the game. Alain Huyghes-Lacour of Tilt praised the game's graphics and 3D presentation of the battle, stating that it exceeded the benchmark set by other wargames. Mark Higham of ST Format questioned the historical accuracy, stating that during the real battle French forces used smoke grenades frequently, and criticised the lack of this inclusion in the game. However, Higham heralded the game as the best, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "no other wargame like it".|$|E

500|$|In the poem, Anactoria is absent, {{though it}} is not evident from the {{surviving}} lines exactly why. [...] One suggestion is that she has left Sappho in order to marry. [...] Christopher Brown argues that the description of Anactoria's αμαρυχμα ("the radiant sparkle of her face") is suggestive of the χαρις ("grace", [...] "charm") of a [...] "nubile girl" [...] of marriageable age, and that it is likely that Anactoria has returned to her native city in order to marry. [...] Eric Dodson-Robinson suggests that the poem could have been performed at a wedding, with Anactoria the bride leaving her family and friends. George Koniaris disagrees, arguing that there is [...] "no special reason" [...] to believe that Anactoria left Sappho for a man. [...] Glen Most goes further, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no reason to believe that}} Anactoria's absence was anything more than temporary.|$|E

[...] Professor David A.

He asserts that Migration of the Serbs and similar paintings stimulated a [...] "revived collective memory" [...] among the new Serbian middle class, [...] "transforming... folk memory into a more modern vehicle for the invention of a new national ideology based on the Serbian struggle for freedom from foreign domination." [...] Art historian Michele Facos describes the painting as {{a celebration of the}} Serbs' [...] "valiant effort to defend Christian Europe against... the Ottoman Turks." [...] The historian Noel Malcolm doubts the historical veracity of depictions of Arsenije leading vast columns of refugees, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no concrete evidence to confirm or deny that the number of migrants exceeded 40,000, as Church leaders claimed.|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Christian Svensson at Capcom {{said that}} there were no plans at the time to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 in regions outside Japan, due to higher {{localization}} costs than estimated returns; according to Eshiro, however, the main reason for the lack of a localization was scheduling, as all the staff working on the game had disbanded and moved to different teams after finishing the game, and were unable to work on a localization. Svensson {{said that there}} was a possibility of a release on another platform, and that he would discuss ways for it to happen with Capcom's strategy and R teams. In December 2011, Capcom was still discussing internally how to address the Ace Attorney audience, with Svensson <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> potential to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 as a downloadable digital title.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Fever received an average score of 68 based on 15 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". Jason Thompson from PopMatters gave the album an extremely positive review and praised the conception {{and production of}} the album, calling it a [...] "perfect album of gorgeous dance music" [...] and claiming that [...] "there probably won't be a better album like it all year long". Chris True from AllMusic also gave it an acclaimed review and enjoyed the simple disco and dancepop music of the album, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "not one weak track, not one misplaced syrupy ballad to ruin the groove". Alex Needham from NME positively reviewed the album and noted that while the album lacks depth, it is [...] "as effervescent as a foot spa" [...] and that through the album, Minogue [...] "shows the upstarts how it's done".
