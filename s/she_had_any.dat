5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any.</b> Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Elizabeth remained in Edinburgh. She had had daughter (Mary) in 1919 and a son (Theo) in 1924, to different fathers (neither of whom was Billy Sing). She travelled to Australia during 1925 with her two children, and settled in Paddington, NSW. She adopted the surname of her son's father. She lived in New South Wales with her son's father until her death in Wollongong in the 1970s. It is not known whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> contact with Billy after her arrival in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E

25|$|Lady Dong {{was from}} Hejian Commandery (河間郡; around present-day Cangzhou, Hebei). She was {{the wife of}} Liu Chang (劉萇), the Marquis of Jiedu Village (解犢亭侯). (Liu Chang was a {{great-grandson}} of Liu Kai (劉開), the sixth son of Emperor Zhang.) In 156, she bore Liu Chang a son, Liu Hong. It is not known whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> other children.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} Elrond's daughter, named Finduilas, {{was made in}} {{reference}} to the banner she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give any hint whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aragorn came later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. Only in his work on the appendices for The Lord of the Rings did Tolkien record the full tale of Aragorn and Arwen.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} Serial {{originated}} with {{an experiment in}} Koenig's basement. Koenig and Snyder had pitched a different idea at a staff meeting for a weekly program on events during the previous seven days, which staff members received without enthusiasm. When Ira Glass asked Koenig if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> other ideas, she mentioned podcasting a story that unfolded over time, a serialized narrative. In an interview with Mother Jones, she explained that each episode {{would return to the}} same story, telling the next chapter of a long, true narrative.|$|E

25|$|Gay {{rights advocates}} criticized her for waiting {{until after the}} 2004 {{election}} to voice her disapproval of the Bush administration's positions on gay rights. During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the Late Show with David Letterman, Letterman brought {{up some of the}} issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.|$|E
500|$|One of Steinholt's {{campaign}} promises {{was to put}} an end to the activities of the petroleum industry close to Lofoten and Vesterålen because of potentially hazardous effects on the environment. When asked if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> political allies in parliament who could help her, Steinholt replied, [...] "Our most important partners are not in Parliament [...] those organisations whose main goal is to improve conditions for the Norwegian people. We must ensure that the Public Action For an Oil-Free Lofoten and Vesterålen will be heard".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Shanina's name {{appeared}} on the war memorial stone of the Siberian State Technological University, {{although there is no}} evidence <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> affiliation with it during her life. Russian author Viktor Logvinov controversially wrote in the 1970s that Shanina had studied in the Siberian Forestry Institute and that she was the daughter of an [...] "old Krasnoyarsk communist". The claim was continued by Krasnoyarsk publications in later years, particularly in 2005. In 2013, a wall of memory, featuring graffiti portraits of six Russian war honorees, including Roza Shanina, was opened in Arkhangelsk.|$|E

500|$|Qureshi was {{initially}} scheduled {{to make her}} film debut with Billa II, a Tamil gangster-thriller, directed and produced by Chakri Toleti, after surviving an audition out of 700 candidates. Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E
500|$|Renaissance humanism {{and science}} figured {{large in the}} Dudley children's education. In 1553 Jane Dudley herself {{commissioned}} two works from the mathematician and Hermeticist John Dee about heavenly configurations and the tides. Jane Dudley was close to her children; her eldest son, Henry, had died during the siege of Boulogne in 1544, aged 19. A postscript she wrote in 1552 under a letter by her husband to their then eldest son, John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick, reads: [...] She also had health problems: In 1548 her husband was unwilling to leave her side, because she [...] "had had her fit again more extreme that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> time yet." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E

500|$|Sigtrygg was of Norse and Irish ancestry. He was {{a son of}} Olaf Cuarán (also called Kváran), King of York and of Dublin, and Gormflaith ingen Murchada. Gormflaith was the {{daughter}} of the King of Leinster, Murchad mac Finn, and the sister of his successor, King Máel Mórda of Leinster. She had previously been married to the King of Meath and High King of Ireland, Máel Sechnaill — the first of her three husbands. [...] She was a beautiful, powerful and intriguing Irish woman, who according to the 13th-century Icelandic Njál's saga, was [...] "the fairest of all women, and best gifted in everything that was not in her own power, but it was the talk of men that she did all things ill over which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> power". Sigtrygg's paternal half-brother was Glúniairn, [...] "Iron-knee", who ruled as King of Dublin from 980–989.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time that she {{approached}} Carter about writing an episode, Anderson was also receiving offers from several television networks to direct shows. She, however, had never directed before, and decided that she would first attempt to helm an episode of The X-Files before branching out into other series. Anderson thus expressed her wish to direct the episode when she pitched the original idea for [...] "all things". Carter accepted her story, but did not appoint her as director until all the revisions and rewrites had been completed. Anderson worked with series director Kim Manners {{for the majority of the}} episode, later noting that if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> questions, she would approach Manners first. To help Anderson, Manners gave her directing exercises, such as making a list of shots for every scene. The episode also marked the first time that a woman had helmed the direction of an episode of The X-Files.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{then asked}} Ono if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{unreleased}} recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was recorded by Lennon in 1977, {{in his and}} Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, [...] "Free—as a boid" [...] (bird). The other songs were [...] "Grow Old With Me", [...] "Real Love", and [...] "Now and Then". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: [...] "People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, {{but it was all}} settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul." ...|$|E

50|$|During sex class, Pauline takes {{a sample}} of her blood and puts it under a {{microscope}} to check for STDs. Later, she sees Adam with his girlfriend. She tells Adam <b>she</b> doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> STDs and asks his girlfriend if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any.</b> Pauline then tells them that if the girlfriend doesn't have anything, neither will she. Adam's girlfriend deduces that he was unfaithful.|$|R
500|$|Alongside {{a series}} of unpopular films, {{problems}} arose from Hepburn's attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children, she snapped back, [...] "Yes I have five: two white and three colored." [...] She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname [...] "Katharine of Arrogance". The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed {{that she needed to}} leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, [...] "I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Boys and Girls" [...] was {{directed}} by Dennie Gordon; {{it was written by}} B. J. Novak, who plays Ryan Howard on the show. The genesis for the episode came from cast members Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer. The two originally formulated an idea while spending time together on the set of The Office: [...] "What if Jan came into the office and did a 'Women in the Workplace' seminar, and Michael got all jealous?" [...] They presented their idea to executive producer Greg Daniels, who liked the idea. Daniels subsequently assigned the idea to Novak, who crafted the final episode. Pam's monologue on reading about a girl who lived in a house with a terrace was based on a real book from the Choose Your Own Adventure series, although not specifically identified as such in the episode read by Jenna Fischer when she was a child. When the show's cast and crew appeared at the Paley Center, Fischer related that Novak asked her if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> personal stories that could relate to what Pam was feeling at the time the episode was being written. She then came up with the storybook idea, which was immediately written and filmed for the episode.|$|E
