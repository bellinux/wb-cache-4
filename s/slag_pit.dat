5000|$|Once {{the scrap}} has {{completely}} melted {{down and a}} flat bath is reached, another bucket of scrap can be charged into the furnace and melted down, although EAF development is moving towards single-charge designs. After the second charge is completely melted, refining operations take place to check and correct the steel chemistry and superheat the melt above its freezing temperature in preparation for tapping. More slag formers are introduced and more oxygen is blown into the bath, burning out impurities such as silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and calcium, and removing their oxides to the slag. Removal of carbon takes place after these elements have burnt out first, as they have a greater affinity for oxygen. Metals that have a poorer affinity for oxygen than iron, such as nickel and copper, cannot be removed through oxidation and must be controlled through scrap chemistry alone, such as introducing the direct reduced iron and pig iron mentioned earlier. A foaming slag is maintained throughout, and often overflows the furnace to pour out of the slag door into the <b>slag</b> <b>pit.</b> Temperature sampling and chemical sampling take place via automatic lances. Oxygen and carbon can be automatically measured via special probes that dip into the steel, but for all other elements, a [...] "chill" [...] sample—a small, solidified sample of the steel—is analysed on an arc-emission spectrometer.|$|E
40|$|After {{injection}} of calcium carbide and magnesium during desulphurisation of hot metal, the slag is normally solid and contains {{large amounts of}} iron. Besides the enclosed iron droplets in the slag, drawn-off hot metal during slag skimming also accounts for iron losses during desulphurisation of hot metal. Iron losses during hot metal desulphurisation using both calcium carbide (mono-injection), and calcium carbide and magnesium (co-injection), have been studied by large-scale investigations of slag from the <b>slag</b> <b>pit</b> as well as slag sampling during the desulphurisation process at SSAB EMEA in Luleå. An alkali-containing mineral, nepheline syenite, was mixed together with thecalcium carbide to facilitate slag formation during desulphurisation and to enhance the separation of iron from the slag. Even though the addition of nepheline syenite resulted in a more fine-grained slag, no reduction in the iron content in the slag before slag skimming was observed. The addition of 5 wt-% of nepheline syenite to the calcium carbide during mono-injection decreased the magnetic fraction of the slag from the <b>slag</b> <b>pit</b> from 2. 5 wt-% to 1. 9 wt-%. The decrease in the larger magnetic fractions combined with the improved iron yield may arise from a more effective slag skimming due to the change in slag consistency. During co-injection with magnesium and calcium carbide, the magnetic fraction of the slag from the <b>slag</b> <b>pit</b> decreased from 3. 2 wt-% to 3. 1 wt-% {{with the addition of}} 10 wt-% of nepheline syenite. Even though nepheline syenite has a positive effect on the slag skimming, due to a decrease in larger magnetic fractions, the total magnetic iron losses have not decreased significantly. A plausible explanation for the lack of improved iron yield during co-injection in the present study could be that the increased turbulence during {{injection of}} magnesium counteracts any positive effect from addition of nepheline syenite on the slag properties. Finally, no negative effect on the reagent efficiency was observed during the trials with addition of nepheline syenite.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} iron {{extraction}} sites from the Iron Age and the Medieval period in Rogaland county, Norway. In Southwestern Norway prehistoric and medieval traces of iron production from bog ore have been rather neglected until some 10 years ago. From Rogaland county this paper records 45 iron extraction sites from the Iron Age and the Medieval period and 33 localities with charcoal pits which probably connect with iron {{production in the}} Late Iron Age and the Middle Ages. Five of the iron extraction sites are dated to the Early Iron Age. Iron extraction took place in shaft furnaces with underlying slag pits (<b>slag</b> <b>pit</b> furnaces). Fourteen of the extraction sites cannot be dated any closer than prehistoric-medieval times, while 26 can be dated to the Late Iron Age - the Middle Ages. On the latter iron production took place in shaft furnaces with slag tapping (slag tapping furnaces). There {{seems to be an}} increase in the amount of iron production in Rogaland from the Early Iron Age to the Middle Ages. But as very few extraction sites have been excavated, it is at the moment impossible to decide how big this increase was. It is clear though that both in the Early and the Late Iron Age and in the Medieval period there existed side by side both a small scale iron production for the farmstead and a more big scale production. Both forms of production took part both in the areas around the farmsteads as well as in more remote parts of the county...|$|E

25|$|Haig {{inspected}} the Loos area (24 June) and expressed {{dissatisfaction with the}} ground; <b>slag</b> heaps and <b>pit</b> head towers which made good observation points for the Germans. French later did the same and agreed. French and Haig {{would have preferred to}} renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. Joffre was not pleased and called another conference (11 July) to urge a British attack on Loos. Haig pushed for Aubers Ridge again (22 July) – French at first agreed until dissuaded by Foch (29 July), who felt that only a British attack at Loos would pull in enough German reserves to allow the French to take Vimy Ridge. French wrote to Joffre saying he was willing to go along with these plans for the sake of Anglo-French cooperation, but then wrote to Joffre again (10 August) suggesting an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks. This was not what Joffre wanted. Kitchener, who had been invited to tour the French Army (16–19 August) listened sympathetically to Joffre's suggestion that in future Joffre should set the size, dates and objectives of British offensives, although he only agreed for the Loos attack for the moment. Kitchener met with Haig first and then with French. It is unclear exactly why Kitchener and then Haig agreed to go along with Joffre's wishes – possibly the disastrous plight of the Russians, but it may be that a promise that poison gas could be used may have persuaded Haig. Having got their own way, the French then postponed the attack as they picked new attacking ground in Champagne and arranged for extra shelling at Vimy, in both cases because of the very reasons – German-held villages and other obstructions – to which the British generals had objected.|$|R
