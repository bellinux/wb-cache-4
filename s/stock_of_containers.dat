50|$|The game {{ends at the}} end of a player's turn {{when the}} pre-determined supply <b>of</b> <b>{{containers}}</b> runs out <b>of</b> two types.

However, the type <b>of</b> <b>container</b> that he has most of (or one of the types <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> that he has joint most of) is deemed to be oversupplied, and hence worthless—creating a situation whereby he wishes to have the most, or joint most, of his least valuable container.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} scheduling {{problems on}} the material handling operation at marine container-yard terminals. The layout, removal order and removal distination <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> are simultaneously optimized {{in order to reduce}} the waiting time for a vessel. The schedule of container-movements is derived by autonomous learning method based on a new learning model considering container-groups and corresponding Q-Learning algorithm. In the proposed method, the layout and movements <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> are described based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), and a state is represented by a container-layout with a selection <b>of</b> a <b>container</b> to be removed or a selection of destination on where the removed container are placed. Then, a state transition arises from a container-movement, a selection of containerdestination, or a selectionh <b>of</b> <b>container</b> to be removed. Only the container-movement takes a cost, and a series of containermovements with selections of destination and order <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> is evaluated by a total amount of costs. As a consequent, the total amount of costs reflects the number of container-movements that is required to achieve desired container-layout. After adequate autonomous learning, the optimum schedule for material handling operation can be obtained by selecting a series of containermovements that has the best evaluation. In the problem, the number of container-arrangements increases by the exponential rate with increase of total count <b>of</b> <b>containers.</b> Therefore, conventional methods have great difficulties to determine desirable movements <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> {{in order to reduce the}} run time for shipping...|$|R

Current research often focuses on the distribution <b>of</b> maritime <b>containers</b> by using combined transport or more specifically, on the usage of rail or inland waterways to serve hinterland terminals and the subsequent distribution <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> to recipients by truck. Very little research has considered using rail for the distribution <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> {{right up to the}} final recipients.

Data sourced from Literature Online, Early English Books Online and the British National Corpus reveal three types <b>of</b> metaphorical <b>containers</b> <b>of</b> sadness: (1) the human body in general and whatever is either literally internal to it, or at least often conceptualized as such, such as {{the heart and the}} soul; (2) external body parts and different kinds of superficial body features, such as the eyes and the voice; and (3) containers that are not inherently connected with the human body, such as a room and a sonnet. A comparison between the types <b>of</b> metaphorical <b>containers</b> in different periods shows that whereas the percentage of the third type <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> remains constant by and large, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of the second type <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> and a quite obvious decrease in the percentage of the first type <b>of</b> <b>containers.</b> It is argued that the diachronic variation in the relative frequencies of the two types <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> may have been related to a shift in the general conception of body and emotions, and specifically to the gradual disintegration of humoral theory. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
