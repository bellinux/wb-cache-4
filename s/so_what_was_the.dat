6000|$|... "Didn't I say <b>so?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> good of {{bringing}} me all this way, when, if you'd only believed me, {{you might have}} saved me the trouble. Ain't I {{to be paid for}} that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} questions," [...] said Robinson, [...] "to be asked and answered.--Had Mrs. B. {{the power to}} make a will? If so, did she make a will? And if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> will she made?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's plain {{they have}} no idea of digging," [...] Fred muttered. [...] "It begins to look as if we had made a big mistake; but if that is <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> meaning of the talk they made last night?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{meaningful}} {{differences between}} B2B and B2C marketing? ...|$|R

6000|$|Dave {{was more}} than willing, {{now that he had}} {{discovered}} the rowboat used by the wild man. Perhaps this island was the home of that mysterious individual. If <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> money-lender's son doing there? Had he business with the strange creature? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What in {{the world}} do you mean?' asked Merton. 'Oh, I guess, the Rev. Mr. Williams! Were you not told that his cure of souls is in Scotland Yard? I ought to have told you, I thought our host would have done <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> holy man doing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Leonard! Oh, dear Leonard!' She {{lay back}} for a few moments, panting under the gust of {{exceeding}} joy; while he was silent, {{and tried not to}} seem to observe her with his anxious eyes. Then she recovered a little and said, 'The truth come out! Did you say <b>so?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> truth?' ...|$|E
5000|$|We cannot {{randomly}} select any two subgraphs - <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{criteria for}} selecting? ...|$|R

6000|$|One {{fragment}} {{began in}} the air. [...] "Of course I had made myself responsible for her life. But it was, you see, such a confoundedly energetic life, as vigorous and as slippery as an eel.... Only by giving all my strength to her could I have held Amanda.... <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> good of trying to hold Amanda?...|$|E
60|$|Sam stalked {{into the}} drawing-room {{with the feeling}} that comes {{to all of us}} from time to time, that it is hopeless to struggle. The whole damned circle of his {{acquaintance}} seemed to have made up their minds that he had not a care in the world, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use? He lowered himself into a deep arm-chair and lit a cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|The meaning seems plain. These pagans {{had nothing}} against Christians, {{but they were}} quite ready to persecute Jews. For some reason or other they hated a Jew before they even knew what a Christian was. May I not assume, then, that the {{persecution}} of Jews is a thing which antedates Christianity and was not born of Christianity? I think <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> origin of the feeling? ...|$|E
3000|$|... ‘Freeness’ in any setting {{corresponds}} to a left adjoint to a forgetful, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> categories involved here? □ [...]...|$|R

60|$|We didn't say a {{word for}} a good while. There warn't {{anything}} to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, {{and that would be}} bound to fetch more bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.|$|E
6000|$|On a west-bound omnibus Claire Fenwick sat and raged {{silently in}} the June sunshine. She was furious. What right had Lord Dawlish {{to look down}} his nose and murmur 'Noblesse oblige' when she asked him a question, {{as if she had}} {{suggested}} that he should commit some crime? It was the patronizing way he had said it that infuriated her, {{as if he were a}} superior being of some kind, governed by codes which she could not be expected to understand. Everybody nowadays did the sort of things she suggested, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> good of looking shocked and saying 'Noblesse oblige'? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You see,” he went on, {{as though}} {{addressing}} his neglected mother across half the girth of the earth, “each year I was going home. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> good to write? It {{was only a}} year. And each year something happened, and I did not go. But I am mate, now, and when I pay off at ’Frisco, maybe with five hundred dollars, I will ship myself on a windjammer round the Horn to Liverpool, which will give me more money; and then I will pay my passage from there home. Then she will not do any more work.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! hush!" [...] I replied; [...] "don't talk <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> trifling mortification of {{my pride}} {{compared}} to the dreadful sacrifice of your happiness?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Do {{the rights}} under section 23 include {{the right to}} manage and control <b>the</b> schools? If <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{nature and extent of}} the {{management}} and control? ...|$|R
5000|$|The 2011 festival {{questioned}} whether the great narratives that have built and sustained <b>the</b> West <b>are</b> under threat and, if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> new gods that will replace them? ...|$|R
6000|$|She remarked, as she {{had done}} before, that in her {{judgment}} Hernan Pereira was [...] "a stinkcat and a sneak," [...] {{who had tried to}} desert them in their trouble, and by the judgment of a just God had got into trouble himself. Personally, she wished that the lion had taken him instead of the worthy Hottentot, although it gave her a higher opinion of lions to conclude that it had not done so, because if it did it thought it would have been poisoned. Well, her view was that it would be just as well to let that traitor lie upon the bed which he had made. Moreover, doubtless by now he was dead, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> good of bothering about him? ...|$|E
6000|$|So he {{went home}} to think it over, and the more he thought, the more troubled he became. How could anybody sleep all winter? And what good did just getting fat do? Johnny Chuck couldn't eat his own fat, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of it? [...] "Must be it's to keep him warm," [...] thought Peter and brightened up. But why wasn't a good thick coat of fur just as good or even better? He didn't have any trouble keeping warm. Neither did Billy Mink or Little Joe Otter or Reddy Fox. No, it couldn't be that Johnny Chuck put on all that fat just to keep warm. Besides, he would spend the winter way down deep in the ground, {{and there was no}} excuse for being cold there.|$|E
6000|$|We doubted {{whether he}} had any visions of wealth--for himself, at any rate. What he seemed mostly {{concerned}} for was the [...] "stride forward," [...] as he expressed it, in the general organization of the universe, apparently. He was heard {{by more than a}} hundred persons in the islands talking of a [...] "great stride forward for these regions." [...] The convinced wave of the hand which accompanied the phrase suggested tropical distances being impelled onward. In connection with the finished courtesy of his manner, it was persuasive, or at any rate silencing--for a time, at least. Nobody cared to argue with him when he talked in this strain. His earnestness could do no harm to anybody. There was no danger of anyone taking seriously his dream of tropical coal, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of hurting his feelings? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you're talking nonsense," [...] said Belturbet; [...] "angels don't exist nowadays, at least, {{not in that}} way, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of {{dragging}} {{them into}} a serious discussion? It's merely silly." ...|$|R
3000|$|... (Q 3) If <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> DESIRE {{values for}} each emotion? Table 5 gives the SIRE values that, at rates better than chance, {{underlie}} voice and gesture portrayals of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can hardly}} believe that,' cried the princess; 'but, alas! if there are, I don't suppose I shall ever see them or they me, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use? Oh, dear, how unhappy I am!' ...|$|R
60|$|Depression returned. It was {{impossible}} to fight against it in this beast of a barn. The place was like a sepulchre. No one but a fool of a butler would have suggested it as a trysting-place. He wondered irritably why places like this were allowed {{to get into this}} condition. If people wanted a barn earnestly enough to take the trouble of building one, why was it not worth while to keep the thing in proper repair? Waste and futility! That was what it was. That was what everything was, if you came down to it. Sitting here, for instance, was a futile waste of time. She wouldn't come. There were a dozen reasons why she should not come. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of his courting rheumatism by waiting in this morgue of dead agricultural ambitions? None whatever--George went on waiting.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{lost his}} temper; indeed, he raved, and stormed, and nearly smashed the patent {{receiver}} in his fury. To a scientific man, let it be admitted, it {{was nothing short of}} maddening to be told that the successful working of his instrument, to the manufacture of which he had given eight years of toil and study, depended upon some pre-existent sympathy between the operators of its divided halves. If that were <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of his wonderful discovery, for who could ensure a sympathetic correspondent? And yet the fact remained that when, in their playmate days, he understood his cousin Mary, and when her quiet, indolent nature had been deeply moved by the shock of the news of her mother's peril, the aerophone had worked. Whereas now, when she had become a grown-up young lady, he did not understand her any longer--he, whose heart was wrapped up in his experiments, and who by nature feared the adult members of her sex, and shrank from them; when, too, her placid calm was no longer stirred, work it would not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Killed or hurt {{by those}} terrible guns," [...] replied Mrs. Quack sadly. [...] "And that wasn't {{the worst of}} it. I told you that when we started each of us had a mate. Now we found that {{of those who had}} escaped, four had lost their mates. They were heartbroken. When it came time for us to move on, they wouldn't go. They said that if they did reach the nesting-place in the far North, they couldn't have nests or eggs or young because they had no mates, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use? Besides, they hoped that if they waited around they might find their mates. They thought they might not have been killed, but just hurt, and {{might be able to get}} away from those hunters. So they left us and swam back towards that terrible place, calling for their lost mates, and it was the saddest sound. I know now just how they felt, for I have lost Mr. Quack, and that's why I'm here." [...] Mrs. Quack drew a wing across her eyes to wipe away the tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "But was {{it really}} a dream, and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> truth and the lesson?" [...] I asked, {{determined}} not {{to allow her to}} bemuse or escape me with her metaphysical talk and illustrations.|$|R
50|$|<b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fifth {{compilation}} album by English {{punk rock}} band the Anti-Nowhere League. It contains mostly well known studio tracks {{along with a}} mix of live tracks, once again taken from the Live in Yugoslavia album.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I say {{we would}} take her?" [...] I demanded, crossly. [...] "Aunt Cynthia took our consent for granted. And you know, as well as I do, we couldn't have refused. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of being grouchy?" ...|$|R
