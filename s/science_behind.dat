5|$|The <b>Science</b> <b>Behind</b> Pixar is a {{travelling}} exhibition that first opened on June 28, 2015, at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts. It {{was developed by}} the Museum of Science in collaboration with Pixar. The exhibit features forty interactive elements that explain the production pipeline at Pixar. They are divided into eight sections, each demonstrating a step in the filmmaking process: Modeling, Rigging, Surfaces, Sets & Cameras, Animation, Simulation, Lighting, and Rendering. Before visitors enter the exhibit, they watch a short video at an introductory theater.|$|E

500|$|Erving Goffman (11 June 1922– 19 November 1982) was a Canadian-American {{sociologist}} and writer, {{considered by}} some [...] "the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century".

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) (1989–2001) was an {{international}} lobbyist group of businesses that opposed action to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and challenged the <b>science</b> <b>behind</b> global warming. The GCC was the largest industry group active in climate policy and the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations. The GCC was involved {{in opposition to the}} Kyoto Protocol, and played a role in blocking ratification by the United States. The coalition promoted the views of climate skeptics. The GCC dissolved in 2001 after membership declined in the face of improved understanding of the role of greenhouse gases in climate change and of public criticism.|$|E
5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to {{represent}} the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the <b>science</b> <b>behind</b> global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E

His popularity with the general public {{has been attributed to}} his writing style, described as [...] "sardonic, satiric, jokey", and as [...] "ironic and self-consciously literary", and to its being more accessible than that of most academics. His style has also been influential in academia, and is credited with popularizing a less formal style in academic publications.|$|R
