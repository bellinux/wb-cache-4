25|$|A channel {{agreement}} for Virgin Media to keep non-premium Sky channels ended on 1 March 2007. Virgin Media and Sky {{failed to reach}} agreement on the issue, and Sky reacted by posting {{a letter to the}} public in major UK newspapers on 28 February 2007. Despite Sky's letter, Virgin Media blamed Sky for tyrannising them and inciting consumers to switch. The companies failed to resolve their differences, and subsequently after midnight on 1 March 2007, Virgin Media replaced the Sky 1, Sky 2, Sky Travel, Sky Travel Extra, Sky Sports News and Sky News channel content with a <b>standard</b> <b>message.</b> Sky attributed part of the rate rise {{to the fact that the}} new deal would also include Sky 3, Sky Arts and undisclosed high definition and video on demand content. Sky said the deal would cost only 3p per customer per day (roughly £35,000,000 per year), but Virgin said that a minimum payment guarantee included in the contract meant that the actual amount due would exceed twice the current payment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} developing linguistically tailored educational messages designed to match the linguistic styles of patients segmented into types with the Descriptor™, and to determine patient preferences for tailored or <b>standard</b> <b>messages</b> based on their segments. Patients and methods: Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) were recruited from a diabetes health clinic. Participants were segmented using the Descriptor™, a language-based questionnaire, to identify patient types based on their control orientation (internal/external), agency (high/low), and affect (positive/negative), which are well studied constructs related to T 2 DM self-management. Two of the seven self-care behaviors described by the American Association of Diabetes Educators (healthy eating and taking medication) were used to develop <b>standard</b> <b>messages</b> and then linguistically tailored using features of the six different construct segment types of the Descriptor™. A subset of seven participants each provided feedback on their preference for standard or linguistically tailored messages; 12 comparisons between <b>standard</b> and tailored <b>messages</b> were made. Results: Overall, the tailored messages were preferred to the <b>standard</b> <b>messages.</b> When the messages were matched to specific construct segment types, the tailored messages were preferred over the <b>standard</b> <b>messages,</b> although this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Linguistically tailoring messages based on construct segments is feasible. Further - more, tailored messages were more often preferred over <b>standard</b> <b>messages.</b> This study provides some preliminary evidence for tailoring messages based on the linguistic features of control orientation, agency, and affect. The messages developed in this study should be tested in a larger more representative sample. The present study did not explore whether tailored messages were better understood. This research will serve as preliminary evidence to develop future studies with the ultimate goal to design intervention studies to investigate if linguistically tailoring com - munication {{within the context of}} patient education influences patient knowledge, motivation, and activation toward making healthy behavior changes in T 2 DM self-management...|$|R
