5000|$|... 'The Settlement Exhibition Reykjavík 871±2' {{focuses on}} archaeological finds from the {{earliest}} period of habitation at Reykjavík, and scholarly research on them. A well-preserved Viking-Age hall was unearthed here, along with fragments of wall structures which {{are some of the}} oldest signs of human habitation in Iceland. These archaeological relics are important in themselves, but what made the find so remarkable, and led to the conservation and display of the site, is that the structures were found at the very place where, according to written sources, the first settler in Iceland made his home. These sources, Íslendingabók (the Book of Icelanders) and Landnámabók (the Book of Settlements), were written down in the 12th century, some time after the events they describe; there is a consensus among scholars that the Book of Icelanders is more reliable as a source on the settlement. Many of the Sagas of Icelanders, written down in the 13th-14th centuries, also recount events from the Settlement Age, but these are today deemed to be largely fictional, although their value is recognised as evidence of the society and circumstances of their writers, and their conceptions of the Settlement Age. From these writings, a myth evolved of the dawn of Icelandic history, which {{played a major role in}} the Icelanders' campaign for independence in the 19th century, and has retained its iconic value for the nation ever since. Archaeological research on man-made structures and other relics from the early years of Icelandic history is of a different nature. Archaeology aims to examine the object of study, analyse it by all available means, and glean from it as much as possible about the society and individuals who left the relics. Archaeological methods have progressed enormously in the century since such research commenced in Iceland. Today's archaeologists apply a variety of hi-tech scientific approaches, in order to uncover the secrets of the smallest traces found. Their methods are not unlike the techniques of forensic scientists, familiar to us from TV and film, where traces invisible to the naked eye can yield vital evidence of past events.Archaeological finds from the Settlement Age are interesting because they cast light on the people who lived here, their way of life and society. But such research will never make any major contribution to resolving the debate on the <b>source</b> <b>value</b> of the Books of Icelanders and Settlements; however, this ongoing debate may in itself be seen as part of the iconic image, having its own symbolic value.|$|E
40|$|The Ca isotope {{composition}} of marine carbonate rocks offers potential to reconstruct drivers of environmental {{change in the}} geologic past. This study reports new, high-precision Ca isotope records (View the MathML source; 2 σSD=± 0. 04 ‰) for three sections spanning a major perturbation to the Cretaceous ocean-climate system known as Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2) : central Colorado, USA (Portland # 1 core), southeastern France (Pont d'Issole), and Hokkaido, Japan (Oyubari, Yezo Group). In addition, we generated new data for selected samples from Eastbourne, England (English Chalk), where a previous Ca isotope study was completed using different methodology (Blättler et al., 2011). Strata of the Yezo Group contain little carbonate (∼ 1 wt. % on average) and accordingly did not yield a clear View the MathML source signal. The Portland core and the Pont d'Issole section display comparable View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>values,</b> which increase by ∼ 0. 10 – 0. 15 ‰ {{at the onset of}} OAE 2 and then decrease to near-initial values across the event. The Eastbourne View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>values</b> are higher than previously reported. They are also higher than the View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>values</b> for the Portland core and the Pont d'Issole section but define a similar pattern. According to a numerical model of the marine Ca cycle, elevated hydrothermal inputs have little impact on seawater View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>values.</b> Elevated riverine (chemical weathering) inputs produce a transient negative isotope excursion, which significantly differs from the positive isotope excursions observed in the Portland, Pont d'Issole, and Eastbourne records. A decrease in the magnitude of the carbonate fractionation factor provides the best explanation for a positive shift in View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>values,</b> especially given the rapid nature of the excursion. Because a decrease in the fractionation factor corresponds to an increase in the Ca/CO 3 ratio of seawater, we tentatively attribute the positive Ca isotope excursion to transient ocean acidification, i. e., a reduction in the concentration of View the MathML source during CO 2 uptake. Recent studies utilizing a variety of isotope proxies, e. g., Nd, Os, and Pb, implicate eruption of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province as a likely source of increased CO 2. Moreover, integration of C, Ca, and Os isotope data reveals new information about the timing of events during the onset of OAE 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Data fusion is {{the process}} of {{combining}} multiple represen-tations of the same object, extracted from several external sources, into a single and clean representation. It is usually the last step of an inte-gration process, which is executed after the schema matching and the entity identification steps. More specifically, data fusion aims at solv-ing attribute value conflicts based on user-defined rules. Although there exist several approaches in the literature for fusing data, few of them focus on optimizing the process when new versions of the sources be-come available. In this paper, we propose a model for incremental data fusion. Our approach is based on storing provenance information {{in the form of a}} sequence of operations. These operations reflect the last fusion rules applied on the imported data. By keeping both the original <b>source</b> <b>value</b> and the new fused data in the operations repository, we are able to reliably detect <b>source</b> <b>value</b> updates, and propagate them to the fusion process, which reapplies previously defined rules whenever it is possible. This approach reduces the number of data items affected by source up-dates and minimizes the amount of user manual intervention in future fusion processes. ...|$|E

40|$|Chromium {{isotopes}} are fractionated during redox {{reactions and}} {{have the potential to}} provide a record of changes in the oxygenation levels of the oceans in the geological past. However, Cr is a trace metal in seawater and its low concentrations make isotopic measurements challenging. Here we report the first determinations of View the MathML source for seawater from open ocean (Argentine Basin) and coastal (Southampton Water) settings, using a double-spike technique. The total chromium concentration in seawater from Southampton Water is 1. 85 nM, whereas the Cr content of Argentine Basin samples is 5. 8 – 6. 6 nM. The View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>value</b> of seawater from the Argentine Basin is 0. 491 – 0. 556 ‰ in intermediate and deep waters, and varies between 0. 412 and 0. 664 ‰ in surface waters (< 150 m). The View the MathML <b>source</b> <b>value</b> of Southampton Water seawater is 1. 505 ‰, which may reflect in situ reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). All of our seawater samples have higher View the MathML source than crustal and mantle silicates, and mass balance modelling demonstrates that river water must also be enriched in heavy Cr isotopes, indicating that Cr isotopes are fractionated during weathering and/or during transport to the oceans. We also show that the Cr isotopic composition of modern non-skeletal marine carbonates (0. 640 – 0. 745 ‰) encompasses the range that we measure for Argentine Basin seawater. Thus, fractionation of Cr isotopes during precipitation of these marine carbonates is likely to be small (< 0. 2 ‰), and they have the potential to provide a record of the Cr isotopic composition of ancient seawater. Phanerozoic carbonates are also characterised by heavy View the MathML source and a correlation between View the MathML source and Ce/Ce? suggests that the Cr and Ce cycles in the ocean are linked...|$|E
