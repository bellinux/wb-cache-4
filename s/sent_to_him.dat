5|$|Daily {{life became}} more {{difficult}} for the family: Priestley was burned in effigy along with Thomas Paine; vicious political cartoons continued to be published about him; letters were <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from across the country, comparing him to the devil and Guy Fawkes; tradespeople feared the family's business; and Priestley's Royal Academy friends distanced themselves. As the penalties became harsher for those who spoke out against the government, Priestley examined options for removing himself and his family from England.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Annigoni {{completed}} a circular {{drawing of the}} Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh facing each other {{against a background of}} Windsor Castle to mark their silver wedding anniversary. The drawing was commissioned by the Library of Imperial History to be etched on commemorative silver and gold plates. Annigoni based the drawing on earlier sketches he had {{completed a}}nd the most recent official portraits which were <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes {{of up to}} , {{emerging}} at night to feed on plant matter and occasionally on animals. From January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by the naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe.|$|E
5000|$|According to his legend, Getulius was {{a native}} of Gabii in Sabina. Getulius was an officer in the Roman army who {{resigned}} when he became a Christian. He retired to his estates near Tivoli. Caerealis was an imperial legate <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> arrest <b>him</b> but was converted to Christianity by Getulius. Primitivus was another officer <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> arrest <b>him,</b> but he was also converted. Amantius was Getulius' brother.|$|R

5|$|The Duchess of Lorraine's {{love for}} her husband was strong and possessive. The letters she <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> shortly before their {{marriage}} expressed her eagerness to see him; his letters, on the other hand, were stereotyped and formal. She was very jealous {{of her husband and}} his infidelity was the greatest problem of their marriage, with Maria Wilhelmina, Princess of Auersperg, as his best-known mistress.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by J. Lewis Bonhote in 1907. The description {{was based on}} a male specimen <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by J.Vassal, a French physician who had collected the specimen from Nha Trang, Vietnam (then called Annam, a French Protectorate) in 1905. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock combined all slow lorises into a single species, Nycticebus coucang.|$|E
5|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically {{under the name}} Boletus confragosus by English naturalist James Bolton, in his 1791 work An History of Fungusses, growing about Halifax. He reported finding specimens on old trees near Fixby Hall, and having specimens <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from Darlington. The species has been shuffled between several genera in its taxonomic history: Daedalea by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801; Trametes by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844; Polyporus by Paul Kummer in 1871; Stigila by Otto Kuntze in 1891; Lenzites by Patouillard in 1900; Agaricus by William Alphonso Murrill in 1905; and Ischnoderma by Ivan Zmitrovich in 2001. It was transferred to its current genus, Daedaleopsis, by German mycologist Joseph Schröter in 1888. D.confragosa is the type species of the genus Daedaleopsis.|$|E

5|$|Greed has {{sometimes}} been said to be over 100 reels long. Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several {{of the people who}} saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that Stroheim initially <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of Greed was 70 reels.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{explained}} that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was adamant that the production should be a collaborative effort amongst the two musicians. The tape <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, {{making it one of}} Jackson's slowest songs.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{recruiting}} {{difficulties in}} Virginia continued, despite {{the implementation of}} a draft by the state legislature. Finally, in October 1779, he forwarded troops <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from Washington's Northern Army on to Lincoln in South Carolina, fulfilling his quota. He retained only Abraham Buford's regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in Petersburg, Virginia. Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General Henry Clinton would turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until it was clear that Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

The mass shootings continued into 1944. With Soviet troops closing in, the last 300 to 700 Sonderkommandos disposing of the incriminating evidence were executed by Trawnikis in late July 1944, long after the camp's official closure. Strebel, the ethnic German who had been installed in the farmhouse built in place of the camp's original bakery using bricks from the gas chambers, set fire to the building and fled to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of Jordan grants its monarch {{the right to}} withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament. Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from the National Assembly; if he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses; otherwise, {{the law does not}} go into effect (but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly). If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him, it becomes law without his signature.|$|E

5|$|What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions is a non-fiction book by Randall Munroe {{in which}} the author answers {{hypothetical}} science questions <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by readers of his webcomic, xkcd. The book contains a selection of questions and answers originally published on his blog What If?, along with several new ones. The book is divided into several dozen chapters, {{most of which are}} devoted to answering a unique question. What If? was released in September 2, 2014 and was received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, {{it is unlikely that the}} impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{a series}} of {{newspaper}} supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, Le Petit Vingtième (The Little Twentieth), which subsequently appeared in Le Vingtième Siècle every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet), a comic strip authored {{by one of the}} paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus' Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.|$|E

5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by his brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings {{of different types of}} symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E
5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily, which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed {{to catch up with}} the expedition before it sailed for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for help, but he did nothing.|$|E
