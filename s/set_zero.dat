Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the <b>set.</b> <b>Zero</b> is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} figure {{compares the}} 1996-1999 period with the 2013-2015 period, {{in terms of}} Japan's real GDP. During the 1996-1999 period, the consumption tax was raised from 3 to 5 per cent, and during the 2013-2015 period, the same tax was raised from 5% to 8%. For the 1996-1999 period, the GDP {{of the first quarter}} of 1996 is set 100. For the 2013-2015 period, that of Q1 of 2013 is 100. The interval of the horizontal axis is one quarter, and the quarters when the consumption tax were raised are <b>set</b> <b>zero.</b> And therefore, the GDPs of Q1 1996 and of Q1 2013 correspond to values evaluated at quarter -5. [...] In the first quarter of 2015, Japan's economy grew by 0.6 per cent on a quarterly basis. Increase of inventories helped the economy to expand, and the momentum can be lost in the second quarter. This suggests that the consumption tax hike from 5 to 8 per cent continues to {{have a negative effect on}} the economy.|$|E
