5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local <b>social</b> <b>norms,</b> government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though appreciated by many of the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and mores.|$|E

40|$|How {{the law and}} the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> {{interact}} with each other in the legalized modern society, whether the law completely replaces the pre-existing <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> or they coexist, and whether their interaction achieves an efficient system of social rules or there is innate inefficiency, have remained obscure until today. This article provides an analytical model to clarify the interrelationship between {{the law and the}} <b>social</b> <b>norm.</b> We show that, where both the law and <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> maximize <b>social</b> welfare, their non-cooperative interaction attains Pareto efficiency and that they are perfect substitutes to each other. We then consider the case where <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> is determined on the basis of some misperceptions and show the possibility that an inefficient social system may persist. Furthermore, we illustrate the possibility that law and <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> are complements to each other and that the existence of the government could be second-best. ...|$|R
40|$|Why are the {{unemployed}} particularly unhappy in some societies? According to the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> theory of unemployment, {{the well-being of}} the non-employed is lower in countries with a strong <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work because of the greater stigma attached to unemployment. In this study, a <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work has been defined as the extent to which people expect others to work: do people think {{the unemployed}} should take any job they are offered, or should {{they have a right to}} refuse? The combined world and European values study and the European social survey were used to test the theory. Multilevel analyses show that—net of one’s own norm and other measures of the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work, such as one’s personal work ethic—the well-being of unemployed men is lower in countries with a strong <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work, in particular that of the long-term unemployed. Overall, it appears that the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work still weighs more heavily upon men than women...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{inspired}} by the observation that the ‘social norm’ approach, from social psychology, has something of a Cinderella role in social marketing. With this in mind, our objective is to review and examine the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> approach, and its relevance to social marketing. The <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> approach consists of encouraging socially desirable behaviour change by telling people what other people do {{in the form of}} communications regarding majority or average behaviours. This approach has been employed by social psychologists and some niche practitioners to tackle social issues from student substance abuse to energy consumption. We first explore the origins of the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> approach in psychology and social psychology, and we comment upon two key mechanisms by which social psychologists have contended that the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> approach works. Using examples, we then provide a conceptually and empirically grounded guide to the implementation of <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> marketing campaigns. In our conclusion, we comment on the curious way in which the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> approach appears to subvert generally accepted ideas about the types of information that should be communicated in social marketing campaigns...|$|R
5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide {{a better understanding of}} intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the effects of {{investigations}} on tax compliance. In a very general model we explain the direct and indirect effects of investigations and analyse taxpayers’ response to an increase in the probability of audit when tax compliance is a <b>social</b> <b>norm.</b> We define the different elements that determine the impact of audits on compliance and show that if tax compliance is a <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> in the relevant community there is an additional effect arising because of <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> considerations. The behavioural response of taxpayers to an increase in the audit rate is stronger. Our Findings help explain seemingly contradictory results that emerge from the empirical evidence. tax evasion, <b>social</b> <b>norm,</b> opportunities to evade, optimal audit rule...|$|R
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{theory of}} wage rigidity claims that a <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> against underbidding may prevent wages from falling to market clearing levels.

Recently performed questionnaire studies have thrown {{doubt on the}} conjecture {{that there is a}} <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> against underbidding. In this paper we experimentally show that the impact of underbidding may crucually depend {{on the nature of the}} labour contract. If labour contracts are incomplete wages may not approach the market clearing level even in the presence of severe underbidding...|$|R

5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and <b>social</b> <b>norms,</b> while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{to what extent}} a <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work moderates the relationship between employment status and subjective well-being. It was expected that the detrimental impact of non-employment on subjective well-being would be larger in countries with a stronger <b>social</b> <b>norm.</b> Using a direct measure of the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work and employing data from 45 European countries, this study assessed subjective well-being levels of five employment status groups {{for men and women}} separately. Results showed that subjective well-being of unemployed men and women is unaffected by the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> to work. However, non-working disabled men are worse off in countries with a stronger norm. Living in such a country also decreases the well-being gap between employed and retired men, whereas retired women are worse off in these countries. This effect for retirees disappears when a country’s GDP is taken into account, suggesting that norms matter less than affluence...|$|R

5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them to articulate <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between unemployment, mental health (care), and medication use among 50 – 65 year old men (N= 11, 789) and women (N= 15, 118) are studied in Europe. Inspired by the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> theory of unemployment, {{the relevance of}} regional unemployment levels and workplace closure are explored, using multilevel analyses of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement. In line with the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> theory, the results show that–only for men–displaced workers are less depressed and use less medication than the non-displaced unemployed. However, they report more depressive symptoms than the employed, which supports the causal effect of unemployment on mental health. Non-displaced unemployed men {{are also more likely}} to consume medication than the displaced unemployed. In addition, using regional unemployment as a proxy for the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> of unemployment can be questioned when studying mental health effects, as it seems to be a stronger measurement of labour market conditions than of the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> of unemployment, especially during a recession...|$|R
5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into {{a woman in the}} course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in the grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. <b>Social</b> <b>norms</b> also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E
5|$|The socio-religious {{movements}} of the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> to which women were expected to abide. By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men, such as administration, business and trade, and involvement in the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote Varadambika Parinayam and Gangadevi who wrote Madhuravijayam were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore {{is known to have}} patronised several women poets.

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge <b>social</b> <b>norms.</b> The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E
