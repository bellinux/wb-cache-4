5000|$|Auckland Brush truck remnants. In 2012 {{excavations}} at {{the former}} Mount Roskill Bus Depot circa 1951 for a new Shopping centre uncovered over a dozen Brush D side frames along with a single Brush improved <b>sideframe</b> and remnants of Brush 1200 and Brush 1400 Motor cases. The side frames are now in MOTAT's possession for research and future Auckland tram restorations with the motor remnants being cared for in private hands for possible replication for various projects. It {{is believed to be}} the only Brush 1200 and 1400 motors to have survived in New Zealand if not the world.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} a modified Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) algorithm for optimal design of topologies for complex structures. A new approach for adaptively controlling the material elimination and a &# 039;gauss point average stress&# 039; is used as the ESO criterion {{in order to reduce the}} generation of checkerboard patterns in the resultant optimal topologies. Also, a convergence criterion is used to examine the uniformity of strength throughout a structure. The ESO algorithm is validated by comparing the ESO based solution with the result obtained using another numerical optimisation method (SIMP). The capabilities of ESO for producing an optimal design against a specified strength constraint are illustrated using two industrial design problems, viz: a bulkhead used in an aircraft structure and a <b>sideframe</b> used in a railway freight wagon. It has been shown that topology optimisation using ESO can result in a considerable reduction in the weight of a structure and an optimum material utilisation by generating a uniformly stressed structure. The ESO algorithm was also applied to the shape optimisation of a local geometry of the <b>sideframe</b> to (locally) reduce stress levels. The paper evaluates and establishes the ESO method as a practical tool for optimum topology and subsequent shape design problems for complex industrial structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{discontinuities}} in surface {{profiles of}} railway wheels, {{commonly known as}} wheel flats, are known to impose excessive impact loads at the wheel-rail interface. Such impact loads can cause premature fatigue and failure of the vehicle-track system components, and impede the operational safety. The safe and cost-effective operations of railways thus necessitate continuous monitoring and control of impact loads induced by wheel defects. In this dissertation research, an adaptive wheel-rail contact model is developed to predict contact geometry and impact force {{as a function of}} flat geometry, speed and normal load. The model employs radial contact springs and could simulate for either single or multiple wheel flats. Unlike the commonly used Hertizan nonlinear models, adaptive model predicts the contact geometry involving either total or partial contact {{in the presence of a}} wheel defect in the contact patch. The proposed contact model is integrated to a roll plane model of vehicle and a three-dimensional flexible track model to derive a coupled vehicle-track system model. The vehicle is modeled as a six-DOF lumped mass system including carbody, bolster, <b>sideframe,</b> wheelset, and primary and secondary suspensions. The track system model considers two parallel Timoshenko beams periodically supported by lumped masses representing sleepers. The rail-pad and ballast are also included through linear visco-elastic elements. Central finite difference technique is employed to solve for the coupled partial and ordinary differential equations of motion for the continuous and discrete system models, respectively. The dynamic response of the wheel-track system is initially investigated under a constant moving load to examine validity of the model and the numerical method. The impact force response of the adaptive contact model in the presence of a single wheel flat revealed reasonably good agreements with available measured data. This agreement was better than that provided by the well-known Hertizan nonlinear point contact model. The results further revealed that discrete sleeper supports act as sources of excitations. The results attained from the parametric study revealed that the normal load, speed and flat size are the primary factors that affect magnitudes of impact forces, while the suspension parameters show only minor effects. Some of the parameters of the track system also revealed important effects on magnitudes of impact force. The coupled vehicle-track system is further analyzed to derive the impact force properties for different wheel flats, operating speeds and loads. The analyses were also performed for single as well as two flats within the same or two opposite wheels of a wheelset. The results suggested that magnitudes of impact forces attributed to the second flat were strongly affected by responses to the preceding flat. The resulting peak impact force may be either higher or lower than that caused by a single flat, depending upon flats geometry, relative coordinates of the flats and operating speed. The results further suggest that the length of a flat, which is regarded as the removal criteria by AAR and Transport Canada, is not sufficient for cases involving either single or multiple flat...|$|E

50|$|Correspondence exists {{indicating}} {{that it was}} intended that later wagons, 92 and above (along with some QR wagons), would be built using underframes recycled from the NN to O conversion project with splices added to increase the length. As this conversion did not happen the wagons were built new, although some in this number range have splices evident in the <b>sideframes.</b>|$|R
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} traction control system in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck <b>sideframes</b> of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|R
40|$|Suspension {{tests on}} three piece bogies were {{conducted}} at the Centre for Railway Engineering Heavy Testing Laboratory. Two 3 â€“piece bogies were tested; both had constant force type friction wedge dampers. One bogie had constant force wedges housed in the bolster. The other bogie had constant force wedges housed in the <b>sideframes.</b> The bogies tested were not reconditioned with wedges half worn or more. Tests were completed using a coal wagon ballasted with scrap steel to simulate a loaded wagon. Track profile inputs were simulated using position controlled hydraulic cylinders. Both bogies were subjected to bounce tests at 3 and 7 Hz and sinusoidal rail profile inputs of wavelengths 3. 0 m with simulated vehicle speeds of 40 and 80 kph. Further variation in suspension behaviour was investigated by simulating variations in wheelset wheel diameters. Wheelset diameter mismatches of 24 mm were simulated for first and second axles on the bogie. Rail profile magnitudes tested were 24 mm peak to peak. The bounce tests illustrated the inadequacy of the friction damping at resonance. The simulation of rail profile inputs, which resulted in pitch motion of the bogie <b>sideframes</b> resulted in unexpected hysteresis performance. The work demonstrates {{the limitations of the}} friction dampers commonly used on freight bogies and highlights the need for more detailed mathematical models in wagon simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Due to the 7/8" [...] {{steel tubing}} {{used for the}} <b>sideframes,</b> chosen for low cost and {{universal}} availability, the RoughRider weighs about 40 lbs which may be too heavy for some newly injured riders to navigate up steep hills. The RoughRider {{does not have an}} anti-tip bar which would make the rider safer during a backwards wheelie and has only recently added wheelguards that reduce mud and water splatter on the rider. Both of these features is currently under development. There is also a need for a rugged active chair for disabled children in developing countries and a child's version of the RoughRider is currently being tested in South Africa.|$|R
40|$|An inverse {{dynamic model}} for the {{estimation}} of wheel-rail interaction forces from measured wagon or car body accelerations was developed. A knowledge of wheel rail forces is industrially important from a vehicle safety and maintenance cost viewpoint but these forces are difficult to determine in service. An initial estimation model was developed from the vehicle dynamic equations to allow prediction of these forces from low cost acceleration measurements. The model has 25 degrees of freedom (DOF). Inputs are accelerations measured at the car body and <b>sideframes.</b> The outputs are 16 wheel-rail reaction forces in lateral and vertical directions respectively. The railway vehicle simulation package, VAMPIRE, is {{used to evaluate the}} initial model...|$|R
5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a rubber roller. The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two <b>sideframes.</b> The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.|$|R
2500|$|The Valkyrie A or Valkyrie I {{took place}} over the summer of 1910 and the {{aircraft}} was first flown in October 1910 at the newly established Hendon Aerodrome, where the ASL had leased three hangars next to those occupied by the BlÃ©riot school. [...] Although this aircraft shared the same canard configuration as its predecessor, there were significant alterations. It was powered by a 35hp 4-cyl Green C.4 engine mounted {{in front of the}} leading edge of the wing, driving a 7ft 3 in (2.21 m) pusher propeller directly in front of the centre-section of the wing, the leading edge of which was set back from that of the outer sections. A pair of foreplanes, one fixed and the other moveable, were mounted on a pair of widely spaced wire-braced mahogany side-frames, each having a straight upper boom and a curved lower member. The twin rudders were initially mounted on the kingposts at the rear of these frames, in line with the trailing edge of the wing but after trials were moved aft, each being mounted on two short booms. In addition a small area of the <b>sideframes</b> at the front of the aircraft was given a fabric covering.|$|R
