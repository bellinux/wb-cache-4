25|$|Although a small {{quantity}} of shrimp were sold locally, most were boiled and dried, {{resulting in a}} <b>shelf-stable</b> product that was exported to China and Hawaii. Drying resulted in two products: one third by weight the higher-grade product, called dried shrimp meat, which was used for human consumption, and two thirds the lower-grade product, called shrimp meal, which was used for fish food and plant fertilizer.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{traditional}} <b>shelf-stable</b> pet foods, Freshpet {{ingredients are}} cooked once at lower temperatures. [...] Thus, similar to less-processed {{foods such as}} milk, natural cooked meats and yogurt, the meals have a shorter shelf life.|$|E
2500|$|Ce4+ is {{a strong}} one-electron {{oxidizing}} agent. [...] In terms of its redox potential (E° ~ 1.61 V vs. N.H.E.) it is even stronger oxidizing agent than Cl2 (E° ~ 1.36 V). Few <b>shelf-stable</b> reagents are stronger oxidants. In the redox process Ce(IV) is converted to Ce(III), a one-electron change, signaled by the fading of the solution color from orange to a pale yellow (providing that the substrate and product are not strongly colored).|$|E
2500|$|Like other missions, HI-SEAS {{evaluates the}} social and {{psychological}} status of the crewmembers while they live in isolation and conduct field work in Mars-like environments and conditions. [...] However, HI-SEAS is especially focused on the diet and nutrition of its crewmembers. [...] In particular, HI-SEAS is studying how “food intake in a confined and isolated setting similar to what an astronaut would experience during a mission” affects the moods of the crew members and their interactions with each other. [...] Crew members prepare their own meals using combinations of <b>shelf-stable</b> ingredients and pre-packaged meals and frequently complete surveys to determine their mood, health, and satisfaction with the food.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shelf-stable</b> food (sometimes ambient food) is food of a {{type that}} can be safely stored at room {{temperature}} in a sealed container. This includes foods that would normally be stored refrigerated but which have been processed {{so that they can}} be safely stored at room or ambient temperature for a usefully long shelf life. For instance, the first <b>shelf-stable</b> formulation of ranch dressing, created in 1983, had a shelf life of 150 days.|$|E

50|$|Food {{designers}} use {{water activity}} to formulate <b>shelf-stable</b> food. If {{a product is}} kept below a certain water activity, then mold growth is inhibited. This results in a longer shelf life.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{whole food}} diets {{contained}} sufficient amounts of omega-3, but because omega-3 is readily oxidized, the trend to <b>shelf-stable,</b> processed foods {{has led to}} a deficiency in omega-3 in manufactured foods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shelf-stable,</b> {{specifically}} “non-potentially hazardous.” This generally means {{food products}} {{that can be}} safely held without temperature controls because the product would not support {{the rapid growth of}} infectious or toxic organisms.|$|E
50|$|While cut and {{extruded}} noodles can be dried {{to create}} a <b>shelf-stable</b> product to be eaten months after production, most peeled, pulled and kneaded noodles are consumed shortly after they are produced.|$|E
5000|$|The Nutrisystem program {{provides}} over 150 menu choices in four categories: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks/desserts. Most options are <b>shelf-stable</b> products which include bars, muffins, pretzel snacks and pancake mix, {{as well as}} microwavable soups and dinner entrees. All <b>shelf-stable</b> microwaveable entrees are developed through retort preparation, which uses heat and pressure to cook food in a strong, sealed package (like a can or pouch). This preparation method allows for safe holding at room temperature and minimizes the need for added preservatives or sodium. Nutrisystem also has a line of frozen food choices available called “Nutrisystem Select.” ...|$|E

50|$|Unrefined {{jojoba oil}} {{appears as a}} clear golden liquid at room {{temperature}} with a slightly nutty odor. Refined jojoba oil is colorless and odorless. The melting point of jojoba oil is approximately 10 °C and the iodine value is approximately 80. Jojoba oil is relatively <b>shelf-stable</b> when compared with other vegetable oils mainly because it contains little triglycerides, unlike most other vegetable oils such as grape seed oil and coconut oil. It has an oxidative stability index of approximately 60, which means {{that it is more}} <b>shelf-stable</b> than safflower oil, canola oil, almond oil or squalene but less than castor oil and coconut oil.|$|E
