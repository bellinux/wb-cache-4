5|$|In 1960, Chai {{went to the}} United States {{and studied}} at the University of Tennessee, where he earned his master's degree in {{political}} <b>science.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of participating in the independence movement of Taiwan, Chai {{was placed on the}} Kuomintang's black list and was unable to return to Taiwan. He continued studying and attended the University of Southern California, earning his doctorate in 1969.

5|$|In 1969, the {{institution}} {{was made into}} an independent school and named to honor Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel after a major contribution from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts & Sciences. The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean <b>Science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> joint venture with the Pew Charitable Trusts, and in 2008, the program relocated to SUNY at Stony Brook.|$|E
5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way of inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called {{for the establishment of}} regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the wall of his home office.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions about <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E

25|$|Scrying is not {{supported}} by <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> method of predicting the future or obtaining information unavailable to empirical investigation.

25|$|According to Pierre Duhem, {{who founded}} the {{academic}} study of medieval <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> critique of the Enlightenment-positivist theory of a 17th-century anti-Aristotelian and anticlerical scientific revolution, the various conceptual origins of that alleged revolution lay in the 12th to 14th centuries, {{in the works of}} churchmen such as Aquinas and Buridan.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} revolution established <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{source for}} the growth of knowledge.

30|$|In {{the above}} outline, the {{different}} modes of understanding share the joint trait that the scientist {{does not yet}} perform any action targeted at intervening in the object world other than for epistemic purposes. Nevertheless, various bigger pictures {{of the status of}} science in society have already been addressed: <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> education of the mind and personality or <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> enabler of instrumental interaction, intervention, control and prediction. The latter will now be discussed in further detail.|$|R
25|$|In Ecofeminism (1993) authors Vandana Shiva, Maria Mies and Evan Bondi ponder {{modern science}} and its {{acceptance}} {{as a universal}} and value-free system. Instead, they view the dominant stream of modern <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> projection of Western men's values. The privilege of determining what is considered scientific knowledge has been controlled by men, {{and for the most}} part of history restricted to men. Bondi and Miles list examples including the medicalization of childbirth and the industrialization of plant reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Conservative Judaism embraces <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way {{to learn}} about the world, and, like Modern Orthodox and Reform Judaism, has not found the theory of {{evolution}} a challenge to traditional Jewish theology. The Conservative Jewish movement has not yet developed one official response to the subject, but a broad array of views has converged. Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings about how this occurs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} of graph {{coloring}} problems in mathematics and computer science, a greedy coloring is a coloring of the vertices of a graph formed by a greedy algorithm that considers the vertices of the graph in sequence and assigns each vertex its first available color. Greedy colorings do not in general use the minimum number of colors possible. However, they {{have been used in}} mathematics as a technique for proving other results about colorings and in computer <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heuristic to find colorings with few colors.|$|E
25|$|Bronx Science has {{a student}} body of about 3,000 students.

In 1999, there were 20,000 students taking the entrance exam, increasing to approximately 30,000 students in 2011. During the 2011 round of tests, 19,587 students listed Bronx <b>Science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> choice on their application, and about 1,044 applicants were offered spots at the school.|$|E

He also attended Mass daily, and would sometimes use a patient's faith, as well as the sacraments, in his treatments.
