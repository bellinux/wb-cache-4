40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{contribution}} to description {{and understanding of the}} distribution and movement of water in swelling soils. In order to investigate the moisture distribution in swelling soils a detailed knowledge of volume change properties, flow characteristics and total potential of water in the soil is essential. Therefore, a possible volume change mechanism is first described by dividing the swelling soils into four categories and volume change of a <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> is measured under different overburden pressures. The measured and calculated (from volume change data) overburden potential components are used to check the validity of the derivation of a load factor, ∝. Moisture diffusivity in <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> under different overburden pressures is measured using Gardner's (1956) outflow method. Behaviour of equilibrium moisture profiles in swelling soils is theoretically explained, solving the differential equation by considering the physical variation of individual soil properties with moisture content and overburden pressure. Using the measured volume change data and moisture potentials under various overburden pressures, the behaviour of possible moisture profiles are described at equilibrium and under steady vertical flows in swelling soils. It is shown that high overburden pressures lead to soil water behaviour quite different from any previously reported...|$|E

Experimentally, water was applied to the top end of an initially air-dry column of <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> (50 % bentonite clay and 50 % quartz silt), with the top end allowed to rise upward as swelling occurred. A narrowly collimated beam of dual-energy gamma rays was employed to measure the soil bulk density and water content nondestructively, within the column, over a time period of 1 to 2 wk. ^ It was found necessary to extend the existing theory, by considering the soil void ratio to be a function of both fractional water saturation (volume of water per unit pore volume) and time. This also introduced an auxiliary time dependence into the water diffusivity function. Furthermore, to allow for an experimentally feasible boundary condition, the governing differential flow equation was recast in terms of the fractional water saturation. A mathematical solution of the flow problem was sought and found in terms of product-form separation of variables. Some early-time departure from square-root-of-time dependence was found.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Swelling</b> <b>soils</b> {{are a major}} {{geologic}} hazard, and expansive clays and clay-shales cause {{extensive damage}} worldwide every year. One of the worst <b>swelling</b> <b>soils</b> damage regions in the United States occurs along the 300 km long Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado which is underlain by Cretaceous clay-shales, including the Pierre Shale. The sedimentary bedrock strata are generally flat-lying, except near {{the foothills of the}} Rocky Mountains where they have been uplifted into steeply-dipping strata. Expansive clays in the Pierre Shale and adjacent formations along the Front Range are responsible for the damage. The hazard is most severe in areas where these units dip steeply because of differential movement of adjacent beds (cm-m) which has been attributed to the abundance and composition of swelling clays (Gill ## ##., 1996).

40|$|Although {{the theory}} of water {{movement}} through an unsaturated, <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> has been developing {{for a number of}} years, the efficiency of the results has been limited, and the developed models have suffered from a lack of a mechanism to reliably define water flow and experimental techniques for measuring the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties. The intent of the present research is to elucidate and to investigate {{the theory of}} flow through unsaturated, <b>swelling</b> <b>soil,</b> to develop a three dimensional theoretical model based on a reliable soil swelling and unsaturated flow mechanism and, furthermore, to characterize the relationships between different soil hydraulic and swelling properties. In the first part, based on the water adsorption mechanism by the soil particles and the use of continuum theory principles, a theoretical model of unsaturated flow through <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> has been developed. Some new techniques were established to measure the different soil swelling and hydraulic properties and to analyze the effect of the soil's initial conditions. The reliability of the different existing empirical models, to be applied to the results obtained from hydraulics, shrinkage and swelling experiments, were investigated and modified where necessary. A static neural network model was developed to mathematically characterize the experimental results being used in the proposed numerical solution of the mathematical model. The neural network model works based on the back-propagation error method with adaptive learning rules by means of the neural network tool box of MATLAB software. A finite difference numerical model, based on a fully implicit method, was proposed to numerically solve the one dimensional governing equation (simplified form of 3 D governing equation). For this part of the study, a computer program in C++ language was developed. Finally, the results of the numerical method were verified using the results obtained from infiltration tests. The tests were conducted for the semi-infinite soil columns having three different confinement conditions: completely confined, semi-confined and free swelling. The results show a clear agreement between the output of the developed numerical model and the experimental data. As one of the conclusions, the results of the numerical analysis of the developed mathematical model agreed reasonably well with those of the experiments. The study also indicated that the static neural network model, {{as one of the most}} promising models, can precisely characterize any experimental function related to the soil properties and cooperates with other numerical approaches such as finite difference method to solve a highly nonlinear partial differential equation such as unsaturated flow equatio...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{detrimental}} consequences of <b>swelling</b> <b>soils</b> are most apparent in arid and semi-arid regions. Sedimentary clays are mixtures of illite, kaolinite and some montmorillonite. There are various soil types liable to swell such as shale, mudstone, siltstone and marl {{due to the}} presence of Smectite group in these soils. Large volume changes of these types of soils can cause extensive damages to civil engineering infrastructures; roads, airport pavements, pipelines and shallow foundations. A number of localities in Egypt are well-known by the presence of <b>swelling</b> <b>soils.</b> Sohag – Safaga highway in the Eastern Desert of Egypt is considered to be an investable transportation road {{and one of the most}} important lateral connections between Upper Egypt and the Red Sea area.

The research objectives are to use recent ASTER satellite imageries with the aid of field samples to map different swelling clay minerals and compare between the different sensors accuracy in locating them within the buffer zone. Certain engineering measures should be considered to enable construction over these types of <b>swelling</b> <b>soils.</b> The results confirmed the presence of montmorillonite in this buffer zone and in the 5 km buffer around the road which represents a hazard especially for the future planned projects within this area...|$|R

This map indexes the territory to low, intermediate, or high swell susceptibility, but does not display smallest and isolated clays lithologies. At local scale, identification of {{clay minerals}} and characterization of swell potential of soils using conventional soil analysis (DRX, chemical, and geotechnical analysis) are slow, expensive, and does not permit integrated measurements. Shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1100 - 2500 nm) spectral domains are characterized by significant spectral absorption bands that provide an underused tool for estimate the swell potential of soils.

Much of the FRLC burned during the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire and active landslides were observed by 2005. Previous studies of this landslide complex (Schulz et al., 2006) focused on assessing landslide activity using subsurface sampling, geologic mapping, and ground displacement monitoring. The purpose of this research was to: (1) determine the clay mineralogy; (2) estimate the engineering properties of the soil; and, (3) evaluate the swelling potential of the soil for a relatively steep section of the FRLC. A soil sample was collected, in May 2012, and determined to have a Liquid Limit (LL) of 23. 5 %, a Plastic Limit (PL) of 18. 5 %, yielding in a Plasticity Index (PI) of 5 %. Based on the LL and PL, the soil was classified as a low plasticity, lean clay (CL-ML). The relatively low PI and low LL moisture content indicate a low <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> potential. A plot of “PI versus Percentage of Clay in the whole sample” (clay percentages range from 40. 6 % to 79. 4 %) similarly supports a low swell potential. XRD clay speciation data verified the lack of Smectite (swelling) clay in five soil samples; the randomly ordered (R 0) I/S clay fraction (with 90 % Smectite clay), never exceeded 3. 6 % of the clay fraction (two samples contained less than 1 %).

The components of radial flows {{of this kind}} include infiltration simultaneously coupled to the storage and advance on the soil surface, and evaporation into the air while the source continuously supplies water. The soils we consider here can be rigid or swelling. Because the infiltration equations reported for both rigid and <b>swelling</b> <b>soils</b> have an identical mathematical structure, the analysis for rigid soils using Philip’s two-term infiltration equation applies to both <b>swelling</b> and rigid <b>soils.</b> As such, we emphasise that our analysis is applicable to both rigid and <b>swelling</b> <b>soils.</b> We first extend the radial Lewis–Milne equation (RLME) given by Rasmussen to analyse the radial flow mechanics by incorporating evaporation as a key component in the radial dynamic water balance.

With the two-term cumulative evaporation equation, we show that the three solutions yield a simple identical asymptotic formulae at large times, {{which can be used}} to design the area to be irrigated, or to derive the final infiltration rate, A, and the final evaporation rate, E 2.

40|$|An oedotensiometer {{was used}} to examine to examine the {{behaviour}} of sieved sample of a <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> (a vertisol) {{as well as of the}} same soils treated with solution of Na+ + Ca 2 + to simulate the soil changes from excessive irrigation with brackish water. The oedometer test consisted in an infiltration of water from below through a ceramic porous plate at a feeding pressure of + 10 cm water and successive drainage under a depression mostly of - 112 cm of water. The rate of water entry as well as the swelling rate of the sample were monitored. Preliminary considerations regards the domains in which the shrinkage curve of a <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> is subdivided and make hypothesis on the swelling process expected when the infiltration from below of the sample is applied. The results support the hypothesis that when the water pressure is applied some water enters rather rapidly in the larger structural pores and is followed later by the swelling in the smaller pores, responsible for the basic domain. This first conclusion demonstrates that the assumption of a simultaneous movement of solid and liquid components in the sample, which is the base of most theoretical developments for swelling soils, cannot be accepted for the tested samples. Some cases with water clogging on the sample surface confirm a late final swelling of the soil and permitted to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity of the swollen soil. These manifestations are more evident in sodicated soils. The loading of the sample reduces the swelling of the sample and seems to reduce its permeability. The reduction of the feeding water pressure further reduces the sample swelling. The draining process from saturated soil sample shows that most of the process occurs in the large pores of the structural domain. This gives the possibility to evaluate the water diffusivity coefficient for the structural domain of the sample. In draining the soil with the highest sodication there was a variation of soil volume practically equal to the water lost, demonstrating that in this case the shrinking state of the soil was in the basic domain and the soil was in a biphasic condition (no air phase in the wetted soil part). This was the only case in which material coordinate arguments could be applied and the soil completely obeys to swelling properties in quasi equilibrium conditions...|$|E

His early attempts to formulate the overburden potential of the soil water as an additional component to the pressure and gravitational potentials did cause some confusion, until it became clear that there is no additional component and that the actual pressure potential can be split into two parts: the (non-actual) pressure potential the soil water would have if the system were unloaded, and a remaining part, which may be called the overburden potential. Using fundamental thermodynamics it is then shown how the overburden potential can be calculated from the slopes of the bundle of load-pressure-dependent shrinkage curves. A set of experimental data published by Talsma is used to test the Groenevelt-Bolt equation of state for the bundle of shrinkage curves and for the numerical values of the overburden potentials for Talsma's clay paste.

40|$|Rainfall {{infiltration}} {{can cause}} a dramatic decrease of suction in unsaturated soils and, consequently, of shear strength, triggering various instability phenomena, such as the slip of steep surface soil layers. Swelling of cracked soils and capillary barrier effects, induced by fine-grained soils overlying a more permeable material, can also affect water flow through this type of soil systems. In the past, few studies on infiltration and rainfall-induced landslides considered the simultaneous effects of surface cracks, swelling materials, and/or the capillary barrier phenomenon. To this purpose, this paper presents the results obtained by a dual-permeability model, which simulates water flow through a fractured <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> overlying a more permeable soil and focusing {{on the influence of}} these phenomena on triggering of landslides. Numerical results show that for high-intensity precipitations, flow through fractures quickly reaches significant depths and the capillary barrier is broken, while soil swelling leads to a uniform narrowing of cracks. On the other hand, for low-intensity precipitations, fracture flow and swelling are limited only to the first 30 - 50 cm of the topsoil, while cracks almost completely closed. Evaluations of the slope stability show that prolonged low-intensity rainfalls might be more dangerous than short high-intensity rains in triggering surface landslides. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThe structural condition of swelling soils can be assessed from their shrinkage curves. We re-evaluated data on six British swelling soils using modern methods to model the void ratio, e, {{as a function of}} the moisture ratio,. The points on the e– curve were fitted with a constitutive shrinkage equation using an unbiased least-squares, curve-fitting program. The shrinkage curves were then differentiated to obtain their slopes, σ(), which were used to calculate the overburden potentials, Ω. The slope functions were subsequently differentiated to obtain the curvatures, κ(), from which the maximum curvature at the wet end was used to separate the structural shrinkage, Sc, from the proportional (unsaturated) shrinkage. At the point of maximum curvature, Sc and the volumetric air content, θac, were calculated and found to correspond closely to those reported previously. Water retention curves were constructed and fitted using the van Genuchten equation, from which the α coefficient appears an important structural parameter. The structural condition of a <b>swelling</b> <b>soil</b> appears to be well described by its air content at the point of maximum curvature, its van Genuchten α coefficient, and a parameter describing the effect of the overburden potential.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a simple approach {{to model the}} hydro-mechanical behaviour of <b>swelling</b> <b>soils</b> at different initial states during successive wetting and drying cycles. This model was developed based on the experimental results obtained for an expansive bentonite/silt mixture compacted at three different initial dry densities representing loose, intermediate and dense states. The parameters of the simplified model were initially fitted {{based on the results}} obtained for the loose and dense samples and then used to estimate the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of the intermediate samples. Generally, the model prediction produced a satisfactory correspondence with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Swelling and {{shrinkage}} of sediments {{rich with}} clay belong to geologically conditioned risk factors. Economicloss as {{the consequence of}} volume changes in the geological catchment area of buildings and infrastructuralobjects is immense. Untimely detected swelling causes higher prices and unnecessary delays during the construction. In those cases when deep cuts and underground spaces are used as intervention into highly preconsolidatedsoils and soft rock with clay contents, failures of embankments and improperly designed supporting measures dueto swelling are not infrequent. Also periodic appearance of landslides at certain areas can be the consequence ofswelling. Some countries, such as the USA, introduced the guidelines and standards for the detection, assessmentand handling with swellable geological materials decades ago. Due to some other more urgent geologically conditionedrisks, such as landslides, earthquakes and constructions on soft ground, in Slovenia the development ofknowledge {{in the area of}} <b>swelling</b> <b>soils</b> was several years behind the knowledge {{in the rest of the}} world. With theconstruction of the Slovenian-Hungarian railway connection after 1998, motorways and the introduction of newknowledge about soil suction, also Slovenian experts were introduced to a different dimension of the problem ofswelling soils, as well as some important experiences were learned and new possibilities for the investigation andunderstanding of volume behaviour of <b>swelling</b> <b>soils</b> were opened. This is especially important for the predictedweather extremes, as only adequate knowledge will allow us to adequately explain any new phenomena in theground and prepare appropriate protection...|$|R
40|$|Unbonded {{post-tensioned}} reinforcement {{has been}} used for many years in concrete structures, such as in elevated slabs (parking garages and residential or commercial buildings), residential foundations, walls, and columns. The use of unbonded post-tensioned reinforcing allows for unique and cost-effective design and construction, including thinner concrete sections, longer spans between supports, stiffer walls to resist lateral loads, and stiffer foundations to resist the effects of shrinking and <b>swelling</b> <b>soils.</b> Unbonded post-tensioned reinforcing is accom-plished by placing high-strength steel tendons or bars into a sheathing or duct, allowing it to move as the tensioning force is applied after the concrete cures.
