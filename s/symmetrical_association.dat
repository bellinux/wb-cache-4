60|$|Let us, however, {{pass to the}} leafage of {{the elder}} {{landscape}} painters, {{and see if it}} atones for the deficiencies of the stems. One of the most remarkable characters of natural leafage is the constancy with which, while the leaves are arranged on the spray with exquisite regularity, that regularity is modified in their actual effect. For as in every group of leaves some are seen sideways, forming merely long lines, some foreshortened, some crossing each other, every one differently turned and placed from all the others, the forms of the leaves, though in themselves similar, give rise to a thousand strange and differing forms in the group; and the shadows of some, passing over the others, still farther disguise and confuse the mass, until the eye can distinguish nothing but a graceful and flexible disorder of innumerable forms, with here and there a perfect leaf on the extremity, or a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>association</b> of one or two, just enough to mark the specific character and to give unity and grace, but never enough to repeat in one group what was done in another--never enough to prevent the eye from feeling that, however regular and mathematical may be the structure of parts, what is composed out of them is as various and infinite as any other part of nature. Nor does this take place in general effect only. Break off an elm bough, three feet long, in full leaf, and lay it on the table before you, and try to draw it, leaf for leaf. It is ten to one if in the whole bough, (provided you do not twist it about as you work,) you find one form of a leaf exactly like another; perhaps you will not even have one complete. Every leaf will be oblique, or foreshortened, or curled, or crossed by another, or shaded by another, or have something or other the matter with it; and though the whole bough will look graceful and symmetrical, you will scarcely be able to tell how or why it does so, since there is not one line of it like another. Now go to Gaspar Poussin, and take one of his sprays where they come against the sky; you may count it all round, one, two, three, four, one bunch; five, six, seven, eight, two bunches; nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three bunches; with four leaves each,--and such leaves! every one precisely the same as its neighbor, blunt and round at the end, (where every forest leaf is sharp, except that of the fig-tree,) tied together by the roots, and so fastened on to the demoniacal claws above described, one bunch to each claw.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{past decade}} has seen the {{emergence}} of several molecular tools that render possible modification of cellular functions through accurate and easy addition, removal, or exchange of genomic DNA sequences. Among these technologies, transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) {{has turned out to}} be one of the most versatile and incredibly robust platform for generating targeted molecular tools as demonstrated by fusion to various domains such as transcription activator, repressor and nucleases. Results: In this study, we generated a novel nuclease architecture based on the transcription activator-like effector scaffold. In contrast to the existing Tail to Tail (TtT) and head to Head (HtH) nuclease architectures based on the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>association</b> of two TALE DNA binding domains fused to the C-terminal (TtT) or N-terminal (HtH) end of FokI, this novel architecture consists of the asymmetrical association of two different engineered TALE DNA binding domains fused to the N- and C-terminal ends of FokI (TALE:: FokI and FokI:: TALE scaffolds respectively). The characterization of this novel Tail to Head (TtH) architecture in yeast enabled us to demonstrate its nuclease activity and define its optimal target configuration. We further showed that this architecture was able to promote substantial level of targeted mutagenesis at three endogenous loci present in two different mammalian cell lines. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that this novel functional TtH architecture which requires binding to only one DNA strand of a given endogenous locus has the potential to extend the targeting possibility of FokI-based TALE nucleases...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the non-alpha-helical, amino-terminal head region of vimentin is {{essential}} for the formation and stability of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs). In order to specify its target site on companion protein subunits, it was cut off from vimentin at amino acid position 96 with lysine-specific endoproteinase and allowed to react with intact vimentin and other IF proteins. In solution of high salt concentration (500 mM KCl), the isolated polypeptide (vim NT) showed a high affinity for all cytoplasmic IF proteins tested, but not for nuclear lamins. Employing limited digestion of the IF proteins with different proteinases, the binding site was shown to reside in their alpha-helical rod domains. Other polypeptides possessing alpha-helical regions with the potential to form coiled-coil structures like tropomyosin and myosin subfragment 2 did not react with vim NT. The binding to IF proteins was strongly inhibited by phosphorylation of vim NT and totally abolished in the presence of 200 mM arginine hydrochloride, whereas the same concentration of lysine hydrochloride was ineffective. Limited chymotryptic digestion of vim NT produced polypeptides that were unable to react with the alpha-helical region of vimentin at high salt concentration. Consistent with these observations, vim NT strongly inhibited filament formation in vitro from protofilamentous vimentin. A 14 -mer oligopeptide comprising the amino acids 3 to 16 of the amino terminus also inhibited filament formation, though to a lesser extent. Conversely, vim NT and, with a lower efficiency, the 14 -mer oligopeptide also severely affected the structure of preformed vimentin filaments by unraveling them. Phosphorylated vim NT was considerably less active in this respect. Further digestion of the rod domain of vimentin with chymotrypsin yielded 17. 4 and 21 kDa polypeptides, which were tentatively characterized as originating from the carboxy- and amino-terminal half of the rod domain, respectively. Both formed salt-stable complexes with vim NT, the smaller polypeptide with a higher efficiency than the larger one. These results suggest that the staggered, antiparallel arrangement of the two coiled-coils in the protofilaments of IF proteins is, at least in part, determined by the twofold, <b>symmetrical</b> <b>association</b> of the amino-terminal head regions of one coiled-coil rope structure with the carboxy-terminal halves of the alpha-helical rod domains of the other coiled-coil and that similar interactions occur during filament assembly and in the intact filament...|$|E

40|$|The {{propensity}} of many proteins to oligomerize and associate to form complex structures from their constituent monomers, is analyzed {{in terms of}} their hydrophobic (H), and electric pseudo-dipole (D) moment vectors. In both cases these vectors are defined as the product of the distance between their positive and negative centroids, times the total hydrophobicity or total positive charge of the protein. Changes in the magnitudes and directions of H and D are studied as monomers associate to form larger complexes. We use these descriptors to study similarities and differences in two groups of associations: a) open associations such as polymers with an undefined number of monomers (i. e. actin polymerization, amyloid and HIV capsid assemblies); b) closed <b>symmetrical</b> <b>associations</b> of finite size, like spherical virus capsids and protein cages. The tendency of the hydrophobic moments of the monomers in an association is to align in parallel arrangements following a pattern similar to those of phospholipids in a membrane. Conversely, electric dipole moments of monomers tend to align in antiparallel associations. The final conformation of a given assembly is a fine-tuned combination of these forces, limited by steric constraints. This determines whether the association will be open (indetermined number of monomers) or closed (fixed number of monomers). Any kinetic, binding or molecular peculiarities that characterize a protein assembly, comply with the vector rules laid down in this paper. These findings are also independent of protein siz...|$|R

40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY To {{describe}} {{prevalence and}} severity of periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-olds in Lithuania and to evaluate risk factors, prevention and treatment needs. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 1. 	To evaluate oral hygiene among 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to describe dependence on gender, age, parients‘ education and living area. 2. 	To evaluate freequence of complaints of the bleeding gingiva among 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to describe dependence on gender, age and living area. 3. 	To evaluate the dependence of freequence of complaints of the bleeding gingiva on oral higiene, living style and parients‘ education. 4. 	To describe prevalence {{and severity of}} periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to elucidate relation with local risk factors and oral hygiene. 5. 	T o evaluate treatment needs of periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren. 6. 	To create methods of prevention of periodontal diseases for the 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and present them too schoolchildren and dentists. ORIGINALITY OF INVESTIGATION OUTCOME For {{the first time in}} Lithuania the periodontal tissue condition of the eleven to fifteen years old town and village schoolchildren, the main periodontal disease risk factors, and the need for periodontal disease treatment was studied and evaluated, as well as the dental caries and periodontal disease risk factor relationship was identified. The periodontal disease prognosis algorithm, which was based on risk factor evaluation, was concluded. An inquiry, which was based on international protocol, was performed together with the public health specialists. Oral hygiene habits, complaints of gum bleeding, oral hygiene means of the Lithuanian schoolchildren as well as gum bleeding relationship to general health condition and schoolchildren way of life or other health-related habits were evaluated with the help of this inquiry. The relationship between the complaints of gum bleeding and the health-risk behaviour signs of the adolescents (smoking, alcohol and drug usage) was analysed. PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY The data of the study reveal a large periodontal disease prevalence and severity among the eleven to fifteen years old schoolchildren, and substantiate the need for preventive measures implementation into functional health care. This problem is especially relevant now, at the time of health care system reform. The data of the oral hygiene inquiry present a substantial schoolchildren approach to tooth brushing, oral hygiene means, and vividly reveal the lack of oral hygiene education, especially among village schoolchildren. Because of that, with the reference to the data of the study, and with an aim to reduce periodontal disease development possibility, as well as to slow the progression of the existing diseases, {{it is very important to}} organise and introduce preventive programmes not only in a field of dental caries, but and the field of periodontal diseases as well. MATERIAL AND METHODS Periods of the study Period 1 comprises of the eleven to fifteen years old Lithuanian schoolchildren inquiry in order to evaluate oral hygiene means variety and the frequency of its application, as well as the frequency of schoolchildren complaints of gum bleeding. The research was carried out in 2002. Period 2 comprises of a more complex investigation. Kaunas and Kaunas region fifteen years old schoolchildren oral cavity hard and soft tissue condition was investigated, periodontal disease risk factors and periodontal disease treatment needs were studied. Lithuanian schoolchildren inquiry about tooth brushing frequency and additional usage of oral hygiene means was performed. The research was carried out in 2003 and 2004. Period 1 inquired children involved 2. 887 (51. 1 percent) boys and 2, 758 (48. 9 percent) girls. The schoolchildren age groups were of almost equal size: 1. 867 (33. 1 percent) eleven year-olds, 1. 873 (33. 2 percent) thirteen year-olds, 1. 905 (33. 7 percent) fifteen year-olds. Inquired children were divided into two groups according to their place of living: group 1 consisted of 2. 402 (42. 6 percent) of schoolchildren living in towns or regional centres; group 2 consisted of 3. 243 (57. 4 percent) of schoolchildren living in a small town or a village. Group 1 was conditionally called “town residents”, and group 2 was conditionally called “village residents”. During period 2 Kaunas, Kaunas region, Jurbarkas region, and Prienai region fifteen years old schoolchildren were properly examined and inquired. Table 1 shows the distribution of the inquired children according to living place and sex. Table 1. The epidemiological study inquiry children distribution according to living place and sex.

The research protocol for the study complies with the strict ethical standards that the WHO requires of its collaborative research. The surveys of schoolchildren are also being carried out according to the ethical procedures required by each individual participating country or region. Presentation of this paper agrees with the rules of Terms of Reference developed for the HBSC study. In this survey child's oral hygiene habits and complains of gum bleeding were accessed by four questions: 1) How often do you brush your teeth? (twice a day; once a day; at least once a week but not daily; less than once a week; never), 2) How often do you use dental floss? (almost daily; sometimes; never), 3) How often do you rinse your mouth with special rinses? (almost daily; sometimes; never), 4) Does your gum bleed than you brussh teeth? (yes; no). Assessment of oral health status among 11 - 15 year-olds Dental caries was scored by surface on all erupted teeth in accordance with the WHO criteria (WHO, 1978) : 0 – Sound; 1 – Decayed; 2 – Filled with decay; 3 – Filled, no decay; 4 – Missing, as a result of caries; 5 – Missing, any other reason; 6 – sealant, varnish; 7 – bridge abudment or special crown; 8 - Unerupted tooth; 9 – Excluded tooth. according to criteria of WHO. The results were recorded in a form, prepared according to the WHO recommendations. Periodontal status was recorded according to CPITN index (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs), according to WHO (WHO, 1978). CPI-codes and Treatment Needs are described in table 2. Table 2. CPI-codes and Treatment Needs Code	Description of the Condition (CPI) 	TN	Treatment packages 0 	Healthy 1 	Bleeding on probing 	I	Oral hygiene instructions 2 	Supragingival and/or subgingival calculus. Iatrogenic marginal irritation	II	Oral hygiene instructions, scaling 3 	Pockets up to 4 - 5 mm. 		 4 	Deeper pockets from 6 mm. 	III	Oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root planing, complex treatment Oral hygiene was evaluation by OHI-S index (Green-Vermillion simplified). The OHI-S index consists of 2 components: plaque index (DI) and calculus index (CI) 		OHI-S = DI + CI There were examined vestibular surfaces of 16; 11; 26 and 31 teeth and lingual surfaces of 36 and 46 teeth. In there is no first molar, second molar was examined, if there was no central incisor, contralateral central incisor was examined. 	The criteria of plaque index (DI) : 	 0 – no plaque present. 	 1 – soft plaque covering not more than ⅓ of tooth surface. 	 2 – soft plaque covering more than ⅓, but not more than ⅔ of the tooth surface. 	 3 – soft plaque covering more than ⅔ of the tooth surface. 	The criteria of calculus index (CI) : 	 0 – no calculus present. 	 1 – supragingival calculus covering not more than ⅓ of the tooth surface. 2 – supragingival calculus cover more than ⅓, but less than ⅔ of the tooth surface, and some subgingival calculus. 3 – supragingival calculus cover more than ⅔ of the tooth surface and subgingival calculus present. 	The sum of scores is divided into 6 (the number of examined teeth). Table 3. Evaluation of the oral hygiene according to OHI-S index OHI-S	Oral hygiene 0 	Perfect 0. 1 – 1. 0 	Good 1. 1 – 2. 0 	Satisfactory 2. 1 – 6. 0 	Bad Data analysis Statistical data analysis was performed using the SPSS (Statistical Program for Social Science). The analyzed groups were described using the characterization of general statistics, dispersion and <b>symmetrical</b> <b>association.</b> The verification of the hypotheses of the relations between qualitative variables was performed using χ 2 criterion. The comparison of quantitative values was performed using Student’s t or Fisher’s F criterion. The mean of the descriptive statistical sample and average square deviation were calculated. These criteria were used for the verification of hypotheses on the means of two or more groups. In case of comparison of the mean values of two or more groups, the conclusions of t and F criteria coincide. The analyzed features of the each group should have normal distribution and the same dispersion when these criteria are used. Using the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test, we estimated the normal distribution of quantitative values. For the comparison of the quantitative data without normal distribution, the tests of the comparison of non-parametric values were applied. The Mann–Whitney („U”) test was performed for the estimation of the difference between two independent groups, while the Cruscall–Wal („H”) test was performed for the estimation of the difference between several different groups. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r and Spearmen’s rank correlation coefficient R were used for the analysis of the correlation relationships between the criteria of the sample. Also, for the reduction of the number of the analyzed criteria and the clarification of general regularities we used factorial analysis. RESULTS AN...|$|E

We {{report for the}} first time a clear case of associative symmetry in the pigeon. Experiment 1 used a successive go/no go matching-to-sample procedure, which showed all of the training and testing stimuli in one location and intermixed arbitrary and identity matching trials. We found symmetrical responding that was as robust during testing (B→A) as during training (A→B). In Experiment 2, we trained different pigeons using only arbitrary matching trials before symmetry testing. No symmetrical responding was found. In Experiment 3, we trained other pigeons with only arbitrary matching trials and then tested for symmetry. When these pigeons, too, did not exhibit symmetrical responding, we retrained them with intermixed identity and arbitrary matching trials. Less robust symmetrical responding was obtained here than in Experiment 1. Collectively, these results suggest that identity matching may have to be learned concurrently with arbitrary matching from the outset of training for symmetry to emerge...|$|R
