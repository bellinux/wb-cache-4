5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the <b>Secure</b> <b>Sockets</b> <b>Layer</b> (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E

25|$|Internet {{security}} experts {{said that the}} passwords were easy to unscramble because of LinkedIn's failure to use a salt when hashing them, which is considered an insecure practice because it allows attackers to quickly reverse the scrambling process using existing standard rainbow tables, pre-made lists of matching scrambled and unscrambled passwords. Another issue that sparked controversy was the iOS app provided by LinkedIn, which grabs personal names, emails, and notes from a mobile calendar without the user's approval. Security experts working for Skycure Security said that the application collects a user's personal data and sends it to the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn claimed the permission for this feature is user-granted, and the information is sent securely using the <b>Secure</b> <b>Sockets</b> <b>Layer</b> (SSL) protocol. The company added that it had never stored or shared that information with a third party.|$|E

This paper proposes a solution for securing the remote procedure calls (RPC) by tunneling it through HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over <b>Secure</b> <b>Socket</b> <b>Layer).</b> RPC over HTTP actually uses the <b>Secure</b> <b>Socket</b> <b>Layer</b> (SSL) protocol as a transport for the traffic. SSL mandates that the server authenticates itself to the client using a digital certificate (and associated private key).
