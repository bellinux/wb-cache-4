40|$|Solder thermal {{interface}} {{materials are}} often used in power semiconductors to enhance heat dissipation from silicon die to the heat spreader. Nonetheless, the presence of voids in the die bond layer impedes heat flow and thus increases the chip junction temperature. Such voids which form easily in the <b>solder</b> joint <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow process at manufacturing stage are primarily occasioned by out-gassing phenomenon. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to investigate the thermal effects of lead-free solder void percentages and configurations on packaged semiconductor device. The thermal resistance for each voiding case is calculated to evaluate the thermal response of the resultant electronic package. The results show that for equivalent void percentage, thermal resistance increases more for large coalesced type voids {{in comparison to the}} small distributed void configurations. The results would assist packaging and design engineers in setting criteria for assessments of the thermal impacts of different solder void patterns...|$|R
40|$|The robust bonding between silicon and {{low melting}} point solders {{composed}} of Sn-Ag solder with addition of Ce and Nd rare earth (RE) element is obtained. The {{content of the}} RE element is 2, 5 wt. %, respectively. The RE elements are stored as island compounds in the solder matrix and their addition has {{little effect on the}} melting point of the Sn-Ag solder. When soldering at 250 degrees C, the intermetallic compounds (IMC) layer is discontinuous and the bonding strength is lower. While soldering at 300 degrees C, the IMC layer become continuous and stronger bonding strength is obtained. The addition of 5 wt. % RE can result in higher bonding strength than that of 2 wt. % RE. In the present research work, we find that in order to get strong bonding between the Si substrate and the composite solders, suitable pressure should be employed to overcome the oxide skin of the liquid <b>solders</b> formed <b>during</b> <b>soldering.</b> The interfacial structure and fracture analysis of the solder joints are investigated to reveal the bonding nature. Complex IMC are found in the residual IMC layer after shear test.

40|$|Intermetallic-layer {{formation}} and growth in Pb-free <b>solder</b> joints <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow or subsequent aging {{has a significant}} effect on the thermal and mechanical behavior of solder joints. In this study, the intermetallic-growth rate, morphology, and kinetics were examined in a Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder reflowed on Cu. The joints were cooled in water, air, or furnace conditions. Solder aging was conducted at 100 °C, 140 °C, and 175 °C and aged for 0 – 1, 000 h. Cooling rate and aging temperature played an important role on microstruc-ture evolution and growth kinetics of Cu 6 Sn 5 (η) and Cu 3 Sn (ε) intermetallic layers. Faster cooling rates resulted in a relatively planar Cu 6 Sn 5 layer, while a nodular Cu 6 Sn 5 morphology was present for slower cooling. Inter-metallic-growth rate measurements indicated a mixed growth mechanism of grain-boundary and bulk diffusion. These mechanisms are discussed in terms of the initial intermetallic thickness and morphology controlled by cooling rate, diffusion kinetics, and the competition between Cu 6 Sn 5 and Cu 3 Sn growth...|$|R

A soldering critical temperature is postulated at which iron begins to react with aluminum to form an aluminum-rich liquid phase and solid intermetallic compounds. When the temperature at the die surface is higher than this critical temperature, the aluminum-rich phase is liquid and joins the die with the casting during the subsequent solidification. The paper discusses the mechanism of soldering for the case of pure aluminum and 380 alloy casting in a steel mold, the factors that promote soldering, {{and the strength of}} the bond formed when soldering occurs. conditions, an aluminum-rich soldering layer may also form over the intermetallic layer.

40|$|Solder joint {{reliability}} {{is dependent}} on both thickness and morphology of the intermetallics that form and grow at the <b>solder</b> joint interface <b>during</b> <b>soldering</b> and subsequent thermal ageing and examining the morphology of these intermetallics is of great importance. The focus {{of this paper is}} to present experimental results of a comprehensive study of the interfacial reactions <b>during</b> <b>soldering</b> of Sn-Ag-Cu lead-free solders on copper (Cu), immersion silver (ImAg), electroless nickel/ immersion gold (ENIG) and electroless nickel/ electroless palladium/ immersion gold (ENEPIG) surface finishes. Using scanning electron microscopy detailed a study of the 3 -D morphology and grain size of the intermetallics was conducted. The results showed that when soldering on ENIG and ENEPIG finishes several morphologies of intermetallics with different grain sizes form at the solder joint interface compared to a single intermetallic morphology that forms when soldering on copper and immersion silver. An attempt was made to discuss the effect of several factors that may have an influence on the type of morphology the intermetallics may grow into. The results obtained in the present investigation also revealed that the technique of removing the solder by deep etching to examine the morphology of intermetallics is a convenient and efficient method to investigate the intermetallics formed at the solder joints...|$|R

Refinement on the solder matrix microstructure, formation of thinner interfacial Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC layer, and enhancement on the hardness, yield strength and shear strength were observed in all the ultrasonic-treated solder joints. Marked morphological change on the β-Sn phase was observed in the joint solder matrix when the USV time was increased from 1 s to 6 s. Thicker interfacial Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC layer was observed {{at the top and}} bottom substrate/solder interfaces and the difference in thickness between these interfaces was greater at increased USV time. The solder matrix hardness increased with increasing USV time, indicating a reduction in joint ductility. The USV time has no influence on the joint shear strength, but decreased joint yield strength was observed after 1 s of USV time.

40|$|The {{packaging}} of optoelectronics and MEMS devices is placing challenging {{requirements for}} the interconnection and soldering technology. These requirements {{can no longer be}} met with standard flux– based processes which use a long temperature reflow profile and are implementing a lot of mechanical handling steps and processes. Basically, the packaging of these new devices is requiring fluxless soldering, no thermal stress by localized heating, low respectively no mechanical contact and damage on sensitive membranes in MEMS or optical components (like lenses, etc.). Some of these applications even require 3 D–packaging and selective solder application in 3 D-structures, like cavity, vertical assembly, etc. An additional, very challenging requirement is a high flexibility in solder alloys because eutectic tin lead and other lead-based solder alloys are not applicable. Instead Gold/Tin and Indium-based solder alloys are required. In order to fulfill the specific needs in these applications, a new laser-based solder jetting technology has been developed.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{conventional}} PV module {{system based on}} crystalline Si solar cell, solder joint {{has been used for}} electrical connection in the four positions such as (1) Cu ribbon interconnection on Ag electrode of Si solar cell, (2) electrical connection of Cu ribbon, (3) by-pass diode connection in the junction box, (4) inverter connection. There are two kinds of solder joint failure modes, (1) Ag or Cu leaching into solder and (2) long-term solder joint fatigue. In both cases, crack is generated and DC arcing discharge may happen at the crack. It is well known phenomena as Ag leaching in the electronic packaging that Ag easily dissolves into <b>solder</b> <b>during</b> the <b>soldering</b> process. Because Ag 3 Sn compound formed in the solder as result of Ag leaching is rigid and brittle material, crack is generated at the interface between solder and Ag dissolved area. It induces to increase contact resistivity of Cu ribbon and Ag electrode of Si cell and to disconnect the Cu ribbon from Si cell in the worst case. It has been reported as solder joint failure that the bus line of Cu ribbon heated up is one of suspicious causes of PV fire. [4] We observed the two types of crack after 1000 thermal cycles from + 85 to - 40 degree C. The crack at the interface between Cu ribbon and Ag electrode may be due to Ag leaching. The crack inside solder joint composed of large grain growing by repeated thermal stress is typical long-term fatigue. Considering highly reliable PV module system, we should pay attention to protect solder joint failure...|$|R

Thus, smaller solder ball sizes are needed for fine solder joint interconnections to fulfill these requirements. This study investigates the interfacial reactions <b>during</b> reflow <b>soldering</b> and isothermal aging between Sn 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 405) and electroless nickel (boron) / immersion palladium/immersion gold (EN(B) EPIG). Reliability of solder joint has also been investigated by performing solid state isothermal aging at 125 ˚C for up to 2000 hours. The results revealed that after reflow soldering, (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 IMC is formed between solder and substrate while after aging treatment another IMC was found between (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 and substrate known as (Ni, Cu) 3 Sn 4. Aging time of solder joints resulted {{in an increase in}} IMC thickness and a change in morphology into more spherical, dense and with larger grain size.

The goal of this dissertation is to develop a distributed electrical model of solar cell in order to simulate the operation of concentrator solar cells in a number of working conditions characteristic of Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) systems, such as uneven illumination profiles with arbitrary spectral distributions. To this end a mixed optical-electrical simulation tool has been developed in order to assess the performances of a typical concentrator solar cell in the case of illumination provided by different kinds of concentrators; in particular a Fresnel lens, a parabolic mirror and a freeform mirror have been considered and compared. At high concentration factors front contact grid pattern has a key role in extracting photogenerated charges, and hence it is another factor that can strongly affect the cell performances; for this reason the above mentioned distributed electrical model has also been applied to the assessment of ohmic losses impact on concentrator silicon solar cells performances in the presence of different kinds of front contact grid patterns.
