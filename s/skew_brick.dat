25|$|In {{the case}} of a masonry skew arch, the {{construction}} requires precise stonecutting, as the cuts do not form right angles, but once the principles were fully understood in the early 19th century, it became considerably easier and cheaper to build a <b>skew</b> arch of <b>brick.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Puente de los Franceses (Bridge of the Frenchmen) railway viaduct {{is located}} in Madrid, Spain. Comprising five {{semi-circular}} <b>brick</b> <b>skew</b> arches, {{it was built in}} the second half of the 19th century to carry the railway line from the north (Madrid - Venta de Baños - Irun) across the River Manzanares.|$|R
50|$|The A4010 then runs as Bradenham Road, {{crossing}} {{under the}} Chiltern Main Line {{by means of}} a distinctive <b>brick</b> <b>skew</b> bridge and closely following it through Bradenham and Saunderton to Princes Risborough. The road travels straight through the town centre, meeting the A4129 at a roundabout. It then turns north-east through Monks Risborough.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} year Fox, still aged only 28 and employed by Robert Stephenson {{as an engineer}} on the London and Birmingham Railway, presented his paper encapsulating these principles to the Royal Institution and from this was born the English or helicoidal method of constructing <b>brick</b> <b>skew</b> arches. Using this method many thousands of skew bridges were built either entirely of brick or of brick with stone quoins by railway companies in the United Kingdom, {{a substantial number of}} which survive and are still in use today.|$|R
50|$|The civil {{engineering}} construction {{was not entirely}} robust; most of the main line bridges were of timber construction, doubtless part of Miller's process of reducing the capital cost. Even before the line was opened, poor foundations to the central pier of a two span bridge over the Esk near Niddrie Burn caused settlement. Then soon after opening, the Calton Tunnel showed signs of distortion at the eastern portal, and near Portobello a <b>brick</b> <b>skew</b> arch for the Portobello Road and an iron arch and wooden viaduct of eleven spans over the Leith branch of the E&DR line were settling.|$|R
50|$|The line {{then passed}} through the Forest of Bere before heading across the water-meadows at Wickham on an {{embankment}}. The embankment crossed the River Meon itself, requiring the river to be taken through a long <b>brick</b> <b>skew</b> tunnel. The embankment also effectively divided the village of Wickham in two, with two new bridges providing {{the only means of}} crossing under the railway. This remains the case today. Just south of Wickham, the Meon was crossed again on a steel bridge supported on 6 tubular steel pillars - this was the second biggest bridge on the line after the West Meon Viaduct. The meandering course of the Meon, the constraints of the landscape and the railway's ruling gradient meant that the railway required 5 under-bridges within half a mile (1 kilometre)- 3 to cross the Meon (including the steel bridge near Wickham station) and the 2 to cross roads in Wickham.|$|R
50|$|While {{claiming}} a superior method, Fox openly acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but in 1837 {{he felt the}} need to reply to a published letter written in support of Nicholson by fellow engineer Henry Welch, the County Bridge Surveyor for Northumberland. Unfortunately the three men became involved in a paper war that, following a number of earlier altercations in which the originality of his writings was questioned, left the 71-year-old Nicholson feeling bitter and unappreciated.The following year Fox, still aged only 28 and employed by Robert Stephenson as an engineer on the London and Birmingham Railway, presented his paper encapsulating these principles to the Royal Institution and from this was born the English or helicoidal method of constructing <b>brick</b> <b>skew</b> arches.
