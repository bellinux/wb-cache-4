5|$|Manchester City's first {{transfer}} {{business of}} the season brought goalkeeper Ken Mulhearn to the club from Stockport County on 21 September, a deal that involved City's back-up goalkeeper Alan Ogley moving in the opposite direction. Harry Dowd kept goal in the next match, a 1–0 defeat at Arsenal, but then dislocated a finger, prompting a debut for Mulhearn in the season's first Manchester derby. Mulhearn was reputedly <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> before the match that Allison locked him in the medical room until he calmed down. Colin Bell scored the opener after five minutes, but two Bobby Charlton goals meant a win for Manchester United. In {{the second half of}} the match, Bowles exchanged punches with Brian Kidd, though neither man was sent off, largely thanks to the intervention of their respective captains. The derby loss was followed by a third consecutive defeat, at Sunderland.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{was educated}} at Haileybury and The Queen's College, Oxford. He played cricket for Haileybury in 1876 and 1877, {{and made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Oxford University against Australia in May 1882. He played five further matches for the University side that year against the MCC (twice), the Gentlemen of England and Surrey, before gaining his blue in June against Cambridge. He was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> in the match {{that at one point}} he started to run the wrong way when called for a run.|$|E
25|$|The {{persistent}} {{courage of}} Clinton, Superior Court Judge, later Mayor, Fletcher Bowron, and former L.A.P.D. detective Harry Raymond turned the tide. The police became <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that the Intelligence Squad blew up Raymond's car and nearly killed him. The public was so enraged by the bombing that it quickly voted Shaw out of office, {{one of the}} first big-city recalls in the country's history. The head of the intelligence squad was convicted and sentenced to two years to life. Police Chief James Davis and 23 other officers were forced to resign.|$|E

25|$|Cowdrey won a Heath Harrison Exhibition {{award and}} a place at Brasenose College at Oxford University to study {{geography}} {{in the autumn of}} 1951. He played for the Oxford University Cricket Club in 1952 and 1953 {{at the start of the}} season and the rest of the summer for Kent. He made 50 and 57 for the Gentlemen vs the 1953 Australians at Lords. In 1954 he captained Oxford University and was a surprise choice for the MCC tour of Australia, replacing Willie Watson. Len Hutton later told him that his selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. At 21, Cowdrey was the youngest man in the side and the schoolboy photographs used in the brochures made him appear younger. He had yet to make a century in the County Championship, go on tour or play a Test, though he was made twelfth man for the Fourth Test against Pakistan and fielded for 20 minutes, but was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> he could barely watch.|$|E

Kausler says that a sequence was animated in which the viewer sees [...] "the {{key in the ignition}} metamorphose into a penis entering Maybelline's vagina." [...] This sequence was deleted from Heavy Traffic, but the same action appeared in the film Down and Dirty Duck. Kausler also states: ...|$|E

She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I would do it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E

500|$|No.4 Squadron {{arrived in}} England in March 1917 to undergo {{training}} {{in preparation for}} service on the Western Front. Equipped with Sopwith Camels, the unit was sent to France in December. Cobby later admitted to being <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> {{about the prospect of}} going into battle that [...] "if anything could have been done by me to delay that hour, I would have left nothing undone to bring it about". When he did see combat against the German Luftstreitkräfte for the first time, he had only twelve hours solo flying experience.|$|E
500|$|In November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever. On {{the subject}} of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, [...] "My father wrote her a formal letter {{inviting}} her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her house ... I was <b>so</b> <b>nervous.</b> In the note he enclosed a pin which she was to wear if she accepted the invitation. The next day she had the pin on." [...] In 1958, when Rice was sixteen, her father moved the family to north Texas, purchasing their first home in Richardson. Rice first met her future husband, Stan Rice, in a journalism class while they were both students at Richardson High School.|$|E

[...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E

After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
500|$|In August 1947 Ted Kavanagh, the {{scriptwriter}} of the BBC Home Service show It's That Man Again (ITMA), {{visited the}} Players' and invited Jacques {{to audition for}} the series, which she did on 18 September, for a fee of five guineas. She became <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> during the audition that Tommy Handley, the show's star, held her hand, which she found made her more nervous. Jacques joined the cast of ITMA as the greedy schoolgirl Sophie Tuckshop, where she [...] "would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges", before finishing her stories with the catchphrase [...] "But I'm all right now". Jacques started her run in ITMA in September 1947, {{at the beginning of}} series eleven, which ran for 38 episodes, and was paid ten guineas per episode.|$|E
500|$|Lynda Day (Julia Sawalha) is {{the editor}} of the Junior Gazette. She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team. Moffat has said that the {{character}} was partly based on the show's [...] "ball-breaking" [...] producer, Sandra C. Hastie. Although she appears very tough, she occasionally exposes her feelings. She quits the paper at the end of [...] "Monday-Tuesday", and in [...] "Day Dreams" [...] laments [...] "Why do I get everything in my whole stupid life wrong?" [...] Intimidated by socialising, she hiccups at the idea. She is <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> at a cocktail party, in [...] "At Last a Dragon", that she attempts to leave on several occasions. The mixture of Lynda's sensitive side and her self-sufficient attitude is illustrated in the series' final episode [...] "There Are Crocodiles."

500|$|The 2002 World Junior Championships {{were held}} before a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and gave Bolt {{a chance to}} prove his {{credentials}} on the world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to [...] tall, and he physically stood out among his peers. He won the 200 m, in a time of 20.61 s, 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, set in the 1st round. Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever. The expectation from the home crowd had made him <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet. However, {{it turned out to be}} a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves. As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4×100 metres and 4×400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.|$|E
500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure he was going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{interest}} in music started at around {{ten years of}} age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music as an outlet for his feelings, stating: [...] "I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so {{madly in love with}} it, it's all I did". He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> he played {{with his back to the}} audience. Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. [...] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. [...] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: [...] "I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s".|$|E

500|$|The Third Test was {{abandoned}} without a ball being bowled due to rain, and Hassett {{prepared for what}} would be the decisive Fourth Test by scoring 94 and 127 in consecutive matches against Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The match at Headingley in Leeds was Australia's only Test victory, which was enough to ensure a drawn series and the retention of The Ashes. In a low-scoring match in a batsman-friendly series, Australia, chasing a target of only 105 runs to win, had slumped to 3/50 when Hassett came to the crease as an approaching storm threatened to either end the game or make the pitch difficult to bat on. Hassett calmly hit 33 runs from 36 balls, to guide the tourists to a five-wicket victory, much to the relief of his captain Don Bradman, who was <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> about the outcome that he could not watch the play. The innings earned Hassett a reputation of being calm under pressure, and Bradman later wrote that Hassett was a [...] "masterful player" [...] in a crisis.|$|E
500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as pulling at her clothes. An early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte I was appalled to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – she is <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound as it should be – and she is so very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder". The young girl was also underweight and had a troublesome digestion.|$|E
500|$|Banquo's {{status as}} a {{contrast}} to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ("Hold, take my sword... Take thee that too"). He also explains {{that he has been}} having trouble sleeping due to [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.|$|E
