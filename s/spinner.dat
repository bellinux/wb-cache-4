5|$|The new ball rule {{also meant}} that spin bowling was less {{effective}} in the Tests, so Australia only used one full-time <b>spinner</b> in the Tests, off <b>spinner</b> Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg <b>spinner</b> Ring. Together they took only eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg <b>spinner</b> Dooland replacing left-arm <b>spinner</b> Tribe in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test at Headingley. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey {{replaced}} the injured opener Sid Barnes, who had collapsed while fielding during the Third Test after being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. Australia declined to replace Barnes with the reserve opener Bill Brown, instead opting to use vice-captain Lindsay Hassett as a makeshift opener rather than in his customary position in the middle-order. Harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in the recent tour matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire respectively. Ron Saggers replaced first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the injury during the match against Middlesex. Former Australian Test leg <b>spinner</b> Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for opting to use only one <b>spinner,</b> pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist <b>spinner,</b> had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited a further instance of an Ashes Test at the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia. He wanted {{at least one of}} the two leg spinners, Colin McCool or Doug Ring, to have played alongside off <b>spinner</b> Ian Johnson, the only specialist <b>spinner</b> to have played in the three preceding Tests.|$|E

50|$|On April 18, 2015, the <b>Spinners</b> {{played their}} season opener at home, {{defeating}} the Boston Whitecaps 22-20. After {{losing to the}} defending champions the DC Current, the <b>Spinners</b> went on a four game winning streak to start {{the season with a}} 5-1 record. This streak ended on June 6 with a 26-24 overtime loss to the Current, the <b>Spinners</b> only home loss that season. After a second versus the New York Rumble, the <b>Spinners</b> went into week ten tied with the Whitecaps for first place at 5-3, and one game ahead of the Current who were 4-4. A 17-14 victory over the Current clinched a playoff spot for the <b>Spinners</b> and for the Whitecaps who also won that week against the Rumble. The <b>Spinners</b> faced the Whitecaps in an away game that would break the tie for the first place spot and decide home field advantage for the Eastern Conference championship. The <b>Spinners</b> lost 26-13.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} <b>spinner</b> shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the <b>spinner</b> shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the <b>spinner</b> shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|Ordinarily, <b>spinner</b> sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the <b>spinner</b> shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spinner</b> shark is a fast, active swimmer that {{sometimes}} forms large schools, segregated {{by age and}} sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults. Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer. Smaller <b>spinner</b> sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the <b>spinner</b> shark include the copepods Kroyeria deetsi, Nemesis pilosus, and N. atlantica, which infest the shark's gills, Alebion carchariae, which infests the skin, Nesippus orientalis, which infests the mouth and gill arches, and Perissopus dentatus, which infests the nares and the rear margins of the fins.|$|E

50|$|After {{losing the}} season opener at home to the DC Current on April 12, 2014, the <b>Spinners</b> would start their season 1-2 with a victory over the New York Rumble on April 26. The <b>Spinners</b> would {{alternate}} between wins and loses {{for most of the}} season (including an upset victory at home versus the defending champions the Boston Whitecaps). Luckily, with a second victory at home over Whitecaps on June 15, the two teams were tied for second place in the Eastern Conference. A Whitecaps loss versus the Rumble and a <b>Spinners</b> victory over the Current would clinch the second playoff spot for the <b>Spinners.</b> However, on June 21, the Whitecaps defeated the Rumble 21-16, meaning the <b>Spinners</b> would have to win later that night to bring up a tie-breaking scenario. However, the <b>Spinners</b> fell to the Current 21-19, ending their season.|$|R

5|$|After {{starting}} {{out in the}} Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off <b>spinner</b> Harbhajan to be recalled in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off <b>spinner</b> in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off <b>spinner</b> Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg <b>spinner</b> Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Ring was omitted from this match, despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947–48 season that preceded the tour of England; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs (6/120). Fellow leg <b>spinner</b> McCool and off <b>spinner</b> Ian Johnsonwho had been regular Test players since World War IIwere the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory.|$|E
2500|$|Such <b>spinners</b> {{generally}} {{buy their}} fibres pre-washed and carded, {{in the form}} of roving, sliver, or batts. This means less work for the <b>spinners,</b> as {{they do not have to}} wash out the lanolin. <b>Spinners</b> then have available predyed fibre, or blends of fibres, which are hard to create when the wool is still in the grease. As machine carders cannot card wool in the grease, pre-carded yarn generally is not spun in the grease. Some <b>spinners</b> use spray-on lanolin-like products to get the same feel of spinning in the grease with carded fibre.|$|R
50|$|The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton <b>Spinners,</b> Self-Actor Minders, Twiners and Rovers of Lancashire and Adjoining Counties {{was formed}} in 1870. The new union grew rapidly and by the late 1880s {{approximately}} 90 percent of cotton <b>spinners</b> were members. The union had 18,000 members {{at the turn of}} the century. By 1910 almost 100% of male mule <b>spinners</b> were members and its membership numbered 22000. The Amalgamation used the high level of union membership amongst mule <b>spinners</b> to restrict the supply of labour to employers, ensuring that their members were able to receive wages and working conditions significantly better than most British industrial employees. This elevated position within the industrial working class led to mule <b>spinners</b> being known as the Barefoot Aristocrats.|$|R

In 1873, driven in large part by the actions of <b>Spinner</b> and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.|$|E
5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England selectors {{were widely}} condemned for {{their failure to}} choose a specialist wrist <b>spinner</b> to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited {{as a reason for}} the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg <b>spinner</b> Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E

5|$|Ring then {{played against}} Middlesex in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test. He took one wicket in each innings for a match total of 2/57. After only scoring {{two in the}} first innings, Ring opened the batting with McCool in the second innings, with a target of only 22runs. They {{promptly}} reached the target without loss, with Ring unbeaten on 15. This was not enough for Ring to force {{his way into the}} team for the Fourth Test at Headingley. Australia persisted with the same bowling attack and posted 3/404 in the second innings, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase to win a Test. Former Australian Test leg <b>spinner</b> Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for using only one <b>spinner,</b> pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist <b>spinner,</b> had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited the 1934 Headingley Test the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia, and said {{that at least one of}} McCool or Ring, should have played alongside Johnson. England had been at 2/423 in their first innings, before collapsing to be 496 all out; O'Reilly blamed Australia's lack of early success on the absence of a leg <b>spinner,</b> attributing England's collapse to inept batting.|$|E
50|$|The 2012 Philadelphia <b>Spinners</b> {{season was}} the inaugural {{season for the}} franchise, and their first and only in the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL).

25|$|Handspinners are split, when {{spinning}} wool, as {{to whether}} it is better to spin it 'in the grease' (with lanolin still in) or after it has been washed. More traditional <b>spinners</b> are more willing to spin in the grease, as it is less work to wash the wool after it is in yarn form. <b>Spinners</b> who spin very fine yarn may also prefer to spin in the grease as it can allow them to spin finer yarns with more ease. Spinning in the grease covers the <b>spinner's</b> hands in lanolin and, thus, softens the <b>spinner's</b> hands.|$|R
50|$|The season {{continued}} with a 13-2 record (with the only loses {{coming to the}} Connecticut Constitution {{on the road and}} the Detroit Mechanix at home, and one postponed game that was not re-played) and about 900 fans attending each home game. The <b>Spinners</b> clinched the first seed for the Eastern conference and home field advantage for the conference championship match. The <b>Spinners</b> were originally to play the second place Connecticut Constitution in the eastern conference championship, but due to a lawsuit, Connecticut was disqualified from the playoffs. The <b>Spinners</b> instead played the third place Rhode Island Rampage, who they defeated 35-21. This advanced the <b>Spinners</b> to the AUDL championship in Detroit at the Silverdome on August 11, 2012. The <b>Spinners</b> defeated the western conference champions Indianapolis AlleyCats 29-21.|$|R
5|$|<b>Spinner</b> {{sharks are}} swift and gregarious predators that feed {{on a wide}} variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods. When feeding on schools of forage fish, they will speed {{vertically}} through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the <b>spinner</b> shark is viviparous, with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year. The newborns are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans, but may become belligerent when excited by food. <b>Spinner</b> sharks are valued by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat, fins, liver oil, and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers. The IUCN has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spinner</b> sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of <b>spinner</b> sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, <b>spinner</b> sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
5|$|These {{performances}} led former Test leg <b>spinner</b> Bill O'Reilly {{to compare}} him to Bradman and former Test opening batsman Jack Fingleton to lament his non-selection for the South African tour and its {{reflection on the}} plight of Australian cricket.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Spinners</b> 2013 {{season began}} away versus the DC Current. New {{head coach and}} general manager Bill Maroon led the team to an 18-16 victory.

The home opener took place on May 4, 2013 at Colonial Stadium at Plymouth Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, PA (which acted as home stadium in the 2013 season as Franklin Field was under renovation). The <b>Spinners</b> lost to the DC Current 18-15. The loss sparked a 7 game losing streak. The streak ended on June 22, when the <b>Spinners</b> defeated the DC Current 19-18 in their {{final game of the}} season.
