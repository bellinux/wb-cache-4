40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a fuel cell-based hybrid electric powertrain for smaller (2 kW) hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). A Hardware-in-the-Loop test rig is designed and built with the possibility to simulate any load profile for HEVs in a realistic environment, whereby the environment is modeled. Detailed simulation models of the test rig are developed and validated to real physical components and control algorithms are designed for the DC/DC-converters and the fuel cell system. A state-feedback controller is developed for the DC/DC-converters where the state-space averaging method is used for the development.

40|$|AbstractThe European Rail Research Advisory Council (ERRAC) as a European Technology Platform and an {{advisory}} {{body to the}} European Commission is advising on the research needs of European rail stakeholders. From 2009 to 2012, ERRAC focuses on concrete and detailed roadmaps on common European R&D to implement the Strategic Rail Research Agenda. The Energy roadmap, the noise and vibrations roadmap are managed by the ERRAC Roadmap project WP 1 – The Greening of rail transport; they define how to focus research efforts of the European railway industry in order to face increased emphasis on energy efficiency, environmental impact, design {{and the need to}} prepare for changes, reduced availability (and further disappearing) of fossil fuels. This WP is leaded by Christophe Chéron, SNCF, co-leaded by Manfred Walter, Knorr Bremse AG, gathers stakeholders from railway operators, industry and academic research and universities. The Energy roadmap raised that the use of energy by the European railway sector is efficient (compared to others modes), but even for railways, savings are unavoidable, as progressing towards a free carbon economy. So the research efforts should consider:•The development of the regeneration of energy (re-use of kinetic (braking) energy) through the smart grids concepts, managed in a system view or infrastructure or by sub-systems. •Hybridisation of energy for diesel rolling stock. •Implementation of storing systems (batteries, <b>supercaps,</b> flywheels). •Energy efficient operation management (efficient driving, fluidification, etc.). •Lighter rolling stock, management of the auxiliaries’ consumption, next generation of power semi-conductor. The noise and vibration roadmaps raised the following mainlines:•Keeping the acoustic performance of the system (train and infrastructure) throughout its whole life. •A new breakthrough in noise reduction – how to succeed minus 5 - 10 dB or more?•Sustainable sound quality. •Ground borne vibration: towards a better knowledge for control...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple pixel design, where the pixel’s pho-todiode {{can be used}} to not only measure the {{incident}} light level, but also to convert the incident light into electrical energy. A sensor architecture is proposed where, during each image capture cycle, the pixels are used first to record and read out the image and then used to harvest energy and charge the sensors ’ power supply. We have conducted sev-eral experiments using off-the-shelf discrete components to validate the practical feasibility of our approach. We first developed a single pixel based on our design and used it to physically scan images of scenes. Next, we developed a fully self-powered camera that produces 30 x 40 images. The camera uses a <b>supercap</b> rather than an external source as its power supply. For a scene that is around 300 lux in brightness, the voltage across the <b>supercap</b> remains well above the minimum needed for the camera to indefinitely produce an image per second. For scenarios where scene brightness may vary dramatically, we present an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the framerate of the camera based on the voltage of the <b>supercap</b> and the brightness of the scene. Finally, we analyze the light gathering and harvest-ing properties of our design and explain why we believe it could lead to a fully self-powered solid-state image sensor that produces a useful resolution and framerate. 1...|$|E

40|$|Because of the extensile {{nature and}} {{familiarity}} {{of the standard}} posterior-lateral approach to the hip, a family of “micro-posterior” approaches has been developed. This family includes the Percutaneously-Assisted Total Hip (PATH) approach, the Supercapsular (<b>SuperCap)</b> approach and a newer hybrid approach, the Supercapsular Percutaneously-Assisted Total Hip (SuperPATH) approach. Such approaches should ideally provide a continuum for the surgeon: from a “micro” (external rotator sparing) posterior approach, to a “mini” (external rotator sacrificing) posterior approach, to a standard posterior approach. This could keep a surgeon within his comfort zone during the learning curve of the procedure, while leaving options for complicated reconstructions for the more practiced micro-posterior surgeons. This paper details one author’s experiences utilizing this combined approach, as well as permutations of this entire micro-posterior family of approaches as applied to more complex hip reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} results of {{experimental}} tests and of theoretical considerations the paper analyses the benefits given by supercaps used as auxiliary supplying devices in road and off-road electrical vehicles. The authors show how small sets of supercaps increase electrochemical batteries life and fuel distance, {{because they are}} capable of supporting transient current peaks and of regenerating electrical energy with higher efficiency than traditional batteries. Due to the characteristics of supercaps and electrical batteries, i. e. mainly to their inner resistances, to their energy/weight and energy/volume ratios the compound use of both components must be properly balanced to obtain concrete improvements of system performances. A sample designing procedure is suggested in the paper, based on the duty-cycles of vehicles.

40|$|A {{scalable}} {{process at}} atmospheric pressure for direct growth of vertical aligned carbon nanotube (VA-CNT) on aluminum substrates {{has been developed}} including dip-coating steps for the wet-chemical buffer and catalyst layer deposition and a subsequent chemical vapor deposition step. Up to 80 µm high vertical aligned carbon nanotube forests were obtained on catalyst-coated aluminium foil in a thermal plasma-free CVD process at atmospheric pressure and 645 °C using ethene as carbon source. The influence of two catalyst compositions (Fe:Co 2 : 3 and Fe:Mo 47 : 3) {{and the effect of}} the catalyst concentration on growth rate, morphology and density of resulting CNT films were investigated. Additionally, the binder-free VA-CNT/aluminum system was electrochemically tested as <b>supercap</b> electrode and the feasibility of tailoring the specific capacity varying the catalyst layer thicknesses was shown. Electrochemical characteristics of supercapacitor cells made from VA-CNT/aluminum electrodes have been described in detail. The specific capacitance of electrodes deduced from impedance spectra varied between 25. 6 - 61. 2 F g- 1 depending on the catalyst complex mixture composition and concentration. The VA-CNT/Al electrodes have a very low value of effective serial resistance (0. 42 - 0. 15 mOhm g) indicating a potential candidate as electrode material for high power supercapacitor application.

40|$|We present {{here the}} design and {{fabrication}} of a self-powered and autonomous fringing field capacitive sensor to measure soil water content. The sensor is manufactured using a conventional printed circuit board and includes a porous ceramic. To read the sensor, we use a circuit that includes a 10 kHz triangle wave generator, an AC amplifier, a precision rectifier and a microcontroller. In terms of performance, the sensor’s capacitance (measured in a laboratory prototype) increases up to 5 % when the volumetric water content of the porous ceramic changed from 3 % to 36 %, resulting in a sensitivity of S = 15. 5 pF per unity change. Repeatability tests for capacitance measurement showed that the θ v sensor’s {{root mean square error}} is 0. 13 %. The average current consumption of the system (sensor and signal conditioning circuit) is less than 1. 5 μ A, which demonstrates its suitability for being powered by energy harvesting systems. We developed a complete irrigation control system that integrates the sensor, an energy harvesting module composed of a microgenerator installed {{on the top of a}} micro sprinkler spinner, and a DC/DC converter circuit that charges a 1 F supercapacitor. The energy harvesting module operates only when the micro sprinkler spinner is irrigating the soil, and the supercapacitor is fully charged to 5 V in about 3 h during the first irrigation. After the first irrigation, with the <b>supercap</b> fully charged, the system can operate powered only by the supercapacitor for approximately 23 days, without any energy being harvested...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare in vitro interproximal overhang formation of Class II composite resin restoration when using different matrix systems. METHODS: 240 lower left molar phantom head teeth with an MO-preparation were divided into 12 groups (n= 20). In six groups a circumferential matrix (Tofflemire X-thin matrix, HaweNeos 1001 -c, <b>SuperCap)</b> was used, combined with either a hand-instrument (PFI 49 or OptraContact) or separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold). In the other six groups two sectional matrix systems were used (flexible and dead-soft), with three separation rings (Composi-Tight Gold, Contact Matrix, Palodent BiTine). Matrices were secured with wooden wedges and preparations were restored with composite resin Clearfil AP-X (Kuraray) placed and polymerized in increments. After matrix removal overhang was measured on a standardized digital macroscopic image in mm(2). For analysis a multiple linear regression model was used. RESULTS: Use of circumferential matrices resulted in less overhang than sectional matrices (- 0. 85 mm 2, p< 0. 001). A flexible matrix led to less overhang than dead-soft matrices (- 0. 54 mm 2, p< 0. 001), and no difference was found between straight and pre-contoured matrices (p= 0. 945). The insertion of the OptraContact resulted in a much increased overhang of 2. 54 mm 2 (p< 0. 001). The Composi-Tight Gold and the Contact Matrix System rings resulted in less overhang, - 0. 69 and - 0. 68 mm(2), respectively (both p< 0. 001), whereas the Palodent BiTine ring did not. CONCLUSIONS: Use of circumferential matrices or sectional flexible matrices resulted in the least marginal overhang when combined with a Contact Matrix separation ring or a Composi-Tight Gold ring...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} composite resin consistency and placement technique on proximal contact tightness of Class II composite resin restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A manikin model (KaVo Dental) was used with an artificial first molar in which a standardized MO preparation was ground. This preparation was duplicated 360 times. Cavities were restored using Clearfil Photo Bond (Kuraray) combined with one of three composite resins of different consistencies: a low-viscosity (X-Flow, Dentsply), a medium-viscosity (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray) and a high-viscosity composite (Tetric Ceram HB, Ivoclar Vivadent). Each composite was combined with 6 different matrix systems and separation techniques (n = 20). Groups 1 and 2 : precontoured metal circumferential matrix (KerrHawe 1101 -c) in a Tofflemire retainer combined either with hand instrument (OptraContact, Ivoclar Vivadent) or separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold, Garrison Dental Solutions). Group 3 : pre-contoured metal sectional matrix (Lite-Flex, Danville Materials) with separation ring. Groups 4 and 5 : pre-contoured metal circumferential dead-soft matrix (Adapt <b>SuperCap,</b> KerrHawe) with or without separation ring. Group 6 : flat metal circumferential matrix (OptraMatrix, Ivoclar Vivadent) in a Tofflemire-retainer with hand instrument (OptraContact). Proximal contact tightness was measured using the Tooth Pressure Meter (University of Technology, Delft). To {{determine the effect of}} experimental variables on the proximal contact tightness, a multiple linear regression model was constructed. RESULTS: Measurements in group 6 were not possible; therefore, this group was excluded. The use of medium- or high-viscosity instead of a low-viscosity composite resin resulted in statistically significantly tighter proximal contacts (p < 0. 01). The use of a separation ring resulted in a large, statistically significant increase (p < 0. 001) in contact tightness, while the use of a hand instrument resulted in a small, statistically significant increase of contact tightness (p = 0. 017). No statistically significant differences were found when a dead-soft matrix or a sectional matrix was used instead of a Tofflemire (p = 0. 159, p = 0. 261, resp.). CONCLUSION: Use of a separation ring when restoring a Class II composite resin restoration has a greater influence on the obtained proximal contact tightness compared to the influence of the consistency of the composite resin...|$|E
