The album topped the UK Albums Chart, disposing for one week Jethro Tull's <b>Stand</b> <b>Up.</b> <b>In</b> the United States, it reached number thirteen on Billboards Top LP's, and was ranked number seventeen on the magazine's Top Country albums of 1969. By January 28, 1970, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America after selling over 500,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{mandatory}} at the swearing-in of the President of Russia, for {{opening and closing}} sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio {{at the beginning and}} end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody must <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> (<b>in</b> case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E

25|$|The USFL had {{initially}} followed the NFL and banned underclassmen. However, league officials concluded the rule would never <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> court, and discarded it. To circumvent the league's $1.8-million salary cap, Walker signed a personal services contract with Duncan (later transferred to Donald Trump). Similar arrangements were later made with other college stars. Although this move was challenged in court, Walker and the USFL prevailed.|$|E
25|$|When {{they get}} to the lake, George pulls the car's choke to feign it is out of gas in order to hide the car in the woods. He acts visibly nervous when he rents a boat from a man who seems to deduce that George gave him a false name; the man's suspicions are aroused more when George asks him whether any other boaters are on the lake (none are). While they are out on the lake, Alice confesses her dreams about their happy future {{together}} with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, and, judging from his attitude, decides not to carry out his murderous plan, Alice tries to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh was (mostly) the {{province}} of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia, have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> politics.|$|E

25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, {{who was doing}} his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called to ring the bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a Leap of Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E

He sails to Bessir where the chief lends him a tiny hut on stilts, entered by a ladder, and not tall enough to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in.</b> He learns to live and work [...] "in a semi-horizontal position"; he is the first white man to come to the island. He trades goods for birds-of-paradise; the people do not shoot them with blunt arrows like Aru islanders, but set out fruit as bait on a forked stick, and catch the birds with a noose of cord that hangs from the stick down to the ground, pulling the cord when the bird arrives, sometimes after two or three days.|$|E
500|$|Birkett {{arrived in}} court two hours late. In his defence, {{he tried to}} claim that the {{relationships}} between women in The Well of Loneliness were purely platonic in nature. Biron replied, [...] "I have read the book." [...] Hall had urged Birkett before the trial not to [...] "sell the inverts in our defence". She took advantage of a lunch recess to tell him that if he continued to maintain her book had no lesbian content she would <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> court and tell the magistrate the truth before anyone could stop her. Birkett was forced to retract. He argued instead that the book was tasteful and possessed a high degree of literary merit. James Melville, appearing for Leopold Hill, took a similar line: the book was [...] "written in a reverend spirit", not to inspire libidinous thoughts but to examine a social question. The theme itself should not be forbidden, and the book's treatment of its theme was unexceptionable.|$|E

500|$|Mason {{has said}} he was nervous about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I did have to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> front {{a group of people}} and tell them , I was gay. That was a little intimidating". The actor felt that the storyline had been handled in a {{realistic}} manner and said that it shows that coming out is a difficult thing to do. Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport. The Australian gay and lesbian newspaper, SX News said [...] "Chris is the captain of the school basketball team, but once word he's gay gets out to the other teams it turns nasty for him".|$|E
500|$|According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee {{public defender}} {{and member of}} the defense team, a pre-trial plea bargain was {{negotiated}} in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because [...] "prospects of losing at trial were very good." [...] Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a [...] "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal. At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. [...] "It made him realize {{he was going to have}} to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> front of the whole world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. [...] "He just couldn't do it." ...|$|E
500|$|As Carey, now dry and clothed, {{is shown}} in another {{scenario}} following the dressing scene, a still of Carey and Miller in the video for [...] "It's like That" [...] is shown, during the lyrics [...] "I can't sleep at night / When you are on my mind". After several other scenes of Carey dressed in the purple gown and white shirt are interspersed, the altar is displayed, where before being ordained by the minister, Carey looks into her ex-lover's eyes once more. She turns to Roberts, and begins running towards Miller, leaving the reception. As the song's climax is reached, Carey and Miller are shown running from the reception, as the guests <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> awe, and watch the pair leave. Carey, dressed in the white shirt, is shown with growing anticipation, crying to the camera and moving her hands and hair. Back at the wedding scene, Carey and her lover get into his vehicle, and drive away as her 27-foot train hangs behind the car. The video was nominated for [...] "Best R Video" [...] and [...] "Best Female Video" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Crete in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role, before {{taking part in the}} fighting around Canea. After this, it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street, along with the New Zealand Maori Battalion, which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance. It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent: [...] "...I saw a German soldier <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> clear view about thirty yards [...] away. He was my first sure kill... I can remember for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo... just as remote." [...] As the Allies began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1June 1941, the battalion was left behind. As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner, though some were able to evade capture by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island. Adopting Cretan dress, learning the dialect, and enlisting the help of local inhabitants, Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months.|$|E
500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|E

2500|$|Strainers and sieves {{can pose}} a {{particular}} hazard. If the sieve is visible above water, a boater can be pinned {{against it and}} may eventually be forced underwater as the current passes through. [...] If the sieve is completely submerged, it is especially insidious because {{it may not be}} discernible at all. [...] In shallow water, bows of boats can get caught in submerged sieves, as the current pulls the nose down below the rocks where it can lodge. [...] If this happens, {{it is likely that the}} whole boat will get pulled under water. [...] Sieves pose a particular hazard to swimmers because even the smallest sieves can trap a person's foot if they <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the current. [...] The force of the current then pushes the whole body underwater, becoming a deadly situation in a matter of seconds. [...] It is for this reason that one of the first things whitewater boaters learn is never to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> more than ankle deep water where there is a current.|$|E
