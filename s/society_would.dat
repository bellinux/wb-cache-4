5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced <b>society</b> <b>would</b> have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal <b>Society</b> <b>would</b> be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal <b>Society</b> <b>would</b> make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{technological}} {{development is a}} strategy proposed by transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom in which <b>societies</b> <b>would</b> seek to influence the sequence in which emerging technologies developed. On this approach, <b>societies</b> <b>would</b> strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.|$|R

5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing <b>society</b> <b>would</b> be better for it, Raskolnikov commits murder {{with the idea that}} he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in {{the archives of the}} Society, where the world in general, or even the members of the <b>Society,</b> <b>would</b> derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{estimated}} to cost 267 million Norwegian krone.

Norwegian Air Shuttle is building a unified fleet of 737-800 aircraft and will {{only be able to}} serve the airport during winter if the investments are carried out. The extension would allow increased charter traffic to Central Europe and increased regularity with existing flights. Avinor has stated that it cannot finance the investments without direct subsidies from the state.|$|E

They actively campaigned for the Labour candidate Alexander Gordon Cameron, {{although he did not}} win.|$|E
5|$|With no {{above ground}} remains, the exact {{location}} of the abbey had been lost, and so in the 1840s, the editor of the Leicester Chronicle, James Thompson, tried, and failed, to attempt to locate the abbey church. In the 1850s the Leicester Architectural and Archaeological <b>Society</b> <b>would</b> also carry out excavations, but also failed to locate the abbey. Prior to the 9th Earl of Dysart's donation of the abbey precinct, another attempt was undertaken, but again, no trace of the abbey was found.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, <b>society</b> <b>would</b> become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E

5|$|Rohayah (also {{known by}} the pseudonyms Nyonya Eni and Siti Hayati; {{abbreviated}} Yah) is Tono's childhood friend and later lover, {{as well as a}} popular kroncong singer. After Tono, who is three years her elder, graduated from elementary school, Yah was forcibly married to a man twenty years her senior and brought from Bandung to Palembang. After escaping him and returning to Bandung, where she found that her parents had died, she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute; she also became a popular kroncong singer under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. When she discovers that Tono has become a doctor in Batavia, she pretends to be a patient and seduces him. Although the two fall deeply in love, Yah decides to leave Tono and move to New Caledonia because she feels that <b>society</b> <b>would</b> view the doctor poorly if he married a former prostitute.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just <b>society</b> <b>would</b> be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

40|$|Pentecostalism has 'bucked the trend' {{predicted}} by Emile Durkheim {{and others that}} religion would disappear in the modern age. This paper outlines Durkheim's thought on the phenomenon that sparks religious life - effervescence - and prediction that future <b>societies</b> <b>would</b> make use of this to create instances of "secular sacralisation. " Tracing the early development of Pentecostalism, I argue that in fact this religious movement has harnessed effervescence to grow explosively in the "secular" era. Pentecostalism has appropriated the role that Durkheim believed <b>society</b> itself <b>would</b> have to fill, reinforcing the link between effervescent experience and an existing religious tradition...|$|R
25|$|The first ethical society {{along these}} lines in Britain was founded in 1886. By 1896 the four London {{societies}} formed the Union of Ethical Societies, and between 1905 and 1910 there were over fifty societies in Great Britain, seventeen of which were affiliated with the Union. The Union of Ethical <b>Societies</b> <b>would</b> later rename itself the British Humanist Association.|$|R
50|$|French {{sociologist}} Michel Maffesoli {{was perhaps}} {{the first to use}} the term neotribalism in a scholarly context.

25|$|Each of the {{societies}} had {{a link to}} a society in the class year before it and after it; that is, members of one freshman <b>society</b> <b>would</b> all get elected to the same sophomore society year after year, and so on, so {{that there were two}} or three parallel sets of linked societies. From time to time, there would be a coup, and one <b>society</b> <b>would</b> break the pattern, forcing the other societies to likewise change election strategies, or cause {{the creation of a new}} society. Delta Kappa Epsilon, a junior society, was created in reaction to a botched election process to the junior class societies in 1844.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advocates of}} right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this {{inconsistency}} in modern societies, arguing that a consistently libertarian <b>society</b> <b>would</b> allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting {{the notion of}} inalienable rights.|$|E
