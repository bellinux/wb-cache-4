40|$|ABSTRACT: Fabrication of poly(p-oxybenzoyl) (POB) nanowhiskers was {{examined}} by using reaction-induced crystallization of oligomers during the polymerization of p-acetoxybenzoic acid in liquid paraffin. Width of the POB whiskers was susceptible to polymerization temperature {{and it was}} efficiently controlled by a change in temperature during the polymerization. Increase in polymerization temperature just after nucleation (Han) reduced the degree of super saturation of oligomers () resulting in the depression of the width increase by the crystallization of oligomers on side surface of the whiskers. Temperature drop just before nucleation (Cbn) enhanced the value of resulting in the generation of much more nuclei having the <b>smaller</b> <b>width.</b> On {{the basis of these}} results, the combination of these two methods Han and Cbn afforded the whiskers having the <b>smallest</b> <b>width,</b> and the POB nanowhiskers were prepared of which the width and the length were 190 nm and 18. 6 mm, respectively.

40|$|Up to {{now it is}} {{possible}} to etch nanostructures with low aspect ratios (1 to 4) with reactive ion etch processes. It is necessary for nanostructures with <b>small</b> <b>widths</b> (<or#approx# 30 nm) and high aspect-ratios to use a very anisotropic etch process. The ECR process is especially suited for this purpose. An ECR-system has been purchased form funds of this project. Putting this system into operation considerable faults had to be repaired. In addition, failures occured repeatedly, which made the actual use of the system possible only after the project deadline. The superiority of the ECR process to the reactive ion etch process has been confirmed within the period under review. The parameters for the etching of 50 to 60 nm wide structures have been derived. The system can actually be used for the construction of X-ray condensers. The characterization of the system for the generation of nanostructures with <b>small</b> <b>widths</b> (<or#approx# 30 nm) could be started on not before the deadline of the project. However, it can be expected that in accordance to the results achieved so far the superiority of the ECR process will be proved for these <b>small</b> structure <b>widths,</b> too. (orig.)

50|$|The <b>small</b> <b>width</b> of {{the beam}} and low power of typical laser {{pointers}} make the beam itself invisible in a reasonably clean atmosphere, only showing a point of light when striking an opaque surface. Some higher-powered laser pointers project a visible beam via scattering from dust particles or water droplets along the beam path. Higher-power and higher-frequency green or blue lasers may produce a beam visible even in clean air because of Rayleigh scattering from air molecules, especially when viewed in moderately-to-dimly lit conditions. The intensity of such scattering increases when these beams are viewed from angles near the beam axis. Such pointers, particularly in the green-light output range, are used as astronomical-object pointers for teaching purposes.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinction}} is important when discussing features of probable fluvial origin on Mars.
