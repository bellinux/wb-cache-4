The pea mitochondrial acetyl-CoA hydrolase showed a Km for acetyl-CoA of 74 micromolar and a Vmax of 6. 1 nanomoles per minute per milligram protein. CoA was a linear competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with a Kis of 16 micromolar. The sensitivity of the enzyme to changes in mole fraction of acetyl-CoA suggested that the changes in the intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio may be an effective mechanism of control.

The total volume of human transported material (HTM) used was 700 tonnes. Soil samples were taken from 0 to 30 cm depth at 23 sampling sites and several soil quality parameters were determined.

A high performance liquid chromatography method has been used to provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of hormones in leaves and roots. Biometric analysis showed that at the early stage of vegetation (7 days) seedlings were more resistant to temperature stresses, especially to cold, than at the later ones (14 and 21 days), that correlates with the frost resistance of cultivar. The results indicated that at the early stages of growth, after a short-term cold stress (2 h., + 20 C), the amount <b>of</b> <b>free</b> ABA substantially increased in roots, while at the later ones, it occurred after a short-term heat stress (2 h., + 400 C) in leaves.

30|$|For a {{long time}} D-enantiomers of proteinogenic L-amino acids were assumed to be physiologically {{irrelevant}} for plants. But there is growing evidence that D-amino acids (D-AAs) also fulfil important physiological functions in these organisms. However, the knowledge about the metabolic fate of D-AAs in plants is still scarce and more information about it is needed. To close this gap we established an optimized protocol for the processing and analysis of D- and L-AAs from large numbers of Arabidopsis lines. This included the application of 18 different D-AAs to <b>seedlings,</b> the extraction <b>of</b> <b>free</b> amino acids from the samples and the determination of 16  L-AAs and their corresponding D-enantiomers. To validate our approach we searched for genetic accessions with aberrant amino acid metabolism. Therefore we applied D-AAs on 17 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and analysed their free amino acid contents. These analyses confirmed the suitability of the system {{for the analysis of}} large sets of plant samples with enhanced velocity and improved accuracy. Furthermore, the resulting data led to the definition of standard amino acid profiles in response to D-AAs <b>of</b> Arabidopsis <b>seedlings.</b> Within these analyses the ecotype Landsberg erecta was found with aberrant metabolic patterns like drastically reduced capabilities to convert different D-AAs to D-alanine and D-glutamate. The presented experimental setup and results of this study offer starting points to dissect the metabolic pathway of D-AAs in plants.|$|R
