25|$|The {{quality of}} shunga art varies, and few ukiyo-e {{painters}} remained aloof from the genre. Experienced artists {{found it to}} their advantage to concentrate on their production. This led to the appearance of shunga by first-rate artists, such as the ukiyo-e painter perhaps best known in the Western world, Hokusai (see The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife). Ukiyo-e artists owed a stable livelihood to such customs, and producing a piece of shunga for a high-ranking client could bring them sufficient funds to live on for about six months. Among other Japanese artists, the world-renowned Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama uses his special hand brush painting technique and hanko <b>stamp</b> <b>signature</b> method in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to create modern day shunga art in the same tradition of the past artists like Hokusai.|$|E

40|$|The questimed {{document}} examination {{plays an}} important role in forensic science. In Chinese documents, such as business contracts, there are <b>stamps</b> and <b>signatures</b> (or fingerprints) over them. Sometimes, those patterns (<b>stamps,</b> <b>signatures</b> or fingerprints) may superimpose on each other. When the documents being served as evidences to court, the overlapped patterns become contentious usually. Even in the document examination, overlapped patterns may interfere with the examination work. It will be helpful if we can reduce the overlapping influence before processing the document examination. The objective of image segmentation is to find regions that represent objects or meaningful parts of objects. The method for image segmentation is to find the measure of homogeneous regions of objects or to detect the boundaries between objects. In this paper, we review some color image models and explain how we apply the image segmentation method to analyze overlapped patterns in the document examination. Synthetic images and one real case image are used to show the capability of the image segmentation method...|$|R

30|$|The scheme [12] {{utilizes}} SVM classifiers with Huffman tree architecture {{to classify}} massive documents. The SVM multiple classifiers {{can be constructed}} based on Huffman tree with the paragraph and local pixel feature of the input document images. Their scheme can distinguish the texture, character and color from the document images. However, the schemes [11, 12] are complexity and infeasible of distinguishing different modes, such as text, picture, photo, mix, and periodic, for the common scanned image. The article [13] proposed an incremental learning approach for document image with zone classification. The scheme segments the document image into physical zones according to a zone-model with incremental learning. The scheme provides five classes (handwritten, tables, <b>stamps,</b> <b>signatures,</b> and logos) with 1117 zones. However, the five classes are unsuitable for applied in the digital copier.|$|R
