The {{purpose of this article}} is to give an elementary account of this result, to widen the family addressed to include the infinite valence case (for instance ZZ), and to make the translation between the algebraic and geometric descriptions explicit. In the rank- 2 case, where the groups concerned include a celebrated example of Baumslag and Remeslennikov, we give the translation by means of a combinatorial `lamplighter description'. This elucidates our proof in the general case which proceeds by manipulating polynomials.

40|$|A <b>suitable</b> <b>presentation</b> of the tensile {{properties}} of paint films is obtained {{by means of}} T. Smith's failure envelope. The viscoelastic states of material appear distinctly on the failure envelope. Technological properties, such as strength, toughness and deformability, can also be evaluated in this way. Films of linseed alkyd, pigmented with Pb[3]O[4], MgO and ZnO, exhibited a shift to the energy-elastic state with increasing pigmentation. In the swollen state, this tendency is markedly reduced by swelling of the binder. The "active" effect of the pigments is diminished at higher pigment volume concentration, since reactive groups in the binder may then be lacking. For systems with inactive pigments, such as urea resin/Fe[2]O[3] and PVC- copolymer/TiO[2], failure envelopes in the dry and swollen state were found which indicate no essential change in the viscoelastic character of the films. Measurements of the systems studied could be explained qualitatively {{on the basis of}} theoretical ideas derived by T. Smith, Bueche and Halpin.

40|$|Underlying our {{approach}} {{to the development of}} a Multimedia Learning Environment (MLE) is the proposition that conventional learning needs analysis, for Computer-Based Learning does not address the richness of delivery possible with MLEs. We propose that knowledge-engineering techniques (from the field of Artificial Intelligence) can provide a richer understanding of the domain, thus enabling a better MLE to be produced. The knowledge-engineering approach we have used, outlined in this paper, involved acquiring knowledge from a range of sources, then analysing this knowledge so that individual knowledge items could be categorized according to identified underlying knowledge-representation paradigms which each imply their own, most <b>suitable,</b> <b>presentation</b> style. This knowledge engineering analysis was then used to select an instructional model capable of conveying all the acquired types of knowledge in their paradigmatic styles, and detailed and adaptable enough to be implemented on a computer.

40|$|The {{notion of}} a partitionable simplicial complex is {{extended}} {{to that of a}} signable partially ordered set. It is shown in a unified way that face lattices of shellable polytopal complexes, polyhedral cone fans, and oriented matroid polytopes, are all signable. Each of these classes, which are believed to be mutually incomparable, strictly contains the class of convex polytopes. A general sufficient condition, termed total signability, for a simplicial complex to satisfy McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem on the numbers of faces, is provided. The simplicial members of each of the three classes above are concluded to be partitionable and to satisfy the upper bound theorem. The computational complexity of face enumeration and of deciding partitionability is discussed. It is shown that under a <b>suitable</b> <b>presentation,</b> the face numbers of a signable simplicial complex can be efficiently computed.

We propose a system for the distribution of Web contents towards IDTV under the Digital Video Broadcasting – Multimedia Home Platform (DVB-MHP) standard. Our system is able to automatically transcode Web contents and ensure a proper visualization on IDTV.

40|$|Annotation This diploma thesis in its {{theoretical}} part sums up didactic approaches which {{serve as a}} starting point for designing teaching methods and <b>suitable</b> <b>presentation</b> of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to primary school children. The thesis deals with the impact ICT has on the development of pupils´ personalities with regard to innovative educational processes which are now at work in our schools. The thesis wants to propose and prove possible and useful approaches to ICT teaching at primary schools based on research in the current state of ICT teaching and in the computer literacy of pupils and on teachers´ own "best experience. The hypothesis was that pupils in ICT lessons are able to work in pairs effectively and that the one with better knowledge of computers can help and give advice to the less experienced one in the pair. In the practical part of the thesis computer literacy of pupils in second and third grades of primary schools is checked with help of a questionnaire. On the basis of selected didactic approaches and analysis of the questionnaire answers a dyadic teaching method was designed and proved in practice. The use of dyadic method is one of possible ways to reach optimal results in ICT teaching at primary schools. The thesis proposes a teaching plan for a third grade of primary school. This teaching plan, effectivity of which was checked in practice and the outcome analysed, can serve as an inspiration for beginning teachers and help them to design their teaching plans for ICT lessons or for employing ICT in other subjects...|$|E

A suitable visualization form is particularly important for weigthing and interpreting simulation results. 3 D animationprovide a solution for a realistic visualization of dynamic simulation sequences. The appeal of 3 D animations have vividness, but also from their provision for interactivity, i. e. when accessing virtual realities. 3 D animations {{have not been able to}} establish themselves as visualization tools, though, especially due to the high costs associated with their generation: thus, there is a lack of suitable animation systems. for this reason, the development of such a tool and exploration of its potential has become the subject of research in the Animation and Image Communicatio ns Department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics. Innovative concepts were realized in the System CASUS (Computer Animation of SimUlation TraceS) which originates out of this work. CASUS offers a simple, cost-effective generation of 3 D visualizations through a homogeneous, graphically interactive user interface. The key concept hereby is to use pre-generated animation elements equpped with comprehensive functionalities available from a library. CASUS allows for flexibility in the selection of image quality, display forms (i. e. symbolic or photo-realistic), temporal relations and output formats. A special feature is the ability to distribute 3 D animations over computer networks locally, as well as over the Internet. Arbitrary, event-based simulators can be connected to CASUS.
