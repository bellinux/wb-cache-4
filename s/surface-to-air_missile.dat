5|$|In 2003, OO-DLL, a DHL Airbus A300, {{was struck}} by a <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> shortly after departing from Baghdad International Airport, Iraq. The missile struck the port-side wing, rupturing a fuel tank and causing the loss of all three {{hydraulic}} systems. With the flight controls disabled, the crew used differential thrust to execute a safe landing at Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25BM target-tower was {{designed}} to provide towed target facilities for training ground forces and naval personnel in ground-to-air or naval <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> systems.

5|$|On 22 November 1972, a B-52D (55-0110) from U-Tapao {{was hit by}} a <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> (SAM) {{while on}} a raid over Vinh. The crew was forced to abandon the damaged {{aircraft}} over Thailand. This was the first B-52 destroyed by hostile fire. In total, 31 B-52s were lost during the war, which included 10 B-52s shot down over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> launcher.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile.</b> Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures {{for at least an hour}} and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E

5|$|The Visakhapatnam class (Project 15B) is a {{class of}} stealth guided missile destroyers under construction. An {{improved}} version of the Kolkata class and ordered in 2011, the first Visakhapatnam-class ship {{is expected to be}} completed in 2018. The class will have enhanced stealth characteristics and state-of-the-art weaponry and sensors, including the long-range Barak 8 <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile.</b> The first ship's keel was laid in October 2013. The Visakhapatnam class will be armed with a 127mm main gun and an AK-630 close-in anti-missile gun system.|$|E
5|$|To {{defend the}} {{stations}} from enemy aircraft, RAF squadrons were raised with the Bristol Bloodhound <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile.</b> The {{first of these}} was No. 264 Squadron RAF, which was formed at RAF North Coates on the Lincolnshire coast on 1 December 1958. Two more Bloodhound squadrons followed; No. 112 Squadron RAF, which was reformed at RAF Church Fenton on 1 August 1960, and No. 247 Squadron RAF which was formed at RAF Carnaby on 1 July 1960.|$|E
5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations {{in support of the}} no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E

5|$|As of 1 June 1989, the International Institute for Strategic Studies {{estimated}} that the Army comprised four corps and 12 division headquarters. At the time, the military had decreased considerably in size. The IISS noted that these formations 'were in name only; below establishment in units, men, and equipment. Brigades were of battalion size.' Units and formations listed in 1990 within six military sectors included the twelve divisions, four tank brigades, 45 mechanized and infantry brigades, 4 commando brigades, 1 <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> brigade, 3 field artillery brigades, 30 field battalions, and one air defence artillery battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission in Vietnam. Nicknamed the Wild Weasel, these aircraft achieved {{a number of}} victories against North Vietnamese <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> radars. The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1972, the Easter Offensive, {{the largest}} {{combined}} arms {{operation of the}} entire Vietnam War, was in its third day. An early morning flight of two United States Air Force EB-66 aircraft was led by Bat 20, piloted by Lt. Col. Robert Singletary. Hambleton was a navigator aboard Bat 21. The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence, including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> and Hambleton was the only survivor, parachuting behind the front lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier saw {{action in}} war again {{when it was}} {{deployed}} in the 1992–1995 conflict in Bosnia, part of the Yugoslav Wars. It launched raids on Serb forces and provided air-support for the international taskforce units conducting Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force against the Army of Republika Srpska. On 16 April 1994, a Sea Harrier of the 801 Naval Air Squadron, operating from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, was brought down by a Igla-1 <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> fired by the Army of Republika Srpska while attempting to bomb two Bosnian Serb tanks.
