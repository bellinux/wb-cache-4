The new approach to construct the curvilinear coordinate system by streamline equation of steady flow was proposed with the complex curved structure composite as the study object. By using the finite-element method and building the curvilinear coordinate system, the distribution of internal temperature, degree of cure, internal stresses and evolutions of physical properties during the curing process of the composite <b>skin</b> <b>plate</b> of a light aircraft wing were calculated. The deformation of the <b>skin</b> <b>plate</b> caused by the uneven distributions of temperature field and cure degree field, anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients and volumetric shrinkage of resin were calculated in the same model.

Using an elastic–plastic damageable model for the skin and an isotropic foam constitutive model for the core, a numerical model is proposed and validated by the comparison with experimental results.

30|$|One of {{the typical}} {{applications}} is as a core material in a composite sandwich structure. Sandwich structures can comprise various types of cores and skin materials to create an optimal design for a specific performance target. Composite sandwich structures are used widely in weight-sensitive structures where high flexural rigidity is required, because of the high-specific strength, stiffness, light weight, high thermal insulation, and the capability to be formed into complex geometries (El Demerdash 2013). Typical composite sandwich panels comprise a relatively thin, stiff, and strong <b>skin</b> <b>plate</b> with a relatively thick and light core. To improve the structural performance of standard composite sandwich panels, numerous strengthening methods have been proposed and studied. One was the change of core materials or configurations to strengthen the elements. The contribution of core materials with high flexural strength and shear stiffness is significant.|$|R

30|$|The {{osteotomy}} {{to correct}} this torsion and remove the excessive strain on the knee can be fixed {{by a variety of}} methods including casting [1, 9, 12], crossed pins [4, 6, 13] and plates [4, 5, 14]. Casting offers the advantage of no hardware, but potential loss of fixation. Crossed pins that offer the advantage of simple fixation, but require cast protection, are temporary and must be removed early due to potential complications from the pin crossing the <b>skin.</b> <b>Plates</b> offer the advantage of fixation beneath the skin, but the rigid fixation may cause delayed healing of the bone and may not permit early weightbearing. The use of intramedullary rods for fixation of the tibia is attractive since it allows for fixation within the bone—sharing the load of walking with the bone and therefore promoting healing, minimizing soft tissue dissection, avoiding the need for supplemental fixation such as a cast and facilitating early weightbearing. A similar approach of intramedullary fixation has been previously reported for isolated femoral osteotomy in pediatric patients [8].|$|R

Two different materials are considered for the middle plate: a quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite laminate and an aluminum alloy 7075 -T 6 plate. The outer (splice) plates are aluminum alloy 7075 -T 6 for both cases. The noncommercial FE code ANSYS vl 2. 0 {{is used for the}} analyses [1]. Linear solid brick elements are used to model the aluminum plates and the composite laminate. One element per layer approach is employed in through-the-thickness direction to model the laminated composite plate. The bolt and the washer are modeled as a single linear elastic deformable solid body. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to define the contact behavior between the joint members including the effect of friction. Comparison of the stress results show that the clamping force has a significantly different effect for composite and aluminum plates. Initial clamping force introduces beneficial compressive stresses for aluminum plate whereas both tensile and compressive stresses occur for the composite laminate. The stress analysis results are used to explain the phenomena behind the different clamping force responses...|$|R

With the increased application of composite materials in aircrafts, improving the high velocity impact (HVI) response of reinforced polymers has been a topic of research for the last decades.

Mechanized tunnelling method using shield TBM has various advantages such as minimization of ground settlement and prevention of vibration induced by blasting that should be accompanied by conventional tunnelling. In Korea, earth pressure balance (EPB) type shield TBM has been mainly used. Despite the popularity of EPB shield TBM for cable tunnel construction, study on the mechanical behavior of cable tunnel driven by shield TBM is insufficient. Especially, the effect of backfill grout injection on the behavior of cable tunnel driven by shield TBM is investigated in this study. Tunnelling with shield TBM is simulated using 3 D FEM. The distance of backfill grout injection from the end of shield skin varies. Sectional forces such as axial force, shear force and bending moment are monitored.

Several studies suggested the effective use of FRP composites in sandwich structures. This paper presents the physical and mechanical properties of a sandwich-structured glue-laminated beam, named as hybrid FRP composite beam, developed by CarbonLOC Pty Ltd in cooperation with the Centre of Excellence in Engineered Fibre Composites (CEEFC) in University of Southern Queensland (USQ).

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} load on {{this type of}} spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical <b>skin</b> <b>plate,</b> which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|R

The Veslefrikk B (VFB) platform {{was built in}} 1985 for drilling exploration but was converted to a production platform in 1989. Shortly thereafter extensive fatigue cracking was discovered and several repairs were made. However, extensive fatigue cracking continued and a retrofitting program was implemented, using various types of grinding and peening techniques. In 1999 the platform was temporarily decommissioned and dry-docked for a comprehensive repair and upgrading program, following the International Institute of welding (IIW) guidelines for weld improvement methods (1), this was completed in only four months. However, {{after a few more}} years of service fatigue damage again necessitated new repairs. The majority of cracks occurred in the hull <b>skin</b> <b>plates</b> and caused water leakage. It is noteworthy that cracking this time occurred only in areas of the structure that were left untreated in the first retrofitting program due to low levels of stress from FE analyses in these areas.
