50|$|It {{is normal}} to find up to 3 (occasionally 5) leukocytes per high power field (40X) in a urine sample, with women having {{slightly}} higher results owing to vaginal contamination. Higher numbers indicate urinary infection. The urine test <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> for {{white blood cells}} detects leukocyte esterase, which is present in azurophilic granules of monocytes and granulocytes (neutrophilic, eosinophilic and basophilic). Bacteria, lymphocytes and epithelial cells from the genitourinary tract do not contain esterases. Neutrophil granulocytes are the leukocytes most commonly associated with urinary infections. A positive test for leukocyte esterase normally indicates the presence of bacteria and a positive nitrite test (although {{it is not always}} the case). Infections caused by Trichomonas, Chlamydia and yeasts produce leukocyturia without bacteriuria. The inflammation of the renal tissues (interstitial nephritis) can produce leukocyturia, in particular toxic interstitial nephritis with predominant eosinophils.|$|E

Therefore, the following semiquantitative <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> <b>tests</b> from two firms were quantified here by means of a computer program and they were adapted to CSF by varying of the sample volume and of the incubation period: granulocyte assay, erythrocyte assay, hemoglobin assay, albumin assay, glucose assay, ascorbate assay, D- 3 -hydroxybutyrate assay, nitrite assay, and bilirubin assay. The quantified <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> <b>tests</b> exhibited detection limits in the reference range of the 10 analytes; the assays of one firm appaered to be less sensitive.

50|$|The {{urine test}} <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> for {{specific}} gravity {{is based on}} the change in dissociation constant (pKa) of an anionic polyelectrolyte (poly-(methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride)) in an alkali medium that is ionised and releases hydrogen ions in proportion to the number of cations present in the solution. The greater the cation concentration of the urine the more hydrogen ions are released, thereby reducing the pH. The pad also includes bromothymol blue which measures this change in pH. It should be remembered that the test strip only measures cation concentration, it is therefore possible that urine with a high concentration of non-ionic solutes (such as glucose or urea) or with high molecular weight compounds (such as the media used to provide radiographic contrast) will yield a result that will be erroneously lower than that measured by densitometry.

A combined result of stool samples processed by Kato and formol-ether concentration methods was used as gold standard. The results showed that detection of CCA in urine using reagent <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> was slightly higher than the combined results of the stool techniques (65. 2 % vs 42. 4 %, p > 0. 05) in suggesting the prevalence of the disease.

40|$|Development of {{one-step}} <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> {{for detecting}} chemical compounds with small molecule weight {{is a very}} challenging task. Since the detection limit of <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> format is usually one or two orders of magnitude less than ELISA format, the success of assembling <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> is strictly limited {{by the quality of}} antibodies, e. g. sensitivity and specificity. Thus, the production of hapten-specific antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity is crucial and a prerequisite for successful assembling of test strips. This project aims at developing ELISA format and <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> that can quickly detect the presence of two antibiotics, i. e. Trimethoprim (TMP) and Enrofloxacin (ENR), in animal body fluid and products. In order to increase the immunogenicity of chemical compounds, different conjugation strategies were used to couple the antibiotics, TMP and ENR to carrier proteins, followed by a comprehensive screening by using different immunogens to immunize animals to produce highly sensitive and specific antibodies against free TMPs or ENRs. In this project, prototype one-step <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and indirect competitive ELISA format for detection of TMP was developed by using anti-TMP polyclonal antibodies. Under the most optimized condition, the detection limit for one-step <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and for indirect competitive ELISA format can reach up to 0. 25 μg/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively. In addition, anti-ENR polyclonal antibodies were also produced. Indirect and direct competitive ELISA formats for detection of ENR were developed by using anti-ENR polyclonal antibodies. The preliminary data showed the detection limit of both formats was less than 1 ng/ml. The successful production of one prototype <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and ELISA formats will provide the technical rout to further produce commercial products for the rapid detection of TMP and ENR residues in animal body fluid and food animal products...|$|E

Sera and urine samples from 455 subjects— 150 confirmed visceral leishmaniasis cases, 160 endemic controls, 100 non-endemic controls, and 45 other febrile diseases—were included in the study. The sensitivity of the KAtex, DAT, and rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> was 87 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 80 - 96], 93. 3 % (95 % CI 88 - 100), and 98 % (95 % CI 93 - 100) respectively. The specificity of these tests was 98 % (95 % CI 93 - 100), 93 % (95 % CI 87 - 100), and 89 % (95 % CI 82 - 97) for the KAtex, DAT, and rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> respectively. Fifty cases were followed up and subjected to the KAtex, DAT, and rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> after 30 days of successful treatment.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comIn this phase III trial for diagnostics for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India, we compared parasitological diagnosis with several serological tests: direct agglutination test (freeze dried; DAT-FD), rK- 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test,</b> rK- 26 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and a latex agglutination test for antigen detection in urine (KAtex) in 452 subjects from the endemic regions of Bihar, India. The subjects were segregated into four categories: 230 confirmed patients, 52 probable cases, 70 non-cases and 100 healthy endemic controls. The first two groups were used for estimating sensitivity, the latter two for specificity. Sensitivity of DAT-FD was 98. 9 %, rK- 39 : 98. 9 %, KAtex: 67. 0 % and rK- 26 : 21. 3 %. Sensitivity of DAT-FD on blood taken on filter paper (DAT-FDF) was 99. 3 %, which was comparable with that using serum. Specificity of serological tests was comparable and high (DAT-FD and DAT-FDF: 94 %, rK- 39 strip test: 97 %, KAtex: 99 % and rK- 26 strip test: 100 %). The classical 'gold standard' parasitological demonstration in splenic smear performed poorly as it missed 18. 4 % of cases that benefited from VL treatment.

MethodsThe urine of a male volunteer was used to dilute recombinant β-hCG at defined concentrations of 0, 6. 25, 12. 5, 25, 50, and 100 mIU/mL. The tubes containing each of the concentrations were coded and blindly assessed for positivity in three different lots of hCG tests: <b>Strip</b> <b>Test</b> Plus®, BioEasy®, and Visitect Pregnancy®. The sample size was calculated for an alpha error of 5 %, with a power of 99 %. ResultsAll three brands, in their three lots analyzed, had 100 % of sensitivity for detecting β-hCG, with 100 % negative predictive value, using only negative controls and samples with concentrations equal or higher than the test cutoff (n= 180 /brand).

Akvo Caddisfly was {{originally}} invented by Ternup Research Labs to detect the precedes of fluoride in drinking water. Ternup joined forces with Akvo in early 2014. The Caddisfly system has been extended to work with <b>strip</b> <b>tests</b> and phone-connected sensors {{as well as the}} original colorimetric tests.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of reagent <b>strip</b> <b>testing</b> and examining urine appearance {{can be used}} to screen out noninfected cases before urine specimens are sent to the laboratory. A validation of this method was carried out in a microbiology laboratory using 970 specimens received over a three-week period. When the tests for nitrite, blood and protein on N-Multistix reagent strips (Ames) were all negative in a clear urine then the predictive value for the absence of bacteriuria was 98. 5 %. Positive <b>strip</b> <b>tests</b> in a turbid urine detected 80. 1 % of infections. On the basis of these findings it is recommended that general practitioners test the urine samples of all patients with suspected urinary tract infections by this method and only send to the laboratory those specimens with positive findings. Using this method the routine laboratory workload involved in testing urine specimens would be reduced by 40 %, instant results would be available in the general practitioner's surgery and the patient would receive immediate and appropriate treatment...|$|R
