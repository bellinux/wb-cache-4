5|$|CTLS-4TAC – Designed {{for export}} under Lend-Lease, {{a total of}} 420 were produced, {{originally}} intended for China. Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor. The remaining 240 were dispersed for emergency <b>situations,</b> <b>like</b> in Alaska. The armor was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62mm (.30 cal) machine guns, {{one of which was}} mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC was labeled Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Some navies operate ocean-going {{hospital}} {{ships to}} lend medical assistance in high casualty <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> wars or natural disasters. These hospital ships fulfill {{the criteria of}} an ambulance (transporting the sick or injured), although the capabilities of a hospital ship are more on par with a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. In line with the laws of war, these ships can display a prominent Red Cross or Red Crescent to confer protection under the appropriate Geneva convention. However, this designation has not always protected hospital ships from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, three {{countries}} applied {{to make their}} debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 {{in an attempt to}} prevent <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> this. The Union set a limit of forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held {{for the first time in}} 2008.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} feeds {{on a wide}} range of prey, {{particularly}} insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> railway lines.|$|E

25|$|The Emergency Task Force is the {{tactical}} {{unit of the}} Toronto Police Service. It is mandated to deal with high-risk <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> gun calls, hostage taking, barricaded persons, emotionally disturbed persons, high risk arrests and warrant service, and protection details. The unit was created in 1965. An earlier non-SWAT Riot and Emergency Squad emerged in 1961. Part of its role is now undertaken by the Emergency Task Force, Public Safety and Emergency Management and the Mounted Unit.|$|E
25|$|Implementing {{appropriate}} proxemic cues {{has been}} shown to improve success in monitored behavioral <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening). Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in student performance by lessening the actual or perceived distance between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of instructional videoconferencing, using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom). Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they are uncomfortable. Others may judge that the disabled person needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.|$|E
25|$|Nash {{equilibrium}} {{has been}} used to analyze hostile <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> war and arms races (see prisoner's dilemma), and also how conflict may be mitigated by repeated interaction (see tit-for-tat). It has also been used to study to what extent people with different preferences can cooperate (see battle of the sexes), and whether they will take risks to achieve a cooperative outcome (see stag hunt). It {{has been used}} to study the adoption of technical standards, and also the occurrence of bank runs and currency crises (see coordination game). Other applications include traffic flow (see Wardrop's principle), how to organize auctions (see auction theory), the outcome of efforts exerted by multiple parties in the education process, regulatory legislation such as environmental regulations (see tragedy of the Commons), natural resource management, analysing strategies in marketing, and even penalty kicks in football (see matching pennies).|$|E

25|$|White {{police on}} the Cleveland force reacted bitterly toward Stokes after the Glenville shootout, blaming him for {{supporting}} radicals like Evans and for providing him with the funds to arm himself. Police began anonymously taunting Stokes and hurling racial epithets at him over police radios. At a police union meeting on August 1, 600 police voted overwhelmingly to demand the resignation of Public Safety Director James McManamon. In an attempt to turn the police department around, Stokes agreed in September 1968 to establish Cleveland's first SWAT unit, so that the police could deal with <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> the Glenville shootout {{in which there was}} heavy gunfire and entrenched gunmen. He also agreed to hire 500 new police officers, purchase 164 new patrol cars, and establish a police training academy. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began urging African Americans to apply for the new positions, and Police Chief Blackwell agreed to racially integrate all police patrols in the Glenville neighborhood.|$|E
500|$|In the Conference on Disarmament, Article 2(4) Protocol III of the {{weaponry}} convention contains [...] "The Jungle Exception", {{which prohibits}} states from attacking forests or jungles [...] "except if such natural elements {{are used to}} cover, conceal or camouflage combatants or military objectives or are military objectives themselves". This exception voids any protection of any military and civilian personnel from a napalm attack or something like Agent Orange and is {{clear that it was}} designed to cover <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> U.S. tactics in Vietnam. This clause has yet to be revised.|$|E
500|$|Franz Kafka (3 July 1883– 3 June 1924) was a German-language {{novelist and}} short story writer, widely {{regarded}} as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work, which fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include [...] "" [...] ("The Metamorphosis"), [...] (The Trial), and [...] (The Castle). The term [...] has entered the English language to describe <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> those in his writing.|$|E

500|$|Although Biko's {{ideas have}} not {{received}} the same attention as Frantz Fanon's, Ahluwalia and Zegeye wrote in 2001 that the men shared [...] "a highly similar pedigree in their interests in the philosophical psychology of consciousness, their desire for a decolonising of the mind, the liberation of Africa and {{in the politics of}} nationalism and socialism for the 'wretched of the earth'". Academics argue that Biko's thought remains relevant; for example, in African Identities in 2015, Isaac Kamola wrote that Biko's critique of white liberalism was relevant to <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals and Invisible Children, Inc.'s KONY 2012 campaign.|$|E
500|$|Both sides lost {{close to}} 28,000 men, to wounds and death. For Napoleon, whose force was smaller, the losses were more costly. For Charles, the victory, which {{occurred}} within visual {{range of the}} Vienna ramparts, won him support from the hawks, or the pro-war party, in the Hofburg. [...] The Austrian victory at Aspern-Essling proved that Napoleon could be beaten. His force had been divided (Davout's corps had never made it over the Danube), and Napoleon had underestimated the Austrian strength of force and, more importantly, the tenacity the Austrians showed in <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> that of Essling, when Klenau marched his force across open country under enemy fire. After Aspern-Essling, Napoleon revised his opinion of the Austrian soldier.|$|E
