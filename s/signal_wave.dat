On February 8, 1900, he filed for a selective system in [...] In this system, two simple circuits are associated inductively, each having an independent degree of freedom, and in which the restoration of electric oscillations to zero potential the currents are superimposed, giving rise to compound harmonic currents which permit the resonator system to be syntonized with precision to the oscillator. Stone's system, as stated in , developed free or unguided simple harmonic electromagnetic <b>signal</b> <b>waves</b> of a definite frequency to the exclusion of the energy of <b>signal</b> <b>waves</b> of other frequencies, and an elevated conductor and means for developing therein forced simple electric vibrations of corresponding frequency. In these patents Stone devised a multiple inductive oscillation circuit with the object of forcing on the antenna circuit a single oscillation of definite frequency. In the system for receiving the energy of free or unguided simple harmonic electromagnetic <b>signal</b> <b>waves</b> of a definite frequency to the exclusion of the energy of <b>signal</b> <b>waves</b> of other frequencies, he claimed an elevated conductor and a resonant circuit associated with said conductor and attuned to the frequency of the waves, the energy of which is to be received. A coherer made on what is called the Stone system was employed in some of the portable wireless outfits of the United States Army. The Stone Coherer has two small steel plugs between which are placed loosely packed carbon granules. This is a self-decohering device; though not as sensitive as other forms of detectors it is well suited to the rough usage of portable outfits.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{sinusoidal}} <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> can transform into a cnoidal (periodic) wave in an optical fibre if the power signal propagates in the fibre core. In this case the <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> period increases, but the wave profile does not almost change. The <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> gets the form of kink for the high-power signal. The wave transformation is determined by nonlinear effects in the fibre core. The lin-ear modes of the fibre transform into the nonlinear ones under influence of cubic or higher nonlinear interactions of electromagnetic and polarization waves.

Investigating three waves on different frequencies, which satisfied the condition 2 w 3 =w 1 +w 2, we found that exact localized vortex parametric soliton solutions existed for the set of four nonlinear 3 D+ 1 vector wave equations. The solutions are obtained for a fixed angle between the main frequencies and the <b>signal</b> <b>waves</b> A= 60 deg. This method is applicable for angular functions, which satisfy additional conditions. It is shown that exact parametric vortex solitary waves exist for solution with eigenrotation momentum L= 1. The method is generalized for arbitrary number of <b>signal</b> <b>waves</b> appearing symmetrically in pairs in respect to w 3. The existence of such type of vortex solitons, {{in the case of}} degenerate four-wave mixing is discussed. As all of the waves are localized and have momentum L= 1, they are called optical mesons.

40|$|Suppression of wave {{scattering}} and {{the realization}} of transparency effects in engineered optical media and surfaces have attracted great attention in the past recent years. In this work the problem of transparency is considered for optical wave propagation in a nonlinear dielectric medium with second-order χ(2) susceptibility. Because of nonlinear interaction, a reference <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> at carrier frequency ω 1 can exchange power, thus being amplified or attenuated, when phase-matching conditions are satisfied and frequency conversion takes place. Therefore, rather generally the medium is not transparent to the <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> because of "scattering" in the frequency domain. Here we show that broadband transparency, corresponding to the full absence of frequency conversion in spite of phase matching, can be observed for the <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> {{in the process of}} sum frequency generation whenever the effective susceptibility χ(2) along the nonlinear medium is tailored following a suitable spatial apodization profile and the power level of the pump wave is properly tuned. While broadband transparency is observed under such conditions, the nonlinear medium is not invisible owing to an additional effective dispersion for the <b>signal</b> <b>wave</b> introduced by the nonlinear interactio...|$|E
