5|$|The {{mayor has}} the {{responsibility}} to enforce all city laws, administer and coordinate city departments and intergovernmental activities, set forth policies and agendas to the Board of <b>Supervisors,</b> and prepare and submit the city budget {{at the end of}} each fiscal year. The mayor has the powers to either approve or veto bills passed by the San Francisco Board of <b>Supervisors,</b> participate in meetings of the Board of <b>Supervisors</b> and its committees, appoint a replacement to fill vacancies in all city elected offices until elections, appoint a member of the Board as acting mayor in his/her absence, and to direct personnels in the case of emergency.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfied {{with city}} politics, and in {{financial}} difficulty {{due to his}} failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of <b>Supervisors</b> on November 10, 1978. However, after {{a meeting with the}} Police Officers' association and the Board of Realtors, White announced that he wanted his seat back. Liberal <b>Supervisors</b> saw {{this as an opportunity to}} end the 6-5 split on the Board that blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by <b>Supervisors</b> Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{factors that influence}} counselor <b>supervisor</b> development in Malaysia. The factors include counselor <b>supervisor</b> training, self-efficacy, and role conflict and role ambiguity. Data were collected from 290 participants who were providing clinical supervision in various settings. Participants completed either an online survey or a paper-and-pencil format on three Malay-translated version questionnaires. Structural Equation Modeling procedure was utilized to test seven hypotheses and path {{analysis was used to}} estimate model parameters. Four fit indices were utilized to assess the goodness-of-fit measurement model and the structural models. Examination of path analysis revealed five out of the seven hypotheses were supported. The results support the idea that counselor <b>supervisor</b> training had collective effect on counselor <b>supervisor</b> development, and counselor <b>supervisor</b> self-efficacy, but did not significantly direct effect on counselor <b>supervisor</b> role. In addition, the counselor <b>supervisor</b> self-efficacy factors reliably predicted counselor <b>supervisor</b> development and counselor <b>supervisor</b> role. Further, counselor <b>supervisor</b> role reliably predicted counselor <b>supervisor</b> development. Finally, the results showed that counselor <b>supervisor</b> training was not completely mediated through counselor <b>supervisor</b> self-efficacy; and direct effect of counselor <b>supervisor</b> training was found on counselor <b>supervisor</b> development. Implications for theory, training, and future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} a new topic {{in the study of}} <b>supervisor</b> support. Previous measures of <b>supervisor</b> support have focused almost exclusively on availability of that support. In this paper the author introduces a new construct of use of <b>supervisor</b> support. It also investigates the relationship between use of <b>supervisor</b> support and the Big Five personality traits. Utilizing a cross-sectional research design, the author surveyed 227 (useable surveys) adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The findings suggest that use of <b>supervisor</b> support is distinct from the availability of <b>supervisor</b> support. Use of <b>supervisor</b> support was negatively associated with subordinate???s perceptions of workplace stressors (e. g. organizational constraints & interpersonal conflict at work), while also negatively associated with negative job affect while controlling for the availability of <b>supervisor</b> support. These results provide evidence that use of <b>supervisor</b> support is an important construct in the supervisor-subordinate relationship. Regarding the relationship between use of <b>supervisor</b> support and personality, agreeableness was the only personality trait associated with both use of emotional and instrumental <b>supervisor</b> support while controlling for all Big Five Personality traits. Conscientiousness was also uniquely associated with use of instrumental <b>supervisor</b> support, but not use of emotional <b>supervisor</b> support. In conclusion, use of <b>supervisor</b> support can be a considered an important addition to organizational research and the understanding of <b>supervisor</b> support...|$|R
5|$|Newsom's first {{political}} experience {{came when he}} volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café. In 1996, Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission, and he was later {{elected president of the}} commission. In 1997, Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of <b>Supervisors</b> seat vacated by Kevin Shelley. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board of <b>supervisors</b> and also, like Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1978, 10 {{months after}} being sworn in, White {{resigned}} {{his position on}} the San Francisco Board of <b>Supervisors,</b> saying that his annual salary of $9,600 was not enough to support his family. Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of <b>Supervisors.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A <b>supervisor</b> is {{responsible}} for the productivity and actions {{of a small group of}} employees. The <b>supervisor</b> has several manager-like roles, responsibilities, and powers.

5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and <b>supervisors</b> will make {{themselves}} available for employment. Agents {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony <b>Supervisors</b> are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to buy new technologies as needed. Multiplayer is available over an IPX network with TetraCorp being the only playable race.|$|E

40|$|<b>Supervisor</b> {{reduction}} procedure {{can be used}} {{to construct}} the reduced <b>supervisor</b> with a reduced number of states in discrete-event systems. The main concepts which are used in this procedure are control consistency of states, control cover, induced <b>supervisor,</b> and normality of the reduced <b>supervisor</b> w. r. t. the original <b>supervisor.</b> In this paper, it is proved that the reduced <b>supervisor,</b> constructed by the proposed method in [9], preserves the observation properties, i. e. normality and relative observability, by self looping corresponding unobservable events at some states of the reduced <b>supervisor.</b> This property can be applied to find a natural projection, under which the <b>supervisor</b> is relative observable.

After spending several years as a businessman managing his family enterprises, he entered politics in 1980s and went on to serve in various community organizations. In 1996, he was the volunteer liaison for then District4 supervisor Leland Yee. In 2002, Yee successfully ran for a seat in the California Assembly, and Jew ran for Yee's seat on the Board of <b>Supervisors</b> in the 2002 election, but was defeated. When Yee's successor Fiona Ma in 2006 ran for state assembly, Jew again ran for supervisor in District4, which comprises most of the Sunset District. After winning a highly competitive election decided by instant-runoff voting, {{he was elected to the}} San Francisco Board of <b>Supervisors.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board of <b>Supervisors</b> becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term. (In the case that both the president of the Board of <b>Supervisors</b> and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E

40|$|Loyalty to <b>supervisor</b> is a {{prevalent}} but under-investigated {{phenomenon in}} Chinese organizations. One plausible {{reason for this}} is the lack of a reliable and valid measure of loyalty in the Chinese context. This study aims to develop a valid measure of Chinese loyalty to <b>supervisor.</b> In Study 1, we identify a four-dimension construct of loyalty to <b>supervisor</b> that consists of 11 sub-dimensions (factors) on the basis of loyalty literature. The four dimensions are: identification with <b>supervisor,</b> task assistance, obedience, and sacrifice for <b>supervisor.</b> In Study 2, a 40 -item Chinese loyalty to <b>supervisor</b> scale was developed and examined by three independent samples. The results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the 11 -factor, 40 -item scale could be reduced to a 6 -factor, 21 -item scale. The six factors are: identification with <b>supervisor,</b> internalization of the <b>supervisor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s values, initiative accommodation, task assistance, obedience, and sacrifice for <b>supervisor.</b> Results of reliability analyses indicated that the Chinese loyalty to <b>supervisor</b> scale is reliable and stable over time. Evidence that supports the criterion-related validity of Chinese loyalty to <b>supervisor</b> scale shows that Chinese loyalty to <b>supervisor</b> significantly associates with paternalistic leadership, job performance, extra-role performance, and <b>supervisor</b> trust in subordinate. This newly developed scale has theoretical and practical implications for future research on Chinese organizational behavior...|$|R
50|$|Lacking budget {{authority}} {{means that a}} <b>supervisor</b> is provided a budget developed by management within which constraints the <b>supervisor</b> is expected to provide a productive environment for the employees of the <b>supervisor's</b> work group.

Normally, budget affecting requests such as travel will require not only the <b>supervisor's</b> approval but the approval of one or more layers of management.|$|R
