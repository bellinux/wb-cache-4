40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} high <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> as a reflection of a college-going culture. A qualitative thematic analysis is used to examine four <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> at high <b>schools</b> in a school district located along the Eastern seaboard of the United States. In order to increase the likelihood of identifying aspects of <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> that are successful in reflecting a college-going culture, only high schools with high college-going percentage rates were selected for this study. 	College-going culture theory, including the nine college-going culture principles, as proposed by McClafferty, McDonough, and Nunez (2002) is used as a framework for this study. The college-going culture principles operate as themes to help categorize school counselor activities and measure whether the <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> reflect a college-going culture in the schools. A methodological triangulation is employed to identify planned college-going activities within three information sources from each school: school counselors' management plans, <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> websites, and the <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> departments' calendars. 	Results suggest that collectively, the four selected schools plan college-going activities that are consistent with all nine college-going culture principles, thus suggesting that there is a college-going culture that is strongly supported and reflected by the <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> departments in these schools. Suggestions, based on these findings, for how other schools might improve their college-going culture are included. Implications for promoting cultural reform to support college access and success for all students are also discussed...|$|R

2500|$|High {{school counselors}} provide academic, career, college access, and {{personal}} and social competencies with developmental classroom lessons and planning to all students, and individual and group counseling for some {{students and their families}} to meet the developmental needs of adolescents (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005, 2012). Emphasis is on college access counseling at the early high school level as more <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> move to evidence-based work with data and specific results that show how <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> help to close achievement, opportunity, and attainment gaps ensuring all students have access to <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>programs</b> and early college access activities. The breadth of demands high school counselors face, from educational attainment (high school graduation and some students' preparation for careers and college) to student social and mental health, has led to ambiguous role definition. Summarizing a 2011 national survey of more than 5,300 {{middle school and high school}} counselors, researchers argued: [...] "Despite the aspirations of counselors to effectively help students succeed in school and fulfill their dreams, the mission and roles of counselors in the education system must be more clearly defined; schools must create measures of accountability to track their effectiveness; and policymakers and key stakeholders must integrate counselors into reform efforts to maximize their impact in schools across America".|$|R
