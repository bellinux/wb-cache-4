5|$|Rotation {{rates of}} massive stars have a {{critical}} {{influence on their}} evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars <b>spin</b> <b>down</b> quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, <b>spin</b> <b>down</b> state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the <b>spin</b> <b>down</b> of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E

For this problem, the cost of making a bad decision (i.e., when <b>spinning</b> the disk <b>down</b> and back up costs more than simply leaving it on) is very well defined since the decision of <b>spinning</b> <b>down</b> the disk does not affect the length of the next idle time.|$|R
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and <b>spin</b> <b>down</b> rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E

25|$|A 2008 patent by Haisch and Moddel details {{a device}} that is able to extract power from zero-point {{fluctuations}} using a gas that circulates through a Casimir cavity.

The gas then goes through a pump and flows through the system again.

However it has not been conclusively shown to be from zero-point energy and the theory requires further investigation.|$|E

25|$|Start {{with one}} setting exactly {{opposite}} to the other.

They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A {{small fraction of the}} pairs, say f, now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations.

Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, <b>spin</b> <b>down).</b> Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...).

500|$|An age of no {{more than}} 750 years for the PSR B1937+21 was at odds with the {{observations}} of the region in other wavelengths. No optical supernova remnant, nor bright x-ray source, had been observed {{in the vicinity of the}} PSR B1937+21. If PSR B1937+21 was that young, it would not have had time to move far from the site at which it formed. As neutron stars are formed as the result of supernova explosions, evidence of the explosion should be nearby for a young pulsar. If it was that young, it would also be expected to still be hot, in which case the thermal radiation from PSR B1937+21 would be observable at x-ray wavelengths. Venkatraman Radhakrishnan and G. Srinivasan used the lack of observed supernova remnant to argue that PSR B1937+21 had not formed with such a fast period, but instead had been [...] "spun up" [...] by a companion star which essentially gave the pulsar its angular momentum, a mechanism now generally used to explain millisecond pulsars. They also made a theoretical estimate of the necessary <b>spin</b> <b>down</b> rate to be 1 seconds per second.
