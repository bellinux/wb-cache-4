40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of minimally invasive surgical procedures has significantly reduced {{the rate of}} major salivary gland removal due to sialolithiasis. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effectiveness of sialoendoscopy, rate of <b>salivary</b> <b>fistula</b> or natural ostium stenosis in parotid sialolithiasis treatment. The endpoint was to analyse the efficiency of a combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach in the removal of refractory and impacted stones in most difficult cases. Study Design: prospective study, tertiary university centre, between XII 2008 and XI 2011, 185 sialendoscopies (SE) were performed in 162 patients. Within the group of 29 patients with parotid sialolithiasis endoscopy was the definite treatment in 15 cases (53 %), in 9 cases lithotripsy (ESWL) was necessary and in 5 patients who failed SE and lithotripsy, a combined approach was performed. This approach comprised both SE and open surgery. We observed no <b>salivary</b> <b>fistula</b> formation after the incision of the duct. Stenosis of the natural ostium thanks to the insertion of stent was observed only in one case. Sialoendoscopy is the method of choice with a high rate of success and gland preservation in small and medium stones. The combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach is indicated for large stones, for complications after and contraindications in using minimally invasive procedures. Short and medium term follow up shows that surgery can be performed with a high rate of success...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although Frey {{syndrome}} is not life-threatening, it {{is identified as}} the most serious and widely recognized sequela of parotidectomy and has significant potential nega-tive social and psychological implications. Several studies have investigated whether AlloDerm ® implants prevent Frey syndrome effectively and safely, however, the conclusions are inconsistent. We aimed to evaluate the precise effectiveness of AlloDerm implants for preventing Frey syndrome after paroti-dectomy, using a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched randomized and quis-randomized controlled trials in which AlloDerm implants were compared to blank controls for preventing Frey syndrome after parotidectomy, from the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the ISI Web of Knowledge databases, without any language restriction. Two reviewers independently searched, identified, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated and pooled. Five articles involving 409 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed a significant 85 % relative risk reduction in objective incidence (RR= 0. 15, 95 % CI 0. 08 - 0. 30; P< 0. 00001) and 68 % in subjective incidence (RR= 0. 32, 95 % CI 0. 19 - 0. 57; P< 0. 00001) of Frey syndrome with AlloDerm implants; {{there was a significant}} 91 % relative risk reduction in <b>salivary</b> <b>fistula</b> (RR= 0. 09, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 66; P= 0. 02); there was no statis-tical significance for the incidence of facial nerve paralysis (RR= 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 84 - 1. 09; P= 0. 51); there was no statistical significance for the incidence of seroma/sialocele (RR= 1. 36, 95 % CI 0. 66 - 2. 80; P= 0. 40); there was a trend for a small effect in improving facial contour.

40|$|A fistula of {{the parotid}} salivary duct is an {{abnormal}} {{communication between the}} duct and the skin, resulting in the drainage of saliva to the exterior. Fistulas of the parotid gland or duct are usually due to trauma but may be idiopathic (Pascoe 1999); they are known to occur in human beings, dogs and horses, among other species. The superficial portion of the duct is most prone to injury because it passes around {{the border of the}} mandible (Newton and others 1997, Olivier and others 1998). The diagnosis of a fistula is based primarily on the clinical signs, such as the discharge of saliva from the wound while the horse is eating. To confirm whether the fluid discharged from the wound is saliva, the concentrations of potassium and/or sodium or the activity of enzymes such as amylase can be measured (Eckersall and others 1985). Retrograde contrast sialography has also been used (Pascoe 1999). Several techniques for the repair of <b>salivary</b> duct <b>fistulae</b> with an intraluminal stent have been described in horses (Newton and others 1997, Olivier and others 1998, Pascoe 1999) and in human beings (Tachmes and others 1990, Karas 1998, Lewkowicz and others 2002), but the fistulae have recurred.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to study the incidence of, and risk factors for developing complications following parotidectomy for benign disease, to improve preoperative patient counselling and better inform future surgical management. Methods: An 11 -year retrospective review of 162 parotidectomies for benign disease, collecting and analysing data about presentation, investigations, surgical treatment, postoperative facial nerve function, Frey's syndrome and other surgical complications. Results: The mean age at presentation was 58 years. The commonest pathology was benign pleomorphic adenoma (43 %), followed by Warthin's tumour (30 %) and chronic sialadenitis (22 %). Sialadenitis was a significant risk factor for facial nerve palsy and increased the incidence of <b>salivary</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Parotid duct ligation increased the risk of nerve palsy in the distribution of zygomatic and buccal branches. Operations for Warthin's tumour were associated with an increased risk of dysfunction of the cervical branch of the nerve. Half the patients had intraoperative facial nerve stimulation and this did not influence the likelihood of facial paresis. The recovery of facial nerve function showed a biphasic distribution, with 90 % of patients having normal function within 12 months, followed by a slower recovery rate for up to 2 years. Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative complications was influenced by the pathology, with inflammatory lesions significantly increasing the risk of facial nerve dysfunction and other complications, but also by variations in surgical practice, such as parotid duct ligation. Overall, the incidence of permanent facial paralysis was less than 2 %, but temporary nerve palsy was common at 40 %, with most patients regaining normal function within 1 year of the operation.

40|$|The {{management}} of parotid sialoceles and fistulae have been unsatisfactory in the past, and numerous methods of treatment with varying success and morbidity have been described. The present prospective study reports results of conservative therapy in 51 patients over a 3 -year period. In 50 patients, the injury healed upon conservative management. During the early {{phase of the}} study, a limited conservative regimen through which the patients received nothing orally for 5 days only was used. During {{the latter part of}} the study, patients were administered nothing orally until complete healing of the injury. In terms of the time it took for healing of the injury, the differences of the two regimens (24 +/- 4 vs. 9. 4 +/- 0. 9 days) was highly significant (p less than 0. 001). The response to conservative management depended on the severity of injury as demonstrated by sialography. Injury to minor intraparotid ducts (G 1) healed in significantly less time compared with that to a major intraparotid duct (G 2) or ductal injuries (p less than 0. 001). There was no difference between the healing of G 2 injury (10. 3 +/- 1. 8 days) and partial ductal transections (10. 5 +/- 2. 2 days) (p greater than 0. 05). There was a significantly greater delay in healing with complete duct transections (21. 5 +/- 3. 7 days) compared with partial duct transections and G 2 injuries (10. 2 +/- 2. 1 days) (p less than 0. 01). There was no difference in the mean period for healing between <b>salivary</b> <b>fistulae</b> and sialoceles (p greater than 0. 05).

40|$|Mandibular {{condylar}} neck fractures and subcondylar fractures represent, respectively, 19 - 29 % and 62 - 70 % of all mandibular fractures; treatment involves some problems, {{common to}} both, concerning {{the choice of}} an adequate approach. Herewith, personal experience is reported related to the surgical treatment of some cases of mandibular condylar neck and subcondylar fractures by transparotid approaches with partial parotidectomy, removing the salivary tissue overlying the condylar neck and/or the subcondylar region. Over the last 5 years, we observed 22 fractures of the condylar neck and 10 fractures of the subcondylar region. In 13 patients (11 male, 2 female, age range 10 - 68 years, mean 33 years), 10 of whom had other mandibular and/or other maxillo-facial and skeleton fractures – 50 % of these with dislocated condylar heads – and the other 3 for their free choice, regarding the different treatments, 18 transparotid approaches with partial parotidectomy (bilateral in 5 cases), were performed reducing and fixing 12 condylar neck fractures and 5 subcondylar region fractures with appropriate plates (2. 0 mm) and screws. After surgery, no intermaxillary fixation was performed. Complications included 4 <b>salivary</b> <b>fistulae</b> (bilateral in 1 patient), which closed spontaneously after 4 or 5 weeks with a dressing, 1 case of Frey's syndrome, which healed after 2 treatments with botulin and 6 cases of transient facial palsy lasting 4 - 8 weeks (1 case bilateral) affecting zygomatic, buccal and marginal mandibular nerves. During follow-up, functional parameters considered were: restoration of original pre-injury occlusion; vertical, lateral and protrusion mandibular movements. All patients re-acquired the original pre-injury occlusion; the maximal post-operative intrinsical distance was at least 40 mm after a variable period of rehabilitation and lateral and protrusion movements also led to satisfactory final results. All patients were free of pain and had no deflection or clicking upon opening or chewing. None suffered from haematoma, miniplate fractures, bone resorption or condylar necrosis. In our experience, the Transparotid approaches with partial parotidectomy permits very good anatomical repositioning of the displaced condylar or subcondylar osseous segments in all cases, since isolation {{of the facial nerve}} branches and removal of a limited part of the parotid gland tissue overlying the lesion allow perfect exposure of the fracture site. The wide operation field allows the facial nerve to be preserved and permits easy internal rigid fixation with plates, as the drill, screws and screwdriver can be positioned exactly perpendicular to the bone surface instead of obliquely, as occurs with many different approaches...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{review the}} 8 -year {{experience}} of the Department of Esophagogastric Surgery, First Surgical University Hospital in Belgrade in the surgical management of Zenker's diverticula (ZD). Methods: Between January 2000 and January 2009, 52 patients underwent surgical procedure {{for the treatment of}} ZD. Complete preoperative workup including the symptom evaluation and large variety of structural and functional diagnostic procedures were conducted before the surgery. After the operative treatment patients underwent detailed follow-up in regular intervals up to 3 years. Results: Preoperative evaluation marked higher incidence of hiatal hernia and pathologic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) among the patients with ZD then in normal population. According to the preoperative evaluation and size of diverticula, as well as due to the intraopertive findings, a variety of surgical procedures were performed, including myotomy alone (n = 2), diverticulopexy and myotomy (n = 36) and diverticulectomy and myotomy (n = 14). Regardless of the operative treatment no <b>salivary</b> cervical <b>fistulas</b> were observed. Late and early postoperative results revealed low incidence in postoperative transitory dysphagia or regurgitation. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the open surgical procedures are safe and effective in the treatment of ZD. Cricopharyngeal myotomy remains the essential focus of treatment, while the choice of resecting or suspending the diverticulum is brought upon its size. Complete preoperative investigation must be conducted in ZD patients, and the role of pathologic GER {{must be taken into account}} when we discuss the origin of this disorder...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) {{produces}} mycolactone toxin when infected Aims and objectives: The aim is {{to document}} the clinical and epidemiological features of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease in the Middle Belt of Ghana, and the outcome of treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with lesions suspected to be MU disease were screened by community workers. Lesions were confirmed {{by any of the}} following: direct smear examination, culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or histopathology. Patients were treated with rifampicin (10 mg/kg orally) and streptomycin (15 mg/kg im) combination for 8 weeks. Patients selected for surgical treatment included cases where medical treatment had failed, cases presenting late with complications, and recurrent cases. Results: 258 patients were seen in the Ahafo Ano, Amansie Central, Amansie West, Asunafo, Asutifi, and Upper Denkyira districts of Ghana between 2005 and 2012. Their ages ranged from 1 year 3 months to 98 years, {{with a mean age of}} 29. 8 (SD 20. 4). The clinical forms of MU disease seen were: papule (0. 74 %), nodule (1. 48 %), chronic osteomyelitis (1. 48 %), contracture (1. 48 %), oedematous lesion (2. 69 %), and ulcer (91. 85 %). Uncommon complications include subluxation of knee joint, <b>salivary</b> gland <b>fistula</b> and Marjolin's ulcer. The lesions were distributed as follows: head and neck (6. 2 %), upper limb (23. 1 %), trunk (1. 5 %), and lower limb (69. 2 %). Conclusion: The use of antibiotics for MU disease has controlled most lesions; however, rare complications requiring reconstructive surgery are emerging...|$|R
