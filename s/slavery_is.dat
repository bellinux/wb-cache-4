In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} <b>slavery</b> <b>is</b> {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this <b>slavery</b> <b>is</b> sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E

50|$|In {{the history}} of the United States of America, a slave state was a U.S. state in which the {{practice}} of <b>slavery</b> <b>was</b> legal, and a free state was one in which <b>slavery</b> <b>was</b> prohibited or being legally phased out. Historically, <b>slavery</b> had <b>been</b> practiced in all the British colonies. The division between slave and free states began during the American Revolution (1775-1783). <b>Slavery</b> <b>was</b> a divisive issue and was the primary cause of the American Civil War. The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865, abolished slavery throughout the United States, and the distinction ended.|$|R

There are examples of forced labor being used to execute Jews during the holocaust by the Extermination through labour policy of Nazi Germany but in general <b>slavery</b> <b>is</b> not considered genocide. However, there are slave labor systems which have killed millions of people due to inhumane treatment and war was waged in order to capture people so they could be enslaved, two particularly infamous examples being the Atlantic and the Arabian slave trades which some refer to as the Maafa or the Black Holocaust.|$|E

The first colonial empire in the century to abolish <b>slavery</b> <b>was</b> the British, who did so in 1834. America's 13th Amendment following their Civil War abolished slavery there in 1865, and in Brazil <b>slavery</b> <b>was</b> abolished in 1888 (see Abolitionism).
