40|$|For {{neutrino}} oscillations to {{take place}} the entangled quantum state of a neutrino and a charged lepton produced via charged current interactions must be disentangled. Implementing a non-perturbative Wigner-Weisskopf method we obtain the correct entangled quantum state of neutrinos and charged leptons from the (two-body) decay of a parent particle. The source lifetime and disentanglement length scale lead to a suppression of the oscillation probabilities in short-baseline experiments. The suppression is determined by π L_s/L_osc where L_s is {{the smallest of the}} decay length of the parent particle or the disentanglement length scale. For L_s ≥ L_osc coherence and oscillations are suppressed. These effects are more prominent in <b>short</b> <b>base</b> <b>line</b> experiments and at low neutrino energy.

40|$|The marine {{controlled}} source electromagnetic (CSEM) {{technique has}} been adopted by the hydrocarbon industry to characterize the resistivity of targets identified from seismic data prior to drilling. Over the years, marine controlled source electromagnetic has matured {{to the point that}} four-dimensional or time lapse surveys and monitoring could be applied to hydrocarbon reservoirs in production, or to monitor the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Marine controlled source electromagnetic surveys have also been used to target shallow resistors such as gas hydrates. These novel uses of the technique require very well constrained transmitter and receiver geometry in order to make meaningful and accurate geologic interpretations of the data. Current navigation in marine controlled source electromagnetic surveys utilize a long base line, or a <b>short</b> <b>base</b> <b>line,</b> acoustic navigation system to locate the transmitter and seafloor receivers. If these systems fail, then rudimentary navigation is possible by assuming the transmitter follows in the ship's track. However, these navigational assumptions are insufficient to capture the detailed orientation and position of the transmitter required for both shallow targets and repeat surveys. In circumstances when acoustic navigation systems fail we propose the use of an inversion algorithm that solves for transmitter geometry. This algorithm utilizes the transmitter's electromagnetic dipole radiation pattern as recorded by stationary, close range (< 1000 m), receivers in order to model the geometry of the transmitter. We test the code with a synthetic model and validate it with data from a well navigated controlled source electromagnetic survey over the Scarborough gas field in Australia...|$|E

Located the underground LNGS Hall-B, the ICARUS T 600 detector has been performed over three years with remarkable detection efficiency featuring a smooth operation, high live time, and high reliability. About 3000 CNGS neutrino events have been collected and are being actively analyzed. ICARUS will now be moved to CERN for an extensive R&D program. The T 600 detector will be overhauled and complemented with a similar T 150 detector. These improvements are performed {{in collaboration with the}} LBNE experiment, of which several INFN Institutions are now members. As a novelty, a SC magnetic field of about 1 T will be introduced. During 2016 it is proposed to move the experiment to FNAL where <b>short</b> <b>base</b> <b>line</b> neutrino beams are available, complementing the approved MicroBooNe experiment which will start operation in 2014. The ICARUS detectors at FNAL will be an important addition since, in absence of anomalies, the signals of several detectors at different distances from the target should be a copy of each other for all experimental signatures. Due to the reduced mass, in MicroBooNE the anti-neutrino signal is too weak for a sensitive comparison. Hence, a definitive clarification of the LSND anomaly requires the exploration of the anti-neutrino signal provided by the much larger T 600. The magnetic field will allow separating the anti-neutrino signal from the neutrino-induced background. It is proposed to expose the T 600 at the Booster NuBeam at ~ 700 m from target; the T 150 will be located at ~ 150 m. The T 600 will also receive > 10 ^ 4 nu_e events/year from the off-axis NUMI beam peaked around 1 GeV and exploitable to prepare for the LBNE experiment.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made at the {{measurements}} of surface velocities of ice flow in several places along {{the east coast of}} Lutzow-Holm Bay in 1960 and 1961. Difficulties in preserving stakes and in selecting suitable sites for surveying and the limited time prevented the authors from making complete measurements. Sporadic results obtained during the above period may be insufficient for the detailed discussion on water mass balance of the region. Nevertheless, they can afford a clue to that problem, because they were obtained from various places including glaciers of small to large size and sheet flow which may be representative of the ice coast. Changes in positions of bamboo stakes were determined by triangulation with a Wild T_ 2 theodolite. Base lines were set up on ice-free areas. Sheet flow was measured on the margin of ice sheet at a distance of 900 m from a coast line of the Ongul Strait. It revealed that there was a considerable difference between flow velocities in the warm season and those in the cold season. If seasonal changes are taken into consideration, flow rates are estimated as 10. 0 to 3. 2 m・year^, according to the localities of stakes. The Langhovde Glacier with a small floating ice tongue may flow at a rate of 172 m・year^, assuming the mean annual velocity to be twice as large as the velocity in the cold season. At the Hamna Glacier which may override higher subglacial rocks between Hamna and Breidvagnippa than in the case of other glaciers only one stake could be surveyed. The stake set up on the ice close (200 m) to a rock exposure showed a movement at a rate of 1. 5 cm・day^. The Hamna Ice Fall is a small distributary of the Hamna Glacier and its velocity near the snout was only 2. 6 m・year^. The Shirase Glacier is the largest ice stream on the coast of Lutzow-Holm Bay and pours into the bay head. Its movements were measured on the marginal part of its floating ice tongue near Insteodden.

The accuracy of measurement is thought to be lowered by the <b>short</b> <b>base</b> <b>line.</b> But the high velocity may be indicated by the growth of tensional crack on fast ice which is accompanied by shear crack formed by thrusting of the glacier tongue.

Horizontal displacement of fast ice along shear crack off the tongues of the Telen and the Skallen Glaciers was measured as an indication of the movement of glaciers.

The setup and mode of deployment of the OFOS was similar to that described by Bergmann and Klages (2012, doi: 10. 1016 /j. marpolbul. 2012. 09. 018). OFOS is a surface-powered gear equipped with two downward-looking cameras installed side-by-side: one high-resolution, wide-angle still camera (CANON® EOS 5 D Mark III; lens: Canon EF 24 f/ 1. 4 L II, f stop: 13, exposure time: 1 / 125 sec; in-air view angles: 74 ° (horizontal), 53 ° (vertical), 84 ° (diagonal); image size: 5760 x 3840 px = 21 MPix; front of pressure resistant camera housing consisting of plexiglass dome port) and one high-definition color video camera (SONY® FCB-H 11). The system was vertically lowered over the stern of the ship with a broadband fibre-optic cable, until it hovers approximately 1. 5 m above the seabed. It was then towed after the slowly sailing ship at a speed of approximately 0. 5 kn (0. 25 m/s). The ship's Global Acoustic Positioning System (GAPS), combining Ultra <b>Short</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> (USBL), Inertial Navigation System (INS) and satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies, was used to gain highly precise underwater position data of the OFOS. During the profile, OFOS was kept hanging at the preferred height above the seafloor by means of the live video feed and occasional minor cable-length adjustments with the winch to compensate small-scale bathymetric variations in seabed morphology. Information on water depth and height above the seafloor were continuously recorded by means of OFOS-mounted sensors (GAPS transponder, Tritech altimeter). Three lasers, which are placed beside the still camera, emit parallel beams and project red light points, arranged as an equilateral triangle with a side length of 50 cm, in each photo, thus providing a scale {{that can be used to}} calculate the seabed area depicted in each image and/or measure the size of organisms or seabed features visible in the image. In addition, the seabed area depicted was estimated using altimeter-derived height above seafloor and optical characteristics of the OFOS still camera. In automatic mode, a seabed photo, depicting an area of approximately 3. 45 m** 2 (= 2. 3 m x 1. 5 m; with variations depending on the actual height above ground), was taken every 30 seconds to obtain series of "TIMER" stills distributed at regular distances along the profiles that vary in length depending on duration of the cast. At a ship speed of 0. 5 kn, the average distance between seabed images was approximately 5 m. Additional "HOTKEY" photos were taken from interesting objects (organisms, seabed features, such as putative iceberg scours) when they appeared in the live video feed (which was also recorded, in addition to the stills, for documentation and possible later analysis).

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Survey-class Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) rely on Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) for precise {{localisation}} {{and navigation}} near the seafloor. In {{cases where the}} seafloor depth {{is greater than the}} DVL bottom-lock range, localising between the surface, where GPS is available, and the seafloor presents a localisation problem since both GPS and DVL are unavailable in the mid-water column. Reliance on acoustic tracking methods such as Ultra <b>Short</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> (USBL) requires a ship to track the vehicle, while Long Base Line (LBL) requires the setting up of an acoustic transponder network. These methods provide bounded error position localisation (10 m) of the underwater vehicle, but inhibits the flexibility and autonomy of the vehicle due to tending or set-up requirements. Proposed alternatives to these include combining GPS on the surface, navigation-grade IMU, the DVL water-track mode and a vehicle model to reduce the dead-reckoning error, although results show that this error is still not competitive with acoustic tracking methods after approximately 10 minutes of descent. Often ocean depth requires hours of descent without GPS or DVL, thus acoustic tracking methods are preferred. This work proposes a solution to localisation in the mid-water column that exploits the fact that current profile layers of water columns are stable over short periods of time (in the scale of minutes). As demonstrated in simulation, using observations of these currents with the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) mode of the DVL during descent, along with sensor fusion of other low cost sensors, position error growth can be constrained to near the initial velocity uncertainty of the vehicle at the sea surface during a vertical dive. Following DVL bottom-lock, the entire velocity history is constrained to an error similar to the DVL velocity uncertainty. When coupled with a tactical-grade IMU and Time Differenced Carrier Phase (TDCP) GPS measurements, approximately 15 m/hr (2 sigma) position error growth is possible prior to DVL bottom-lock, and 6. 5 m/hr (2 sigma) position error growth is possible following DVL bottom-lock. The method is demonstrated using real data from the Sirius AUV coupled with on-bottom view-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping), without the use of an IMU. Horizontal localisation in the mid-water zone is also explored using an extension to the water-layer framework. The layered water currents are extended to include horizontal gridding, while the ADCP sensor is remodelled to use beam coordinates to exploit horizontal observation. The water current vector field is modelled as correlated spatially through neighbourhood least-squared constraints. Simulations illustrate the performance possible with this method, and results from real data validate this approach. In order to minimize the dead-reckoning error during mid-water zone transits, a novel method to incorporate Inertial Measurements and the constraints of a drag-based vehicle model is outlined. The drag-based Vehicle model uses the water current velocity estimates from the ADCP aiding method, while also accounting for the error from the Vehicle parameters given a prior system identification. Due to the redundant observations of motion from the IMU and DVL when available, there is potential for further improvement in estimates of the Vehicle parameters. Simulations are undertaken to assess the advantage of incorporating a vehicle model, and application on real data from the Sirius AUV validates this method...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an applicable model for complex multiattribute negotiations between autonomous agents. The model adopts a novel protocol which decomposes the original n-dimensional negotiation space {{into a series}} of negotiation <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> and in each period agents negotiate locally based on a given <b>base</b> <b>line.</b> A belief <b>based</b> negotiation strategy and an offer enhancement process are proposed for agents to make base offer on the negotiation <b>base</b> <b>line</b> and search for Pareto optimal enhancements of the base offer. The model achieves asymptotic Pareto optimality...|$|R
