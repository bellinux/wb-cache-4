50|$|If {{the skin}} defect does not exceed 3 cm in diameter, {{it can be}} closed primarily. If this is not {{possible}} without tension, the surrounding loose connective tissue can be undermined to attain more mobility. Different kinds of transpositions to close the defect with adjacent skin are possible: V-Y, Z, pinwheel flaps, advancement flaps, Orticochea flaps and rotation flaps. All these transpositions generate tension of the skin and may distort <b>hair</b> <b>lines.</b> A combination of the Orticochea and rotation flaps {{is illustrated by the}} pictures about the forehead defect.Another option is secondary healing, but this is aesthetically inferior to primary closure in hair bearing areas because of the resulting alopecia. If the scalp cannot be closed primarily and local reconstruction with hair bearing skin is needed because of <b>hair</b> <b>lines,</b> tissue expansion of hair bearing skin may be possible. The expansion process is uncomfortable on the short term, but long-term results are good.|$|R
40|$|In this study, Photoshop {{software}} {{was used to}} do image analysis on the photos of spun yarns. The result showed that yarn could {{be divided into two}} parts: the <b>surface</b> <b>hairs</b> and the stem. Based on this finding, a mathematical model of yarn unevenness was built to analyze the relationship between yarn unevenness and surface hairiness. The relationships among the coefficients of mass variance of the yarn, the stem and the <b>surface</b> <b>hairs,</b> expressed as CVt, CVs and CVh, respectively, were investigated in detail. Results indicate that the CVs of an uneven yarn always coincides with the irregularity of the yarn hairiness. More specifically, the CVt of a yarn cannot be better than those of both yarn hairiness and stem (CVh and CVs), even if one of them is excessive. It is rare for CVt to be higher than CVs after removal of yarn hairs. In particular, it is irrational for the CVt value to be higher than both CVs and CVh, which prompts a rethinking of the exact distribution of yarn hairs on the yarn bod...|$|R
