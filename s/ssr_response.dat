40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that multisensory integration may occur at an early phase in sensory processing and within cortical regions traditionally though to be exclusively unisensory. Evidence from perceptual and electrophysiological studies indicate that the cross modal temporal correspondence of multisensory stimuli plays {{a fundamental role in}} the cortical integration of information across separate sensory modalities. Further, oscillatory neural activity in sensory cortices may provide the principle mechanism whereby sensory information from separate modalities is integrated. In the present study we aimed to extend this prior research by using the steady-state EEG response (SSR) to examine whether variations in the cross-modality temporal correspondence of amplitude modulated auditory and vibrotactile stimulation are apparent in SSR activity to multisensory stimulation. To achieve this we varied the cross-modal congruence of modulation rate for passively and simultaneously presented amplitude modulated auditory and vibrotactile stimuli. In order to maximise the <b>SSR</b> <b>response</b> in both modalities 21 and 40 Hz modulation rates were selected. Consistent with prior SSR studies, the present results showed clear evidence of phase-locking for EEG frequencies corresponding to the modulation rate of auditory and vibrotactile stimulation. As also found previously, the optimal modulation rate for SSR activity differed according to the modality, being greater at 40 Hz for auditory responses and greater at 21 Hz for vibrotactile responses. Despite consistent and reliable changes in SSR activity with manipulations of modulation rate within modality, the present study failed to provide strong evidence of multisensory interactions in SSR activity for temporally congruent, relative to incongruent, cross modal conditions. The results are discussed in terms of the role of attention as a possible factor in reconciling inconsistencies in SSR studies of multisensory integration...|$|E

We studied twenty-one hemiparetic patients with and eighteen patients without SHS. Variables were palm temperature, sympathetic skin <b>responses</b> (<b>SSR),</b> and proximal nerve latencies of both the affected and nonaffected upper extremity. In patients with SHS, the paretic extremity was significantly warmer and showed enhanced <b>SSR</b> <b>responses</b> when stimulated on the affected side and pro-longed proximal nerve latencies {{in comparison to the}} nonaffected side. There was no difference in these parameters between both sides in patients without SHS. The altered tonic and reflex mediated sympathetic responses in patients with SHS may be related to neuroapraxia of the axillary plexus due to malalignment of the hemiplegic shoulder.

40|$|Abstract Simple {{spectral}} ratio (SSR) and horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) site-response estimates at 47 {{sites in}} the Puget Lowland of Washington State document significant attenuation of 1. 5 - to 20 -Hz shear waves within sedimentary basins there. Amplitudes of the horizontal components of shear-wave arrivals from three local earthquakes were used to compute SSRs {{with respect to the}} average of two bedrock sites and H/V spectral ratios with respect to the vertical component of the shear-wave arrivals at each site. SSR site-response curves at thick basin sites show peak ampli-fications of 2 to 6 at frequencies of 3 to 6 Hz, and decreasing spectral amplification with increasing frequency above 6 Hz. SSRs at nonbasin sites show a variety of shapes and larger resonance peaks. We attribute the spectral decay at frequencies above the amplification peak at basin sites to attenuation within the basin strata. Computing the frequency-independent, depth-dependent attenuation factor (Qs,int) from the SSR spectral decay between 2 and 20 Hz gives values of 5 to 40 for shallow sedimentary deposits and about 250 for the deepest sedimentary strata (7 km depth). H/V site responses show less spectral decay than the <b>SSR</b> <b>responses</b> but contain many of the same resonance peaks. We hypothesize that the H/V method yields a flatter response across the frequency spectrum than SSRs because the H/V reference signal (vertical component of the shear-wave arrivals) has undergone a degree of attenuation similar to the horizontal component recordings. Correcting the <b>SSR</b> site <b>responses</b> for attenuation within the basins by removing the spectral decay improves agreement between SSR and H/V estimates...|$|R

This MEG study investigated interactions within and between sensory modalities using a frequency analysis of steady-Ââstate <b>responses</b> (<b>SSR)</b> to periodic auditory and/or visual inputs. The 3 x 3 factorial design, manipulated (1) modality (auditory only, visual only and audiovisual) and (2) temporal dynamics (static, dynamic 1 and dynamic 2). In the static conditions, subjects were presented with (1) visual gratings, luminance modulated at 6 Hz and/or (2) pure tones, frequency modulated at 40 Hz. To manipulate perceptual synchrony, we imposed additional slow modulations on the auditory and visual stimuli either at same (0. 2 Hz = synchronous) or different frequencies (0. 2 Hz vs. 0. 7 Hz = asynchronous). This also enabled us to investigate the integration of two dynamic features within one sensory modality (e. g. a pure tone frequency modulated at 40 Hz amplitude modulated at 0. 2 Hz) in the dynamic conditions. We reliably identified crossmodulation frequencies when these two stimulus features were modulated at different frequencies. In contrast, no crossmodulation frequencies were identified when information needed to be combined from auditory and visual modalities. The absence of audiovisual crossmodulation frequencies suggests that the previously reported audiovisual interactions in primary sensory areas may mediate low level spatiotemporal coincidence detection that is prominent for stimulus transients but less relevant for sustained <b>SSR</b> <b>responses.</b> In conclusion, our results indicate that information in SSRs is integrated over multiple time scales within but not across sensory modalities at the primary cortical level...|$|R

40|$|Persons with {{schizophrenia}} experience subjective sensory anomalies {{and objective}} deficits on assessment of sensory function. Such deficits could {{be produced by}} abnormal signaling in the sensory pathways and sensory cortex or later stage disturbances in cognitive processing of such inputs. Steady state <b>responses</b> (<b>SSRs)</b> provide a noninvasive method to test the integrity of sensory pathways and oscillatory responses in schizophrenia with minimal task demands. <b>SSRs</b> are electrophysiological <b>responses</b> entrained to the frequency and phase of a periodic stimulus. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit pronounced auditory SSR deficits within the gamma frequency range (35 – 50 Hz) in response to click trains and amplitude-modulated tones. Visual SSR deficits are also observed, most prominently in the alpha and beta frequency ranges (7 – 30 Hz) in response to high-contrast, high-luminance stimuli. Visual SSR studies that have used the psychophysical properties of a stimulus to target specific visual pathways predominantly report magnocellular-based deficits in those with schizophrenia. Disruption of both auditory and visual SSRs in schizophrenia are consistent with neuropathological and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of anatomic abnormalities affecting the auditory and visual cortices. Computational models suggest that auditory SSR abnormalities at gamma frequencies could be secondary to γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid dysregulation. The pathophysiological process in schizophrenia encompasses sensory processing that probably contributes to alterations in subsequent encoding and cognitive processing. The developmental evolution of these abnormalities remains to be characterized...|$|R

The disturbances are mostly responsive to dopaminergic (DA) treatment; yet, there are conflicting results. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate pain processing and nociception in PD patients in a more comprehensive manner than previous studies. For this purpose, a multi-methods approach was used in order to monitor different levels of the central nervous system (spinal, subcortical-vegetative, cortical). Methods: The heat-pain threshold, contact-heat evoked brain potentials (CHEPs) and sympathetic skin <b>responses</b> (<b>SSR),</b> nociceptive flexion <b>responses</b> (NFR) and subjective pain ratings were measured in 23 idiopathic PD patients both in the Off-phase (without DA medication) and On-phase (after DA medication intake) as well as in 23 healthy controls. Results: Compared to controls, PD patients showed decreased heat-pain thresholds only in the Off and tentatively increased NFR amplitudes in both phases. We found no between-group differences for the CHEPs, the NFR threshold/latency or the pain ratings. Yet, SSR amplitudes/frequencies were decreased and latencies were increased in PD patients in both phases. Correlations between CHEPs amplitudes and pain ratings were found only in controls. Discussion: Increased pain sensitivity (heat-pain threshold) in the Off which normalizes in the On argues for DA induced dysfunctions of the nigrostriatal pain loops with the basal ganglia as main circuit in our PD sample. Dysfunctions of the subcortical-vegetative parameters despite of inconspicuous cortical nociception suggest disturbances of the central or peripheral innervation of sympathetic branches with coincidently intact ascending pathways in the PD group.

As neuropathy manifests in longstanding diabetes mellitus, autonomic nervous system also gets affected.

This study was undertaken to compare the sympathetic skin <b>response</b> (<b>SSR)</b> and galvanic skin resistance (GSR) in males with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in controls. METHODS Thirty males in the age group of 45 - 55 years, known to have diabetes mellitus and having a history of neuropathic symptoms served as subjects and thirty males in the same age group with no history of diabetes mellitus and neuropathy served as controls. SSR and GSR were recorded using Recorders and Medicare Systems 4 channel polygraph in the noise and light reduced research laboratory, Department of Physiology. All the recordings were done between 10 - 12 noon at ambient temperature. SSR was measured by deep inspiration and the GSR was measured in the supine and standing response. Comparison of latency and amplitude of the sympathetic skin response and the percentage of decrease in galvanic skin resistance was done.
