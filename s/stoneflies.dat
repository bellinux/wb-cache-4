5|$|Nearly {{all adult}} caddisflies are terrestrial, but their larvae and pupae are aquatic. They share this {{characteristic}} with several distantly-related groups, namely the dragonflies, mayflies, <b>stoneflies,</b> alderflies and lacewings. The ancestors {{of all these}} groups were terrestrial, with open tracheal systems, convergently evolving different types of gills for their aquatic larvae as they took to the water to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|Wild trout {{naturally}} reproduce in Hammersley Fork {{from its}} headwaters downstream to its mouth. Great blue herons {{have been observed}} at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, {{despite the fact that}} they are more commonly found in large river valleys. Little yellow <b>stoneflies</b> also inhabit it. Brown trout first appeared in the stream in the 1920s after being stocked in Cross Fork and in the 1940s the brown trout populations significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are useful}} as bioindicators (of good water quality), {{since they are}} {{sensitive}} to water pollution, and are {{large enough to be}} assessed conveniently in the field. Some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. Although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with <b>stoneflies</b> and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E

50|$|Lick Run has a {{low level}} of {{biodiversity}} at Panther Rocks. In a 2004 benthic macroinvertebrate survey, only two alderfly larvae and one crayfish were observed here. Upstream of Doctors Fork, the survey observed 125 <b>stonefly</b> nymphs, 52 caddisflies, 5 alderfly larvae, 2 cranefly larvae, and a single crayfish. Downstream of Doctors Fork, 40 <b>stonefly</b> nymphs, 22 caddisfly larvae, and two alderfly larvae were observed. At the SGL #90 Bridge, 45 caddisfly larvae, 44 <b>stonefly</b> nymphs, 3 midge larvae, and 2 aquatic worms were observed by the survey. Upstream of the tributary Stone Run, the survey observed 83 <b>stonefly</b> nymphs, 53 caddisfly larvae, 8 alderfly larvae, 7 mayfly nymphs, 1 caddisfly, and 1 aquatic worm.|$|R
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City. Several flooding events have occurred on Hull Creek. The creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In 2013, it received a habitat assessment score of 159 {{on a scale of}} 0 to 200. Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), <b>stoneflies</b> (Plecoptera), and caddis flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, <b>stoneflies</b> and dragonflies, {{but to a}} {{somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the park, the {{free-flowing}} reaches of Balch Creek support a population of resident cutthroat trout. Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run cutthroat trout, coho salmon, and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including <b>stoneflies,</b> mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Population {{counts of}} aquatic insects {{can be a}} {{credible}} indicator of the overall health of a waterway. <b>Stonefly</b> (Plecoptera) larva {{are very sensitive to}} chemicals present within the waterway, however obtaining population counts of the larvae can be very labor intensive and thus costly. The BugID project has been working to create an automated system to classify the different species of <b>stonefly</b> larva. The current imaging devices require extensive time from a lab technician to individually place <b>stonefly</b> larva into the device. This paper describes the development of a singulation device which would individually remove <b>stonefly</b> larva from a field sample and place them into the imaging device, resulting in a possible solution to help automate the identification process of the larva...|$|R

5|$|Insect {{wings are}} {{fundamental}} in identifying and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences of color and pattern. For example, just by position one can identify species, albeit to a much lesser extent. Though most insects fold their wings when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with their wings spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, <b>stoneflies,</b> alderflies, and lacewings hold their wings sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap their wings around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close their wings together straight upward over the back.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some <b>stoneflies.</b> An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|There are 41 macroinvertebrate taxa {{that have}} been {{observed}} in West Creek, more than have been observed in all of upper Fishing Creek. The number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in West Creek at the site WC1 (in the lower reaches of the creek) is nearly 900, which is far higher {{than the number of}} macroinvertebrates per square meter in any other site except the site WC2, in the middle reaches of the creek. Site WC2 has a macroinvertebrate density of 600 macroinvertebrates per square meter. Approximately 60% of the taxa are Ephemeroptera (mayflies), 10% each are Plecoptera (<b>stoneflies),</b> and approximately 5% are Trichoptera (caddisflies).|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters {{consume a}} wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful {{butterflies}} they consume almost any insect from tiny Drosophila flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, <b>stoneflies,</b> cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise {{a large part of the}} diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.|$|E
5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, <b>stoneflies</b> and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, <b>stoneflies</b> (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
