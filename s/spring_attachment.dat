40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Aircraft and the definitive published version is available at [URL] {{key part of the}} main landing gear (MLG) of a civil aircraft is its locking mechanism that holds the gear in the deployed or down-locked state. The locking is driven by a spring mechanism and its release by the unlock actuator. This paper considers this mechanism in terms of its stability and the locking and unlocking forces required for down-locking. To study this an analytical model was developed. The equations, consisting of geometric constraints and force/moment equilibriums, were derived using the coordinate transformation method. Using numerical continuation to solve these equations, the effect of the unlock force on the MLG retraction cycle was analyzed. The variation of a fold bifurcation point, which indicates the transition between the locked state and the unlocked state, gives further insight into the required unlock force that governs the sizing of the unlock actuator. Moreover, some important information, such as the critical position for the lock-links’ stops, the unlock position and the unlock force, are discussed using the bifurcation diagrams for the MLG retraction/extension cycle. Then, the effect of three key geometry parameters of the locking spring (the spring stiffness, unstrained spring length and <b>spring</b> <b>attachment</b> point) on the critical over-center angle and the unlock force are investigated. Finally, an optimization of the critical unlock force is carried out with a constraint on the initial over-center angle. The results show that the spring parameters have significant effects on the MLG’s retraction performance. A 37 % reduction of the required unlock force is obtained through optimizing for the gear considered here...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to develop}} a wearable, passive, dynamic arm support that provides users with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with support to perform activities of daily living. The arm support needs to be inconspicuous and not stigmatizing, to encourage the users to participate in social activities. Ideally, the device fits underneath clothing. The first sub-goal is to review the state-of-the-art in dynamic arm supports in detail. At the date of publication of the review (June 2013), 23 dynamic passive and active arm supports were found, from which only 4 were wearable. Most of the devices that were found use a parallelogram linkage structure. This structure limits the range of motion of the arm and has a large volume. None of the devices were inconspicuous and fitted underneath clothing. The detailed review to these devices concludes that a serial linkage from the trunk to the arm is required to make the device inconspicuous and underneath clothing. This linkage should have the same degrees of freedom (DoF) as the human arm (3 DoF at the shoulder, 1 DoF at the elbow). In addition, the use of a passive support implies smaller actuators in case an active support is needed. The knowledge from the review is taken into account when defining concepts for a close-to-body arm support (second sub-goal). The focus of the concept elaboration was on compliant structures and on a linkage system with rubber springs. The compliant structure concept was elaborated with two designs. One design uses bending beams as spring elements to support the upper arm. With only two very slender bending beams the upper arm was balanced in a single plane. A proof-of-principle prototype showed that the device gives enough support, is very slender (4 times smaller than current arm supports), and is comfortable. A second design and proof-of-principle prototype showed support of the forearm with a compliant joint consisting of 4 bi-stable leaf springs. The compliant elbow joint has self-aligning capabilities and can be worn underneath clothing. Nevertheless, the forearm is only supported, against gravity, in a single plane. Next to the compliant structure concept, a linkage system with rubber springs is elaborated as a concept for a close-to-body arm support. The focus is on slender and close-to-body spring configurations. Analysis and re-definition of the theory of designing spring configurations resulted in the ability to create designs with multiple serial links. The main accomplishment of re-defining the theory is that the locations of the attachment points of the springs could be calculated very intuitive. Next to that, the behavior of the spring configuration for varying the parameters in the configuration (locations of the attachment points or the spring stiffness) becomes more understandable. In the process, different spring configurations were designed. One spring configuration uses 2 bi-articular springs from the trunk to the forearm, parallel to the upper arm. Some locations of the attachment points of the springs can be chosen freely, others are related to these chosen locations. Another design balances the complete arm with 3 springs. In this configuration, each location of the <b>spring</b> <b>attachment</b> can be chosen freely and close to the body. The required balancing quality can be obtained by adjusting the spring stiffnesses. The balancing quality can be adjusted very easily to the preference of the user during the day. A comparison of the balancing quality and tuning capabilities of different spring configurations showed that the 3 -springs configuration is excellent to apply in a close-to-body arm support. This is mainly due to its easiness of achieving and tuning the required balancing quality, and due to the opportunity to locate the spring attachments close to the body. The third sub-goal was to apply the developed spring configurations into prototypes that could be evaluated on patients with DMD. The first prototype was based on a parallelogram structure, parallel to the body, running from the upper legs and hip to the forearm of the user. This prototype shows the advantage of trunk motion capability. The range of motion of the user increases by 10 %, compared to the use of a currently available arm support that is attached to the wheelchair. For reaching anteriorly the increase in range of motion is even 50 %. The surface electromyography (sEMG) activity is similar. This trunk motion capability was considered as very important by the patients. Therefore, it was included in all the future prototypes as well. Nevertheless, the prototype also showed that the parallelogram structure next to the arm limited the range of motion of the arm. This is because the DoF of the prototype were not similar as the DoF of the human arm. For this reason, in the second prototype this structure was redesigned such that it follows the body contours of the user. This resulted in a kinematic structure with 3 DoF at the shoulder joint and 1 DoF at the elbow joint. The structure was combined with a 2 -springs configuration (based on an existing theoretical model). Rubber bands were used as spring elements. The prototype was evaluated with DMD patients and shows good results on comfort, balancing quality (less than 6 % error with respect to the required balancing force) and range of motion. The user is able to perform most of the important activities of daily living again (e. q., eating, drinking, table-top activities, reaching the face, scratch the head, reaching for high objects). A downside of this device was that the spring configuration is not inconspicuous. Due to limitations of the spring configuration {{it is not possible to}} position the device closer to the body. Therefore, the third prototype is developed with the focus to position the spring configuration closer to the body. The 3 -springs configuration was applied in the prototype. The rubber springs were split into hollow spring structures that fit around the body. In combination with covers on specific places to provide safety, extra structures for sideways stabilization and anatomically shaped body interfaces for more comfort, the third version of the prototype fits within 30 mm from the body. This design allows for further optimization to bring the device even closer to the body. With this result, a wearable passive dynamic arm support is developed that supports the user during activities of daily living and is not stigmatizing.

40|$|International audienceWe present new {{analytical}} {{approach to the}} problem of energy pumping in strongly non- homogeneous nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) systems with single anchor spring under condition of initial impact. Energy pumping is a passive, almost irreversible transfer of mechanical energy from the main substructure of the system to the light auxiliary attachment. The mechanism of energy pumping in the system under consideration is a resonance capture. The approach is based on application of Laplace transformation to the principal asymptotic approximation of the equations of motion in complex form and using the power expansion of the solution in terms of time. Obtained temporal dependence of the system energetic characteristics gives a tool for estimation of energy pumping efficiency. In particular, we show that the system without an anchor <b>spring</b> in <b>attachment</b> is more efficient than the system with such a spring.

METHODS: Four prefabricated attachment systems were tested [Group SG: retentive ball attachment (Straumann, Switzerland) with gold matrix, Group ST: retentive ball attachment (Straumann, Switzerland) with titanium spring matrix, Group IB: UNOR i-Ball with Ecco matrix (UNOR, Switzerland) and Group IMZ: IMZ-TwinPlus ball attachment with gold matrix (DENTSPLY Friadent, Germany) ]. Ten samples of each system were subjected to 10, 000 insertion-separation cycles.

But the stiff court society of Prussia was irksome to her; money difficulties continued; and by way of climax, the murder of the Tsar Paul, in whose favour Baron Krüdener had stood high, made the position of the ambassador extremely precarious.

In practical terms most diving watches feature a rubber, silicone rubber, polyurethane or fabric watchstrap or a stainless steel or titanium metal link or mesh bracelet of adequate length to facilitate wearing the watch over a diving suit sleeve.For a wrist with a 200 mm circumference wearing a 4 mm thick diving suit sleeve increases the strap or bracelet length required the fit the watch over the sleeved wrist to 225 mm. For this bracelets often have a (concealed) divers extension [...] clasp by which the bracelet can be appropriately extended by approximately 20 mm to 30 mm.Some watchstraps allow an increase in length by adding a diving suit extension strap piece to the standard watchstrap. If required more than one diving suit extension strap piece {{can be added to}} the standard watchstrap.With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference. Many watchstraps intended for diving watches have rippled or vented sections near the attachment points on the watch case to facilitate the required flexibility to strap the watch tightly for normal wear at the surface whilst keeping the watch sufficiently tightly in place on the divers wrist at depth.Metal link bracelets theoretically have more failure points compared to metal mesh bracelets and watchstraps due to the use of link connection parts like split pins or screw pins. One piece (NATO style) nylon fabric straps that slide under the watch case through both spring bars (or attaching points between the watch case and strap) are used to minimize the chance of losing the watch due to a <b>spring</b> bar or <b>attachment</b> point failure.|$|R
60|$|The {{vicinity}} {{of the young man}} he certainly relished, educated, distingué and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an <b>attachment</b> <b>sprang</b> up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited {{two or three times a}} week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the King's proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader's, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.|$|R
