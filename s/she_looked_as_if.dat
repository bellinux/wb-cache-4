2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson {{suggests}} that Raquel epitomised {{the representation of}} Northern working-class women during the 1990s: [...] "Raquel articulated the hopes of many young women in her position. The character was complex; one that the whole audience loved, she was naive, gentle, and although <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she would break men's hearts, {{for the most part}} it was her own heart that was broken." [...] Hobson deemed Raquel's breakdown at the registry office prior to her marriage to Curly [...] "one of the most poignant and heartbreaking of any scene in a soap opera, or indeed in any other dramas." [...] She felt that in sobbing with awareness that she was marrying not for love but security, Raquel [...] "spoke of the young working-class women, bright, intelligent, who had been failed by the education system, thus united the shared cultural knowledge of the audience as she wept for herself and millions of other women like her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{another word}} of pursuit {{would put it}} beyond her power to control herself.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} {{inundated}} with an angry colour and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she would attack someone with her hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had just}} {{stepped out of}} a bandbox of last century, thought Mary.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why did he}} choose such a horrid, common girl? Isn't she fearfully alive, though? <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were saying: 'Cheerio!'" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> stands <b>looking</b> out at {{the same}} stars without a word. They are {{beginning}} to pale, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their coldness froze her.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} face, {{she raised her}} hands, in blank amazement: <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she distrusted her own ears.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair before which she had been standing, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were going to swoon.|$|E
60|$|Eustacia made no reply, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she could}} say as much upon that subject as he if she chose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Sir John, 'I am sure <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> found plodding {{along the}} lanes as {{wholesome}} as sleeping in her bed! Nan Apple-cheeks, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} give an opinion until I have seen her. Does <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{might have been}} a pretty woman at one time of her life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I keep meeting Syd and Polly {{circulating}} {{in the same}} directions; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had found something uncommonly nice, and he <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all creation was getting Pollyfied pretty rapidly. Wonder you have n't observed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she scarce followed. [...] "Why is it virtuous if--since she's free--there's {{nothing to}} impose on it any condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she knew}} all about that! [...] "Awfully charming--mustn't it?--to act upon a person, through an affection, so deeply." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{voice in}} which she assented was hoarse and {{scarcely}} audible, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> twenty years had passed over her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} see the heads of her top-gallant sails. She seems a ship {{steering}} to the southward, with as many kites flying as an Indiaman in the trades. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were carrying royal stun'-sails, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|Hélène finds a {{photograph}} of Victor in her husband's jacket pocket with his name and address on the back. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is going to confront him but she goes outside and burns it. Her emotions are difficult to read.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think so. At {{least she}} {{did not seem to}} cheer up as I should have {{expected}} when her brother grew better. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been nursing him too closely, and yet I see her walking a good deal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she {{sometimes}} {{thought of that}} too, but rather in a different way. [...] "Where other people, you mean, are concerned?" ...|$|E
60|$|The girl curtseyed, and sat down. She {{was very}} young, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were {{frightened by the}} matter-of-fact {{prospect}} the world afforded.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she failed}} to {{understand}} this, but went on: [...] "She wants me to have more. She thinks {{she is going to}} die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} happy to be taught," [...] said Rosamond. [...] "But I am sure you admit that the {{interruption}} was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then Mrs. Drury {{should never}} {{come out of}} the scullery. I am sure <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her station was to black the kettles!' cried Gilbert, with some {{domestic}} confusion in his indignation. 'Didn't <b>she</b> <b>look</b> like a housekeeper with her mistress's things on by mistake?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what has}} happened, Francisco?" [...] Polani asked, {{as the boat}} neared {{the side of the}} ship. [...] "Half your bulwark is carried away, and the whole side of the ship is scraped and scored. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been rubbing against a rock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{we might}} walk together,' he {{suggested}} hesitatingly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she did not}} quite know, and he settled the question by showing the way.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she could}} hardly believe me. [...] "Surely you must have heard the name," [...] she said, [...] "when I told you about poor Euneece?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall I do?" [...] she cried. [...] "I can't {{walk home}} without that basket. It's {{perfectly}} dreadful!" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she was going}} to cry.|$|E
6000|$|FREDA turns {{slowly and}} looks up at SIR WILLIAM; he involuntarily [...] raises his hand to his mouth. Her eyes travel on to LADY [...] CHESHIRE, who faces her, but so deadly pale that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] <b>she</b> were going to faint. The girl's gaze passes on to BILL, [...] {{standing}} rigid, with his jaw set.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am really}} {{surprised}} at you, Monsieur Duburg," [...] his wife said, angrily. [...] "I am sure I {{do not wish}} Julie and Justine {{to have as much}} color as their cousin. I consider it quite a misfortune for poor Milly. It is so very commonplace. Poor child, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been working at the vintage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{longed to}} ask what sort of braces she wears, to keep her so straight. I mean to by and by; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't snub a body;" [...] and Sally vainly tried to square her own round shoulders, bent with much poring over books, for she was the bright girl of the school.|$|R
6000|$|... '"O no, no! I was {{thinking}} {{you might be}} going on to town to meet your mother. I saw her there--and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she might be expecting 'ee." ...|$|E
6000|$|The two women's {{eyes met}} again, and Gwendolen said proudly, [...] "I will not {{interfere}} with your wishes." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were shivering, and her lips were pale.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{seemed to}} wonder, however, exactly {{how these things}} could be. [...] "He doesn't {{want you to give}} up anything?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> swiftly {{thinking}} what Nanda MIGHT give up.|$|E
60|$|I like my brethren in affliction very well; and, {{could you}} see us sitting round our table at meal-times, before the great kitchen fire, you would call it a cheerful sight. Mrs. B------ is a most {{comfortable}} woman to behold. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her ample person were stuffed full of tenderness,--indeed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were all one great, kind heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{look at her}} beside of Wrestling Brewster, or Faith Carver. They are {{flesh and}} blood, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been made out of sunshine. 'Tis a sweet babe as ever was; but fitter for {{the kingdom of heaven}} than our rough life--deary me! a hard time we have had of it. I suppose it's all best, but I don't know." ...|$|R
60|$|Her voice became choked, and {{clasping}} her hands, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> upward, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> seeking, in her agony, intelligence from a {{wisdom that}} was infinite.|$|R
