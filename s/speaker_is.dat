50|$|The Macedonian {{language}} was the tenth most common language spoken in Australia after English. In 2006, 67,835 people spoke the Macedonian language at home. In 2001 one-third of Macedonian <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> aged over 65, 25.9% were aged from 55-64, 31.8% were aged from 25-54, 1.2% were aged from 13-24 and 7.7% were aged from 0-12. 53.2% or 38,826 <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> {{born in the}} Republic of Macedonia, 37.6% or 27,051 <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> born in Australia, 4.4% or 3,152 <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> born in Greece and a further 1.3% or 908 <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> born in Yugoslavia.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} experiment, Exp. 1, native Arabic <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} {{in both the}} training and the testing. The WestPoint corpus is divided {{in such a way}} that 61 % of the corpus is used for the training and 39 % for the test regardless of either gender or scripts. In the second experiment, Exp. 2, native <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test phase. Then, the training uses 85 % of the corpus (native speakers), while 15 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. In Exp. 3, all nonnative Arabic <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> used for the training and all Arabic native speakers for the test. In the fourth experiment, Exp. 4, only nonnative Arabic <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> used in both training and testing systems. The nonnative speakers' part of the corpus is divided to obtain 67 % for the training, and 33 % for the test. In the fifth experiment, Exp. 5, both native and nonnative Arabic utterances are pooled to constitute the training data (69 % of the corpus) and testing data (31 % of the corpus). Experiments Exp. 6 to Exp. 9 are set up by varying the gender of the speakers in training and testing data. In Exp. 6, native male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only nonnative male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. Thus the training uses 82 % of the corpus (male speakers only), while 18 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. In Exp. 7, native female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only nonnative female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. Hence the training uses 90 % of the corpus (female speakers only), while 10 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. In Exp. 8, nonnative male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only native male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. In this case, the training uses 18 % of the corpus (male speakers), while 82 % of the corpus composed of native male <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. Finally, in Exp. 9, nonnative female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only native female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. Thus the training uses 10 % of the corpus (female speakers), while 90 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. The bigram language model was always derived from the total of prompts provided by WestPoint. This means that we use the same language model for all experiments.|$|R
5|$|The President of the European Parliament (Parliament's <b>speaker)</b> <b>is</b> Antonio Tajani (EPP), {{elected in}} January 2017. He presides over a multi-party chamber, {{the two largest}} groups being the Group of the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S). The last union-wide {{elections}} were the 2014 elections.|$|E
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The <b>speaker</b> <b>is</b> shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the <b>speaker</b> <b>is</b> attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
50|$|Bazigar is an {{unclassified}} Dravidian {{language of}} northern India. <b>Speakers</b> <b>are</b> {{scattered across the}} country, but the principal block of <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> south of Chandigarh in adjoining areas of the states of Panjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. <b>Speakers</b> <b>are</b> shifting to more dominant languages.|$|R

50|$|Guitar <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{differently from}} hi-fi speakers intended for in-home listening to pre-recorded music. Whereas hi-fi <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> meant to provide as little coloration {{of the source}} signal as possible, guitar <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> often designed to add some type of tonal coloration to the sound.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Speaker</b> <b>is</b> Liberal Peter Milliken. Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only {{votes in}} a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus was {{effectively}} reduced by one. This, {{along with the}} defection of Wajid Khan to the Conservatives enabled the Conservatives to pass legislation {{with the cooperation of}} any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or New Democratic Party (NDP).|$|E
5|$|While the Leslie <b>speaker</b> <b>is</b> {{still made}} and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend {{not to be in}} good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris <b>Speaker</b> <b>is</b> the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the roles of}} gender and visual realism in the persuasiveness of <b>speakers.</b> Participants <b>were</b> presented with a persuasive passage delivered by a male or female person, virtual human, or virtual character. They were then assessed on attitude change and their ratings of the argument, message, and speaker. The {{results indicated that the}} virtual <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> as effective at changing attitudes as real people. Male participants were more persuaded when the <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> female than when the <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> male, whereas female participants were more persuaded when the <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> male than when the <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> female. Cross gender interactions occurred across all conditions, suggesting that some of the gender stereotypes that occur with people may carry over to interaction with virtual characters. Ratings of the perceptions of the <b>speaker</b> <b>were</b> more favorable for virtual speakers than for human speakers. We discuss the application of these findings in the design of persuasive human computer interfaces...|$|R

5|$|The <b>speaker</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} its inventor, Donald Leslie, who began {{working in the}} late 1930s to get a speaker for a Hammond organ that better {{emulated}} a pipe or theatre organ, and discovered that rotating the speaker gave the best sound effect. Hammond {{was not interested in}} marketing or selling the speakers, so Leslie sold them himself as an add-on, targeting other organs as well as Hammond. Leslie made the first speaker in 1941. The sound of the organ being played through his speakers received national radio exposure across the US, and it became a commercial and critical success. It soon became an essential tool for most jazz organists. In 1965, Leslie sold his business to CBS who, in 1980, sold it to Hammond. Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation subsequently acquired the Hammond and Leslie brands.|$|E
