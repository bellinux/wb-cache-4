2500|$|With its {{humor and}} {{occasional}} tongue-in-cheek tone, Passions {{has been known}} to [...] "break the fourth wall", or somehow call {{attention to the fact that}} the show is fictional. In an early episode, Kay, Simone, and Zombie Charity were seen actually watching Passions, and when the television in the Bennett's kitchen covered what would have been Theresa's execution, the news report actually pre-empted Passions, cutting in during the theme song just after the appearance of the logo. In a 2002 episode Theresa was giving birth while stuck in a cabin with Ethan and Gwen; she had a hallucination in which the three of them did a dance together and sang the show's theme song [...] "Breathe." [...] In 2004, TC made a reference to [...] "that crazy soap after Days of our Lives", which in most areas airs before Passions. In one episode Fancy Crane used a magazine to hide her face from Noah; the magazine had an image of the then-unseen Rachel Barrett with the sentence [...] "Who is she?" [...] under the Passions logo. Fancy later commented that serials [...] "are just like life; you never know what's going to happen!" [...] In an early 2006 episode, Ivy and assistant Valerie were <b>searching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> for Miguel to bring him back to Harmony and interfere with Fox and Kay's relationship. They could not find him, but Valerie tracked down his last place of employment: he was last seen working as a gardener in some suburban town on a street called Wisteria Lane. At that time, Jesse Metcalfe (ex-Miguel) was playing a gardener on the prime-time serial Desperate Housewives, which takes place on a street called Wisteria Lane. In the March 30, 2006 episode, while Passions reruns were airing on the Sci-Fi Channel, Simone compared life in Harmony to living in a show on the Sci-Fi Channel. Similarly, in the August 10, 2006 episode, Theresa commented that her office was not like an NBC daytime serial, and that she would not hire somebody just because he looked like Jesse Metcalfe (who had portrayed her brother Miguel from 1999–2004). A similar inside joke occurred when the character Fancy had a dream that she was a cheerleader; in real life, Fancy's portrayer Emily Harper was a [...] "Laker Girl" [...] (cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers) from 2000-2003.|$|E

40|$|Background: With the {{widespread}} dissemination of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> throughout <b>the</b> world of health, {{it would be}} relevant to report on current knowledge about health information <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> from <b>the</b> consumers' standpoint. Methods: We conducted a bibliographical research {{over the past five}} years and distinguished between international and French studies. Results: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health <b>searches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding <b>the</b> impact <b>on</b> consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> seems to emerge but research should be continued. Conclusion: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare...|$|R

50|$|The show's {{producers}} {{had already}} concluded {{on their own}} that the video {{would have to be}} bleeped to be broadcast, but had a special request for Ludwin: they asked to be given permission to make the uncensored version available online.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{estimate}} the impact of job <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> probability of re-employment and the duration of unemployment spells. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses national panel datasets from Germany (SOEP 2003 - 2007) and South Korea (KLIPS 1996 - 2006) {{to estimate}} probit and Hausman-Taylor IV models {{of the impact of}} job <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> probability of re-employment. The study also explores duration analysis with the aim of estimating <b>the</b> impact of <b>internet</b> job <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> duration of unemployment. Findings – In Germany and South Korea job seekers who used <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> had a 7. 1 and 12. 7 percentage point higher probability, respectively, of being re-employed in the next 12 months. Furthermore, job seekers who used <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> had a shorter duration of unemployment in both Germany and South Korea. Practical implications – Over <b>the</b> past decade, <b>internet</b> penetration rates and use of <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> in job search have risen sharply across <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>internet</b> has significantly changed the job application process and improved the channels of communication between employers and job seekers. The findings of the research indicate that <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> is beneficial and should be a part of job search efforts. Originality/value – The contribution of this study is twofold. It is the first study to use panel datasets to analyze <b>the</b> link between <b>internet</b> use and job search outcomes. Therefore, the results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity problems. The study also addresses the issue of endogeneity of job <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> by using <b>the</b> Hausman-Taylor IV model...|$|R

50|$|In {{the year}} 2001, Michael K. Bergman said how <b>searching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> can be {{compared}} to dragging a net {{across the surface of the}} ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed. Most of the web's information is buried far down on sites, and standard search engines do not find it. Traditional search engines cannot see or retrieve content in the deep web. The portion of the web that is indexed by standard search engines is known as the surface web. , the deep web was several orders of magnitude larger than the surface web. An analogy of an iceberg used by Denis Shestakov represents the division between surface web and deep web respectively:It is impossible to measure, and harsh to put estimates on the size of the deep web because the majority of the information is hidden or locked inside databases. Early estimates suggested that the deep web is 400 to 550 times larger than the surface web. However, since more information and sites are always being added, it can be assumed that the deep web is growing exponentially at a rate that cannot be quantified.Estimates based on extrapolations from a study done at University of California, Berkeley in 2001 speculate that the deep web consists of about 7.5 petabytes. More accurate estimates are available for the number of resources in the deep web: research of He et al. detected around 300,000 deep web sites in the entire web in 2004, and, according to Shestakov, around 14,000 deep web sites existed in the Russian part of the Web in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Special Prosecutor Robert Jambois {{contended that}} Mark Jensen {{poisoned}} his wife Julie, then 40, with ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and then suffocated her inside the garage {{of their home}} in Pleasant Prairie on December 3, 1998. The trial was moved from Kenosha County to Walworth County in response to pre-trial publicity. defense counsel Craig Albee argued that Julie Jensen was a depressed woman who killed herself and framed her husband. Moreover, the deceased had seen a therapist {{at least three times}} for depression and was aware of her husband's extramarital affair with a co-worker, Kelly LaBonte Grieman whom Mark Jensen later married, and who assumed custody of the Jensens' two sons after Mark's eventual imprisonment. Evidence was introduced showing that Mark Jensen had discussed poisoning his wife with co-workers and a jailhouse associate, as well as <b>searching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> for information relating to spousal murder and poisoning techniques. The prosecution contended further that Jensen remained angry over his wife's brief affair in 1991 with co-worker Perry Tarica. The letter's use by the prosecutors was controversial, because such evidence has been blocked from court for years by strict hearsay rules based on criminal defendants' right, under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to confront their accusers. But the Wisconsin Supreme Court, guided by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling (Crawford v Washington 541 U.S. 36 (2004)), created a hearsay exception that permitted the use of Julie Jensen's letter and statements as a dying declaration — that is, evidence of her state of mind {{at the time of her}} death. The letter was the critical factor in the trial that ended on February 22, 2008. The jury found Jensen, 48, guilty of his wife's murder after more than 30 hours of deliberations. He was sentenced by Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder on February 27, 2008 to life in prison with no chance of parole.|$|E
