An optical expander electrooptically expands an optical boolean pattern encoded in d bits into an optical pattern of size N bits. Each expanded pattern {{is one of the}} N mutually orthogonal boolean patterns. We wish the expansion to be exponential, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> have <b>d</b> = c log N for some constant c. An optical expander can be viewed as either an electrooptical line decoder which converts d bits of optically encoded binary information to up to N unique optical outputs; or a digital beam deflector which deflects an input laser beam into one of N distinct directions with a control signal of <b>d</b> bits. <b>We</b> show that an optical expander can not be constructed by using linear optical systems, so a non-linear optical filter must be used.

We describe two di erent architectures to implement an optical expander. One uses an optical matrix-vector multiplier and an array of Nthreshold devices. The other uses log N novel re ection/transmission switching cells. We then analyze these architectures in terms of size, energy requirement, and speed. Our optical expander can help develop various applications in electrooptical computing systems. In general, because of I/O constraints and the limited fan-in/fan-out of electrical circuits, the conventional VLSI technology is not suitable for building a large line decoder. On the other hand, conventional acoustooptic beam de ectors are bulky and limited by capacity-speed product. We show that as an electrooptical functional unit, the line decoder nds many applications in optical computing such as optical interconnects and optical memory. Thus, the design and development of optical expanders is vital to optical computing. Our optical expander utilizes high speed and high space-bandwidth product connections provided by optical beams in a volume, so it o ers fast and accurate operations. Holographic memory system and message routing systems are potential applications of the optical expanders, and are discussed to further motivate the design and development of optical expanders.
