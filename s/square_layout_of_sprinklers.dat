50|$|Rooms in the Spinks {{house were}} built {{primarily}} with plaster walls adorned sparingly with redwood and some Port Orford Cedar fascia boards. The main staircase, well {{lit by a}} large second-story skylight, was created using {{a significant amount of}} wood and incorporates two landings. Although much of the wood was covered in paint over the years, it was painstakingly restored by owners around 1970. The more-or-less <b>square</b> <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the house remains largely intact as originally built, and very few modifications have been made to the house in its over 100 years of existence. The only significant changes to the house include an early 20th-century garage expansion to allow the formerly one-car garage with workroom and chauffeur's quarters to accommodate three cars, and a one-story expansion of the house to the south to accommodate two maid's rooms. The latter change was designed by the original architectural firm of Greene & Greene.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though the}} <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> Nishat Bagh {{was based on}} the basic {{conceptual}} model of the Persian gardens, it had to be remodelled to fit the topographic and water source conditions at the site chosen in the Kashmir valley. The plan, instead of being central with four radiating arms in a square pattern {{as in the case of}} Chahar (suited for a flat country side), was changed to an axial stream flow design to fit the hill condition with water source originating at the top of the hill end. This resulted in planning a rectangular layout rather than a <b>square</b> <b>layout.</b> This helped in dispensing with the long side arms. Thus, a rectangular layout with east-west length of 548 m and width of338 m was adopted.|$|R

40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{applying}} two long seine ropes and a seine net. Demersal seining relies on fish responding to the seine rope as it moves during the fishing process. The seine ropes and net are deployed in a specific pattern encircling an area on the seabed. In some variants of demersal seining the haul-in procedure includes a towing phase where the fishing vessel moves forward before starting to winch in the seine ropes. The initial seine rope encircled area, the gradual change in it during the haul-in process and the fish's reaction to the moving seine ropes {{play an important role}} in the catch performance of demersal seine fishing. The current study investigates this subject by applying computer simulation models for demersal seine fishing. The demersal seine fishing is dynamic in nature and therefore a dynamic model, SeineSolver is applied for simulating the physical behaviour of the seine ropes during the fishing process. Information about the seine rope behaviour is used as input to another simulation tool, SeineFish that predicts the catch performance of the demersal seine fishing process. SeineFish implements a simple model for how fish at the seabed reacts to an approaching seine rope. Here, the SeineSolver and SeineFish tools are applied to investigate catching performance for a Norwegian demersal seine fishery targeting cod (Gadus morhua) in the coastal zone. The effect <b>of</b> seine rope <b>layout</b> pattern and the duration of the towing phase are investigated. Among the four different layout patterns investigated, the <b>square</b> <b>layout</b> pattern was predicted to perform best; catching 69 %- 86 % more fish than would be obtained with the rectangular <b>layout</b> pattern. Inclusion <b>of</b> a towing phase in the fishing process was found to increase the catch performance for all layout patterns. For the <b>square</b> <b>layout</b> pattern, inclusion <b>of</b> a towing phase of 15 or 35 minutes increased the catch performance by respectively 37 % and 48 % compared to fishing without a towing phase. These results highlights the importance of the selected seine rope layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase when fishermen try to maximize the catch performance of their fishery. To our knowledge this is the first time the combination of models for the physical behaviour of seine ropes and for fish behaviour in response to seine rope movements have been applied to predict catch performance for demersal seining...|$|R
