40|$|In this thesis, CO 2 {{injection}} in matrix/fracture {{systems has}} been studied using a finely-gridded compositional simulator representing a single matrix block. Three laboratory experiments were modeled to investigate whether CO 2 injection in a fracture-matrix system could be simulated using commercial simulators that include basic fluid flow physics, phase behavior, and molecular diffusion. The first experiment was performed by Karimaie (2007) using an equilibrium, saturated gas-oil fluid system (C 1 -n-C 7) at 220 bar and 85 oC. Because no recovery was expected from non-equilibrium thermodynamic mass transfer, reported recovery stemmed only from Darcy displacement driven by gravity and capillary forces. When the oil production stopped from the equilibrium gas displacement, a second injection period with pure CO 2 followed. The numerical modeling was conducted using a compositional reservoir simulator (SENSOR) without diffusion. The 2 -dimensional r-z model used fine grids for the core matrix and surrounding fracture. Automated history matching {{was used to determine}} parameters which were not accurately known (fracture permeability, fracture and matrix porosity, and separator conditions), using surface volumetric oil production rates reported experimentally. The final model match was relatively unique {{with a high degree of}} confidence in final model parameters. The oil recovery improved significantly with CO 2 injection. Our model indicated that the recovery mechanism in the Karimaie experiment was dominated, for both equilibrium gas and CO 2 injection, by top-to-bottom Darcy displacement caused by low conductivity in the artificial fracture; little impact of capillary-gravity displacement was found. Changes in CO 2 injection rate had a significant impact on recovery performance. This experiment was also modeled using ECL 300, with the same production performance as SENSOR for the set of history-match parameters determined without diffusion. When molecular diffusion was used in ECL 300, results were nearly identical with those found without diffusion. Two other experiments were performed by Darvish (2007) at a higher temperature and pressure (130 oC and 300 bara) using a similar chalk and live reservoir oil. A similar modeling approach to that described above was also used for these experiments. In both experiments, the matching process based on reported oil production data gave a high degree of confidence in the model. The reported experimental mass fractions of produced-stream components were also matched well. Our modeling study indicates that gravity drainage affects the displacement process, but that mass transfer – including vaporization, condensation and molecular diffusion – also impact the recovery performance of CO 2 injection in the Darvish experiments. The CO 2 injection rate and initial water saturation were investigated by comparing the two Darvish experiments. Our studies from all of the Karimaie and Darvish experiments show a strong influence of the <b>surface</b> <b>separator</b> temperature on surface oil production, and this is an important consideration in designing and interpreting laboratory production data consistently. Once the laboratory recovery mechanisms had been successfully modeled, predictive numerical simulation studies were conducted on field-scale matrix/fractured systems, albeit mostly for single matrix blocks surrounded by a fracture. The effects of several key parameters on recovery production performance were studied in detail for field-scale systems: matrix permeability, matrix block size, matrix-matrix capillary continuity (stacked blocks), and the use of mixtures containing CO 2 and hydrocarbon gas. The field-scale results were affected by gridding, so grid was refined to the degree necessary to achieve a more-or-less converged solution – i. e. recovery production performance didn’t change with further refinement. We studied the effect of molecular diffusion on oil recovery by CO 2 injection in laboratory experiments and field-scale systems. Because the fluid systems considered had complex phase behavior and a wide range of conditions from strongly immiscible to near-miscible, the diffusion driving potential used was total component potential including chemical and gravity effects; concentrationdriven diffusion did not represent the more-complex non-equilibrium CO 2 injection processes observed in the laboratory tests. A key result of this study was that diffusion can have an important effect on oil recovery, and that this effect varies with matrix block size and CO 2 injection rate. We have shown that diffusion has a dominant effect on the recovery mechanism in experimental tests, except at very low rates of CO 2 injection (and equilibrium hydrocarbon gas injection). For the field-scale matrix/fracture systems, diffusion can have a significant effect on the rate of recovery, with the effect becoming noticeable for low reservoir pressures and/or matrix block sizes less than ~ 40 ft.

40|$|Monitoring {{changes with}} {{time of the}} {{isotopes}} of water (18 O and D) in wellhead fluids is an effective way of indicating reservoir changes and processes. Because 18 O concentrations in water are altered by high-temperature exchange with rock oxygen and because both 18 O and D are fractionated in vapor-liquid separation processes at the <b>surface</b> (<b>separators</b> and cooling towers), these isotopes are excellent indicators of inflow and distribution of fluids from outside the reservoir, either natural or injected. Studies of the isotopic compositions of fluids from the Cerro Prieto field in Baja California, Mexico show that pressure drawdown in the major β (beta) reservoir has caused intense boiling followed by inflow of water from outside the reservoir.

40|$|AbstractEquilibrium ratios play a {{fundamental}} role {{in understanding the}} phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures. They are important in predicting compositional changes under varying temperatures and pressures in the reservoirs, <b>surface</b> <b>separators,</b> and production and transportation facilities. In particular, they are critical for reliable and successful compositional reservoir simulation. Several techniques are available in the literature to estimate the K-values. This paper presents a new model for predicting K values with genetic programming (GP). The new model is applied to multicomponent mixtures. In this paper, 732 high-pressure K-values obtained from PVT analysis of 17 crude oil and gas samples from a number of petroleum reservoirs in Arabian Gulf are used. Constant Volume Depletion (CVD) and Differential Liberation (DL) were conducted for these samples. Material balance techniques were used to extract the K-values of crude oil and gas components from the constant volume depletion and differential liberation tests for the oil and gas samples, respectively. These K-values were then used to build the model using the Discipulus software, a commercial Genetic Programming system, and the results of K-values were compared with the values obtained from published correlations. Comparisons of results show that the currently published correlations give poor estimates of K-values for all components, while the proposed new model improved significantly the average absolute deviation error for all components. The average absolute error between experimental and predicted K-values for the new model was 4. 355 % compared to 20. 5 % for the Almehaideb correlation, 76. 1 % for the Whitson and Torp correlation, 84. 27 % for the Wilson correlation, and 105. 8 for the McWilliams correlation...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing the {{electrolyte}} wetting of <b>separators</b> by <b>surface</b> modification is {{very critical}} to prepare high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Herein, {{we present a}} new approach named hyperthermal hydrogen induced cross-linking (HHIC) technology to increase the electrolyte-affinity of polypropylene (PP) separators by covalently cross-linking {{a thin layer of}} poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) on surface-inert PP separators. With the HHIC treatment, the polar functionalities of PEO (e. g. –OH, C–O–C) can be preserved through selective cleavage of C–H bonds and subsequent cross-linking of resulting carbon radicals generated on PEO and PP chains. As proved by solvent rinsing tests, contact angle measurements and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a PEO coating was found firmly fixed on the <b>separator</b> <b>surface,</b> which results in significantly improved wetting with the electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements on subsequent lithium-ion batteries with the modified separator by HHIC treatment exhibit a lower internal resistance but higher capacity retention when compared to the pristine separator. HHIC treatment is concluded to be a highly efficient and environmental-friendly approach for <b>separator</b> <b>surface</b> modification without need for other chemical additives (e. g. chemical cross-linkers, initiators, and catalysts) and can preserve the desired macroscopic material properties of separators such as pore structures and mechanical strength...|$|R

Those previous results together with the ones presented here definitely show that with this ILs electrolyte mixture, the use of mesoporous carbon electrodes is recommended, {{because of the high}} viscosity and the low conductivity of such kind of electrolytes. Furthermore, an excellent affinity is also obtained thanks to hydrophobic nature of those two compounds, namely the carbon and the IL mixture. Thus, these results definitely confirm that best performances can be achieved when electrolyte and electrode fit perfectly each other (chemically and physically speaking).|$|R
30|$|After {{comprehensive}} considerations, {{in order}} to realize the high performance of Li/S batteries, a novel interlayer composed of polypyrrole (PPy) and ZnO nanoparticle has been fabricated. The cross-linked PPy nanofibers formed a three-dimensional hierarchical network structure in the composite which was uniformly coated by ZnO nanoparticles. We hypothesized that the interlayer with special morphology would provide both the chemical and physical restraints to hinder the diffusion of polysulfides and protect the active material to suppress “shuttle effect.” The combination of PPy and ZnO not only enhances {{the ability of the}} interlayer to capture polysulfide but also avoids the defect of poor conductivity of the ZnO-only interlayer. Moreover, such a 3 D structure can offer better electronic pathways and reduce the electrochemical polarization. To prove the effectiveness of such an interlayer in enhancing the performance of Li/S batteries, we uniformly coated PPy/ZnO composite onto the <b>surface</b> of a <b>separator</b> as an interlayer.|$|R

The transport behavior of liquid water inside the porous separator was also investigated using another cell for the direct observation of the porous cross-section. Because of the higher contact resistance, the cell voltage with porous separator is lower than that with serpentine separator, but a stable operation can be maintained with the porous separator under conditions at higher current density and lower stoichiometric ratio of cathode gas. The cross-sectional observation showed that the porous separator is superior in the drainage performance from the surface of gas diffusion layer, and the hydrophilic property of porous separator is important for the better cell performance...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent well {{systems are}} {{installed}} in production or injection wells, to increase {{the total amount of}} produced hydrocarbons. An intelligent well system has the advantages of being able to set different choke openings, using hydraulic operated sleeves to regulate the flow of produced or injected fluids. The procedure of operating the choke from surface without the use of any intervention work, is both economical and less time consuming. Combining the efficiency of intelligent well systems and down hole monitoring systems, such as pressure and temperature gauges, allows for production optimisation. If the down hole monitoring system also is fitted with a multiphase flow meter, <b>surface</b> test <b>separators</b> could be unnecessary. Multilateral wells are used to reach several pay zones, either within the same reservoir or in different smaller reservoirs. A multilateral well is a single bore well, at the surface, with one or several branches going out from the main bore. This method of drilling is economical and less time consuming. The equipment costs are lower, due to the need for only one wellhead, less casing costs, lower rig charge etc. Seeing as one only have to drill one main bore, as opposed to drilling separate wells where all wells must be drilled from the seabed, the method is also time saving. Combining these two solutions, the well will produce from several zones in different reservoirs into one main bore. The production can be controlled and regulated for each zone continuously. This thesis will describe the equipment used in a combined intelligent well and multilateral solution...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{advanced}} {{coal cleaning}} processes {{have been developed}} {{in recent years that}} are capable of substantially reducing both ash- and sulfur-forming minerals from coal. However, most of the processes involve fine grinding and use water as the cleaning medium; therefore, the clean coal products must be dewatered before they can be transported and burned. Unfortunately, dewatering fine coal is costly, which makes it difficult to deploy advanced coal cleaning processes for commercial applications. As a means of avoiding problems associated with the fine coal dewatering, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) developed a dry coal cleaning process in which mineral matter is separated from coal without using water. In this process, pulverized coal is subjected to triboelectrification before being placed in an electric field for electrostatic separation. The triboelectrification is accomplished by passing a pulverized coal through an in-line mixer made of copper. Copper has a work function that lies between that of carbonaceous material (coal) and mineral matter. Thus, coal particles impinging on the copper wall lose electrons to the metal thereby acquiring positive charges, while mineral matter impinging on the wall gain electrons to acquire negative charges. The charged particles then pass through an electric field where they are separated according to their charges into two or more products depending on the configuration of the separator. The results obtained at NETL showed that it is capable of removing more than 90 % of the pyritic sulfur and 70 % of the ash-forming minerals from a number of eastern U. S. coals. However, the BTU recoveries were less than desirable. The laboratory-scale batch triboelectrostatic separator (TES) used by NETL relied on adhering charged particles on parallel electrode surfaces and scraping them off. Therefore, its throughput will be proportional to the electrode surface area. If this laboratory device is scaled-up as is, it would suffer from low throughput capacities and high maintenance requirements. In general, <b>surface</b> area-based <b>separators</b> (e. g., shaking tables, magnetic drum separator, electrodynamic separator, etc.) have lower throughput capacities than volume-based separators (e. g., flotation cell, dense-medium bath, cyclones, etc.) by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the electrodes of the laboratory unit need to be cleaned frequently, creating a high maintenance requirement if it is scaled-up to a commercial unit. The bench-scale continuous TES unit developed at NETL, on the other hand, separates positively and negatively charged particles by splitting the gaseous stream containing these particles in an electric field by means of a flow splitter, so that the oppositely charged particles can be directed into different compartments. This device is fundamentally different from the laboratory unit in that the former is a <b>surface</b> area-based <b>separator,</b> while the latter is a volume-based separator. The bench-scale unit is referred to as an entrained flow separator by the in-house researchers at NETL. Thus, the entrained flow TES unit is a significant improvement over the laboratory unit with regard to throughput capacity. In the present work, the entrained flow separator concept will be utilized for developing a proof-of concept (POC) separator that can be scaled-up to commercial size units. To accomplish this, it is necessary to develop a bench-scale separator that can achieve high Btu recoveries while maintaining the high degree of separation efficiencies. It is the objective of the present investigation to develop an efficient separator by studying the mechanisms of triboelectrification and investigating better ways of separating the charged particles. An important criterion for developing efficient separators is that they not only provide high separation efficiencies but also have high throughput capacities, which are essential ingredients for successful commercialization...|$|R
40|$|The work {{concerns}} the spillover hydrogen (H-so) mobility between Co 9 S 8 and MoS 2 {{and the corresponding}} synergetic effects in gas-oil hydrodesulfurization (HDS), when a solid material separates the partners, either as a powder or a monolith surface. The influences of the distance (0 - 10 mm) between Co 9 S 8 and MoS 2 {{and the nature of}} the separator (gamma-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, carbon, MgSiO 3 and two silica-aluminas) on the synergism were studied. A correlation exists between the value of the isoelectric point (IEP) of the <b>separator</b> <b>surface</b> and the enhancement of HDS activity. Inferring that the synergetic effect is due to hydrogen spillover, this shows that the IEP is an important parameter controlling spillover.

The other results confirm that the remote control model is able to explain the synergism detected in this study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The new cell design used a low-cost hydrophilic membrane to replace costly proton exchange membranes and carbon felt {{and a range of}} carbon and modified carbon anodes were investigated. The fuel for the SCMFC was brewery wastewater which was diluted with domestic wastewater and the presented microflora acts as a source of electro-active bacteria.

40|$|Context. The {{complicated}} {{distribution of}} magnetic flux across the solar photosphere {{results in a}} complex web of coronal magnetic field structures. To understand this complexity, the magnetic skeleton of the coronal field can be calculated. The skeleton highlights the (separatrix) surfaces that divide the field into topologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar surface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections with other separatrix <b>surfaces</b> (i. e., <b>separators)</b> are important likely energy release sites. Aims. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field topologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation.

Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and SOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the potential-field source-surface model.

The main building blocks which make up magnetic fields are identified and classified according to the nature of their sep-aratrix surfaces.

40|$|The {{shuttling}} process involving lithium polysulfides {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors responsible for the degradation in capacity of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, we demonstrate a novel and simple strategy—using a bifunctional separator, prepared by spraying poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on pristine separator—to obtain long-cycle LSBs. The negatively charged SO 3 – groups present in PSS act as an electrostatic shield for soluble lithium polysulfides through mutual coulombic repulsion, whereas PEDOT provides chemical interactions with insoluble polysulfides (Li 2 S, Li 2 S 2). The dual shielding effect can provide an efficient protection from the shuttling phenomenon by confining lithium polysulfides to the cathode side of the battery. Moreover, coating with PEDOT:PSS transforms the <b>surface</b> of the <b>separator</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thereby improving the electrochemical performance. We observed an ultralow decay of 0. 0364 % per cycle when we ran the battery for 1000 cycles at 0. 25 C—far superior to that of the pristine separator and one of the lowest recorded values reported at a low current density. We examined the versatility of our separator by preparing a flexible battery that functioned well under various stress conditions; it displayed flawless performance. Accordingly, this economical and simple strategy appears to be an ideal platform for commercialization of LSBs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{accepted}} now that flare-like phenomena {{are the result}} of reconnection of topologically complex magnetic fields. Observations show that such fields are often characterized by a twisted structure. This is modeled here using a force-free flux tube whose arc-like body is embedded into an external potential magnetic field. We study how the topological structure of this configuration evolves when the flux tube emerges quasistatically from below the photosphere to a certain height in the corona, where the tube becomes unstable and its eruption has to occur. During this evolution below the flux tube there appears a separator field line, along which two separatrix <b>surfaces</b> intersect. This <b>separator</b> is of generalized type because there are no magnetic nulls in the configuration. Both the separator and the separatrices are topological features, where the connectivity of magnetic field lines suffers a jump. We propose that the eruption of the flux tube has to stimulate the formation of strong current layers, in which the free magnetic energy of configuration is released {{in the form of a}} flare. The model predicts the formation of hot loops of two kinds during the reconnection phase: the long loops which make nearly one turn around the twisted flux tube, and short sheared loops below. The proposed model provides important clues to the mechanism of solar flares in twisted configurations...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} that the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation fully explains membrane potential behavior. The fundamental facet of the GHK equation lies in its consideration of permeability of membrane to ions, when the membrane serves as a separator for separating two electrolytic solutions. The GHK equation describes that: variation of membrane permeability to ion in accordance with ion species results in the variation of the membrane potential. However, nonzero potential was observed even across the impermeable membrane (or separator) separating two electrolytic solutions. It {{gave rise to a}} question concerning the validity of the GHK equation for explaining the membrane potential generation. In this work, an alternative theory was proposed. It is the adsorption theory. The adsorption theory attributes the membrane potential generation to the ion adsorption onto the membrane (or <b>separator)</b> <b>surface</b> not to the ion passage through the membrane (or separator). The computationally obtained potential behavior based on the adsorption theory was in good agreement with the experimentally observed potential whether the membrane (or separator) was permeable to ions or not. It was strongly speculated that the membrane potential origin could lie primarily in the ion adsorption on the membrane (or separator) rather than the membrane permeability to ions. It might be necessary to reconsider the origin of membrane potential which has been so far believed explicable by the GHK equation...|$|R

It is determined that the using of several calculated methods and models of the EIS spectra can not only diagnose the condition of the degree of discharge and temperature in the Li?S current sources, but also enables to correct the quantitative composition of the electrolyte and cathode mass. Conclusions. The paper describes the methods of calculation EIS spectra for analyzing the impact of the Li?S current sources component composition and structural characteristics on their status.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the magnetic field is often {{an important factor in}} many energetic processes in the solar corona. To determine the topology of the magnetic field features such as null points, separatrix <b>surfaces,</b> and <b>separators</b> must be found. It has been found that these features may be preferred sites for the formation of current sheets associated with the accumulation of free magnetic energy. Over the last decade, it also became clear that the geometrical analogs of the separatrices, the so-called quasi separatrix layers, have similar properties. This thesis has the aim of investigating these properties and to find correlations between these quantities. Our goal is to determine the relation between the geometrical features associated with the QSLs and with current structures, sites of reconnection and topological features. With these aims we conduct three different studies. First, we investigate a non linear force free magnetic field extrapolation from observed magnetogram data taken during a solar flare eruption concentrating our attention on two snapshots, one before the event and one after. We determine the QSLs and related structures and by considering carefully how these change between the two snapshots we are able to propose a possible scenario for how the flare occurred. In our second project we consider potential source distributions. We take different potential point source models: two four sources models already presented in the literature and a random distribution of fifteen sources. From these potential models we conduct a detailed analysis of the relationship between topological features and QSLs. It is found that the maxima of the Q-factor in the photosphere are located near and above the position of the subphotospheric null points (extending part way along their spines) and that their narrow QSLs are associated with the curves defined by the photospheric endpoints of all fan field lines that start from subphotospheric sources. Our last study investigates two different flux rope emergence simulations. In particular, we take one case with and one without an overlying magnetic field. Here, we can identify the QSLs, current, and sites of reconnection and determine the relation between them. From this work we found that not all high-Q regions are associated with current and/or reconnection and vice-versa. We also investigated the geometry of the field lines associated with high-Q regions to determine which geometrical behaviour of the magnetic field they are associated with. Those that are associated with reconnection also coincide with topological features such as separators.

In this review, the nature of the magnetic skeleton on both global and local scales, over solar cycle time scales, is explained. The behaviour of wave pulses in the vicinity of both nulls and separators is discussed and so too is the formation of current layers and reconnection at the same features. Each of these processes leads to heating of the solar atmosphere, but collectively do they provide enough heat, spread over a wide enough area, to explain the energy losses throughout the solar atmosphere? Here, we consider this question for the three different solar regions: active regions, open-field regions and the quiet Sun. We find that the heating of active regions and open-field regions is highly unlikely to be due to reconnection or wave dissipation at topological features, but it is possible that these may play a role in the heating of the quiet Sun. In active regions, the absence of a complex topology may play an important role in allowing large energies to build up and then, subsequently, be explosively released in the form of a solar flare. Additionally, knowledge of the intricate boundaries of open-field regions (which the magnetic skeleton provides) could be very important in determining the main acceleration mechanism(s) of the solar wind.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the proposed study are as follows: (1) To understand and evaluate an unusual primary oil production mechanism which results in decreasing (retrograde) oil cut (ROC) behavior as reservoir pressure declines. (2) To develop better, produced water, disposal techniques so as to minimize lifting costs, surface separation costs and water disposal costs. (3) To improve calculations of initial oil in place so as to determine the economic feasibility of completing and producing a well. (4) To optimize the location of new wells based on understanding of geological and petrophysical properties heterogeneities. (5) To evaluate various secondary recovery techniques for oil reservoirs producing from fractured formations. (6) To enhance the productivity of producing wells by using new completion techniques. These objectives are important for optimizing field performance from West Carney Field located in Lincoln County, Oklahoma. The field, which was discovered in 1980, produces from Hunton Formation in a shallow-shelf carbonate reservoir. The early development in the field was sporadic. Many of the initial wells were abandoned due to high water production and constraints in surface facilities for disposing excess produced water. The field development began in earnest in 1995 by Altex Resources. They had recognized that production from this field was only possible if large volumes of water can be disposed. Being able to dispose large amounts of water, Altex aggressively drilled several producers. With few exceptions, all these wells exhibited similar characteristics. The initial production indicated trace amount {{of oil and gas}} with mostly water as dominant phase. As the reservoir was depleted, the oil cut eventually improved, making the overall production feasible. The decreasing oil cut (ROC) behavior has not been well understood. However, the field has been subjected to intense drilling activity because of prior success of Altex Resources. In this work, we will investigate the primary production mechanism by conducting several core flood experiments. After collecting cores from representative wells, we will study the wettability of the rock and simulate the depletion behavior by mimicking such behavior under controlled lab conditions. The overall project goal would be to validate our hypothesis and to determine the best method to exploit reservoirs exhibiting ROC behavior. To that end, we will collect and analyze core samples, and run a single well tracer test during the Budget Period I. We will continue to drill vertical wells during this period. Once we understand the mechanism and are able to quantify the geological model, in Budget Period II we will drill several, additional wells. Depending on the feasibility, we will equip some of the vertical wells with downhole separator, as well as <b>surface</b> compact <b>separator.</b> This will allow us to compare the new technology with the existing one. In the Budget Period III, we will monitor the field performance and revise and refine our models to further optimize the performance...|$|R

Context. The complicated distribution of magnetic flux across the solar photosphere results in a complex web of coronal magnetic field structures. To understand this complexity, the magnetic skeleton of the coronal field can be calculated. The skeleton highlights the (separatrix) surfaces that divide the field into topologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar surface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections with other separatrix <b>surfaces</b> (i. e., <b>separators)</b> are important likely energy release sites. Aims. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field topologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation. In particular, we characterise the typical global fields at solar maximum and minimum. Methods. Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and SOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the potential-field source-surface model. This allows the variations in the coronal skeleton to be studied over three solar cycles. Results. The main building blocks which make up magnetic fields are identified and classified according to the nature of their separatrix surfaces. The magnetic skeleton reveals that, at solar maximum, the global coronal field involves a multitude of topological structures at all latitudes criss-crossing throughout the atmosphere. Many open-field regions exist originating anywhere on the photosphere. At solar minimum, the coronal topology is heavily influenced by the solar magnetic dipole. A strong dipole results in a simple large-scale structure involving just two large polar open-field regions, but, at short radial distances between ± 60 ° latitude, the small-scale topology is complex. If the solar magnetic dipole if weak, as in the recent minimum, then the low-latitude quiet-sun magnetic fields may be globally significant enough to create many disconnected open-field regions between ± 60 ° latitude, in addition to the two polar open-field regions.
