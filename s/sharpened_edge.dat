25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of katana amongst samurai came about {{due to the}} changing nature of close-combat warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge</b> facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn with the edge of the blade facing down and suspended from a belt.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the middle}} Cainozoic period there have {{appeared}} various apes with many quasi-human {{attributes of the}} jaws and leg bones, {{but it is only}} as we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak of as [...] "almost human." [...] These traces are not bones but implements. In Europe, in deposits of this period, between half a million and a million years old, we find flints {45} and stones that have evidently been chipped intentionally by some handy creature desirous of hammering, scraping or fighting with the <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge.</b> These things have been called [...] "Eoliths" [...] (dawn stones). In Europe there are no bones nor other remains of the creature which made these objects, simply the objects themselves. For all the certainty we have it may have been some entirely un-human but intelligent monkey. But at Trinil in Java, in accumulations of this age, a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes, which seems to have walked erect. This creature is now called Pithecanthropus erectus, the walking ape man, and the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to, ourselves the makers of the Eoliths.|$|E

The proposed scheme <b>sharpens</b> <b>edges</b> in directions diffused from the entire spatio-spectral information available with a more precise and a more stable sharpening effect along the iterative processing. We validate our method on color images as well as on realistic simulations of dynamic PET images...|$|R

5000|$|A {{study by}} Federico Formenti of the University of Oxford {{suggests}} that the earliest ice skating happened in southern Finland more than 3,000 years ago. Originally, skates were merely sharpened, flattened bone strapped {{to the bottom of}} the foot. Skaters did not actually skate on the ice, but rather glided on top of it. True skating emerged when a steel blade with <b>sharpened</b> <b>edges</b> was used. Skates now cut into the ice instead of gliding on top of it. Adding edges to ice skates was invented by the Dutch in the 13th or 14th century. These ice skates were made of steel, with <b>sharpened</b> <b>edges</b> on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern ice skates has stayed largely the same since then. In the Netherlands, ice skating was considered proper for all classes of people, as shown in many pictures by the Old Masters.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge</b> is the inward curved, longer side of {{the blade}} - the {{opposite}} of a standard katana - making it extremely difficult to kill an opponent; it generally knocks the wielder's enemies [...] "senseless" [...] rather than killing them. The only way for the sakabatō to cut is to rotate the hilt by 180 degrees within the hand, thus holding the sword backwards. The sakabatō symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{transverse}} flute, the kaval {{is fully}} open at both ends, and {{is played by}} blowing on the <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge</b> of one end. The kaval has 8 playing holes (7 in front and 1 in the back for the thumb) and usually four more unfingered intonation holes {{near the bottom of}} the kaval. As a wooden rim-blown flute, kaval is similar to the kawala of the Arab world and ney of the Middle East.|$|E
5000|$|Hunting knives are {{traditionally}} designed for cutting rather than stabbing, and {{usually have a}} single <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge.</b> The blade is slightly curved on most models, and some hunting knives may have a blade that has both a curved portion for skinning, and a straight portion for cutting slices of meat.

50|$|The basket-hilted sword was {{generally}} in {{use as a}} military sword, {{in contrast with the}} rapier, the slim dueling sword worn with civilian dress during the same period, although each did find some use in both military and civilian contexts. A further distinction applied by arms historians and collectors is that a true broadsword possesses a double-edged blade, while similar wide-bladed swords with a single <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge</b> and a thickened back are called backswords. Various forms of basket-hilt were mounted on both broadsword and backsword blades.|$|E
50|$|A {{champagne}} sword (sabre à champagne) is {{an instrument}} specially made for sabrage. Some swords have short blades, around 30 cm long and resemble large knives, although others have longer blades. The {{side of the}} blade used should be blunt - a <b>sharpened</b> <b>edge</b> is unnecessary because in sabrage it is the impact that is important. If using a sword with a sharp blade then the flat blunt back of the blade is used. A champagne bottle can be opened with a spatula using the same method - or {{the base of a}} wine glass.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} use of laparoscopic surgery {{has resulted in a}} growing interest in use of ultrasounds. Ultrasounds do not have any known side effects, and it provides the surgeon with real-time imaging. In spite of its advantages, ultrasounds also have some disadvantages. The most obvious is that ultrasound images contain much noise. Another problem is that edges of vital organs may appear diffuse. In this thesis we will look at ways of <b>sharpening</b> <b>edges</b> by using a relatively new mathematical method called wavelet. With wavelets we analyse signals according to scale. This idea started with Fourier in the 1800 ’s, when he used sines and cosines to represent functions. After Fourier, mathematicians where led from frequency to scale analysis of functions. But {{it was not until the}} 1980 ’s that wavelets really came in to play. The work done by Ingrid Daubechies in 1990 was a milestone in the world of wavelets; she created a set of orthonormal basis functions. In this thesis our motive was to <b>sharpen</b> <b>edges</b> of blood vessels in ultrasound images. These edges may be both dark and diffuse, and our goal was to make them narrower and brighter. To find out if wavelets could be used for this purpose we developed a prototype application that implements the wavelet-based methods. With this application we performed some tests on very simple synthetic images containing edges. Our results imply that the Mexican hat wavelet is exceptionally well suited for finding and <b>sharpening</b> <b>edges.</b> We were able to “attune” the Mexican hat to the edge so that the centre of the edge became many times brighter, at the same time as the noise in the image was reduced. We were able to both located the two sides of the edge so that it could be made narrower manually, in addition to make the edge slimmer by means of wavelet transformation...|$|R

The Bulgarian kaval, a folk instrument, resembles the Turkish dilsiz folk ney. The Romanian nai is a panpipe rather than a flute, but may be related etymologically and morphologically.|$|E
