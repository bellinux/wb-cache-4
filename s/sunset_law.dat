5000|$|Just a few zamindars {{controlled}} half of {{the total}} landed property of Bengal while the colonial state was forming in the last decades of the 18th century. The colonial state viewed these princely zamindaris as potential threats {{to the security of}} the new state, because their power were so great that they could at any opportune moment combine and put the colonial state in great jeopardy. Hence it became a policy of the government to weaken these estates, if not destroy them altogether. One of the strategies to implement this design was the ruthless operation of the <b>sunset</b> <b>law</b> (law which required the lords to submit their revenues by sunset). In 1788, in her old age, Rani Bhabani transferred the zamindari to her adopted son Raja Ramkrishna, then forty years old.|$|E

5000|$|The {{practice}} of law was not formally regulated in Arizona for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the {{practice of}} law. Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized {{practice of law}} was allowed to lapse from a <b>sunset</b> <b>law</b> in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics. Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in State Bar v. Arizona Land Title & Trust Co., 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling sanctioned a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, [...] "Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in Arizona Title." ...|$|E

40|$|Congress often {{moves slowly}} to change tax and {{spending}} laws when circumstances change, {{but there are}} ways to design legislation to anticipate and prevent the tendency towards “policy drift. ” Enactment of major pieces of legislation tends to be followed by periods of legislative stasis, even when economic conditions change. Policies during the Great Recession are an example of this. The Great Recession proved significantly deeper than forecasters had predicted, when the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act was enacted, but as new information became available, Congress did little to alter the fiscal stimulus in response, other than to continue some expiring provisions. There are ways to design legislation to anticipate and prevent the tendency towards “policy drift. ” This paper identifies four mechanisms: delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies, triggers that either automatically adjust policy for changed circumstances or try to force an issue onto Congress’s agenda, expirations of legislation that <b>sunset</b> <b>laws</b> on a predetermined date, and indexing to adjust policy in discrete increments in response to changes in conditions. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but on balance, triggers that automatically adjust policy to new circumstances tend to be most effective in preventing policy drift, particularly for countercyclical policy and Social Security. When economic conditions deteriorate, triggers could be in place that would automaticall...|$|R

[...] It was Sponsored by Assembly Members Paul Tonko and Peter Rivera and passed the Assembly consecutively for 5 years. Timothy's Law {{was sent to the}} governor on December 13, 2006 who later signed it into law. A condition of Timothy's Law passing the NY State legislature was it have a 2-year sunset clause to provide for an actuarial study on the cost effectiveness (the shortest <b>sunset</b> of any <b>law</b> in NY history). Timothy's Law became effective January 1, 2007. In May, 2009, the Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department released the actuarial study on the cost effectiveness of Timothy's Law, and reported that the law had considerably increased mental health parity at a nominal cost to employers. It stated that neither consumers nor brokers viewed the mandates as a significant issue relative to cost or their overall purchasing decision.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 84 - 92) A {{little more}} than a century before thousands of young adults faced off against helmeted riot officers on the Sunset Strip our sixteenth President delivered an address about freedom and sacrifice on hallowed ground he consecrated as a spatial haven for the fallen. Lincoln???s powerful sentiment about the sacrament of space for a ???New Birth of Freedom??? was never more evident than during several weekends in November of 1966 when young adults valiantly defended their right to a strip of Los Angeles they called their own. The true measure of this thesis is to discover the value and meaning that space held for an emerging Los Angeles counterculture. The value of spatial zones to young adults during the mid-sixties is a compelling narrative that has fallen on deaf ears. Very little historical research, analysis, and meaning resonates in literature concerning Los Angeles counterculture as to spatial theory. Despite David McBride???s earnest study of the cultural implications of the Los Angeles counterculture during this period, there is virtually no research on spatial justice. It is with this purpose that I have dedicated to address the meaning space held for a growing confident Los Angeles counterculture during the musically charged years between 1965 and 1967. In order to fully appreciate how space influenced young Angelenos, the research concentrated on several unique spatial zones where the counterculture flourished. In theory without a unified cause it would have been difficult for young adults to share meaning. Therefore, it fell upon the underground press to give a voice which penetrated to the heart of their emerging vibrant and often contentious ideology. Furthermore, it was through this research that the link between racial inequities in the black community began to resonate in the struggle for hippie space along the Sunset Strip. Coupled with the growing resentment against the Vietnam War ??? the underground press galvanized and empowered countless young Angelenos. In effect, the Los Angeles Free Press secured a space for young adults to further their bohemian cause during the mid-sixties. Another powerful spatial zone that emerged to unify the LA counterculture were the hip rock clubs that brought performer and audience to new musical heights. Rock and roll took on more meaning for a vibrant LA youth community. The Beatles and Bob Dylan created a sound that cut to the heart of identity and cause for many caught under their dynamic influence. Moreover, LA clubs began to showcase a talented crop of local performers like The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and Love who changed the entire dimension of live performance for their fans along the Sunset Strip. The powerful synergy they created proved an undeniable formula for shared community and spatial empowerment. Yet, when established business interests saw their own bottom line threatened by the intrusion of bizarrely dressed long-haired rockers along the <b>Sunset</b> Strip, curfew <b>laws</b> were enforced and spatial lines were drawn. The Sunset Strip Riots revealed how far young Angelenos would go to preserve their spatial relationships they cherished. The rapid growth in their collective identity to preserve and defend their musically bound zones was clear to all who witnessed the three weekends of strife along the Sunset Strip. Finally, the research delved into the unique characteristics of local canyon bohemian communities which revitalized the young corps after being harassed by law enforcement and an establishment unwilling to understand them. This flourishing canyon lifestyle reinforced their natural inclination for free love and psychedelic pursuits through higher consciousness. However, through my research it was discovered that the ideals so sought for came at a dear price for many who became reckless and abusive with drugs and violent inclinations. Nevertheless, 1967 was a year of Be-ins, flower power and the sounds of Sergeant Pepper???s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Of relevance to this project was an event that recently occurred in the land that was once our sworn enemy ??? Russia. An all female punk band named ???Pussy Riot??? were being harassed by local Moscow authorities for singing sacrilegious songs against the Russian Orthodox Church. A church the band believed was intent on suppressing Russian women???s rights. When the band infiltrated the revered Cathedral of Christ the Savior and played an impromptu gig several of the band members were arrested on charges of ???hooliganism. ??? Facing years of imprisonment for merely appropriating the pulpit for rock rather than religion the story sent shockwaves across the world. The valiant young female rockers risked much just to play their guitars for spatial justice on sacred grounds they saw as their rightful place to dissent. Spatial empowerment is a righteous entity, indeed, comrade...|$|R
