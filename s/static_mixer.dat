The <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.|$|E

This study focuses on the emulsification of a silicon oil-in-water system stabilized by a surfactant through SMX+ ® <b>static</b> <b>mixers</b> involving no mass transfer between the two phases.

5000|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers are supplied in {{a variety}} of containers, from tubes to 55 gallon drums. Because of their viscous nature, these liquids are pumped at high pressures (500 - 5000 psi) based on the durometer of the material.

Regardless the extensive research {{efforts on the}} development of new catalyst supports or <b>static</b> <b>mixers</b> with low-pressure drop, the industrial application of such structures is limited to differently shaped extrudates only, especially honeycombs. However, particularly structured components made of ceramics could be advantageous in many applications, especially catalyst supports or <b>static</b> <b>mixers</b> and in small-scale decentralized plants, that have gained increasing interest in recent years, e. g. for energy generation or chemical syntheses.

The Fraunhofer IKTS uses the lithography-based ceramic manufacturing (LCM) technology for the development of modified honeycombs with wall openings between and spoilers inside the different channels to combine enhanced mass transfer and low-pressure drop. In addition, channels with varying diameters can be realized. In this context, the application of simulation tools (multiphysics Computational Fluid Dynamic codes) and computer aided engineering is of high interest.

50|$|In a {{continuous}} reactor, {{the product is}} continuously pumped through the reactor. This pump {{can also be used}} to promote mixing. If the fluid velocity is sufficiently high, turbulent flow conditions exist (which promotes mixing). The disadvantage with this approach is that it leads to long reactors with high pressure drops and high minimum flow rates. This is particularly true where the reaction is slow or the product has high viscosity.This problem can be reduced with the use of static mixers. Static mixers are baffles in the flow channel which are used to promote mixing. They are able to work with or without turbulent conditions. Static mixers can be effective but still require relatively long flow channels and generate relatively high pressure drops.The oscillatory baffled reactor is specialised form of <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> where the direction of process flow is cycled. This permits static mixing with low net flow through the reactor. This has the benefit of allowing the reactor to be kept comparatively short.|$|E
50|$|The first {{method is}} the foam process or angel food cake method. The egg whites are whipped until a foam is formed before any other {{ingredients}} are added. This method {{ensures that the}} foam is not disturbed when it is being formed and that {{the maximum number of}} bubbles stay intact. Another method is called the meringue process. This entails whipping all or most of the ingredients together at the same time. This may result in a lower quality foam and a final cake with a reduced volume. The last method is call the continuous process and is usually used in commercial bakeries because it creates a consistent product in large volumes. Ingredients are fed into the continuous mixer in either one or two stages. A one-stage process mixes all of the ingredients together and feeds them into an emulsion head. Upon entry into the emulsion head, air is incorporated, fully mixing the batter. In a two-stage process, the ingredients are blended separately in different tanks according to the recipe. The speed of the mixer is controlled, as well as air flow to help mix the batter. The final batter may then go through a <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> (a pipe with a spiral blade inside) to be deposited in a tube pan, depositor, or hopper.|$|E

40|$|Mixing {{of fluids}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} industrial operations. Static mixers, also known as motionless mixers, are very efficient devices used for mixing of both single phase and multiphase fluids. With a gradual increase in the usage of static mixers in various industrial operations, it is necessary to achieve higher mixing efficiency at the cost of minimum energy consumption. Mixing performance can be improved either by designing new internal geometry or by modifying an existing <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> geometry. The objective of this research is to improve the mixing performance of static mixers by incorporating design modifications to the internal geometry. For that purpose, a <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> with an open blade internal structure (such as SMX) was selected because of its complexed geometry and industrially proven mixing abilities. As a part of design modifications in the SMX mixer, perforations of varying sizes and different shapes of serrations were introduced to the <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> blades using AutoCAD software. These modified <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> geometries include perforated SMX with 2 holes of D/ 20 size on each blade, perforated SMX with 4 holes of D/ 20 size on each blade, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 20 holes, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 30 holes, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 40 holes, SMX with circular serrations, SMX with triangular serrations and lastly SMX with square shaped serrations. In order to select the best modified <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> in terms of mixing performance, CFD simulations are performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software and the mixing performance of each modified <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> geometry was compared with the standard SMX mixer. The mixing performance of each <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> was compared on the basis of dispersive mixing and distributive mixing parameters. For laminar flow regime and incompressible fluid, simulation results for all the static mixers are first characterized in terms of pressure and velocity field, which showed good agreement with the literature data. For the comparison of dispersive mixing, shear rates and extensional efficiency of each <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> is compared with that of a standard SMX mixer. Further, binary cluster particle tracer is injected in the flow domain to compute the distributive mixing capacity of static mixers. Distributive mixing of each mixer is quantified in terms of standard deviation. Based on the comparison of the simulation results for the dispersive and distributive mixing, the most efficient <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> is targeted for its use in polymerization processes. Synthesis of polyacrylamide using a <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> is explored in this research work. SMX mixer and the most efficient modified <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> based on the overall mixing performance are chosen to carry out the homopolymerization of acrylamide using CFD simulations.
