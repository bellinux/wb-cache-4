This model allows rather good predictions of experimental data. The French pavement design method consists in a pavement mechanistic analysis based on the Burmister multilayer elastic model (1943) -LCPC Software ALIZE (1982) -. In that model the Huet-Sayegh behaviour is taken into account with its equivalent elastic modulus at the 15 °C French average temperature and a 10 Hz frequency. That frequency value {{is assumed to be}} equivalent to the standard 72 km/h French vehicle speed. Such semi-analytical calculations provide relatively good stress and strain fields for heavy traffic pavements but it is less satisfactory for flexible pavements with low traffic, for high temperature gradients and for the analysis of damages under slow heavy loads. Therefore the complete visco-elastic behaviour of each asphalt pavement layers has to be taken into account. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a thermo-visco-elastic multi-layer model using the Huet-Sayegh behaviour. By means of the Fast Fourier transform method, the equations of the model are solved in the coordinate system of the moving load. Results are successfully compared with an analytical solution, finite element results and accelerated pavement testing data. A software called ViscoRoute (i. e. ViscoRoad) based on this modelling has been developed. The second part of this work deals with the relevance of the assumption on the time-frequency equivalence of the French design method...|$|R

The present article suggests that while the technology variable has a determining effect on organizational life in the long run, in the short term these effects are inhibited by individual, organizational and cultural factors. In the long run, present computer technology suggests that organizations will be more flexible, less standardized and that they will require more involvement from personnel. In an information rich environment, organic forms of management (Burns and Stalker) and networks (Donald Schon) will replace mechanical and bureaucratic styles of management. These long term trends seem to raise questions about the future of middle management and labor unions. The traditional role of transmitting orders downward and information upward, inherent in middle management, will be superseded by management information Systems. As the organizational pyramid will flatten, individual middle managers will either be promoted or demoted. In expanding organizations, middle managers will have better chances of being promoted than demoted. In the case of labour unions, a renewed importance of employee involvement and participation and a decreased importance of standardized categories of workers will combine to weaken the relevance of collective bargaining. However these are long term trends. In the short run, individual, organizational and cultural factors will prevent these long term trends to have their full impact. On an individual level, persons who enjoy routine and repetitive work might be unconfortable with future technological trends that will require a fuller understanding of organizational data. On an organizational level, the shortcomings of computer specialists will prevent organizations form benefiting fully from technological possibilities. On a cultural level, cultures that have traditionally stressed centralization and standardization will experience difficulties in adapting to the more flexible management processes required by more sophisticated technologies...|$|R
40|$|En utilisant les données de P.  DEMANGEON (1959), les {{connaissances}} acquises sur le métamorphisme de la Montagne Noire et nos propres résultats, ce travail met en évidence les variations des spectres minéralogiques dans la sédimentation néogène du piémont languedocien avant de les expliquer par l'érosion et la tectonique. Les rapports entre les aplanissements et les accumulations sédimentaires sont analysés. La sédimentation fine du bassin de Cruzy-Montouliers témoigne d'une morphogenèse calme favorable au façonnement d'un vaste aplanissement miocène bien conservé à Villespassans. La crise messinienne et un soulèvement du socle accompagné de déformations <b>souples,</b> à la charnière mio-pliocène, expliquent l'arrivée massive de staurotide dans la sédimentation du piémont. A half-century {{after the}} P.  DEMANGEON thesis (1959) and despite numerous researches concerning the southern Central Massif, {{there are no}} certitudes about the chronology of the erosion surfaces and the uplift stages of the Massif Central. The use of P.  DEMANGEON data, advances in the Montagne Noire metamorphism (M.  DEMANGE, 1998) and our own results allows us to record mineralogical variations in the Neogene Languedocian piedmont (Tab.  I, Fig.   3), then to explain them by erosion and tectonics in the Orb basin. A north-south cross-section in the Saint-Chinianais is used to analyse relationships between erosion surfaces and piedmont deposits (Fig.   1, 4, 5). A sharp change in the heavy minerals composition occurs between Miocene and Pliocene: tourmaline which dominated during the Miocene is replaced by staurolite during the Pliocene (Fig.   3). The figure  2 shows that this massive arrival of staurolite takes place when erosion reaches the X  14 and X  15 micaschists which are thrusted by the Cambro-Ordovician Avant-Monts. The fine sedimentation in the Cruzy-Montouliers basin shows that a low morphogenesis occurred from the Burdigalian to the Tortonian and was favourable to the elaboration of the Villespassans erosion surface. The Messinian regression of the Mediterranean Sea caused a deep valley incision up to Cessenon for the Orb River and to Montouliers for the Cesse tributary. However, an uplift of the basement with gentle distortions in the Languedocian piedmont seems necessary to explain the upstream erosion in the X micaschists. The Villespassans surface was distorted while the lower Fontcaude surface was not affected. These Mio-Pliocene tectonic movements are responsible of the size increase and of the mineralogical change in the Pliocene deposits...|$|R

G--, sir, I never could help laughing when I think how the scoundrel redcoats must have been bumbazed; for the mist being, as I said, thick, they had little notion, I take it, that they {{were on the verge of}} such a dilemma. I was half way down--for rowing is faster wark than rinning--ere they could get at their arms; and then it was flash, flash, flash--rap, rap, rap--from the edge of the road; but my head was too jumbled to think anything either of that or the hard knocks I got among the stones. I kept my senses thegither, whilk has been thought wonderful by all that ever saw the place; and I helped myself with my hands as gallantly as I could, and to the bottom I came. There I lay for half a moment; but the thoughts of a gallows is worth all the salts and scent-bottles in the world for bringing a man to himself. Up I sprang, like a four-year-auld colt. All the hills were spinning round with me, like so many great big humming-tops. But there was nae time to think of that neither; more especially as the mist had risen a little with the firing. I could see the villains, like sae mony craws on the edge of the brae; and I reckon that they saw me; for some of the loons were beginning to crawl down the hill, but liker auld wives in their red cloaks, coming frae a field preaching, than such a <b>souple</b> lad as I was. Accordingly, they soon began to stop and load their pieces. Good-e'en to you, gentlemen, thought I, if that is to be the gate of it. If you have any further word with me, you maun come as far as Carriefraw-gauns.

He is surrounded by fine old traditions, religious, social, architectural, culi- nary; and he may have the satisfaction of feeling that he is French to the core. No part of his admirable country is more characteristically national. Normandy is Normandy, Burgundy is Burgundy, Provence is Pro- vence; but Touraine is essentially France. It is the land of Rabelais, of Descartes, of Balzac, of good books and good company, as well as good dinners and good houses. George Sand has somewhere a charm- ing passage about the mildness, the convenient quality, of the physical conditions of central France, - [...] "son climat <b>souple</b> et chaud, ses pluies abondantes et courtes." [...] In the autumn of 1882 the rains perhaps were less short than abundant; but when the days were fine it was impossible that anything in the way of weather could be more charming. The vineyards and orchards looked rich in the fresh, gay light; cultivation was everywhere, but everywhere it seemed to be easy. There was no visible poverty; thrift and success pre- sented themselves as matters of good taste. The white caps of the women glittered in the sunshire, and their well-made sabots clicked cheerfully on the hard, clean roads. Touraine is a land of old chateaux, - a gallery of architectural specimens and of large hereditary pro- perties. The peasantry have less of the luxury of ownership than in most other parts of France; though they have enough of it to give them quite their share of that shrewdly conservative look which, in the little, chaffering, place of the market-town, the stranger ob- serves so often in the wrinkled brown masks that sur- mount the agricultural blouse. This is, moreover, the heart of the old French monarchy; and as that monarchy was splendid and picturesque, a reflection of the splen- dor still glitters in the current of the Loire. Some of the most striking events of French history have occurred on the banks of that river, and the soil it waters bloomed for a while with the flowering of the Renais- sance. The Loire gives a great [...] "style" [...] to a landscape of which the features are not, as the phrase is, promi- nent, and carries the eye to distances even more poetic than the green horizons of Touraine. It is a very fit- ful stream, and is sometimes observed to run thin and expose all the crudities of its channel, - a great defect certainly in a river which is so much depended upon to give an air to the places it waters. But I speak of it as I saw it last; full, tranquil, powerful, bending in large slow curves, and sending back half the light of the sky. Nothing can be finer than the view of its course which you get from the battlements and ter- races of Amboise. As I looked down on it from that elevation one lovely Sunday morning, through a mild glitter of autumn sunshine, it seemed the very model of a generous, beneficent stream. The most charming part of Tours is naturally the shaded quay that over- looks it, and looks across too at the friendly faubourg of Saint Symphorien and at the terraced heights which rise above this. Indeed, throughout Touraine, it is half the charm of the Loire that you can travel beside it. The great dike which protects it, or, protects the country from it, from Blois to Angers, is an admirable road; and on the other side, as well, the highway con- stantly keeps it company.
