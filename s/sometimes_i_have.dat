Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, captain, I have drove many {{a bargain}} in my time, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been paid in money, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been paid in promises; now the last are what I call {{pinching}} food." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe in}} you. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{thought that you}} believe in me, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> feared that you do not. I think that you are good, and honest, and true; and {{therefore}} I like to see your face and hear your voice,--though it is not often that you say very pleasant things to me." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{many months}} I {{travelled}} with this ever-darkening cloud upon my mind. Some blind reasons that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> for not returning home--reasons then struggling within me, vainly, for more distinct expression--kept {{me on my}} pilgrimage. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> proceeded restlessly from place to place, stopping nowhere; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lingered long in one spot. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had no purpose, no sustaining soul within me, anywhere.|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m afraid {{an account}} of all my shifts and adventures would be monotonous. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two or three hundred dollars in hand, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing but a suit of shabby clothes; but when things were at the worst some new chance always turned up, and I wandered about the Pacific slope until I fell in with Clay again.” ...|$|R
60|$|EGYPT. I {{used to feel}} that, when <b>I</b> was queen: <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to carve}} gods, for company, all over my palace. <b>I</b> would fain <b>have</b> seen real ones, if I could.|$|R
60|$|I {{have lived}} much among the Western {{mountain}} men. I have studied their problems; differed {{with some of}} them, and worked with many of them. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> won, but every time the fight was worth while. I {{have come out of}} it all with a respect and liking for the West which will last as long as I do.|$|E
6000|$|... "George," [...] {{said his}} uncle, [...] "I wonder whether you {{really care about}} money? <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> almost thought that you don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dog yourself," [...] was the prompt retort. [...] "Opportunity {{is a fine}} thing. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a gruesome}} fear that Sarah does not {{altogether}} trust me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{what people}} say--but <b>I</b> don't know. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no right to}} any part of it. You have to earn what you own, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Uncertain--but soon, I suppose. Edward, you see, can do {{anything}} pretty nearly, and yet can't get a straightforward living. <b>I</b> wish <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> kept him here, and let professions go. But {{he was such a}} one for the pencil.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a {{companion}} in my fishing, who {{came through the}} village to my house {{from the other side}} of the town, and the catching of the dinner was as much a social exercise as the eating of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, dearest friend, do {{you know}} {{anything}} about it? that is the very question I want to ask you. Do you know anything about it? <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought you knew nothing. And then <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought, been bold enough to think--" [...] And Sir Lionel looked intently at the handkerchief which covered her face; and Miss Todd looked furtively, ever and anon, at Sir Lionel. [...] "I declare I think it would do very well," [...] said Miss Todd to herself good-naturedly.|$|E
6000|$|Again {{there was}} a silence, and again it was broken by Miss Baker. [...] "I wonder whether you ever really loved him? <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought you never did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of it, Betty, only <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{thought that}} the {{distance}} was scarcely wide enough," [...] answered Margaret, and left the subject, for {{she was thinking of}} other things.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very interesting, all this," [...] said Johnson, folding up {{the half}} {{sheet of paper}} and {{unfolding}} it. [...] "I wish <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a business of my own instead of a fixed salary. You'll have to keep books of course." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was killing}} work. We had to rest every few steps. Often we would fall. Jim laughed, Jones swore, and <b>I</b> groaned. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to drop my things {{to help my}} companions. So we toiled wearily up the loose, steep way.|$|R
3000|$|I shouldn’t {{always be}} only an English teacher, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be a friend, a counselor, a conductor… {{touching}} their lives, so {{the duty of}} a teacher is very heavy however {{it does not seem}} to be. (Interview 20, February 12, 2015) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "Dane {{has always}} {{suspected}} me. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wondered whether he hadn't the truth {{at the back}} of his head. You can make me safe forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear Caroline," [...] said Sir Lionel; [...] "of course I can {{say nothing}} till I have heard {{more of the}} matter. But do you think Caroline really loves him? <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{hitherto}} meddled with {{no party}} in the state," [...] said Henry, [...] "but have remained quietly at home; and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had serious thoughts of joining one of our foreign regiments." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will now}} {{say a few}} words {{concerning}} Miss Bertha Nugent. She was a lady whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known well in New York, and who, for more than a year, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> loved well, although I never told her so. Whether or not she suspected my passion was a question about which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never been able to satisfy myself. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> one opinion; <b>sometimes</b> another. Before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken any steps to assure myself positively in regard to this point, Miss Nugent went abroad with a party of friends, and for eight months <b>I</b> <b>had</b> neither seen nor heard from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{imagine what}} it is! These two years that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been here <b>I</b> <b>have</b> passed hours--hours! One gets used to things, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got used to this. But {{there are some things}} that are always {{beginning}} over again. For example, my coffee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't it funny?" [...] she said. [...] "I mostly {{lets them}} run {{the length of}} their tether but <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>has</b> to pull them up, and then I does it with a jerk. Now, {{you can take your}} time about dressing, my dears, and I'll go down and keep them in order, the mean scalawags." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he spoke}} with the {{authority}} of the priest," [...] said the old minister. [...] "His Church alone of all the Protestant Churches has preserved that to its ministers. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{thought it was a great}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't feel it {{as others}} would. I didn't myself. Even at present I {{may be said}} to be living on charity. But <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> fancied that in Mr. Morton's case there might be peculiarly {{mitigating}} circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{understanding}} {{have you}} acquired, Freydisa? For instance, does it {{tell you that}} our gods of wood and stone are true gods which rule the world? Or are they but wood and stone, as <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] said Freddie dreamily, [...] "I wish I {{were engaged}} to be married. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some sweet girl {{to watch over}} me and.... No, I don't, by Jove. It would give me the utter pip! Is Sir Derek up yet, Barker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just like them. Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{got into}} a fairy tale. Everything is so {{beautiful}} and so bewildering, and unlike what I fancied.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What strange little creatures!" [...] she murmured. [...] "You {{seem to find}} {{quite a lot of}} time to {{read and}} do other things beside fish, Mr. Andrew," [...] she remarked, as she looked over his bookcases. [...] "You puzzle me very much <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no idea," [...] she added, looking at him hesitatingly, [...] "that people who have to work, as you have to, for a living, {{understood}} and read books like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|Inquiry. But yet I {{must tell}} you, now you {{put me in}} mind of it, surely <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> most horrible blasphemous {{thoughts}} in me against God, Christ, and the Spirit. May not these be that sin I trow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's true, sir. Sometimes since Lizzie {{was left}} free by father's death, I {{have thought that}} such a young woman might soon acquire {{more than enough to}} pass muster. And <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> even thought that perhaps Miss Peecher--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} a rumour," [...] she said slowly; [...] "there has been a word spoken here and there about you. I've had my doubts <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> them again every time you speak. Are you really Everard Dominey?" ...|$|E
60|$|It is not Oscar's fault, if I am out {{of spirits}} {{every now and}} then. It is my own fault. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{offended}} my father; and <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> fear <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not acted justly towards Madame Pratolungo. These things vex me.|$|R
6000|$|... 106. While this temptation lasted, {{which was}} about a year, I could attend upon none of the {{ordinances}} of God but with sore and great affliction. Yea, then was I most distressed with blasphemies; if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been hearing the Word, then uncleanness, blasphemies, and despair would hold me as captive there; if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been reading, then, <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sudden thoughts to question all <b>I</b> read; <b>sometimes,</b> again, my mind would be so strangely snatched away, and possessed with other things, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> neither known, nor regarded, nor remembered {{so much as the}} sentence that but now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> read.|$|R
