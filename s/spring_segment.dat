40|$|International audienceKarst {{aquifers}} {{display a}} range of geologic and geomorphic characteristics {{in a wide range}} of climatic and land-use settings; identification of transport dynamics representative of karst aquifers in general could help advance our understanding of these complex systems. To this end, nutrient, turbidity, and major ion dynamics in response to storms were compared at multiple sites in two karst aquifers with contrasting characteristics and settings: the Chalk aquifer (Eure Department, Normandy, France) and the Barton <b>Springs</b> <b>segment</b> of the Edwards Aquifer (Texas, U. S. A.). The Chalk aquifer is typified by high matrix porosity, thick surficial deposits (up to 30 m thick), and agricultural land use; the Barton <b>Springs</b> <b>segment</b> is typified by low matrix porosity, outcropping limestone, and urban land use. Following one to three storms, from 5 to 16 samples from springs and wells were analyzed for major ions, and specific conductance and turbidity were monitored continuously. Comparison of the chemographs indicated some generalized responses, including an increase in turbidity and potassium concentrations and a decrease in major ion and nitrate concentrations with infiltrating storm runoff. Factor analysis of major ions and turbidity revealed strikingly similar behavior of the chemical variables for the two aquifers: The first two factors, explaining more than 75 % of the variability, illustrate that dynamics of most major ions (including nitrate) are opposed to those of turbidity and of potassium. The results demonstrate that potassium and nitrate are effective tracers of infiltrating storm runoff and resident ground water, respectively, and the similar results for these two highly contrasting aquifers suggest that the dynamics identified might be applicable to karst systems in general...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany karst {{regions are}} {{undergoing}} {{rapid population growth}} and expansion of urban land accompanied by increases in wastewater generation and changing patterns of nitrate (NO 3 ‚àí) loading to surface and groundwater. We investigate variability and sources of NO 3 ‚àí in a regional karst aquifer system, the Edwards aquifer of central Texas. Samples from streams recharging the aquifer, groundwater wells, and springs were collected during 2008 ‚Äì 12 from the Barton Springs and San Antonio segments of the Edwards aquifer and analyzed for nitrogen (N) species concentrations and NO 3 ‚àí stable isotopes (Œ¥ 15 N and Œ¥ 18 O). These data were augmented by historical data collected from 1937 to 2007. NO 3 ‚àí concentrations and discharge data indicate that short-term variability (days to months) in groundwater NO 3 ‚àí concentrations in the Barton <b>Springs</b> <b>segment</b> is controlled by occurrence of individual storms and multi-annual wet-dry cycles, whereas the lack of short-term variability in groundwater in the San Antonio segment indicates the dominance of transport along regional flow paths. In both segments, longer-term increases (years to decades) in NO 3 ‚àí concentrations cannot be attributed to hydrologic conditions; rather, isotopic ratios and land-use change indicate that septic systems and land application of treated wastewater might {{be the source of}} increased loading of NO 3 ‚àí. These results highlight the vulnerability of karst aquifers to NO 3 ‚àí contamination from urban wastewater. An analysis of N-species loading in recharge and discharge for the Barton <b>Springs</b> <b>segment</b> during 2008 ‚Äì 10 indicates an overall mass balance in total N, but recharge contains higher concentrations of organic N and lower concentrations of NO 3 ‚àí than does discharge, consistent with nitrification of organic N within the aquifer and consumption of dissolved oxygen. This study demonstrates that subaqueous nitrification of organic N in the aquifer, as opposed to in soils, might be a previously unrecognized source of NO 3 ‚àí to karst groundwater or other oxic groundwater systems...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the current research {{is to develop a}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to investigate rigid and flexible aerofoil propulsive characteristics when the aerofoil IS subjected to oscillatory flapping motions. The study is also extended to rectangular wings. Flows past the flapping aero foils at moderate Reynolds numbers are simulated using the twodimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model is incorporated to determine eddy viscosity for higher Reynolds numbers turbulent flow simulations. Flows past flapping wings are simulated using strip theory, which computes the flows in multiple two-dimensional planes located at intervals along the wing span. The flows are assumed locally. two-dimensional and the three-dimensional effects between each section are incorporated via the consideration of vortex lattice effects. The simulations are modelled using piecewise linear finite element approximation method on an unstructured triangular finite element mesh. A dynamic moving mesh is used to compute flexible aerofoils and wings. The mesh is remeshed at each fluid time step using the <b>spring</b> <b>segment</b> analogy method. A novel treatment of the near. -wall viscous grids ensures that the good orthogonal properties are maintained to facilitate the turbulence computations. A wide range of simulations is carried out for an oscillatory heaving NACA 0012 aerofoil.

MethodsThe study was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal trial conducted at 38 sites. Enrollment occurred between December 2003 and June 2005. Standard follow-up interval examinations were prescribed at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. These endovascular results were compared with retrospective open surgical data from three centers of excellence. ResultsThe Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial enrolled 195 patients, and 189 were identified as retrospective open surgical subjects. Compared with the open surgery group, the VALOR test group had similar age and sex distributions, but had a smaller TAA size. Patients received a mean number of 2. 7 ¬± 1. 3 stent graft components. The diameters of 25 % of the proximal stent graft components implanted were 40 mm. Left subclavian artery revascularization was performed before the initial stent graft procedure in 5. 2 % of patients. Iliac conduits were used in 21. 1 % of patients. In 33. 5 % of patients, the bare <b>spring</b> <b>segment</b> of the most proximally implanted device was in zones 1 or 2 of the aortic arch. In 194 patients (99. 5 %), vessel access and stent graft deployment were successful at the intended site. The 30 -day VALOR results included perioperative mortality, 2. 1 %; major adverse advents, 41 %; incidence of paraplegia, 1. 5 %; paraparesis, 7. 2 %; and stroke, 3. 6 %. The 12 -month VALOR results included all-cause mortality, 16. 1 %; aneurysm-related mortality, 3. 1 %; conversion to open surgery, 0. 5 %; target aneurysm rupture, 0. 5 %; stent graft migration > 10 mm, 3. 9 %; endoleak (12. 2 %), stent graft patency, 100 %; stable or decreasing aneurysm diameter, 91. 5 %; and loss of stent graft integrity, four patients. No deployment-related events or perforation of the aorta by a graft component occurred. The Talent Thoracic Stent Graft showed statistically superior performance with respect to acute procedural outcomes (P <. 001), 30 -day major adverse events (41 % vs 84. 4 %, P <. 001), perioperative mortality (2 % vs 8 %, P <. 01), and 12 -month aneurysm-related mortality (3. 1 % vs 11. 6 %, P <. 002) vs open surgery. ConclusionsThe pivotal VALOR 12 -month trial results demonstrate that the Medtronic Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System is a safe and effective endovascular therapy {{as an alternative to}} open surgery in patients with TAA who were considered candidates for open surgical repair...|$|E

40|$|The area {{contributing}} recharge to Barton Springs {{is undergoing}} rapid growth, accompanied by increased generation of wastewater. This {{study found that}} nitrate, {{a major component of}} wastewater and a nutrient that can degrade water quality, has increased in Barton Springs and the creeks that provide its recharge. Key Findings Nitrate concentrations in Barton Springs and the five streams that provide most of its recharge were much higher during 2008 ‚Äì 10 than before 2008. Biogenic nitrogen (nitrogen from human or animal waste, or both) is a probable source of nitrate measured in the recharging streams during 2008 ‚Äì 10. Septic systems and land-applied treated wastewater effluent are likely sources contributing nitrate to the recharging streams. The area providing most of the recharge to Barton Springs has undergone rapid development since 2000 (upper left), with an associated increase in the generation of wastewater.

ET is the largest component of a precipitation water balance and can be measured within 5 % using an eddy covariance system with Bowen-ratio energy balance corrections. Water balance components of precipitation, evapotranspiration, internal runoff, soil moisture were measured using a eddy co-variance system, tipping bucket and visual rain gauges, flumes, and soil-moisture sensors. The re-search site was located within a 0. 19 -km 2 (46 -acre) internal drainage sinkhole basin where runoff never flows beyond the basin, but potentially reaches a cave serving as a drain to the sinkhole.

40|$|Geochemical {{variability}} of karst spring flow {{has been shown}} to be closely linked to storm events (for example, Andrews and others, 1984; Ryan and Meiman, 1996; Personn√© and others, 1998; Vesper and White, 2004; Mahler and Massei, 2007). Less attention, however, has been paid to the relation between focused recharge and spring geochemistry under base-flow conditions. The Barton <b>Springs</b> <b>segment</b> of the Edwards aquifer, Austin, Texas, is well situated for studying this relation: An estimated 85 percent of aquifer recharge occurs as focused recharge through the beds of six ephemeral creeks, and an estimated 90 percent of aquifer discharge occurs at Barton Springs (Slade and others, 1986). Concentrations of major ions, nutrients, soluble pesticides, and volatile organic compounds were measured at Main Barton Spring at two or three week intervals from 2003 through 2005 (Mahler and others, 2006). The relations between estimated recharge rate through creek beds and concentrations of major ions, nutrients, the pesticide atrazine, and the volatile organic compound tetrachloroethene in spring flow were investigated. Recharge rate was inversely correlated with concentrations of some constituents and contaminants, including sodium, chloride, and nitrate. This indicates that concentrations of these compounds are higher in water stored in the aquifer than in focused recharge, which dilutes them as it mixes with water alread...|$|R

40|$|Contaminants in {{surface water}} {{entering}} karst aquifers in focused recharge can be transported rapidly {{through the system}} to discharge at springs. Such contaminants act as anthropogenic tracers of ground-water transport; analysis of their breakthrough curves as they discharge from springs allows identification and apportionment of contaminant sources, and can provide insight into aquifer structure and function. At Barton Springs, the principal outlet for the Barton <b>Springs</b> <b>segment</b> of the Edwards aquifer, near Austin, Texas, breakthrough curves for several anthropogenic and natural tracers have been analyzed. The proportion of discharge composed of recent recharge is determined with a mixing model for oxygen- 18 : following rainfall, an initial increase in discharge related to pressure transfer is clearly seen, followed by a further increase consisting of an increasing proportion of recently recharged water, which reaches a maximum about 48 hours after rainfall. First appearance of contaminants varies from less than 20 to more than 40 hours after rainfall, depending on the contaminant, aquifer conditions, and location of contaminant source. Decomposition of breakthrough curves of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds at the different spring orifices indicates the existence and approximate location of multiple conduit flow routes, contaminant times of travel, and probable contaminant sources. Differences in breakthrough curve shape and magnitude indicate urban runoff, contaminant spills, and infiltration through the soil zone as sources of different contaminants.
