5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream <b>storage</b> <b>{{reservoir}}</b> by USBR, the reservoir floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water {{collected}} is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir</b> in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{shores of}} the seas and <b>storage</b> <b>reservoirs</b> {{are in the same}} {{property}} of the state, as its subsoil, forests, water resources. The urgency of coastal protection against the abrasion especially increased in recent decades (in connection with the construction of new ports, coastal cities, energetic and chemical objects, and rapid development of the resort construction). The protection of the municipal coastal areas is more important, safety of human habitation is often dependent on this. Thus, measures against abrasion are no less important than the protection of land from erosion, and <b>storage</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and rivers from pollution. The paper is based on a research of the negative factors associated with abrasion, and selection of bank protection structure type of the <b>storage</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Selected structure should allow to provide the necessary protection of reservoir's banks from the wave destruction, both urban conglomerate parcels and agricultural, for example on the Kuibyshev reservoir...|$|R
25|$|The Puyallup River and {{its main}} tributary, the White River, have been {{subjected}} to major modifications during the 20th century. The Puyallup River between Sumner and its mouth at Tacoma was straightened. A diversion dam was built at Game Farm Park in 1914 to prevent the White River from flowing on its natural course into the Green River at Auburn; since then it has flowed into the Puyallup River instead of the Green River. Flood protection structures were built along many rivers in the basin, including extensive levees. A flood <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir,</b> Mud Mountain Lake, was created on the White River with the construction of Mud Mountain Dam. As part of the flood control efforts, river channels and embankments have been generally kept clear of debris such as gravel bars, large trees, logjams, and other woody debris. These modifications have radically altered the natural character of the rivers. River widths have been generally reduced. Water now fills nearly all of the land between river banks, instead of the historic pattern of braided meanders and wetlands.|$|E

While Carlingford was still distinctly rural, technological {{change in the}} district continued with the laying of reticulated water mains from 1908, establishment of the Pennant Hills Wireless Telegraphy Station (1912, first radio tower demolished 1959; second radio tower opened 1935 and demolished 1981), metropolitan water <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir</b> on Mobbs Hill (1916, 1934 and 1970), extension of telephone lines, arrival of electric power (1922), the transition from horse drawn road transport to motorised, the sealing of district roads and eventually sewrage. A sign of progress and modernity was the installation of a public drinking water fountain {{in the middle of}} the road at Mobbs Hill in 1911 and removed in 1929 as it had become a hazard to the increased volume of motorised traffic. A Mechanics' Institute and Memorial Hall, designed by Sydney architect and Carlingford resident Lord Livingstone Ramsay, was opened at Mobbs Hill in 1924 (demolished 1987) and was the centre of many social events, political rallies, fetes and school activities.|$|E
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir</b> below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of an methodology to screen and rank Dutch reservoirs suitable for longterm large scale CO 2 storage. The screening is focused on off- and on-shore individual aquifers, gas and oil fields. In total 177 <b>storage</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have been taken into consideration (139 gas fields, 4 oil fields and 34 aquifers, with a total storage potential of about 3200 Mt CO 2). These reservoirs have been selected from over five hundred potentially suitable CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The total number of <b>storage</b> <b>reservoirs</b> has been reduced by applying preconditions with associated threshold values. Nevertheless, the number of reservoirs is still significant and limits the possibility to use any pair-wise comparison method (e. g. Multi-Criteria programs such as Bosda or Naiade). Therefore, a excel tool has been developed based on linear aggregation. The tool screens the reservoirs based on three criteria: storage potentials, costs and effort needed to manage risk...|$|R

500|$|The [...] "Waterworks Act" [...] of 1856 {{was passed}} to enable damming of the {{upstream}} Torrens for water supply purposes. The resulting [...] "Water Commission" [...] arranged {{the following year}} for foundations to be laid for a water supply weir [...] from Adelaide near Campbelltown. Unsuitable geology and shoddy work by contractors Frost & Watson led to it being washed away in July 1858 and the site abandoned. Engineer Hamilton was replaced by John England. Government then created a Waterworks Department, which started construction of a weir [...] {{from the city and}} reservoir at Thorndon Park in 1859. The weir was completed on 4 June 1860 and the reservoir began supplying piped water in December. Engineer England was found by a Select Committee to have overpaid the contractors and forced to resign. The water was captured at the weir, piped for storage to the Thorndon Park Reservoir then to a water tower at Kent Town. Water from Kent Town storage was distributed via a manually controlled water system, unmetered for its first six years. Within six years 20,000 citizens in Adelaide and Port Adelaide were connected to reticulated water from the Torrens.
