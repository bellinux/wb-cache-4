5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the <b>sloshing</b> back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's {{rotation}} on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E

Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil <b>sloshing</b> from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E

The SPSA method is used to optimize the PID parameters such that the liquid <b>slosh</b> is minimized. In order to validate our modelfree design, a liquid <b>slosh</b> model is considered to represent the lateral <b>slosh</b> motion.

40|$|The Miles {{equation}} {{has long}} been used to predict <b>slosh</b> damping in liquid propellant tanks due to ring baffles. The original work by Miles identifies defined limits to its range of application. Recent evaluations of the Space Launch System identified that the Core Stage baffle designs resulted in violating {{the limits of the}} application of the Miles equation. This paper describes the work conducted by NASA/MSFC to develop methods to predict <b>slosh</b> damping from ring baffles for conditions for which Miles equation is not applicable. For asymptotically small <b>slosh</b> amplitudes or conversely large baffle widths, an asymptotic expression for <b>slosh</b> damping was developed and calibrated using historical experimental sub-scale <b>slosh</b> damping data. For the parameter space that lies between region of applicability of the asymptotic expression and the Miles equation, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of <b>slosh</b> damping were used to develop an expression for <b>slosh</b> damping. The combined multi-regime <b>slosh</b> prediction methodology is shown to be smooth at regime boundaries and consistent with both sub-scale experimental <b>slosh</b> damping data and the results of validated Computational Fluid Dynamics predictions of <b>slosh</b> damping due to ring baffles...|$|R

Many experimental and numerical studies of water <b>slosh</b> have been conducted. However, <b>slosh</b> data for cryogenic liquids is lacking. Water and cryogenic liquid nitrogen are used in various ground-based tests with a spherical tank to characterize damping, <b>slosh</b> mode frequencies, and <b>slosh</b> forces. A single ring baffle is installed in the tank for some of the tests. Analytical models for <b>slosh</b> modes, <b>slosh</b> forces, and baffle damping are constructed based on prior work.

40|$|Liquid {{propellant}} {{makes up}} {{a significant portion}} of the total weight for large launch vehicles such as Saturn V, Space Shuttle, and the Space Launch System (SLS). Careful attention must be given to the influence of fuel <b>slosh</b> motion on the stability of the vehicle. A well-documented <b>slosh</b> danger zone occurs when the <b>slosh</b> mass is between the vehicle center of mass and the center of percussion. Passive damping via <b>slosh</b> baffle is generally required when the <b>slosh</b> mass is within this region. The pole-cart hardware system, typically used for academic purposes, has similar dynamic characteristics as an unstable launch vehicle.

25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the <b>sloshing</b> water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E

A similar 50,000 gallon (189,250 liter) tank is located in the basement for firefighting purposes.

40|$|Predicting {{the effect}} of fuel <b>slosh</b> on a {{spacecraft}} and/or launch vehicle attitude control system {{is a very important}} and a challenging task. Whether the spacecraft is under spinning or lateral moving conditions, the dynamic effect of the fuel <b>slosh</b> will help determine whether the spacecraft will remain on its chosen trajectory. There are three categories of <b>slosh</b> that can be caused by launch vehicle and/or spacecraft maneuvers when the fuel is in the presence of an acceleration field. These include bulk fluid motion, subsurface wave motion, and free surface <b>slosh.</b> Each of these <b>slosh</b> types have a periodic component that is defined by either a spinning or lateral motion. For spinning spacecraft, all three types of <b>slosh</b> can {{play a major role in}} determining stability. Bulk fluid motion and free surface <b>slosh</b> can affect the lateral <b>slosh</b> characteristics. For either condition, the possibility for an unpredicted coupled resonance between the spacecraft and its on board fuel can have mission threatening affects. This on-going research effort aims at improving the accuracy and efficiency of modeling techniques used to predict these types of lateral fluid motions. In particular, efforts will focus on analyzing the effects of viscoelastic diaphragms on <b>slosh</b> dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The <b>slosh</b> {{dynamics}} of propellant tanks {{can be represented}} by an equivalent mass-pendulum-dashpot mechanical model. The parameters of this equivalent model, identified as <b>slosh</b> mechanical model parameters, are <b>slosh</b> frequency, <b>slosh</b> mass, and pendulum hinge point location.

Lateral <b>slosh</b> testing, involving both random excitation testing and free-decay testing, are performed to validate the <b>slosh</b> mechanical model parameters and the damping added to the fluid by the anti-slosh baffles.

500|$|The {{most obvious}} effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, {{one on the}} side facing the Moon {{and the other on}} the side opposite. This results in {{elevated}} sea levels called ocean tides. As the Earth spins on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place [...] "under" [...] the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours. Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth. The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides. If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the inertia of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the <b>sloshing</b> of water between different ocean basins. As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.|$|E

2500|$|Turnagain Arm {{is one of}} {{only about}} 60 bodies of water {{worldwide}} to exhibit a tidal bore. The bore may be more than six feet high and travel at 15 miles per hour on high spring tides. Turnagain Arm sees the largest tidal range in United States, with a mean of 30 feet (9.2 m), and the fourth highest in the world, behind Bay of Fundy (11.7m), Ungava Bay (9.75m), and Bristol Channel (9.6m). The ocean's natural 12-hour 25-minute tidal cycle is close to Turnagain Arm's natural resonance frequency, which then reinforces the tide similar to water <b>sloshing</b> in a bathtub. [...] Tidal fluctuations in the main body of Cook Inlet, while not as extreme as the shallow and narrow Turnagain Arm, regularly reach [...] and exhibit currents in excess of [...] at full tidal flow.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of developing flight control systems for liquid-propelled space vehicles is ensuring stability and performance {{in the presence of}} parasitic minimally damped <b>slosh</b> dynamics in the liquid propellants. This can be especially difficult when the fundamental frequencies of the <b>slosh</b> motions are in proximity to the frequency used for vehicle control. The challenge is partially alleviated since the energy dissipation and effective damping in the <b>slosh</b> modes increases with amplitude. However, traditional launch vehicle control design methodology is performed with linearized systems using a fixed <b>slosh</b> damping corresponding to a <b>slosh</b> motion amplitude based on heritage values. This papers presents a method for performing the control design and analysis using damping at <b>slosh</b> amplitudes chosen based on the resulting limit cycle amplitude of the vehicle thrust vector system due to a control-slosh interaction under degraded phase and gain margin conditions...|$|R

For the low Bond number case, the low-g <b>slosh</b> models were also studied. Those low-g models can be used for Bond number > 10. The current low-g <b>slosh</b> models were also modified to extend their applications for the case that liquid height is smaller than the tank radius.

40|$|The liquid motion {{within a}} partly-filled tank has been {{associated}} with reduced overturning limits and braking performance of highway tank trucks. The magnitude of maneuver-induced fluid <b>slosh</b> in a partly-filled tank is strongly dependent upon baffles geometry and baffles layout, apart from many other factors. The conventional lateral baffles can effectively suppress longitudinal fluid <b>slosh</b> induced by a braking or acceleration maneuvers, while their effect on lateral <b>slosh</b> in the roll plane is negligible. Both the overturning limits and braking properties of a partly-filled tank truck could be enhanced through alternate baffles geometry and layout. This dissertation research focuses on the analysis of fluid <b>slosh</b> behavior in a partly-filled tank coupled with different designs of anti <b>slosh</b> baffles. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics <b>slosh</b> model is developed for the partly-filled cleanbore, and different designs and layouts of baffled tanks {{on the basis of the}} Navier-Stokes equations incorporating the VOF technique. The <b>slosh</b> models are formulated to investigate steady-state as well as transient forces and moments imposed on the container under longitudinal, lateral and combined longitudinal and lateral acceleration fields. A quasi-static model of the partly-filled cleanbore tank is also formulated to examine validity of the dynamic fluid <b>slosh</b> model in terms of steady-state responses. The fluid <b>slosh</b> characteristics are analyzed under different fill volumes corresponding to varying cargo load and subjected to external excitations representing steady-turning, straight-line braking and braking-in-turn maneuvers. The fluid <b>slosh</b> analyses are also carried out to explore the anti-slosh effectiveness of baffles and to evaluate the effects of baffles design factors, such as baffle curvature, orifice size and shape of the orifice. Alternate design concepts and orientations of baffles are also explored with goals of limiting both the longitudinal and lateral <b>slosh.</b> Concepts in obliquely placed baffle, partial baffles, and partial baffles arranged in an alternating pattern are proposed and analyzed for their effectiveness in limiting the fluid <b>slosh.</b> The results of the study suggest that obliquely placed baffles could help to limit lateral as well as longitudinal fluid <b>slosh</b> under lateral as well as combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration excitations...|$|R

In six cases, {{the differences between the}} <b>SLOSH</b> and HRD surface peak wind speeds were 6 % or less, but in one case (Hurricane Emily of 1993) the <b>SLOSH</b> computed peak wind speeds were 15 % less than the HRD.
