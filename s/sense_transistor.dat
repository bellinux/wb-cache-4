40|$|Most {{active pixel}} CMOS image sensors use a source {{follower}} in the pixel circuit {{as shown in}} Fig. 27. 3. 1. However, the standard 3 T pixel architecture typically has poor low-light sensitivity due to the large reset noise. 4 T pixels incorporating a pinned diode have gained popularity due to low reset noise and dark current [1, 2]. However, pinned diodes require special technology develop-ment and may compromise device yield and reduced fill factor. In this paper, a 3 T pixel image sensor with low reset noise, good fill factor, and flexible operation is described. The pixel architecture allows reset-noise reduction by negative feedback [3, 4] and increased responsivity in low-light conditions. Figure 27. 3. 2 shows the schematic of the new active pixel.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} how {{the sensitivity of}} a nanowire or nanoribbon sensor {{is influenced by the}} subthreshold slope of the <b>sensing</b> <b>transistor.</b> Polysilicon nanoribbon sensors are fabricated {{with a wide range of}} subthreshold slopes and the sensitivity is characterized using pH measurements. It is shown that there is a strong relationship between the sensitivity and the device subthreshold slope. The sensitivity is characterized using the current sensitivity per pH, which is shown to increase from 1. 2 % ph− 1 to 33. 6 % ph− 1 as the subthreshold slope improves from 6. 2 V dec− 1 to 0. 23 V dec− 1 respectively. We propose a model that relates current sensitivity per pH to the subthreshold slope of the <b>sensing</b> <b>transistor.</b> The model shows that sensitivity is determined only on the subthreshold slope of the <b>sensing</b> <b>transistor</b> and the choice of gate insulator. The model fully explains the values of current sensitivity per pH for the broad range of subthreshold slopes obtained in our fabricated nanoribbon devices. It is also able to explain values of sensitivity reported in the literature, which range from 2. 5 % pH− 1 to 650 % pH− 1 for a variety of nanoribbon and nanowire sensors. Furthermore, it shows that aggressive device scaling is not the key to high sensitivity.

The neurons are coupled to the polycrystalline silicon (PS) FG through 420 A thermal oxide in an area which is located over the thick field oxide away from the transistor. The combination of coupling area pad having a diameter of 10 or 15 mum and <b>sensing</b> <b>transistor</b> with W/L of 50 / 0. 5 mum results in capacitive coupling ratio of the neuron signal of about 0. 5 together with relatively large transistor transconductance.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{motion of}} most NEMS/MEMS devices {{has to be}} transduced to electrical domain by using active or passive components. In passive transduction, resistors, capacitors and inductors are used to sense the motional current which is then converted to voltage. In active <b>sensing,</b> <b>transistors</b> are also used for the conversion process. Since transistors can offer enhanced gain through transconductance, they can increase small signals into larger signals that can be less susceptible to systematic and innate noise sources. The active components can {{be integrated into the}} NEMS device either by monolithic integration or through a two chip solution. In monolithic integration, both the active device and the NEMS devices are fabricated on the same substrate, using short thin film interconnects, minimizing parasitics. In the two-chip solution, the active and NEMS components are fabricated on separate wafers and the individual dices are wire-bonded, or flip chip bonded which can have higher parasitics and generate mismatches in the system. One of the goals of this thesis is to monolithically integrate JFETs into N/MEMS components to enhance signal transduction. The dissertation begins with the characterization of an SOI pre-biased NEMS electrostatic switch with a pre-biased voltage of 54. 8 V and a switching voltage as low as 300 [mu]V. The contact resistance of the switch was 4. 3 MΩ due to the Si-to-Si contact used in the switch. Later, to reduce the contact resistance, MoSi 2 was used as a iv structural layer and Cr and Pt were sputtered on the switch to produce Pt-to-Pt contact. The measured contact resistance was reduced to 1 KΩ. A Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) was integrated into the switches to enable the sensing of the displacement of the moving structure. The JFETs had a pinch-off voltage of - 19 V (at VDS= 10 V) and a transconductance parameter of 1. 9 mA/V 2 (at VDS= 10 V). These JFETs were monolithically integrated into the switch to minimize parasitics. The JFET was then incorporated into a nanoscale multiple-tip prober which was used for atomic imaging of Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) as well as performing conductance measurements of HOPG. The JFET along with capacitive sensing was used to sense the motion of the movable tip. The resonating tip had a resonance frequency of 293 kHz and the tip radius of < 50 nm. Currently, commercial Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPM) such as STM and AFM use a single tip for scanning which limits its use to static electrical measurements.
