5|$|Flying Blind, Flying <b>Safe</b> <b>is</b> a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a whistleblower and was highly critical of the airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E
25|$|Use of pure oats in a {{gluten-free}} diet offers improved {{nutritional value}} {{from the rich}} content of oat protein, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and lipids, but remains controversial because {{a small proportion of}} people with celiac disease react to pure oats. Some cultivars of pure oat could be a safe part of a gluten-free diet, requiring knowledge of the oat variety used in food products for a gluten-free diet. Determining whether oat consumption is <b>safe</b> <b>is</b> critical because people with poorly controlled celiac disease may develop multiple severe health complications, including cancers.|$|E

KeePass stores usernames, passwords, and other fields, including free-form notes and file attachments, in an encrypted file. This file can be protected by a master password, key file, and/or the current Windows account details. By default, the KeePass database is stored on a local file system (as opposed to cloud storage).|$|E

500|$|Christina Del Valle {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} BusinessWeek, and wrote: [...] "Flying Blind, Flying <b>Safe</b> <b>is</b> an incisive primer on what ails the aviation industry and the feds' regulation of it". A subsequent article in BusinessWeek highlighted the book among [...] "The Best Business Books of 1997". In a review in The Washington Post, Judy Mann called the book [...] "a scathing -- and frightening -- indictment of the FAA, the multibillion-dollar airline industry and its lapdogs in Congress". James T. Yenckel of The Washington Post called the book [...] "frightening" [...] and [...] "informative", and wrote that [...] "passengers should {{have this kind of}} safety information when choosing a flight." [...] In a review for The Virginian-Pilot, Michael Anft wrote: [...] "She may be to the airplane what Ralph Nader was to the automobile." [...] Bill Wallace gave the book a favorable review in the San Francisco Chronicle, and wrote: [...] "Part memoir, part expose, her book gives an inside view of how the FAA does its job of regulating air travel -- and how it frequently fails." [...] R.J. Ignelzi gave the book a positive recommendation in a review for The San Diego Union-Tribune, and commented: [...] "Mary Schiavo's candid evaluation of the Federal Aviation Administration, airport security and air traffic controllers will give even the occasional flier some apprehension. Still, it should be read." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suzuki's {{views on}} {{the health and safety}} of genetically {{modified}} foods, or GMOs, are at odds with the scientific consensus on the subject. He has written that “products of biotechnology are being rammed into our food, onto our fields and into our medicines, without any public participation in discussions and with the complicity, indeed, the active support and funding of governments. But there are profound health, ecological and economic ramifications of this activity.” In a 1999 CP Wire article, Suzuki is quoted as saying: [...] "Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are <b>safe</b> <b>is</b> either very stupid or lying." [...] In an interview with CBC TV, Suzuki argues that the science showing GMOs are <b>safe</b> <b>is</b> [...] "very, very bad science" [...] and that the commercialization of GMOs is “driven by money.” His foundation’s website includes an “Understanding GMO” page which claims, “the safety of GMO foods is unproven and a growing body of research connects these foods with health concerns.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Some area {{residents}} suggested the crossing itself was the problem. Lance Sexton, a Manhattan resident who commutes {{to the area}} to assemble electronic equipment, described using it to The New York Times: [...] "oming down the hill of the cemetery, {{you have to put}} the brakes on earlier ... There's a bank there that always collects water, making it even more dangerous." [...] He also said he and his coworkers often complained about how quickly the train came after the gates went down, gates which had been installed after a 1984 crash killed a van driver. [...] "How <b>safe</b> <b>is</b> that crossing—for this to happen again?" [...] that victim's sister asked the newspaper. While the crossing had undergone upgrades in recent years, including brighter lights and an additional sign warning passing drivers not to stop on the tracks, in 2009 another upgrade, which would have added a sign with flashing lights [...] up the road west of the tracks was not installed. [...] "It's way too early to be guessing about what could have or couldn't have made a difference," [...] said a spokesman for the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding paper money, Nathaniel Gorham {{explained}} at the Constitutional Convention that he [...] "was for striking out" [...] {{an explicit}} power of Congress to issue paper money, but Gorham was also against [...] "inserting any prohibition." [...] That is what ultimately {{happened at the}} Convention: language explicitly giving the federal government power to issue legal tender paper money was removed on a vote of 9-2, but an option allowing the issuance together with a prohibition against making it legal tender was not acted upon. [...] Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress power to [...] "borrow money on the credit of the United States," [...] and therefore Gorham envisioned that [...] "The power , {{as far as it}} will be necessary or <b>safe,</b> <b>is</b> involved in that of borrowing." [...] The power to emit paper money (e.g. bank notes) has been justified by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause in combination with the other enumerated powers which include the power to borrow money. [...] The power to [...] "issue bills of credit" [...] is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as a prohibition on the States, and could therefore be interpreted as a power so momentous that {{it would have to be}} conferred explicitly on the federal government rather than inferred from the Necessary and Proper Clause, although it is not entirely clear whether or not the framers intended such an interpretation, nor did the Supreme Court adopt such an interpretation in the Legal Tender Cases or subsequently.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact of}} Aborigines on native species populations is {{considered}} to be less significant than that of the European settlers, [...] whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. Much of Australia's fauna is protected by legislation. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 was created to meet Australia's obligations as a signatory to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. This act protects all native fauna and provides for the identification and protection of threatened species. In each state and territory, there is statutory listing of threatened species. At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation. More broadly, a complete cataloguing of all the species within Australia has been undertaken, a key step in the conservation of Australian fauna and biodiversity. In 1973, the federal government established the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), which coordinates research in the taxonomy, identification, classification and distribution of flora and fauna. The ABRS maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna. Impacts such as the illegal setting of traps in rivers affect animals such as the Australian platypus, along with lack of awareness each year an average of 2–5 Australians lose their lives to what is presumed a safe creature. The key is understanding of Australia's diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems <b>safe</b> <b>is</b> often deadly.|$|E
