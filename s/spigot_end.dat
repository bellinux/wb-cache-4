50|$|Before 2007 it was {{questioned}} whether the Roman aqueduct at Lincoln had ever worked as {{there was no evidence}} of limescale in any of the lengths of pipe that had been uncovered. Construction on a housing estate close to the Nettleham showed that there was limescale , indicating that the aqueduct had been in use. This length of the aqueduct had ceramic pipes, joined with collared joints , but other lengths of the aqueduct had pipes which were about 7.5 inches in diameter, narrowing to 4 inches and when laid, the narrow or <b>spigot</b> <b>end</b> of the pipe fitted into the broad or socket end of the next pipe.|$|E
50|$|Cast iron {{proved to}} be a {{beneficial}} material for the manufacture of water pipes and was used as a replacement for the original elm pipelines laid in the ground earlier. These water pipelines were composed of individually cast pipe sections, often termed sticks, jointed together by a bell and spigot joint. Here one end of the pipe stick is flared, termed the bell or socket, to enable {{the opposite end of the}} next stick, the <b>spigot</b> <b>end,</b> to be inserted to create a joint. The gaps in these joints were sealed with oakum to prevents the water leaking out. A molten-lead joint was then run around the socket to ensure that the oakum seal remained in place.|$|E
40|$|Cast-iron pipes {{installed}} between 1850 and {{the early}} 1960 s in North America, United Kingdom, and European countries were produced in foundries located near growing urban centers. Their considerable weight, size (especially larger-diameter pipes), and limited transportation facilities made their handling and delivery to the installation site difficult. Historical anecdotal evidence exists to suggest that some cast-iron pipes may have been damaged during delivery. This paper examines different mechanical models to examine what specific conditions {{may have led to}} pipe damage during delivery and installation. Analyses show that if pipes did incur damage, then cracks were likely to have occurred {{on the inside of the}} pipe bell or <b>spigot</b> <b>ends.</b> Furthermore, it appears that the <b>spigot</b> <b>ends</b> of smaller-diameter pipes had higher risk of damage during delivery, whereas both bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>ends</b> faced increased risk of damage in larger-diameter pipes. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to account for uncertainties in the parameters that were used in the different models. 9 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

25|$|The final {{length is}} the {{tapering}} duct, {{the site of}} most of the fibre formation. This consists of a tapering tube with several tight about turns, a valve almost at the end (mentioned in detail at point No. 5 below) <b>ending</b> in a <b>spigot</b> from which the solid silk fibre emerges. The tube here tapers hyperbolically, therefore the unspun silk is under constant elongational shear stress, which {{is an important factor in}} fibre formation. This section of the duct is lined with cells that exchange ions, reduce the dope pH from neutral to acidic, and remove water from the fibre. Collectively, the shear stress and the ion and pH changes induce the liquid silk dope to undergo a phase transition and condense into a solid protein fibre with high molecular organisation. The <b>spigot</b> at the <b>end</b> has lips that clamp around the fibre, controlling fibre diameter and further retaining water.|$|R
40|$|Broken {{prestressing}} wire wraps are {{the main}} cause of failure in prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP). The effect of the number and location of broken wire wraps on the structural performance of PCCP is investigated using advanced numerical modeling that considers full interaction between the <b>spigot</b> and bell <b>ends</b> of adjacent pipes. The stresses and strains in the various components of PCCP are evaluated with increasing internal pressure. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how manipulating the severity of the damage through varying the number of broken wire wraps affects the internal fluid pressure that causes failure. A 244 -cm (96 -in.) embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) is modeled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 broken wire wraps. The results obtained show that the internal fluid pressure required to cause failure can be as much as 14 % lower when the damage is at the joint, and that the internal pressure that causes yielding of the wire wraps decreases approximately 65 % as the severity of the damage increases from 5 to 100 broken wires.

50|$|Manufacturing ProcessDuctile iron piles are {{manufactured}} using a centrifugal spin-casting process. After magnesium {{is added to}} the cast iron melt the molten iron is placed into the rotating mold and a pile shaft of nearly uniform thickness is formed. The <b>spigot</b> <b>end</b> is formed {{with the use of a}} sand mold. The still glowing pipe is removed from the centrifugal mold and directed to an annealing furnace for a slow and steady cooling to ensure that the tensile and elongation properties are maintained. This annealing process creates also the very thick and high corrosion protection oxyd-layer which protect the DIPs much better as normal construction steel. Once the material has properly cooled the manufactured material is sampled and tested for material properties in accordance to factory quality control procedures (ISO 9001). In addition, the wall thickness of each pile is measured at 32 different locations with ultrasonic methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the grout shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the <b>spigot</b> <b>end</b> of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical grout shoe. As the pile is driven the conical grout shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand grout that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The breaker hammer driving tool is fitted with a special grout box adapter to allow the grout to flow from the grout pump through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the grout should slightly exceed the take rate of the grout. In softer soils the grout takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the grout column.|$|E
40|$|The {{water loss}} is a {{phenomenon}} frequently observed within water distribution systems. A considerable part of water losses occurs either because of the incorrect assembly of joints or because of the fatigue and ageing of the material used to ensure a watertight seal. Moreover, such a leakage {{is very difficult to}} detect and to assess. In this work, we present a novel formulation for modelling the pressure effect on the background leakage through the joints. The proposed approach is based on the preliminary evaluation of the enlargement i i, due to pressure, of the existing space between the outer side of the <b>spigot</b> <b>end</b> of a pipe and the inner wall of the hub end of the adjacent pipe (which is characterised by the area ωatm at atmospheric pressure). Furthermore, the whole procedure is based on the evaluation, by field data or calibration, of a parameter i representing the rate of enlarged area ω that, for several reasons, may be not covered by the gasket, ω being the value, at pressure p, of the area above defined...|$|E
60|$|Macintosh Bags.--I {{would also}} {{recommend}} {{a trial of}} square bags of strong macintosh--say 18 inches deep and 10 inches square, in which case they would hold 60 lbs. of water--fitting into square compartments, in large panniers, like those in a bottle-basket. I have made some experiments upon this arrangement. The basket-work gives protection against blows and the jolting together of packages, and it yields without harm to a strain, and the bags yield also. Moreover, water is less churned in half-empty bags than in half-empty barrels. No unusual strength of materials would be required in making these bags: their mouths should be funnel-shaped, and corked at {{the neck of the}} funnel. The funnels should be wide at their mouths, for convenience in filling them; and a string to secure the cork should be tied round the neck of the funnel. The bags should have loops on their sides, through which a strap, passing underneath, might run, in order to Give a good hold for lifting them up. They could easily be filled as they lay in their compartments, and would only require to be lifted out in order to empty them; there is, therefore, no objection to their holding as much as 60 lbs. weight of water. An india-rubber tube as a siphon, and with a common <b>spigot</b> at the <b>end</b> of it, would be particularly useful. A pannier not much exceeding 30 inches long, by 20 broad, and 18 deep, would hold six of these bags, or 360 lbs. weight of water in all; and two such panniers would be ample for exploring purposes. I had a pannier and two bags made for a trial, which were quite satisfactory, and I found that the weight of the panniers and bags together was at the rate of 6 lbs. for each compartment; therefore the weight of these water-vessels is not more than 10 per cent. Of that of the water which they carry. It might be well to vary the contents of some of the compartments; putting, for instance, two or even three small bags into one, and tin cases into a few of the others, instead of the large bags. These panniers, with the bags inflated, and connected together by a stage, would form an excellent and powerful raft. If secured within a wagon about to cross a deep river, they would have enough power, in all ordinary cases, to cause it to float and not to sink to the bottom. I trust some explorer will try this plan. I may add that the macintosh water-bags cost me about 1 pound each.|$|R
