5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both <b>set</b> <b>equal</b> to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been <b>set</b> <b>equal</b> to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E
5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was <b>set</b> <b>equal</b> to that of gold.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} part, {{consider}} a shortest path P (there {{may be more}} than one) from source to u with at most i edges. Let v be the last vertex before u on this path. Then, the part of the path from source to v is a shortest path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, since if it were not, then there must be some strictly shorter path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, and we could then append the edge uv to this path to obtain a path with at most i edges that is strictly shorter than P -- a contradiction. By inductive assumption, v.distance after i−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from source to v. Therefore, uv.weight + v.distance is at most the length of P. In the ith iteration, u.distance gets compared with uv.weight + v.distance, and is <b>set</b> <b>equal</b> to it if uv.weight + v.distance was smaller. Therefore, after i iterations, u.distance is at most the length of P, i.e., the length of the shortest path from source to u that uses at most i edges.|$|E
