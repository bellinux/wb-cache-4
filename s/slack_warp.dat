50|$|There {{are many}} things that can cause the warp threads not to {{separate}} cleanly, and thus produce a poor shed. A <b>slack</b> <b>warp,</b> threads set too closely in the reed, or increase of friction on the first foot or so of the warp where the threads were handled all cause poor sheds. Fuzzy yarns like mohair can also cause a poor shed. To get a better shed the weaver can lift the harnesses while the reed is against the fabric, or raise only one harness at a time. By weaving in a different manner sometimes a good shed can be created. The weaver can also insert a stick into the shed to clear it, and make way for the shuttle though this option is time-consuming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fabric {{reinforced}} cement composites {{are a new}} class of cementitious materials with enhanced tensile strength and ductility. The reinforcing mecha-nisms of 2 -D fabric structures in cement matrix are studied using a fabric pullout model based on nonlinear finite difference method. Three main aspects of the composite are evaluated: nonlinear bond slip charac-teristic at interface; <b>slack</b> in longitudinal <b>warp</b> yarns, and mechanical anchorage provided by cross yarn junctions. Parametric studies of these key parameters indicate that an increase in the interfacial bond strength directly increases the pullout strength. Grid structures offering mechanical anchorage at cross yarn junctions can substantially increase the pullout resistance. Pres-ence of slack in the yarn geometry causes an apparently weaker and more compliant pullout response. The model was calibrated using a variety of test data on the experimental pullout response of AR-Glass specimens, manufactured by different techniques to investigate the relative force contribution from bond at interface and from cross yarn junctions of alkaline resistant glass fabric {{reinforced cement}} composites...|$|R
