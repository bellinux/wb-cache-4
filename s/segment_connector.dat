40|$|AbstractThe {{aspect ratio}} of {{submerged}} floating tunnel (SFT), i. e. the ratio of length to diameter, is usually as large as 102 to 103, which means the behavior of SFT would like a slender cylinder restrained by tethers. Although SFT is usually placed under the water surface at a certain depth, surface wave has important influence on its dynamic response due to the slenderness. This paper performs analyses on the fluid-structure interaction of SFT in wave field. Potential fluid theory is adopted to describe the wave field. Boundary element method is used to solve the interaction between SFT and surface wave. Wave potential {{is divided into three}} parts, including incident wave potential, diffraction wave potential and radiation wave potential. SFT is discretized into finite elements and its dynamic response is finally solved in frequency domain. As a case study, the values of design parameters for SFT prototype in Qiandao Lake are adopted. Two different tunnel end connectors are used to compare the distributions of tunnel deflections, axial membrane forces at the tube <b>segment</b> <b>connectors</b> and tunnel end connectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{coronary}} stents has evolved significantly {{over the past}} two decades. However, they still face the problem of in-stent restenosis, formation of neointima within 12 months of the implant. The biological response after stent implantation depends on various factors including the stent geometry which alters the hemodynamics. This study takes five different coronary stent designs, used in clinical practice, and explores the hemodynamic differences arising due to the difference in their design. Of particular interest is the design of the <b>segments</b> (<b>connectors)</b> that connect two struts. Pulsatile blood flow analysis is performed for each stent, using 3 -D computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and various flow features viz. recirculation zones, velocity profiles, wall shear stress (WSS) patterns, and oscillatory shear indices are extracted for comparison. Vessel wall regions with abnormal flow features, particularly low, reverse, and oscillating WSS, are usually more susceptible to restenosis. Unlike previous studies, which have tried to study the effect of design parameters such as strut thickness and strut spacing on hemodynamics, this work investigates the differences in the flow arising purely due to differences in stent-shape, other parameters being similar. Two factors, the length of the connectors in the cross-flow direction and their alignment with the main flow, are found to affect the hemodynamic performance. This study also formulates a design index (varying from 18. 81 % to 24. 91 % for stents used in this study) that quantifies the flow features that could affect restenosis rates and which, in future, could be used for optimization studies...|$|R
40|$|CPC 1 is the {{transcriptional}} activator of {{amino acid}} biosynthetic genes of Neurospora crassa. CPC 1 function in vivo was abolished upon deletion of segments of cpc- 1 {{corresponding to the}} presumed transcription activation domain, the DNA-binding and dimerization domains, or a 52 -residue <b>connector</b> <b>segment</b> of CPC 1. A truncated CPC 1 polypeptide containing only the carboxy-terminal 57 -residue segment of CPC 1 was sufficient to form homodimers that bound DNA. However, deletion of the segment of cpc- 1 corresponding to the <b>connector</b> <b>segment</b> in the full-length CPC 1 polypeptide abolished DNA binding. Removal of a segment of cpc- 1 corresponding to the GIn-rich region of CPC 1 reduced in vivo function only slightly. The homologous transcription activator of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GCN 4, did not substitute for CPC 1 in N. crassa. Chimeric CPC 1 -GCN 4 polypeptides that contained the GCN 4 transcriptional activation domain or the domain of GCN 4 that corresponds to the essential 52 -residue <b>connector</b> <b>segment</b> of CPC 1, functioned with reduced efficiency. However, a chimeric polypeptide containing the GCN 4 DNA-binding and dimerization domains in place of those of CPC 1 functioned essentially as well as wild-type CPC 1. The basic and dimerization domains of CPC 1 were characterized by introducing deletions or site-directed amino acid replacements. The basic region was required for DNA binding but not for dimerization. CPC 1 has a short dimerization domain containing heptad residues Leu- 1, Leu- 2, Trp- 3, and His- 4. When Val was substituted for Leu- 1 or Leu- 2, CPC 1 was fully active, but when Val replaced Trp- 3, dimerization and DNA binding were prevented. DNA band shift analyses with CPC 1 heterodimers demonstrated that CPC 1 does not require aligned heptad leucine residues for dimerization. Replacement of two charged residues located between Leu- 1 and Leu- 2 of CPC 1 abolished dimerization and DNA binding...|$|R

Three new peptides of Mr 28 000, 48 000 and 22 000 were produced and the novel S 1 derivative formed had an intact actin-activated ATPase activity. Amino acid sequence analyses indicated that the 48 kDa and 22 kDa peptides overlap the two connector elements...|$|R

In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the Berkshire Connector to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in Schodack, and I-90 {{was assigned}} to the <b>segment</b> of the <b>Connector</b> east of the proposed freeway.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{between two}} immiscible polymers stitched together via mobile promoters is studied with large scale molecular simulations employing a coarse-grained bead-spring model. An adhesion model is presented that enables both connector molecular slipping out viscously and bulk dissipation in two dissimilar glassy polymers, {{in which one}} is dense melt and another is loose. The contributions to the separation work from thermodynamics and chain suction are studied in dependence of the connector areal density, at constant temperature, and at fixed basic molecular parameters. It is shown that high connector coverage, but below saturation areal density, can enhance the adhesion toughness and interfacial strength. Bulk dissipation is not considerable with low connector areal density in mushroom regime, while becomes more evident in the loose block when the coverage density is increased up to overlapping brush regime. With increasing connector length, both bulk melts are enhanced by the <b>segments</b> of <b>connector</b> chains that penetrated in. The results {{provide insight into the}} structure evolution of adhesion interface coupled with promoter molecular, which are useful for future developments of continuum cohesive models for fracture of polymer- polymer interfaces...|$|R
50|$|Highway 47 was {{the former}} {{designation}} for U.S. Highway 62 between Rogers and Gateway and Highway 37 between Gateway and the Missouri State Line. Running {{a distance of}} approximately 18 mi, its southern terminus was {{at the intersection of}} U.S. Route 71 (aka 8th & Walnut Streets) in Rogers then passed through the communities of Avoca and Garfield before it ended at the Missouri state line just north of Gateway. When U.S. 62 was designated in Arkansas in 1930, Highway 47 was truncated to the 1/2 mi segment from Gateway to the Missouri state line where it continued as Route 37. The brief <b>connector</b> <b>segment</b> was renumbered in January 1976 to match the Missouri designation, thus providing continuity for travelers seeking Eureka Springs.|$|R

40|$|HAMP domains are ï¿½ 50 -residue motifs, {{found in}} many {{bacterial}} signaling proteins, that consist of two amphiphilic helices joined by a nonhelical <b>connector</b> <b>segment.</b> The HAMP domain of Tsr, the serine chemoreceptor of Escherichia coli, receives transmembrane input signals from the periplasmic serine binding domain and in turn modulates output signals from the Tsr kinase control domain to elicit chemotactic responses. We created random amino acid replacements {{at each of the}} 14 connector residues of Tsr-HAMP to identify those that are critical for Tsr function. In all, we surveyed 179 connector missense mutants and identified three critical residues (G 235, L 237, and I 241) at which most replacements destroyed Tsr function and another important residue (G 245) at which most replacements impaired Tsr function. The region surrounding G 245 tolerated 1 -residue deletions and insertions of up to 10 glycines, suggesting a role as a relatively nonspecific, flexible linker. The critical connector residues are consistent with a structural model of the Tsr-HAMP domain based on the solution structure of an isolated thermophile HAMP domain (M. Hulko, F. Berndt, M. Gruber...|$|R
40|$|RfaH {{activates}} horizontally acquired operons that encode lipopolysaccharide core components, pili, toxins, and capsules. Unlike its paralog NusG, which potentiates Rho-mediated silencing, RfaH strongly inhibits Rho. RfaH is {{recruited to}} its target operons via {{a network of}} contacts with an elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) and a specific DNA element called ops to modify RNAP into a pause- and NusG-resistant state. rfaH null mutations confer hypersensitivity to antibiotics and detergents, altered susceptibility to bacteriophages, and defects in virulence. Here, we carried out a selection for suppressors that restore {{the ability of a}} Î”rfaH mutant Escherichia coli strain to grow in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. We isolated rho, rpoC, and hns suppressor mutants with changes in regions previously shown to be important for their function. In addition, we identified mutants with changes in an unstructured region that connects the primary RNA-binding and helicase domains of Rho. The connector mutants display strong defects in vivo, consistent with their ability to compensate for the loss of RfaH, and act synergistically with bicyclomycin (BCM), which has been recently shown to inhibit Rho transformation into a translocation-competent state. We hypothesize that the flexible connector permits the reorientation of Rho domains and serves as a target for factors that control the motor function of Rho allosterically. Our results, together with the existing data, support a model in which the <b>connector</b> <b>segment</b> plays a hitherto overlooked role in the regulation of Rho-dependent termination...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{roles of}} sarcomere-associated cytoskeletal lattices were investigated {{by studying the}} resting tension-sarcomere length curves of mechanically skinned rabbit psoas muscle fibers {{over a wide range}} of sarcomere strain. Correlative immunoelectron microscopy of the elastic titin filaments of the endosarcomeric lattice revealed biphasic extensibility behaviors and provided a structural interpretation of the multiphasic tension-length curves. We propose that the reversible change of contour length of the extensible segment of titin between the Z line and the end of thick filaments underlies the exponential rise of resting tension. At and beyond an elastic limit near 3. 8 microns, a portion of the anchored titin segment that adheres to thick filaments is released from the distal ends of thick filament. This increase in extensible length of titin results in a net length increase in the unstrained extensible segment, thereby lowering the stiffness of the fiber, lengthening the slack sarcomere length, and shifting the yield point in postyield sarcomeres. Thus, the titin-myosin composite filament behaves as a dual-stage molecular spring, consisting of an elastic <b>connector</b> <b>segment</b> for normal response and a longer latent segment that is recruited at and beyond the elastic limit of the sarcomere. Exosarcomeric intermediate filaments contribute to resting tension only above 4. 5 microns. We conclude that the interlinked endo- and exosarcomeric lattices are both viscoelastic force-bearing elements. These distinct cytoskeletal lattices appear to operate over two ranges of sarcomere strains and collectively enable myofibrils to respond viscoelastically over a broad range of sarcomere and fiber lengths...|$|R
30|$|Working {{under the}} initial {{hypothesis}} {{of a central}} systemic role of bridges, there {{is a challenge to}} identify similar segments in non-river cities. Since we are looking after segments of central importance to structuring the city, this does not translate easily to â€˜bottleneck segmentsâ€™. We have chosen to consider the property best corresponding to the hypothesized role of bridges to be those included in what Hillier (2009) names the foreground network; i.e. the limited number of segments that tend to have a distinctly higher centrality than the other <b>segments</b> operating as <b>connectors</b> in the cityâ€™s configuration. It is worth mentioning that the number of segments, with the highest values of choice measurement, which were cut from each river-city, {{is the same as the}} number of segments which forms the bridges in that city. Also for the non-river-cities, it is the same as the number of segments cut in the river â€“cities with the same size. Our stress on the size and number of cutting segments is to establish comparability between the effect of bridges (in wider view rivers) and the effect of the highest values of choice (in a wider view foreground network). For reasons that will become clear, we also made a sample where the method of cutting segments was exactly the same in river cities as in non-river cities. In this respect we will have two types of results from a mathematically consistent method; river-high-cut (Figs.Â  1 and 3) and non-river-high-cut (Fig.Â  2) pointing out respectively to the river-cities and non-river-cities in which the segments including the highest values of choice measurement are cut from them.|$|R
