60|$|She {{folded the}} card into her untidy bag and <b>snapped</b> the <b>catch.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{returned}} the photograph to {{her purse and}} <b>snapped</b> the <b>catch</b> with vicious emphasis.|$|R
60|$|DEARTH. <b>Snap.</b> (She <b>catches</b> the biscuit in her mouth.) Let that be {{the last}} time, Margaret.|$|R
60|$|I <b>snapped</b> the <b>catch</b> back, {{and flung}} up the sash. An icy wind {{swept into the}} room, bearing {{particles}} of snow. I scrambled on to the window-sill, and a crash from behind me told of the falling of the door.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Cold Snap", Micah outs {{himself as}} [...] "Rebel" [...] to Tracy Strauss. As Danko's agents {{close in on}} them, Tracy has Micah set off the {{sprinklers}} and buys him time to escape by unleashing her full cold snap on the agents, freezing herself in the process; Micah barely escapes as the <b>snap</b> nearly <b>catches</b> up to him.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously as the {{box-turtle}} of {{his native}} heath, the doctor drew away sideways and to the right, with {{the air of a}} frustrated burglar coming out from under a bed, and stood up free, one black diagonal shoulder projecting through the grey of his ruined overcoat. I returned the scissors to the bag, <b>snapped</b> the <b>catch,</b> and held all out to him as the wheels of the fly rang hollow under the railway arch.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{took hold}} of the latch of the door, and put it almost to, very gently. He turned the latch so as to prevent its <b>snapping</b> against the <b>catch,</b> and then pushed it {{suddenly}} into its place three or four times, opening the door only a very little way every time.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{local police}} {{lieutenant}} Toomey is {{keeping an eye}} on the mansion, believing that Snaps is meeting with Chicago mobsters soon. Also watching Snaps is mob rival Vendetti, who, too, believes that Snaps is meeting Chicago mobsters. Vendetti plans a hit on Snaps in the early afternoon while Toomey plans a raid at the same time to <b>catch</b> <b>Snaps</b> red-handed.|$|R
5000|$|During {{a police}} {{deposition}} on December 2 Frayne {{stated that the}} thread of the screw which held the spring catch was worn or torn off, and that sent the bullet below its aim. He was attempting a backward shot when the <b>catch</b> <b>snap</b> of the rifle became imperfect and slipped just as the hammer was released. Frayne'sbreast and neck were burned black by the powder emitted by the breech of the gun.|$|R
50|$|The team {{goes after}} Rodrigo {{and find out}} that he was not a real priest. Una is not daunted, and she {{responds}} by lighting a fire beneath his feet. Derek saves Rodrigo, and goes after Una. They almost kill her, but she escapes when the cord which was dragging her into the sunlight <b>snaps.</b> She <b>catches</b> Derek, but Derek then grabs what is left of the cord. Before they reach the sunlight, Derek shoots her head off with a shotgun and sends it flying into the sun, where it catches fire. Her body turns into stone with a black beating heart in the chest. Derek drives a stake into the heart. Sancho and Rodrigo decide to stay in the village, and Derek and Zoey drive away in the sunset.|$|R
2500|$|Less {{than four}} {{years had passed since}} the Progressive Conservatives won their {{landslide}} victory in 1979. [...] Premier Peter Lougheed decided to call a <b>snap</b> election to <b>catch</b> fledgling new parties off guard, most notably the separatist Western Canada Concept which was capitalizing on anger over Lougheed's perceived weakness in dealings with the federal government, in particular his acceptance of the hugely unpopular National Energy Program. [...] The WCC's Gordon Kesler had won a by-election earlier in the year, and Lougheed decided that {{it would be wise to}} stage a showdown with the WCC sooner rather than later.|$|R

5000|$|Bugs Bunny and Gossamer pass by a mirror. Gossamer {{looks into}} the mirror, then his {{reflection}} comes to life and runs away toward the door, screaming in horror. Albeit confused, Gossamer turns to the audience and shrugs. Bugs rushes up a staircase, but rushes back down and knocks down Gossamer, telling him he can't go up there because it's dark (similar to a gag from The Wabbit Who Came to Supper). Bugs acts as a lamp, then dances {{to the tune of}} Shuffle Off To Buffalo, taunting Gossamer by calling him [...] "Frankenstein!". Bugs and Gossamer keep running until a trapdoor on the floor opens, forcing Bugs to halt. While Bugs is tiptoeing backwards and praying, he bumps into Gossamer. He comes up with the idea to give him a manicure. He produces a table and a chair and starts working on Gossamer's nails while he talks and acts like a girl ("Oh, for shame! Just look at those fingernails! My, I'll bet you monsters lead in-teresting lives. I said to my girl friend just the other day, 'Gee, I'll bet monsters are in-teresting.' I said. The places you must go and the things you must see -- my stars! I bet you meet lots of in-teresting people too. I'm always in-terested in meeting in-teresting people. Now let's dip our patties in the water!") He puts the monster's fingers into a bowl of water, but it contains two mousetraps, which <b>snap</b> and <b>catch</b> his fingers, making the monster yelp in pain.|$|R
60|$|It was {{astonishing}} {{how quickly}} the cubs learned that game {{is not to be}} picked up tamely, like huckleberries, and changed their style of hunting,--creeping, instead of trotting openly so that even a porcupine must notice them, hiding behind rocks and bushes and tufts of grass till the precise moment came, and then leaping with the swoop of a goshawk on a ptarmigan. A wolf that cannot catch a grasshopper has no business hunting rabbits--this seemed to be the unconscious motive that led the old mother, every sunny afternoon, to ignore the thickets where game was hiding plentifully and take her cubs to the dry, sunny plains {{on the edge of the}} caribou barrens. There for hours at a time they hunted elusive grasshoppers, rushing helter-skelter over the dry moss, leaping up to strike at the flying game with their paws like a kitten, or <b>snapping</b> wildly to <b>catch</b> it in their mouths and coming down with a back-breaking wriggle to keep themselves from tumbling over on their heads. Then on again, with a droll expression and noses sharpened like exclamation points, to find another grasshopper.|$|R
40|$|Many elastic {{structures}} {{have two}} possible equilibrium states [1]: from umbrellas that become inverted {{in a sudden}} gust of wind, to nanoelectromechanical switches [2, 3], origami patterns [4, 5] and the hopper popper, which jumps after being turned inside-out [6]. These systems typically transition from one state to the other via a rapid ‘snap-through’. Snap-through allows plants to gradually store elastic energy, before releasing it suddenly to generate rapid motions [7, 8], as in the Venus flytrap [9]. Similarly, the beak of the hummingbird <b>snaps</b> through to <b>catch</b> insects mid-flight [10], while technological applications are increasingly exploiting snap-through instabilities [11 – 13]. In all of these scenarios, it {{is the ability to}} repeatedly generate fast motions that gives snap-through its utility. However, estimates of the speed of snap-through suggest that it should occur more quickly than is usually observed. Here, we study the dynamics of snapthrough in detail, showing that, even without dissipation, the dynamics slow down close to the snap-through transition. This is reminiscent of the slowing down observed in critical phenomena, and provides a handheld demonstration of such phenomena, as well as a new tool for tuning dynamic responses in applications of elastic bistability...|$|R
5000|$|While at Notre Dame, Leahy had six undefeated seasons, four {{national}} championship teams, and an unbeaten string of 39 games (37-0-2) {{in the late}} 1940s. He also coached four Heisman Trophy winners - Angelo Bertelli (1943), Johnny Lujack (1947), Leon Hart (1949) and Johnny Lattner (1953) - and recruited a fifth, 1956 winner, Paul Hornung. His overall record at Notre Dame was 87-11-9. Like his former coach, Knute Rockne, Leahy believed that games were won in practice and had the reputation for being relentless. It is said that Leahy's teams never had a practice without hitting and that his quarterbacks would <b>catch</b> <b>snaps</b> every practice until their hands bled. His teams were always well conditioned and Leahy was merciless {{when it came to}} the toughness of his players. In addition to his practices, Leahy coached a tough-nosed style of football during the games. Leahy's teams rarely kicked field goals when they were on the goal line because [...] "Notre Dame didn't kick field goals, Notre Dame was too tough to kick field goals." [...] This philosophy backfired against Army in 1946, when the Irish drove all the way to the Cadets' 4-yard line and turned the ball over on downs. A field goal would have won the game. Leahy always referred to his players as his [...] "lads." [...] In 1949, he wrote a book on the T-formation, Notre Dame Football: The [...] "T" [...] Formation.|$|R
