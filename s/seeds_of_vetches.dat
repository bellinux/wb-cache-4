All legumes in the mixture survived winter while legumes alone, except Hungarian vetch, did not survive in the cold areas. The maximum fresh and dry forage yields (56 and 15 ton ha- 1 respectively) were obtained from a mixture <b>of</b> smooth <b>vetch</b> and barley in provinces with mild winter and more than 400 mm of rainfall. The mixture of barley and smooth vetch resulted in the highest mean crude protein content (17 %). Autumn <b>seeding</b> <b>of</b> smooth <b>vetch</b> and barley in a 1 : 1 ratio produced more than 2 ton ha- 1 of dry biomass with good quality in all studied areas and thus could serve as an alternative cropping system after wheat/barley in cold and semi-cold dry land...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{investigated}} the effect of exogenous cyclitols on the accumulation of their galactosides and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), {{as well as on}} some enzymes important for their biosynthesis in <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> tiny <b>vetch</b> (Vicia hirsuta [L. ] S. F. Gray). Immature seeds during 6 -day incubation with D- chiro -inositol (naturally does not appear in <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> tiny <b>vetch)</b> were accumulated cyclitol and its galactosides (fagopyritols: B 1 and B 2). Short 4 -hour incubation with D- chiro -inositol, and subsequent slow desiccation process caused accumulation of free cyclitol only, without biosynthesis of its galactosides. Feeding D- chiro -inositol to pods <b>of</b> tiny <b>vetch</b> induced accumulation <b>of</b> high levels of its galactosides (fagopyritol B 1, B 2 and B 3) in maturing seeds. Similarly, feeding D-pinitol increased accumulation of its mono-, di- and tri-galactosides: GPA, GPB, DGPA and TGPA in tiny <b>vetch</b> <b>seed.</b> Accumulation <b>of</b> both cyclitols and their galactosides drastically reduced accumulation of verbascose. Inhibition of RFOs biosynthesis by elevated levels of free cyclitols suggests some competition between formation of both types of galactosides and similarity of both biosynthetic routes in tiny vetch seeds. Galactinol synthase (GolS) from tiny vetch seeds demonstrated ability to utilize D- chiro -inositol as galactosyl acceptor, instead of myo-inositol. Presence of both cyclitols, as substrates for GolS, caused synthesis of their galactosides: fagopyritol B 1 and galactinol. However, formation of galactinol was more efficient than fagopyritol B 1. D-chiro-Inositol and D-pinitol at concentrations several-fold higher than myo-inositol had inhibitory effect on GolS. Thus, we suggest that a level of free cyclitols can have an influence on the rate of galactinol biosynthesis and further accumulation of RFOs and galactosyl cyclitols in tiny vetch seeds...|$|R

Mechanical weed control is difficult in common vetch cultivation. So the weed suppressing effect of different vetch-oat-mixtures was investigated. Field trials were conducted at the Thünen-Institute of Organic Farming with the vetch cultivars Berninova, Ina, Jaga, Toplesa and Slovena in pure stands and in intercrops with oat in the years 2011 and 2012. The intercrops were sown in three different seed density ratios (75 % vetch with 25 % oat, 50 % vetch with 50 % oat, 25 % vetch with 75 % oat of the respective sole seed density). During the growing season weed biomass was harvested, once at the time of flowering <b>of</b> common <b>vetch</b> and another sample was taken at the time of harvest. The evaluation of the two-year results showed interactions between the tested cultivars and the seed density ratios as well as between cultivars and the sampling time. Weed biomass showed in the different mixtures within a cultivar in most cases comparable graduations. The highest weed biomass, with the exception of the cultivar Slovena, was determined in pure stands, the lowest one in the mixture with a share of 75 % oat. In pure stands, Toplesa showed due to their less leafy and upright growth type as well as a lower field emergence, the significantly highest weed biomass, followed by the cultivar Ina.

Nevertheless, the effects of mixing conditions of the two cover crops on biomass and nutrient productivities and on the yield characteristics of subsequent rice crops have not been well studied. To evaluate the effects of mix-seeding legume and non-legume cover crops {{on the value of}} green manure in paddy soil, barley and hairy vetch were sown at the rice harvesting stage as pure crops at the recommended rates (180 kg ha− 1 of barley, B 100; 90 kg ha− 1 <b>of</b> hairy <b>vetch,</b> V 100), and as mixtures, in which the two cover crops were mix-seeded with varying seed ratios according to the replacement principle. The mixed <b>seeding</b> <b>of</b> the two crops significantly increased the cover crop biomass and nutrient productivities compared with the single barley and hairy vetch cultivation. Biomass productivity linearly increased with increasing barley seeding level, but it was not affected by the hairy vetch seeding rate. The total N content of the barley biomass clearly increased as the proportion of the total biomass accounted for by hairy vetch was increased, and this significantly improved the value of the green manure of cover crop biomass. In contrast, the total N content <b>of</b> the hairy <b>vetch</b> biomass was not affected by changes in the barley proportion. Biomass produced in the pure barley seeding could not produce the nutrients required by the recommended chemical fertilization level (N–P 2 O 5 –K 2 O = 90 – 45 – 57 kg ha− 1) for rice, but the biomass increase caused by mixed <b>seeding</b> <b>of</b> the two cover crops resulted in enough nutrients to satisfy the recommended fertilization level. The highest biomass and nutrient yields were observed for the mixed <b>seeding</b> <b>of</b> barley and hairy vetch at 25 and 75 % (B 75 V 25) of their respective recommended seeding rates. This increased nutrient input stimulated the rice plant growth and significantly improved the rice yields. The highest yields were achieved with the B 75 V 25 treatment.

Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot wagtails (Motacillae), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds. For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces. The earth had been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the common oat, and at least one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species. With such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are annually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which annually migrate--for instance, the millions of quails across the Mediterranean--must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in dirt adhering to their feet or beaks?

A condition for an archaeological watching brief {{was placed on the}} approval and the Archaeology Unit of Southampton City Council carried out the archaeological work between January and October 2012. Post-excavation work was undertaken from October 2012 to June 2013. The earliest phase of occupation was a late Iron Age enclosure with a splayed, ditched entrance. Within the enclosure was evidence of a structure, internal ditches and pits. The ditches and pits contained pottery in sand-, flint-, grog- and organic-tempered fabrics, briquettage, daub and burnt flints. A few grains of charred wheat were recovered, together with large amounts of charcoal from oak, hazel, buckthorn, gorse, birch and lime. Radiocarbon dates of 370 - 170 BC and 390 - 200 BC were obtained from samples of roundwood charcoal. After the enclosure ditches had filled, a posthole structure of late Iron Age/early Roman date was built over the site of the splayed entrance. The postholes produced charred wheat, barley and oats, grog-tempered pottery, and a fragment of iron slag. The final phase of occupation was marked by a rectilinear field system. The fills of the ditches included sherds from Gaulish flagons and mortaria of the late 1 st century AD, together with local copies of Gallo-Belgic pottery vessels.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We explored the floral transcriptome to examine a genome-scale genetic model of the zygomorphic flower <b>of</b> <b>vetch.</b> mRNA was obtained from an equal mixture of six floral organs, leaves and roots. De novo assembly <b>of</b> the <b>vetch</b> transcriptome using Illumina paired-end technology produced 71, 553 unigenes with an average length of 511 bp.

To find the best compromise in timing between effective termination <b>of</b> <b>vetch</b> and reasonable yield of no-till sunflower, an on-farm experiment {{was carried out in}} Pisa (Italy) in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 to compare three termination techniques (roller crimper with no, half and full dose of glyphosate) and three termination dates (before flowering, beginning of flowering, 70...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen (N) is the {{nutrient}} which more frequently limits grain yield of species of poaceae family, {{such as the}} corn crop. One of the strategies to increase N availability in the soil is by using leguminous species as preceding crop. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>vetch</b> burndown as winter soil covering and herbicides types used in the burndown in corn agronomic performance grown cultivated in succession under nitrogen fertilization. Two experiments were performed during the growing seasons of 1999 / 00 and 2000 / 01, in Eldorado do Sul-RS, Brazil. In the first year, four management systems <b>of</b> common <b>vetch</b> as preceeding crop to corn cultivated under two N rates (0 and 70 kg ha- 1) were tested. The variables evaluated were type of herbicides used and timing <b>of</b> <b>vetch</b> burndown. In the second year, besides the two N rates (15 and 120 kg ha- 1), three times <b>of</b> <b>vetch</b> burndown were tested. In both years, the experimental design was of randomized complete blocks, arranged as a splitplot design, with four replications. The vetch burndown one day before corn sowing date increases corn grain yield as compared to burndown 15 days before sowing. As preceding crop, vetch does not need to be burndown with no-selective herbicides. The application of pre-emergent herbicide selective to corn crop is effective to vetch burndown. Nitrogen fertilization applied in side-dressing in corn crop increases its grain yield even when cultivated in succession to vetch...|$|R

40|$|Growing cereal-legume {{mixtures}} {{is associated}} with N transfer from the legume to the accompanying cereal and offers the potential for {{reducing the amount of}} N-fertiliser used in cereal grain production. Cereal crops grown in these mixtures tend to accumulate more protein in their grain. At the same time they extend their growing season. The traditional oat production system in Poland is based on covered oats grown with vetch on poor and damp soils. Our objective was to determine the grain yield and quality of a naked oat cultivar grown as a pure crop and with a spring vetch companion crop. The field experiment was conducted at the Czyrna Experimental Station from 1999 to 2002. The naked oat cv. Akt was sown either as a pure crop or with spring vetch determinate cv. Ina at two seed rates. The amount of rainfall over the experimental years varied from 737 to 1040 mm, corresponding with the multiannual average of 834 mm. The effect <b>of</b> graded <b>seed</b> rates <b>of</b> spring <b>vetch</b> on yield and gross chemical composition of naked oat grain (AOAC, 1995) and ?-glucans content (the Megazyme assay kit no 995. 16) were determined. The present results confirm earlier findings indicating that total yields of wheat and triticale grown with legume companion plants were decreased with decreasing cereal seeding rates (Pisulewska, 1997). Cereal grain protein content was increased with increasing <b>seeding</b> rates <b>of</b> legume companions. We confirmed the negative relationship between oat grain protein and fat content, while ash and ?-glucans were only little, although significantly affected. In conclusion, the relative changes in grain yield and quality of naked oat grown either as a pure crop or with a spring vetch companion plant, were similar to those observed for wheat and triticale.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted under irrigated {{conditions in the}} highlands of Madagascar to assess the potential of intercropping Italian ryegrass with common vetch for improving yield and quality <b>of</b> forage. <b>Seed</b> proportions studied were ryegrass-vetch 100 : 0; 0 : 100; 50 : 33; 50 : 50; 50 : 66; 75 : 33 and 75 : 66. Mixtures were sown in alternate rows and the sowing rates of pure stands <b>of</b> ryegrass and <b>vetch</b> were 20 and 60 kg per hectare, respectively. The results showed that all mixtures achieved yield advantage over pure stands with the highest land equivalent ratio value for dry matter yield obtained from the mixture of 75 : 66 (1. 47) followed by 50 : 50 (1. 35). Slight increase of crude protein content and protein digested in the small intestine when rumen-fermentable nitrogen is limiting (PDIN) content were obtained from mixtures compared with pure stand <b>of</b> ryegrass. <b>Vetch</b> rate in dry matter yield of mixtures increased with the increase <b>of</b> <b>vetch</b> <b>seed</b> proportion and ranged from 31 to 44 %. Agressivity and competitive ratio indices showed that ryegrass was slightly competitive than vetch.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} investigate the possibility <b>of</b> barley-bitter <b>vetch</b> intercropping under field conditions, based on factorial using randomized complete blocks design with three replications, at the Agricultural Research Station of Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran. Treatments were sole cropping of barley (200, 300 and 400 plants/m 2 densities), sole cropping <b>of</b> bitter <b>vetch</b> (20, 40 and 60 plants/m 2 densities) and additive intercropping based on {{combination of the two}} species. Results revealed that the effects of treatments were significant for number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> per spike, flag leaf chlorophyll, grain yield and biological yield of barley. Interaction of barley density× bitter vetch density significantly affected only grain and biological yields of barley. Maximum number of seeds/spike (22. 25) and leaf chlorophyll (43. 38 SPAD) was achieved at 200 and 400 barley plants/m 2, respectively. Also, maximum plant height (43. ‌ 8 cm) and number of seeds/spike of barley (22. 78) and minimum value of these traits (32. 9 cm and 17. 22 seeds/spike, respectively) was observed in barley sole-cropping and intercropping (adding <b>of</b> 60 bitter <b>vetch</b> seeds/m 2 to barley densities), respectively. Sole cropping of barley at 400 plants/m 2 density produced the highest grain and biological yield (288 g/m 2 and 564 g/m 2, respectively) which was not significantly different from 300 plants/m 2 treatment (260 g/m 2 and 555 g/m 2, respectively). Plant height, number of pods/plant and leaf chlorophyll <b>of</b> bitter <b>vetch</b> were significantly affected by barley densities. Maximum plant height (20 cm) and leaf chlorophyll (46. 83 SPAD) were observed at adding of 400 barley plants/m 2 to bitter vetch densities. Maximum number of pods/plant (9. 22) was in sole cropping <b>of</b> bitter <b>vetch.</b> Also, comparison <b>of</b> bitter <b>vetch</b> densities revealed that 60 plants/m 2 was superior to 20 and 40 plants/m 2 densities. Maximum land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 81) and system productivity index (SPI= 4526) were achieved at intercropping of barley and bitter <b>vetch</b> with densities <b>of</b> 300 and 20 plants/m 2, respectively. Therefore, it seems that intercropping of low density <b>of</b> bitter <b>vetch</b> (20 plants/m 2) with normal density of barley (300 plants/m 2) may give better overall yield and income than sole cropping of barley...|$|R
