5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E

S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata is one, and {{possibly}} the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea.

The perianths of T.truncata are of a single <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing the centre of the flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away.|$|E

5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only {{to adjust to the}} changes in the official rendering of the national coat of arms.

Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> red was first legally specified as vermilion by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, {{were built in}} 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an average cost of £11,641 each.
