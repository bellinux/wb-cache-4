Different from the classical method where the electrical degradation of a-Si:H/SiN TFTs is quantified by the shift of the threshold voltage {{after a period of}} stress, the authors choose to describe the degradation in terms of drain–current transients that appear during alternative periods of electrical stress. It is shown that the contributions of charge trapping and defect creation to the drain–current degradation can be discriminated based on stress time, stress voltage, and temperature. A numerical model with variable parameters is proposed to fit both short- and long-term transients. This paper shows that the long-term current degradation is related to the changes in the interface trapped charge, whereas the creation of the defects dominates the <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> degradation. ...|$|E

We use an autoregressive distributed lag model in a destination-origin panel set up. The empirical findings of this paper suggest that MPAs have a negative direct effect on tourism.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in the Transaction s of the ASAE 2002 A series of experiments were performed to measure behavioral responses and changes in blood cortisol concentration of cows exposed to 60 Hz electrical current applied from front to rear hooves. Increased activity level was not a consistent indicator of response to current, whereas a flinch or startle response was a consistent and repeatable behavioral indicator. Cows responded at lower current levels to the one-front to two-rear-hoof pathway than to muzzle to four-hooves pathway. Cortisol levels did not increase in response to <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> exposure at levels up to 1. 5 times the flinch reaction level. Cortisol concentrations were found, however, to increase in response to hoof trimming. These results indicate that behavioral changes are a more sensitive indicator of response to short-term electrical current exposure than blood cortisol levels.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intrinsic}} rate {{of population}} increase (r) {{is a common}} performance measure in many ecological and evolutionary studies. However, in life cycles with diapause investment resources are split into a <b>short-term</b> (<b>current</b> population growth) and a long-term (population survival through periods of unsuitable habitat conditions) component, which complicates the use of r as a single performance measure. Here we propose a new measure that integrates both performance components into a single parameter, the potential intrinsic growth rate, rpot. This is {{the rate of increase}} that a population/genotype would have if no investment in diapausing stages would occur. We show that rpot can be computed using standard demographic data from temporal series or life table experiments and demonstrate the use of the rpot for two common life cycles among zooplanktonic organisms: (1) a cyclically parthenogenetic life cycle where investment in diapause happens only during the sexual phase, and (2) an obligate sexual life cycle with a switch from non-investing females to investing females along the lifespan. Using case studies we show that choosing rpot or the standard r affects comparisons between genotypes/populations or environmental factors. We provide clues on how rpot can be estimated in other life cycles with diapause investment if appropriate assumptions are made...|$|E

The model, based on intertemporal optimization, emphasizes the labor-leisure choice {{and the role of}} capital accumulation There are two main conclusions to be drawn from the analysis. The first 1 s that in all cases the transitional dynamics depends critically upon the long-run response of the capital stock to the deterioration m the terms of trade. This has been shown to consist of a substitution effect, which is negative, together with an income effect, which is positive. Secondly, since the steady state equilibrium depends upon the initla 1 conditions of the economy, a temporary shock, by altering these initial conditions for some later date when the shock ceases, leads to a permanent effect on the economy. In the case where the substitution effect dominates, a deterioration in the terms of trade leads to a short-run reduction in investment and a short-run current account surplus, contrary to the Laursen-Metzler effect. However, when the long-run income effect dominates, the deterioration m the terms of trade leads to a short-run investment boom, accompanied by a <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> account deficit. The Laursen-Metzler effect prevails, although it is driven by investment, rather than by savings behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of high-resolution (30 kHz) sidescan sonar and seafloor photography {{has been used}} to image barchan dunes and sand ripples in the Faroe-Shetland Channel. The barchan dunes display body lengths and horn-to-horn widths of up to 120 m, and the horns point downcurrent to the southwest. The seafloor surrounding the dunes is variable, with gravel patches, sand with gravel streaks, and uniform rippled sand all observed. The pattern of sand ripples across the dune surface is strongly controlled by the dune morphology. On the lower stoss slopes of the dunes, straight-crested transverse ripples gradually merge upslope into sinuous-crested transverse ripples. Most of the upper dune surface is dominated by short-crested linguoid ripples. This sequence represents an increase in height above seafloor and increasing flow velocity. The overall pattern of ripples across the dune surface indicates that the bottom current flow is modified by the dune morphology, with flow concentrated over the dune crest and along the inner edge of the horns. It is also possible to estimate flow velocity across the dune field, using published analogues and <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> meter observations. Generally, published examples of submarine barchans suggest a flow velocity of 40 - 80 cm/s. This range of values is in agreement with near-bed current meter measurements in the study area, which indicate peak flow velocities of 50 - 60 cm/s. However, in the longer term higher flow speeds may be possible, especially considering the presence of erosional furrows adjacent to the dune field...|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} fiscal state {{needs to}} have two critical factors: A stable tax base and access to an efficient bond market. The Tokugawa Shogunate had a stable land tax revenue, which was inherited to modern Japan after the Meiji restoration. Taxation, however, was restricted by the constitution after the Meiji restoration. The parliament opposed to expansionary policy in the early 1890 s, and then it turned to support that at the exchange of governmental commitment to investment in social infrastructure. The government committed to investment to increase productivity, and was allowed to raise tax rate. About the bond market, at the other hand, the government had issued bonds only in the domestic market until the mid 1890 s. In the late 1890 s, after Japan joined the international gold standard, the government began to issue considerable amount of bonds, and the balance surged during the Russo-Japanese war in 1904 - 1905. Now the London market efficiently financed Japanese government. In the early 20 th century, the government was one and only one player that had established its own reputation in the international financial market. Hence balance of Japanese government bonds was the only route to import capital. This route also provided Japanese economy with macroeconomic stability, offsetting <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> account deficit by import of capital.

The aim was to investigate the mechanism of enhancement and route of skin permeation associated with each penetrant and mode of treatment. Franz cell diffusion experiments were conducted using human epidermal sheets and a saturated buffer solution (pH 7. 4) of the respective penetrant, at a pseudo-finite dose. The effects of electrode type (anodal or cathodal) and current treatment protocol (iontophoresis or post-iontophoresis) on solute permeation was found not to be significantly different (p > 0. 05). However, in contrast to BP, a significant increase in CF transport (3 ??? 5 -fold) relative to untreated skin was observed when iontophoretic/post-iontophoretic treatment protocols were employed. The use of delipidised skin was found to enhance the permeation of both model penetrants to an extent greater than iontophoresis (BP: 3 -fold; CF: 24 -fold). Results from this study suggest that the permeation of the more hydrophilic CF across the skin, unlike BP, may involve multiple pathways. Electroperturbation of the epidermis was confirmed as the mechanism responsible for enhancing CF transport when electrical current was applied. Iontophoretic and post-iontophoretic enhancement may serve as a potential approach to enhance the topical delivery of CF in cosmetic or dermatological treatments (anti-cellulite, viral infections and psoriasis) ...|$|E
40|$|Urban sprawl has {{recently}} become {{a matter of}} concern throughout Europe, but it is in southern countries where its environmental and economic impact has been most severe. This low-density, spatially expansive urban development pattern can have a highly marked impact on municipal budgets. Thus, local governments may see sprawl as a potential source of finance, in terms of building-associated revenues and increased transfers from upper tiers of government. At the same time, sprawl leads to increased levels of expenditure, as it may raise the provision costs of certain local public goods and requires greater investment in extending basic infrastructure for new urban development. What, therefore, is the net fiscal impact of urban sprawl? Do local governments consider the long-run net fiscal impact of new urban growth or do they simply focus on its short-term benefits, ignoring future development costs? This paper addresses these questions by analysing the dynamic relationship between urban sprawl and local budget variables. To do so, we estimate a panel vector autoregressive model using data for 4, 000 Spanish municipalities for the period 1994 - 2005. Computed Generalised Impulse Response Functions show: (i) that sprawl considerably increases demand for new infrastructure, (ii) that the capital deficit generated by this new infrastructure is covered in the main by intergovernmental transfers and, to a lesser extent, by revenues linked to the real estate cycle, and (iii) that sprawl leads to a <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> surplus, as the increase in current revenues offsets the increase in current expenditures due to public service provision for new developments. Overall, these findings point to a moral hazard problem for local governments in which inordinate intergovernmental transfers and development revenues encourage excessive urban sprawl.

For the success of any Tongan enterprise in New Zealand, the financial management of assets is so crucial. Thus, this research focuses only on the Working Capital Management (WCM) of Tongan SMEs in New Zealand and its direct impact on performance that is vital for business survival and sustainability. WCM deals with the administration of the businesses’ <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> assets and liabilities that is an important issue for Tongan SMEs’ financial decision making. The business financial performance is measured using working capital ratios, profitability ratios via Du Pont financial analysis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore and analyse the impact of working capital management dynamics on financial performance of Tongan SMEs in New Zealand. It also aims to explore how Tongan SMEs manage their various working capital components such as cash, inventory, account receivables, account payables, operating cycle, and credit policy management. Consequently, this develops an appropriate conceptual framework model to illustrate the impact of WCM dynamics on performance and providing some key recommendations that will improve Tongan SMEs use of working capital management. The primary data was collected from 8 Tongan enterprises and 4 business consultants in Auckland using a qualitative Pacific research method known as “Talanoa Approach (TA) ” in the form of semi-structure interviews and a focus-group. The secondary data was captured from a consecutive five years of financial statements of a selected enterprise as a case study.

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} first {{scientific}} {{portrait of the}} Baka in North-Eastern Gabon, a group of post-foragers living along the River Ivindo, {{and the way they}} practice and conceptualise mobility. The inquiry encompasses the long-term historical and the daily or <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> mobility of this group, elicited through life histories and participant observation. The central premise of this work is that mobility is relational. Relational refers to interaction of movement and fixity, of position and outcome, and to the understanding of mobility as socially produced. The second concept employed is that of motility, the capacity or potential to be mobile. As motility analyses what comes before observable movement, of potential and actualised outcome as mobility or immobility, it takes up the idea of mobility as relational. The Baka living on the Ivindo migrated from Cameroon and Congo into Gabon over the last approximately 60 years. In contrast to established approaches to forest forager mobility, which focus mainly on resource mobility during an annual cycle, this study considers the long-term and larger geographical perspective and shows that the quality of personal relations between Baka and their neighbours is decisive in mobility considerations. Previously these relations were characterised as a structural opposition between two ethnic groups. This analysis demonstrates the heterogeneity of people and their interactions, in the past and the present, to argue, firstly, that relations are more appropriately conceptualised as multilateral, and, secondly, that an inquiry remains incomplete without considering affections and emotions. A principal mobility factor for the Baka is the search for a good life, meaning economic improvement and freedom from violence. This search coincides with a diversification of Baka livelihoods to include subsistence practices as well as working in the gold sites of Gabon. Employing motility shows the aspirations and limitations of Baka personal and group mobility in gold work. Motility is also understood as ‘mobility capital’ and thereby helps document social change, and how gold work is undertaken with reference to Baka egalitarian social organisation to be successful. By including group and individual as well as different temporalities in the analysis, and detailing the impact of social values on mobilities, motility gives depth to the analysis of mobility. ...|$|E
40|$|Submarine volcaniclastic deposits, both {{modern and}} ancient, pose a {{conundrum}} in distinguishing between syn- and post-eruptive processes. High-standing, submarine volcanic edifices {{of the late}} Quaternary southern Kermadec arc (SW Pacific) are point sources of pyroclastic/hyaloclastic deposits that are bathed and modified by a complex current system of the South Pacific gyre flowing southeast along the northern margin of New Zealand, which in part comprises the anticyclonic flow of the warm-cored East Cape Eddy (ECE). Flow of the ECE across the southern Kermadec arc provides a present-day case of extensive and in situ, post-eruptive, textural modification of modern pyroclastic/hyaloclastic deposits on the crests and upper flanks of submarine stratovolcanoes. Photographic observations (and limited textural data) from seven Kermadec volcanoes reveal pervasive evidence of sediment winnowing (including crag and tail structures, scour and moating around volcanic blocks, coarse sand-granule lag deposits, epifaunal deflection, lineated mud streaking, and moulded bioturbation mounds) and asymmetric current-ripple bedforms at water-depths of at least 1500 m. All bedforms indicate increasing current speed at progressively higher elevations (decreasing water-depth) for each volcano. Current-ripples mostly have discontinuous, asymmetric, shorted-crested, linguoid–lunate forms below 1000 m water-depth, progressing to semi-continuous, asymmetric, shorted-crested, linear-sinuous forms above 500 m. Current elutriation of the Kermadec deposits progressively removes fines with decreasing water-depth resulting in relatively fines-depleted, volcaniclastic sands and granules. This post-eruptive process overprints syn-eruptive processes that notionally generate more comminuted fine-grained clasts with decreasing water-depth as phreatomagmatic explosive eruptions become more vigorous. Current-elutriation also modifies volcaniclastic detritus prior to subsequent removal by episodic, mass-gravity flow. In addition the sand-granule traction load, driven by current-flow, moves sediment nearly continuously to gully and rill heads for removal down-slope, independently of syn-eruptive sediment flux. The underlying observation is that volcaniclastic deposits rarely reflect just syn-eruptive processes, and that significant in situ current-elutriation of at the least surficial pyroclastic/hyaloclastic eruption products can occur on submarine volcanoes. Threshold current velocities, derived assuming unidirectional flow over cohesionless sand-lapilli grainsizes, and accounting for bed friction, yield current velocities (at 100 cm above the bed) of ? 15 cm s? 1 for water-depths > 1500 m through to 70 cm s? 1 for depths < 500 m at the crests of Rumble III and V volcanoes. Estimated velocities are consistent with <b>short-term</b> <b>current</b> velocities of 30 – 40 cm s? 1, measured directly from either acoustic doppler current profile data or relative geostrophic flow, since the latter do not account for seafloor topographic intensification. The variable hydrographic climatology of the ECE, known from sea-surface dynamic heights and repeat CTD surveys, is possibly recorded by seafloor substrates as evinced by worm-trails post-dating ripple formation and differing orientations of winnowed structures and ripples. <br/...|$|E
