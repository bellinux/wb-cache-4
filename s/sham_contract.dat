In this article, we identify the different meanings that the term ‘sham contracting’ can be given, and review evidence as the prevalence of disguised employment.

40|$|Fraudulent phoenix {{activity}} and <b>sham</b> <b>contracting</b> are well-recognised {{issues in the}} context of protecting employees’ remuneration entitlements, both during the life of a company and after it has collapsed through insolvency. To date, much of the emphasis in dealing with these problems has been on the businesses’ controllers. This paper takes a different approach and ponders whether at least some of these improper and illegal arrangements could have been devised and executed without some expert advice. It asks whether a more effective approach might be to target those advisers. Several cases have considered the liability of advisers as accessories to the company’s or directors’ breaches of legislation. While these are useful starting points, the lack of other actions against advisers, coupled with a general failure of professional bodies to caution against these illegal and improper behaviours, undermines the continued effectiveness of these decisions. A concerted effort — by regulators, courts and professional bodies — is required to ensure that advisers are persuaded that advocating these sorts of fraudulent schemes is simply not worth the risk...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Among the {{fraudulent}} contracting of work practices, one of {{the most}} difficult to identify is the creation of sham companies (usually, in another country). Sham companies are essentially new entities created to disguise the real employer. Creating a company, even abroad, is – of course – legal and may well be institutionally and economically advisable. However, when the only purpose of its creation is to benefit from more favourable regulations relating to labour and tax (and not to develop an activity in the country), then questions should be asked about the ‘genuine’ nature of the company. The Eurofound study Exploring the fraudulent contracting of work in the European Union emphasises that the term ‘sham contracting’ or ‘sham companies’ embraces a diversity of fraudulent practices, embedded in different institutional contexts (Eurofound, 2016 a). 1 Fraudulent practices are perpetrated for different purposes, the most important of which are to avoid paying, or to save, employment-related taxes and social security contributions, and to evade employers’ liability towards employees. Beyond some recent analysis of ‘letter-box’ companies, 2 there is not much research into <b>sham</b> <b>contracting</b> or <b>sham</b> companies. In addition, EU legislation has not played any role in this respect. Sham companies share the common goal of disguising the real employer. This can be achieved through different mechanisms such as: the creation of companies without assets, generally within subcontracting chains commercial or civil law contracts between companies where employees are misrepresented as contractors or company owners workers’ cooperatives, where workers lack actual control over the organisation’s decisions...|$|R

40|$|This {{report shows}} that some {{international}} students are being exploited and suffering {{racism in the}} workplace. Last year, almost 300, 000 people came {{from around the world}} to begin their studies in Australia. Many find they must work to support themselves and the government recognises that, allowing them to work for 40 hours a fortnight during term time. There has been little research on the working experiences of international students in Australia. This is surprising given the plethora of media reports, evidence to inquiries and investigations pursued by the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) — so many of which have found that international students are frequently exploited. In the retail cleaning industry, many international students — around half of whom are born in India — are exploited because the industry is in crisis. Barriers to entry are low, so new contractors can win business from large shopping centre owners like Westfield and Colonial First State. Having won a cleaning contract at a low price, these operators soon find the easiest route to profitability is to intensify the workloads of the cleaners they employ. This means demanding that cleaners do more work in less time, leading to extreme workloads that can impact upon the health and safety of their cleaners. Hygiene can also suffer, as cleaners are forced to take shortcuts. It can also mean cutting pay or conditions. Or contractors can seek to deliberately underpay cleaners. In some cases, they do all three. <b>Sham</b> <b>contracting</b> and ignoring workplace laws are also a significant problem. In fact, an FWO investigation into the cleaning industry in Victoria recently found that 44 per cent of audited employers were breaking workplace laws. All these problems can be intensified because of the many sub-contractors that can stand between the ultimate client — the shopping centre owner — and the cleaner. With each looking to make a profit, less and less is left for the cleaners doing the work. Shopping centre owners like Westfield also contribute to the crisis by insisting on cutting back on the value of their contracts, forcing contractors to shift an even greater burden on to cleaners. International students are left bearing the brunt of this crisis, with the majority struggling to pay even their rent. A third also worked additional time without pay, exacerbating an already difficult financial situation. Some are also asked to violate their visas, putting them at risk of deportation. This report serves to highlight the need for shopping centre owners to support reform of the retail industry and end a crisis that is putting the welfare of its workers at risk. Shopping centre cleaners themselves have been campaigning for fundamental reform of their industry, seeking an end to extreme workloads, low pay and a culture that fosters a lack of respect and, at times, discrimination.

40|$|AIM: This {{randomized}} {{double blind}} controlled study {{is aimed at}} determining the effect of repeated vibratory stimuli focally applied to the contracted quadriceps muscles (repeated muscle vibration=rMV) on bone mineral density, leg power and balance of postmenopausal osteoporotic women. METHODS: The study has been conducted on 40 voluntary postmenopausal osteoporotic women, randomised at 2 groups for rMV treatment and for control. The treatment group underwent rMV (100 Hz, 300 - 500 μm; three applications per day, each lasting 10 -minutes, for 3 consecutive days) applied to voluntary contracted quadriceps (VC=vibrated and contracted group). The control group, received a <b>sham</b> stimulation on <b>contracted</b> quadriceps (NV=non vibrated group). Bone mineral density T-score of proximal femur of the participants, was evaluated in two weeks before and 360 days after intervention; body balance and explosive leg power were measured 1 day before, 30 days and 360 days after treatment. RESULTS: VC group T-score at one year didn't change significantly relative to baseline values (pretreatment: - 2. 61 ± 0. 11, post-treatment - 2. 62 ± 0. 13); conversely in NV subjects T-score decreased significantly from - 2. 64 ± 0. 15 SD down to - 2. 99 ± 0. 28 SD. A significant improvement of balance and explosive leg power was observed only in VC group at 30 and 360 days after the intervention. CONCLUSION: We conclude that rMV is a safe, short-lasting and non-invasive treatment that can significantly and persistently improve muscle performance and can effectively counteract progressive demineralisation in postmenopausal and osteoporotic wome...|$|R
40|$|The {{report is}} a broad ranging {{assessment}} of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s workplace relations (WR) framework, considering current laws, institutions and practices. It uses an economywide approach, looking at possible reforms that, where merited, are likely to enhance the welfare of Australians as a whole. This report was sent to Government on 30 November 2015 and publicly released on 21 December 2015. • Key points 	A workplace relations (WR) framework must recognise two enduring features of labour markets. 	 		Labour {{is not just an}} ordinary input. There are ethical and community norms about the way in which a country treats its employees. 		Without regulation and an ability to act collectively, many employees are likely to have much less bargaining power than employers, with adverse outcomes for their wages and conditions. Equally, poorly-designed regulation can risk bestowing too much power on organised labour in their dealings with individual employers. 	 	 	The challenge for a WR framework is to develop a coherent system that provides balanced bargaining power between the parties, that encourages employment, and that enhances economic efficiency. It is easy to both over and under regulate. 	The bulk of relationships between employees and employers are harmonious. The adversarial relationships between the parties that sometimes surface can often reflect poor relationship management, rather than flaws in the WR framework. 	Contrary to perceptions, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s labour market performance and flexibility is relatively good by global standards, and many of the concerns that pervaded historical arrangements have now abated. Strike activity is low, wages are responsive to the economic cycle and there are multiple forms of employment arrangements that offer employees and employers flexible options for working. 	Set against that background, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s WR system is not dysfunctional - it needs repair not replacement. Nevertheless, several major deficiencies need addressing. 	While the Fair Work Commission (FWC) undertakes many of its functions well, the legalistic approach it adopts for award determination gives too much weight to history, precedent and judgments on the merits of cases put to it by partisan interest groups. This calls for a change in institutions and in practices. The wage regulation function of the FWC should be separated from it. The existing FWC would concentrate on its tribunal and administrative functions. A new body, the Workplace Standards Commission (WSC), would be dedicated to determining minimum wages and award regulation. 	 		The WSC would use different types of expertise, and apply a clear analytical framework supported by evidence it collected. 	 	 	The appointment process for FWC members can lead to inconsistencies in some of its decisions, a problem that a new 2 ̆ 7 fit for purpose 2 ̆ 7 governance model involving all Australian jurisdictions could resolve. The same processes would apply to the WSC. 	The Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and sometimes the FWC can give too much weight to procedure and too little to substance, leading to unnecessary compliance costs and poor outcomes. For example: 	 		some minor procedural defects in enterprise bargaining can require an employer to begin the agreement-making process again. 		an employee may engage in serious misconduct but may receive considerable compensation under unfair dismissal provisions due to procedural lapses by an employer. 	 	 	These problems can be easily remedied without removing employee protections. 	Minimum wages are justified, and the view that existing levels are highly prejudicial to employment is not well founded. However, significant minimum wage increases pose a risk for employment, especially for more disadvantaged job seekers and in weakening labour markets. 	Complementary policies that provide in-work benefits - such as wage subsidies or an earned income tax credit - might support higher incomes for lower paid employees, while not damaging employment. However, there are challenges in developing effective policies of this kind. 	Awards are an Australian idiosyncrasy with some undesirable inconsistencies and rigidities, but they are an important safety net and a useful benchmark for many employers. The WSC should address specified troublesome hotspots on a thematic basis. 	Penalty rates have a legitimate role in compensating employees for working long hours or at asocial times. However, Sunday penalty rates for hospitality, entertainment, retailing, restaurants and cafes are inconsistent across similar work, anachronistic in the context of changing consumer preferences, and frustrate the job aspirations of the unemployed and those who are only available for work on Sunday. Rates should be aligned with those on Saturday, creating a weekend rate for each of the relevant industries. 	Enterprise bargaining generally works well, although it is often ill-suited to smaller enterprises. However: 	 		while the better off overall test is cosmetically similar to a no-disadvantage test (NDT), in practice, the NDT makes agreement-making less costly and more efficient. A NDT with guidelines about the use of the test should be used for all enterprise agreements and individual arrangements. 		bargaining arrangements for greenfields agreements pose risks for large capital-intensive projects with urgent timelines. A limited menu of bargaining options would address the worst deficiencies, while taking account of the different nature of greenfields projects. 	 	 	Individual flexibility arrangements have many possible advantages, but their take-up is relatively low. In part, this reflects ignorance of their existence. But there are perceptions (sometimes not well based) of defects, which also constrain their use. These should be resolved by providing information on their use, extending the termination period of the arrangements, and by moving to the NDT. 	There is scope for a new form of employment arrangement, the 2 ̆ 7 enterprise contract 2 ̆ 7, which would provide for variations to awards suited to the circumstances of individual enterprises. This would offer many of the advantages of enterprise agreements, without the complexities, making them particularly suited to smaller businesses. Any risks to employees would be assuaged through a comprehensive set of protections, including a clear written statement to employees of the implications of award variations, a no-disadvantage requirement, the right to revert to the award or to initiate enterprise bargaining, and continued coverage by the National Employment Standards and employee protections. 	Strike activity in Australia is at low levels, but debilitating processes and problematic new forms of action should be fixed: 	 		overly complex processes for secret ballots should be simplified 		aborted strikes and brief stoppages are sometimes ingeniously used as bargaining leverage by employees, but a few modest remedies can address this without affecting the legitimate use of industrial action 		employers should be given more graduated options for retaliatory industrial action other than locking out its workforce. 	 	 	It is too easy under the current test for an employer to escape prosecution for <b>sham</b> <b>contracting.</b> Recalibrating the test from one of 2 ̆ 7 recklessness 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 reasonableness 2 ̆ 7 is justified. 	Migrant workers are more vulnerable to exploitation than are other employees, and {{this is especially true for}} illegally working migrants. This requires a package of measures that encourage migrants to report exploitation and support for the Fair Work Ombudsman to detect and pursue exploitative employers...|$|R
40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) is a promising tool for enhancing neurorehabilitation outcomes, especially after stroke. TDCS applied to human M 1 improves functional recovery post stroke, possibly through the modulation of cortical excitability and intracortical inhibition (2, 3). These ‘after-effects’, which occur following {{the application of}} tDCS, are at least partly related to the modification of NMDA efficacy and depend on GABA-related mechanisms (6 - 7). Most studies to date have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (1 - 4, 7 - 8) for measuring effects on M 1 in intrinsic hand muscles at rest (1, 3, 7 - 8). However, among moderate and severe stroke survivors TMS induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are usually absent in their paretic hand when muscles are relaxed. Furthermore, from a clinical point of view the restoration of paretic forearm function proximal to the hand {{is critical to the}} recovery of post stroke patients. Here we aimed to develop a new paradigm for testing the effectiveness of tDCS. Our sham-controlled crossover preliminary experiment was designed to test two hypotheses: 1) Anodal tDCS applied to the forearm region of M 1 induces similar after-effects to that previously observed in the hand. 2) Anodal tDCS induced after-effects can be successfully measured in the target muscle also {{in the presence of a}} controlled muscular contraction. In healthy young subjects (n= 7) we measured the after-effects of anodal tDCS in the right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) during resting and active motor states. MEPs and short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) measurements were collected before and immediately after 1) 20 min of 1 mA anodal tDCS over M 1 or 2) 20 min of sham stimulation, using standard measurement protocols (5). In the rest sessions (anodal or sham), subjects maintained a relaxed posture in their forearm during TMS measurements. In the active sessions (anodal or <b>sham),</b> subjects <b>contracted</b> their right ECR (10 % of maximum voluntary contraction) during TMS measurements. Preliminary analyses revealed increases in MEP amplitude following the application of anodal tDCS compared to sham in both the resting (18. 26 %± 21) and the active state (30. 94 %± 13). However, this increase was much more reliable when tested in the active state such that significant effects were observed even in a small sample (anodal tDCS vs sham: p= 0. 028). By contrast, measurements were highly variable when performed at rest and changes did not reach significance (anodal tDCS vs sham: p= 0. 405). Intracortical inhibition did not change significantly in either states when compared between the anodal and sham session (rest: p= 0. 175; active: p= 0. 613). Our results show that application of anodal tDCS to the forearm region of M 1 modulates cortical excitability in a similar manner to the hand region. However, there was no evidence that this effect arose from M 1 disinhibition. Furthermore, the after-effects of anodal tDCS in the ECR measured by TMS were more pronounced in active motor state than resting. Our findings have important implications for the design of post stroke rehabilitation protocols that incorporate tDCS, suggesting that targeting more proximal muscles in the upper limb is achievable. Moreover, when TMS is used to probe the patient’s response to tDCS, results might be more reliable when tested with a light pre-contraction of the targeted muscle. status: publishe...|$|R
