40|$|The Ottawalk-Speed (OWS) {{orthosis}} prevents knee {{collapse in}} <b>stumble</b> situations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to develop a virtual <b>stumble</b> perturbation to measure OWS response to a knee collapse when walking. A new split speed perturbation was developed for the CAREN virtual reality system. This perturbation induced a <b>stumble</b> with increased knee flexion for five able-bodied participants, with either a hopping or stopping recovery strategy. Three knee-ankle-foot orthosis users were subjected to five <b>stumble</b> trials while wearing the OWS. OWS participants used a straight-legged recovery strategy, and extended the knee through recovery weight acceptance. Therefore, the split speed perturbation was not appropriate to measure OWS response to a <b>stumble</b> since knee collapse did not occur. The OWS allowed free knee motion during gait. Further study is required to measure OWS response during a <b>stumble</b> with a knee collapse event...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} (1) {{what kind}} of "role" students play in cooperative learning, and (2) {{what kind of}} "stumbles" they face in their learning in a students-centered education {{as part of the}} general education of a university. The role is one of the very important viewpoints in learning theory, and students cannot develop their learning without various <b>stumbles,</b> compromises, and even failures as well. In this case, students faced three stumbles“, Gap between students," "Making their activity autotelic", and "Downward revisions of their learning target". In these <b>stumbles,</b> to bring students' various opinions to a better conclusion, a student tried to explain his own opinion to make the other members consent, and another student tried to coordinate members' various ideas in discussion in class time or various schedules to meet for discussion outside the class time. It is thought that they tried to take a suitable role and to play it, but they could not do it well. In these <b>stumbles</b> they tried to change their role to make the idea of their group advanced in the class, or tried to acquire the ability to overcome the <b>stumbles</b> at other classes and internships after this class had ended, or evaluated the <b>stumbles</b> affirmatively and assumed the <b>stumbles</b> to be an index of their learning and life afterwards. Through this case, we can see that these <b>stumbles</b> offer opportunities for students to be autonomous and cooperative subjects on their learning. So, a <b>stumble</b> is not a "failure of learning" or "what the teacher should exclude". The <b>stumble</b> offers the possibility that the general education curriculum can be reconstructed from the viewpoint of students' learning...|$|R

40|$|Falling is {{a serious}} health problem for many elderly. To {{investigate}} whether the higher fall incidence in elderly {{is due to a}} higher probability of experiencing near falls in daily life, it is necessary to evaluate the <b>stumble</b> incidence of elderly in daily life. Accelerometers are already frequently used for in vivo activity monitoring. The current study investigates whether an ambulant and unobtrusive accelerometer can identify <b>stumbles</b> from treadmill walking using a wavelet based detection approach. Seventy nine healthy subjects walked on a treadmill with a triaxial accelerometer attached {{at the level of the}} sacrum. <b>Stumbles</b> were induced using a specially designed braking system (The TRiP). The TRiP evoked 30 <b>stumbles</b> at different phases of the swing phase.

The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. <b>Stumbling</b> across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E

Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} its {{traditional}} Western orientation, relations with Europe {{have always been}} a central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey {{became one of the first}} members of the Council of Europe in 1949, applied for associate membership of the EEC (predecessor of the European Union) in 1959 and became an associate member in 1963. After decades of political negotiations, Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, became an associate member of the Western European Union in 1992, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the EU since 2005. Today, EU membership is considered as a state policy and a strategic target by Turkey. Turkey's support for Northern Cyprus in the Cyprus dispute complicates Turkey's relations with the EU and remains a major <b>stumbling</b> block to the country's EU accession bid.|$|E

5|$|In the 22ndminute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and {{went out for a}} corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta <b>stumbling</b> to the ground in the inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and <b>stumbling</b> in the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical <b>stumbling</b> block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E

On 27 August, Dassier confirmed that the club had reached an agreement on a loan fee with Newcastle for the transfer of Ben Arfa with personal terms being the only <b>stumbling</b> block in the deal. Marseille agreed to a £2million loan fee. Newcastle had been set to pay Marseille another £5million if Ben Arfa had made 25 club appearances in the 2010–11 season, which would have made the transfer permanent.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders and, despite the fact he was <b>stumbling,</b> shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another <b>stumbling</b> block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

5|$|Many of Grant's {{associates}} {{were able}} to capture his confidence through flattery and brought their intrigues openly to his attention. One of these men, Orville E. Babcock, was a subtle and unscrupulous enemy of reformers, having served as Grant's personal secretary for seven years while living in the White House. Babcock, twice indicted, gained indirect control of whole departments of the government, planted suspicions of reformers in Grant's mind, plotted their downfall, and sought to replace them with men like himself. Grant allowed Babcock to be a <b>stumbling</b> block for reformers who might have saved the President from scandal. Grant's secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, who was often at odds with Babcock, made efforts to save Grant's reputation by advocating that reformers be appointed to or kept in public office.

He played for the Heat with an angry demeanor and less joy than in years past, and later admitted that he regretted this approach. On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland {{for the first time}} since departing as a free agent. He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting. Miami entered the playoffs as the East's second seed and advanced to the Finals before <b>stumbling</b> against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2–1 series lead going into Game 4. James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series. His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.|$|E
