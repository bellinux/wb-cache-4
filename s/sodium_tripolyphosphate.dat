The rod-like and spherical particles were precipitated with an extremely fast {{rate of reaction}} under 100 ℃. The spherical particles were only produced in a very narrow region at 100 ℃ by aggregation of primary small particles. The rod-like particles were Ca_ 2 P_ 2 O_ 74 H_ 2 O but the uniform spherical ones were amorphous and the latter ones were crystallized to β-Ca_ 2 P_ 2 O_ 7 after calcined above 600 ℃. The aging temperature drastically varied the particle shape under a condition for producing uniform spherical particles; solid spherical particles were produced up to the aging temperature of 115 ℃ but balloon-like hollow spheres were precipitated at 120 ℃. However, large and irregular agglomerates that {{are made up of}} extremely small rod-like particles were precipitated after aging the solution above 125 ℃. TEM observation and ICP-AES measurements revealed that the balloon-like hollow spheres were produced by dissolving the interior of solid spherical particles after reinforced their shell by the adsorption of tpp unhydrolyzed.

The resistant starch yield, crystalline structure, {{as well as other}} physicochemical properties of the modified starch was investigated. The yield of resistant starch was 36. 33 and 50. 16 %, by HMT and Aut-col, respectively, whereas 48. 56 and 50. 16 %, respectively were obtained by Aut-acid and STMP/STPP. The scanning electron microscopy images clearly illustrated that the granular structure of native parkia starch was disrupted and a continuous network with irregular shape was formed after HMT and autoclaving-cooling cycles. The subsequent chemical cross-linking appeared to make the network structure more compact and dense. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that B- and V types coexisted in all the modified parkia starches and the DSC results also showed that the formation of amylose double helices could contribute to the changes in the X-ray diffraction patterns. The RS-rich powder presented crystalline due to the process of heat moisture and autoclaving-cooling cycles with cross-linking treatment induced starch retrogradation.

40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the effect of curing brine composition on the water properties in sediments from pork shank and semi-membranous muscles. The applied brines were solutions of inorganic salts of varying composition. The performed analyses comprised active acidity pH, water activ-ity Aw, water absorbability expressed as percentage proportion of free water in the total water content, as well as the value of relaxation times spin-network T 1 and spin-spin T 2. An inversely proportional correlation was found between pH values and water activity in the examined muscles when brines containing <b>sodium</b> chlo-ride, pyrophosphate, <b>tripolyphosphate</b> and a mixture of NaCl and pyrophosphate were applied. In the case of the control muscles as well as those containing a mixture of sodium chloride and tripolyphoshate, the above correlation was directly proportional. It was demonstrated that pyrophosphate, even at low pH values, signifi-cantly increased water absorbability of muscle tissue sediments. The analysis of relaxation parameters showed that pyrophosphate as a constituent of brine reduced the content of free water in relation to bound water as demonstrated by significant shortening of the spin-network relaxation time. In addition, the molecu-lar dynamics of bound water was found to be inhibited. The above observations allowed the authors to con-clude that pyrophosphate, as brine constituent, causes very good water binding in muscle tissue sediments.

40|$|Fracture non-unions {{and bone}} defects {{represent}} a recalcitrant {{problem in the}} field of orthopaedic surgery. Although the current gold-standard treatment, autologous bone grafting, has a relatively high success rate, the technique is not without serious problems. The emerging field of regenerative medicine may have the potential to provide an alternative treatment. One promising strategy involves the delivery of both cells and multiple growth factors with different release profiles. A range of scaffolds was developed from Poly(-caprolactone) (PCL), Poly(lactideco- glycolide) (PLGA), and two blends of PCL (Mn 42, 500) and PLGA. The scaffolds were manufactured utilising a novel modified fused deposition modelling system, using polymer/dichloromethane solutions. The scaffolds were found to have pore sizes suitable for bone regenerative medical applications (373 ± 9. 5 μm in the Ydirection and 460 ± 13 μm in the X-direction). However, the scaffolds were found to be only 52 ± 3 μm in height. This means that the two-layer scaffolds were relatively flat. This was undesirable, as direct control of the complete 3 D geometry was the favoured strategy, though {{it may not be a}} necessary requirement. Five scaffold coatings were also developed from alginate, chitosan (crosslinked using <b>sodium</b> hydroxide or <b>tripolyphosphate),</b> Type-I collagen and Type-A gelatin. The scaffold coatings were screened in vitro for their cell-compatibility with human marrow stromal cells (hMSCs), human osteoblasts and MG 63 cells.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Gadoid fish, like Alaska pollock and Pacific whiting, have a {{high level}} of trimethylamine-N-oxide {{demethylase}} (TMAOase) that catalyzes the breakdown of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) to formaldehyde (FA) and dimethylamine (DMA) even during frozen storage. FA reacts with amino acid residues to promote covalent cross-links in the formation of inter- and intramolecular linkages between protein chains via covalent methylene bridges, resulting in textural toughening when frozen storage extends. Heading and gutting (H&G) or filleting, which are a common practice for seafood processing, often affects fish quality during refrigerated and/or frozen storage due to freeze- and FA-induced protein denaturation followed by aggregation. The primary goal of the study presented in the dissertation was to investigate physicochemical and textural properties of frozen Alaska pollock and Pacific whiting fillets as affected by postharvest processing and storage conditions, and further to measure the relationship between TMAOase activity and protein aggregation. In the first part (Chapter 3), TMAOase activity, FA content and physicochemical properties of frozen Pacific whiting fillet during frozen storage (- 18 and - 80 °C) were investigated. Whole fish and H&G fish were stored under refrigeration for 0, 2, and 5 days and subsequently filleted and frozen. Frozen fillets were analyzed during 24 weeks of storage. TMAOase activity and FA content, which affect the textural quality of frozen fillet, were measured. FA induced by TMAOase increased at all treatments at - 18 °C as frozen storage extended to 24 weeks, but it was near zero at - 80 °C up to 12 weeks of storage. This study showed that textural quality and freshness were significantly lower when fillets were prepared from H&G fish than whole fish and stored at - 18 oC. Based on the finding from the first part, the second part (Chapters 4 and 5) evaluated various TMAOase-related (TMAOase activity, FA, DMA, and TMAO contents), physicochemical and textural properties of frozen Alaska pollock subjected to different freezing/thawing (F/T) cycles (0 - 12). TMAOase, FA and DMA contents significantly increased in fillets prepared from H&G fish as F/T cycles repeated. Interestingly, FA contents in fillets and drip were significantly reduced at 12 -F/T, indicating that FA was possibly used for protein denaturation and textural toughness. F/T, which is often used to mimic long-term frozen storage, likely induced the rapid FA production by accumulated TMAOase in fish muscle as ice crystal formation was maximized. The last part of the study (Chapters 6 and 7) was to investigate the effect of various <b>sodium</b> phosphates [sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> (STPP) /tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) mixture, STPP, TSPP, trisodium pyrophosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, and disodium phosphate anhydrous] on TMAOase- and freeze-induced protein denaturation followed by aggregation using 2 step approach (lab and pilot scale).

The treatments all maintained acceptable quality throughout a 98 -day shelf life. Citrus fiber treatments resulted in bologna with acceptable technological parameters, as indicated by similar cook/chill yields and emulsion stability compared with the STPP control. Lipid oxidation across all treatments was maintained for the entirety of the 98 -day shelf life period. There were slight differences among sensory evaluation scores for texture and moistness, with the citrus fiber treatments perceived as being softer and less moist; however, these contradicted the TPA measurement data showing the citrus fiber treatments as harder than the <b>sodium</b> <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control. The citrus fiber treatments were harder, less resilient, less cohesive, and less springy compared to the <b>sodium</b> <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control. Sensory evaluation of color showed no difference in lightness throughout the 98 -day shelf life. While there were instrumental color differences, they were slight and did not result in a product that was visually different or unappealing compared to the <b>sodium</b> <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control.
