50|$|A {{sideslip}} {{may be used}} {{exclusively to}} remain lined up with a runway centerline while on approach in a crosswind or be employed in the final moments of a crosswind landing. To commence <b>sideslipping,</b> the pilot rolls the airplane toward the wind to maintain runway centerline position while maintaining heading on the centerline with the rudder. Sideslip causes one main landing gear to touch down first, followed by the second main gear. This allows the wheels to be constantly aligned with the track, thus avoiding any side load at touchdown.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper details {{a unique}} method for {{estimating}} key vehicle states—body <b>sideslip</b> angle, tire <b>sideslip</b> angle, and vehicle attitude—using Global Positioning System (GPS) mea-surements {{in conjunction with}} other sensors. A method is pre-sented for integrating Inertial Navigation System sensors with GPS measurements to provide higher update rate estimates of the vehicle states. The influence of road side-slope and vehicle roll on estimating vehicle <b>sideslip</b> is investigated. A method using one GPS antenna that estimates accelerometer errors occurring from vehicle roll and sensor drift is first developed. A second method is then presented utilizing a two-antenna GPS system to provide direct measurements of vehicle roll and heading, resulting in improved <b>sideslip</b> estimation. Additionally, it is shown that the tire <b>sideslip</b> estimates can be used to estimate the tire cornering stiffnesses. The experimental results for the GPS-based <b>sideslip</b> angle measurement and cornering stiffness estimates compare favorably to theoretical predictions, suggesting that this technique has merit for future implementation in vehicle safety systems.

No significant asymmetries were observed at zero <b>sideslip</b> in the water tunnel tests. The sensitivity of the upper surface vortex flow fields to variations in <b>sideslip</b> angle was also studied. The vortex formed on the glove remained very stable in position above the wing up through the 10 deg of <b>sideslip</b> tested. There was a change in the vortex lifts under <b>sideslip</b> due to effective change in leading-edge sweep angles.

5000|$|The term side-slipping or side-stepping {{has been}} used to {{describe}} several similar yet distinct methods of playing outside. In one version, one plays only the five [...] "'wrong'" [...] non-scale notes for the given chord and none of the seven scale or three to four chord tones, given that there are twelve notes in the equal tempered scale and heptatonic scales are generally used. Another technique described as <b>sideslipping</b> is the addition of distant ii-V relationships, such as a half-step above the original ii-V. This increases chromatic tension as it first moves away and then towards the tonic. Lastly, side-slipping can be described as playing in a scale a half-step above or below a given chord, before resolving, creating tension and release.|$|E

5000|$|The A-3 Aerosledge has a hull {{built of}} riveted metal alloy {{construction}} using 2mm D-16T plates and profiles. The craft's ribs, stringers and plates are also of D-16 Duraluminium. Traverse bulkheads divide the craft into three watertight compartments. The craft will remain afloat with one flooded compartment. Double plating is employed for the hull bottom to strengthen it for crossing ice and snow. Low friction 3.5 mm polyethylene {{is attached to}} the bottom plates, which is removable for repair. Three stainless-steel runners are mounted to the hull base to provide the craft with the ability to maintain an even course, and prevent <b>sideslipping</b> on ice. The smooth lines of the hull's underside allow it to traverse bodies of water choked with weeds without difficulty. [...] Even with a maximum payload, the Aerosledge has a draft of no more than 2 inches. [...] The cabin is fully enclosed with a seating capacity of five in passenger configuration. In standard mail-carrying configuration, the cabin has one swiveling seat for the driver/mail carrier, and a cargo capacity of 1,433 lbs over ice, and 661 lbs over water. [...] Cabin access is by two gull-wing doors. There is an additional baggage storage compartment in front of the cabin, located beneath a hermetically-sealed hatch. The craft is controlled by a single wheel connected to twin rudders located behind the propeller. If the wheel is pulled towards the driver both rudders fold outward, forming a brake. If turned and pulled toward the driver, only one rudder folds outward, giving greater turning control over water overgrown with reeds or weeds. Three stainless steel runners mounted along the bottom of the hull provide additional stability while traveling over ice or snow. [...] When traversing snow, the slightly upturned bow of the A-3, together with the differences in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces of the hull, generate an aerodynamic lifting force. At speeds above 50 mph aerodynamic lift reduces the pressure exerted by the craft against the surface by one third. As the depth of the furrow decreases, friction resistance is reduced accordingly. On water the large area of the lower hull, with its small keel, makes it an ideal shallow-draft watercraft.|$|E

The results indicated that for positions close to the fuselage (on and near the plane of symmetry) changes in the angle of <b>sideslip</b> caused large changes in the flow-field characteristics {{and particularly in the}} local angles of <b>sideslip,</b> which in some cases were nearly double the static angle of <b>sideslip.</b> In general, the effects of changing the angle of <b>sideslip</b> on the flow-field characteristics for all of the outboard underwing locations were qualitatively similar, although conditions at the more inboard and outboard locations were somewhat more severe for lifting conditions than at the one-half semispan location. The chordwise gradients in the flow parameters for the underwing locations were more severe than for the fuselage locations although the effect of changing the angle of <b>sideslip</b> was less severe, in that the incremental changes in the local angles of <b>sideslip</b> were approximately equal to the static angle of <b>sideslip.</b> Flow conditions near the wing tip were found to be critically dependent on vertical location, with the largest sideslip-induced variations occurring at the nearest vertical locations.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{computing}} span loads {{and the resulting}} rolling moments for <b>sideslipping</b> wings of arbitrary plan form in incompressible flow is derived. The method requires that the span load at zero sideslip be known for the wing under consideration.

The basic method derived herein requires a mechanical differentiation and integration to obtain the rolling moment for the general wing in sideslip. For wings having straight leading and trailing edges over each semispan, the rolling moment due to sideslip is given by a simple equation in terms of plan-form parameters and the lateral center of pressure of the lift due to angle of attack. Calculated span loads and rolling-moment parameters are compared with experimental values. The comparison indicates good agreement between calculations and available experimental data...|$|E

A simple theoretical analysis, which supported this conclusion, also allowed the minimum practical manoeuvre time for any initial displacement to be calculated, once the available rate of roll, and an overriding maximum angle of bank, had been established.
