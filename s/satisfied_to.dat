He significantly improved his marathon best in April at the Paris Marathon {{to win the}} race over more-favoured opposition {{in a time of}} 2:06:41 – establishing him as the fifth-fastest ever Ethiopian over the distance. He took the top honours at the Portugal Half Marathon in September, beating Josphat Menjo and Francis Kiprop to win in 1:01:05. He was <b>satisfied</b> <b>to</b> have beaten such competition over the distance after finishing second in Ras Al Khaimah. He competed at the Frankfurt Marathon in October and improved his best for the distance by ten seconds, although he was beaten into second place by Wilson Kipsang.

25|$|Behind the {{two leading}} runners, Ferrari's {{challenge}} for pole position faded {{during the final}} session. Alesi's car {{ground to a halt}} on his first out-lap of the session after losing hydraulic pressure, and he had to share Berger's chassis for the remainder of qualifying. This forced Berger to hurry through his planned programme, making three runs instead of four, before handing his car over to his teammate. The extensive adjustments required to tailor the car's pedal system from Berger to Alesi's preferred set-up meant that he left the pits with only twominutes and 38seconds of the session remaining. Alesi thus had time for just one flying lap, which was spoiled when Irvine crashed his Jordan at Tabac during the final minutes. As a result, Alesi failed to improve on his Thursday time and dropped to fifthplace on the grid, half a second and oneposition behind Berger. The team's problems allowed Coulthard to improve to third place with a time of 1:23.109, continuing his progress as he became more familiar with the circuit. Häkkinen was another driver to be caught out by Irvine's crash {{at the end of the}} session, restricting him to sixthplace on the grid ahead of Herbert, who was <b>satisfied</b> <b>to</b> qualify only a second behind Schumacher. Blundell rounded out the top ten in the second McLaren, despite going up the escape road after missing his braking point at Sainte Dévote. Brundle took eighth and Irvine ninth despite his crash, which meant that all six of the British drivers qualified in the top ten.|$|E

500|$|The Ostend Manifesto, [...] Ostend Circular, was a {{document}} written in 1854 that described {{the rationale for}} the United States to purchase Cuba from Spain while implying that the U.S. should declare war if Spain refused.

At the national level, American leaders had been <b>satisfied</b> <b>to</b> have the island remain in weak Spanish hands so long as it did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France. The Ostend Manifesto proposed a shift in foreign policy, justifying the use of force to seize Cuba in the name of national security.

He also commended the film on its detail surrounding Chris Webber's infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship. The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film: Michigan athletic director Bill Martin, 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team, 1992–93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, Michael Talley and Webber.

On 2February1965, it was announced that the P.1154 had been terminated on the grounds of cost. At the time of cancellation, at least three prototypes had reached various stages of construction. Following the cancellation, the RAF and Royal Navy both adopted the F-4 Phantom II instead; however, [...] the government also issued a contract for continued work on the original subsonic P.1127(RAF), which led to the Harrier; this name had originally been reserved for the P.1154 should it enter service.|$|E

[...] The Stanley Cup championship finals alternated between the East and the West each year, with games played alternately under NHA or PCHA rules. The Cup trustees agreed to this new arrangement, because after the Allan Cup became the highest prize for amateur hockey teams in Canada, the trustees had become dependent on the top two professional leagues to bolster the prominence of the trophy. After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, joined the PCHA in 1914, the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup championship final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup.
