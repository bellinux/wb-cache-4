40|$|Studies of the {{vulnerability}} to gear damage of fish {{that have been}} caught in a trawl but have escaped through the codend meshes have focussed on determining survival rates. This study examines the risk of predation in small cod (Gadus morhua) (18. 2 cm mean total length) escaping a small-scale trawl. Trawling was simulated in a circular tank by towing a small mock-up of a trawl (70 mm codend meshes) for 30 minutes. Escaped fish were retained in a <b>small-meshed</b> <b>net</b> (16 mm) covering the codend. After each towing period, {{three or four of}} these fish and the same number of fish from a control group were immediately transferred to a tank holding five large. cod (56. 3 cm mean total length). Predation by the large cod was recorded for 30 min or until 50 % of the small cod had been taken. In a total of nine experiments, equal numbers of escaping fish and fish from the control group were eaten by the large cod. This indicates that small cod escaping from a trawl do not have increased risk of predation under these experimental conditions. However, the stressed fish were not physically exhausted and the predation experiment was conducted under conditions where the predator could easily capture both stressed and control fish...|$|E
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} innervation of {{the human}} gastric wall was studied by means of (1) demonstration of the acetylcholinesterase activity, (2) fluorescence microscopy, and (3) electron microscopy. The cholinergic innervation was rich: in the mucosa, a dense three dimensional network consisting of single delicate varicose acetylcholinesterase-positive axons and small nerve fascicles was observed in close relation to the gastric glands. In the submucosa, large nerve trunks and densely woven plexuses mainly consisting of single varicose axons (obviously perivascular plexuses)) were seen. In the muscularis external, a <b>small-meshed</b> <b>net</b> consisting of single varicose axons and nerve fascicles was observed. The ganglia of the myenteric plexus were small and scattered irregularly between and within the muscle layers. Most of the nerve cells exhibited moderate to intense acetylcholinesterase activity. In the serosa, only a few nerves were observed. By fluorescence microscopy, an abundance of brightly yellow fluorescing irregularly fusiform enterochromaffin cells was observed in the epithelial lining of the antral glands. The parietal cells of the fundic glands exhibited a granular, yellow to orange autofluorescence. Fluorescing axons were seen in intimate relation to some enterochromaffin cells, whereas most enterochromaffin cells and parietal cells did not receive any direct functional adrenergic innervation. In the other tissue layers, only a few fluorescing nerves were seen. The main ultrastructural characteristics of the intrinsic innervation of the mucosa were: (1) 'Innervation fasciculée'; (2) the axons were unmyelinated; (3) two main types of nerve terminals were identified according to their vesicle population(s) : (a) nerve terminals containing only clear vesicles, (b) nerve terminals containing clear vesicles and large dense-cored vesicles. Most of the axons and nerve terminals within the nerve fascicles were acetylcholinesterase-positive. The nerve terminals were separated from the gastric glands (and the parietal cells, chief cells and endocrine cells of their epithelial lining) by a considerable gap so that {{it seems unlikely that}} the gastric glands, parietal cells, chief cells and endocrine cells receive a direct innervation in the sense of synaptic neurotransmission; the transmitter substance must diffuse across a wide gap. In contrast, the endocrine cells were in close contact with the parietal cells and chief cells, and occasional membrane specialization (desmosomes) reinforce the assumption that (also) direct local humoral interaction may be possible. In addition, a large number of mast cells was observed in the lamina propria, many lying as close to glandular cells (parietal cells, chief cells and endocrine cells) as were the nearest nerve terminals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Burbot, Lota lota (L.), {{populations are}} declining {{throughout}} much of their native distribution. Although numerous aspects of burbot ecology are well understood, less is known about effective sampling techniques for burbot in lotic systems. Occupancy models were used to estimate the probability of detection (p̂) for three gears (6. 4 - and 19 -mm bar mesh hoop nets, night electric fishing), {{within the context of}} various habitat characteristics. During the summer, night electric fishing had the highest estimated detection probability for both juvenile (p̂, 95 % C. I.; 0. 35, 0. 26 – 0. 46) and adult (0. 30, 0. 20 – 0. 41) burbot. However, <b>small-mesh</b> hoop <b>nets</b> (6. 4 -mm bar mesh) had similar detection probabilities to night electric fishing for both juvenile (0. 26, 0. 17 – 0. 36) and adult (0. 27, 0. 18 – 0. 39) burbot during the summer. In autumn, a similar overlap between detection probabilities was observed for juvenile and adult burbot. <b>Small-mesh</b> hoop <b>nets</b> had the highest estimated probability of detection for both juvenile and adult burbot (0. 46, 0. 33 – 0. 59), whereas night electric fishing had a detection probability of 0. 39 (0. 28 – 0. 52) for juvenile and adult burbot. By using detection probabilities to compare gears, the most effective sampling technique can be identified, leading to increased species detections and more effective management of burbot.

40|$|In the Mediterranean region, {{the use of}} <b>small-mesh</b> <b>netting</b> {{to protect}} horticultural crops is an {{effective}} sustainable tool against pests. But in tropical regions, because of high humidity under the net favoring fungal development, netting with a larger mesh size has to be used, protecting crops against lepidopteran pests but not against small pests such as hemipterans, thrips, and phytophagous mites. A combination of netting with a repellent or irritant product is one possible solution, but the desire to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals and mitigate resistance issues calls for a natural alternative. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the repellent, irritant, and toxic effects of nets dipped in 20 different plant extracts on Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) adults. The repellent effect of volatile compounds was evaluated using a still-air olfactometer. The irritant effect and toxicity were evaluated with a no-choice test in tubes separated into two parts by an impregnated net. Our results showed the seven most irritant and toxic products against B. tabaci were aframomum, cinnamon, geranium, dill, citronella, litsea, and savory. The most repellent were aframomum and lemongrass, although cinnamon, geranium, and savory were also repellent at higher doses. Effects varied with the plant extract and the concentration, and effects were independent of one another, i. e., an essential oil can be irritant but not repellent, suggesting that the repellent mechanism and that behind the irritant or toxic effects is not the same. The use of repellent compounds in combination with netting as new pest control strategy is discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the hake fishery in the ICES Divisions adjoining Ireland displays strong similarities to the fishery for megrim; Ireland's landings of hake rose from 100 t per year in 1979 to 2, 000 t ten years later. Most hake comes from Divisions Vllg-k. The Communities Logbook of the Irish-Spanish joint venture fleet provides a short time series. CPUE by both demersal trawl and long line declined sharply between 1985 and 1991. The second quarter is the most productive of hake landings but otherwise {{there is no clear}} seasonal pattern. Hake were sampled on a half yearly basis and the fish were aged on the otoliths with a success rate of 70 %. Ages in the first half were adjusted to a birth date of 1 January. Mean lengths at age were higher than those calculated by statistical methods (Normsep.). Length frequencies indicated two age groups in the discards. Methods of capturing hake have altered over the past five years, gill nets have increased their share of the Irish catch and, in 1991, were a close second to demersal trawl. Age of recruitment to the landings is 2 - 4 years. Discard hake was calculated at 25 - 163 % by weight of landings per quarter in 1991, higher values coming from <b>small-meshed</b> <b>nets</b> targeting Nephrops. Survivorship curves based on aged length frequencies of hake taken by whitefish boats provided F values of between 0. 40 and 0. 76. These results are high and together with sharply declining CPUE would seem to suggest the part of the stock in Divisions Vllb-c and Vllg-k is more heavily fished than the stock in other parts of Sub-area VII.

40|$|Abstract – This {{research}} investigates {{a status}} assessment approach for remnant lake salmonin populations, using the lake charr (Salvelinus namaycush Walbaum) of Crean Lake (105 km 2) as an example. A mark-recapture program was implemented employing <b>small-mesh</b> gill <b>nets</b> to ensnare charr by the teeth at spawning. Prior to sampling, potential spawning sites were designated primary or secondary based on habitat. Most charr were caught on three primary reefs, with some spawners moving between reefs. The spawning period peaked at day 2, enhancing spawning synchrony, and lasted up to 10 days. Results produced very low sampling mortality (5. 7 %), consistent {{estimates of the}} number of spawning charr (∼ 60 y− 1) and a very low (< 2000) estimate of the total number of mature charr in Crean Lake. The approach offers an effective means of assessing remnant salmonins with minimal impact on their populations...|$|R
40|$|Length, {{life history}} and {{ecological}} characteristics of landed fish communities were studied over a 10 -year period to test theories of fishing disturbance {{during a time}} of increased gear and closure management in heavily utilised fisheries. It was predicted that with greater management restrictions: (1) the earliest and fastest responses in the fishery will be seen in those species with faster turnovers, or relatively lower vulnerabilities to fishing; (2) the fishery would transition to a landed catch with higher mean trophic levels, and greater mean body lengths. In addition, the removal of a non-selective, <b>small-mesh</b> seine <b>nets</b> should benefit the catch of gears that previously had the greatest species selectivity overlap with the seine net. Many predictions were supported, although maximum lengths and lengths at maturity responded more rapidly than anticipated. The response to eliminating the non-selective seine net was a more rapid increase in sizes caught by gears with a larger overlap in size (hook and lines) than species selectivity (gill nets). The simultaneous comparison of management systems over time indicates that open-access fishing grounds can benefit from restrictions imposed in adjacent fishing grounds. The study indicated that multi-species coral reef fisheries management objectives of maximising yields, as well as maintaining the fish community's life-history diversity, require management trade-offs that balance local socio-economic and biodiversity needs...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} small-mesh (4 -mm) fyke netting {{and boat}} electrofishing for sampling a littoral fish assemblage in Muskegon Lake, Michigan. We hypothesized that fyke netting selects for small-bodied fishes and electrofishing selects for large-bodied fishes. Three sites were sampled during May (2004 and 2005), July (2005 only), and September (2004 and 2005). We {{found that the}} species composition of captured fish differed considerably between fyke netting and electrofishing based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Species strongly associated with fyke netting (based on NMDS and relative abundance) included the brook silverside Labidesthes sicculus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, mimic shiner Notropis volucellus, and bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, whereas species associated with electrofishing included the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, catostomids (Moxostoma spp. and Catostomus spp.), freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, walleye Sander vitreus, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio. The total length of fish captured by electrofishing was 12. 8 cm (95 % confidence interval ¼ 5. 5 – 17. 2 cm) {{greater than that of}} fish captured by fyke netting. Size selectivity of the gears contributed to differences in species composition of the fish captured, supporting our initial hypothesis. Thus, <b>small-mesh</b> fyke <b>nets</b> and boat electrofishers provided complementary information on a littoral fish assemblage. Our results support use of multiple gear types in monitoring and research surveys of fish assemblages.

40|$|In 1879 {{commercial}} fishing was of small {{concern to the}} West; yet in this year was fostered a venture which was the pioneer of a vast new fishery which has grown to take a superior place {{in the interest of}} both commercial and sport fishermen. First in 1879 and then again in 1882 striped bass yearlings, totaling 435 in all, were planted in San Francisco Bay, California. These fish, members of the sea-bass family, Serranidae, were removed from their native waters on the Atlantic seaboard and shipped across the country in one of the early transcontinental trains. These few fish were evidently readily adapted to San Francisco Bay, for since their planting they have flourished there beyond expectation. As early as 1889, only ten years after the first plant, they were being caught in the gill nets and offered for sale in the markets. By 1895 they had formed a recognized fishery, and fishermen constructed special <b>small-mesh</b> <b>nets</b> for their capture. These commercial net men were quick to realize that a ready market awaited these new and tasty fish. During this same period the anglers began to hook these game bass and it was not long before every hook-and-line fisherman had recognized this introduced species as a new field for sport, for their gameness was discovered to be second only to the wary steelhead that migrate in and out of our coastal streams. To illustrate the enormous and almost unbelievable increase in abundance of these fish, figures compiled by the United States Bureau of Fisheries reveal that in 1899, twenty years after their introduction, the commercial net catch alone was 1, 234, 000 pounds. In 1915 the greatest catch was recorded when 1, 784, 448 pounds were delivered to the markets. The total commercial catch continued at this high level until the close of the World War, when a general economic slump occurred throughout the country. Since then the total catch has varied between about 500, 000 pounds and 1, 000, 000 pounds annually. Because the striped bass have had only fifty years of existence in this region, one might be led to believe that the annual toll of the commercial nets, as well as the increase in angling activities which are generally conceded an annual total catch of several hundred thousand pounds, will lead to the extermination of the species. The casual observer may refer to the total catch as an index to such a condition. To the contrary, however, we find the abundance of this species on the increase. A report by Craig bearing out this statement is based on the catch per boat over a period of years. As Craig points out, the decrease in the total catch is due to economic conditions brought about mainly by an increase in stringent conservation measures. Though the results of Craig's analysis show an increase of the striped bass from 1920 to 1928, {{it is not at all}} improbable that depletion might occur in future years. In order to prevent such an occurrence, a thorough understanding of the prime factors responsible for the yearly abundance, as well as the life history of the species, is essential. The abundance is dependent upon two factors, namely, natural and artificial conditions. Because man holds no control over the former, then the latter must be submitted to detailed study. This study may involve many problems such as commercial netting, angling, influence of obstructions such as dams and land reclamation, pollution, and others. If the fishery is doomed as a result of any or all these artificial influences, then proper regulation and conservation lie within the power of man, provided he is familiar with the life history of the species. As the relative abundance of the striped bass has been determined by Craig, the present report deals with the next two important studies necessary in building a solid foundation upon which conservation measures may be based. These are the life history and an analysis of the commercial fishery. To simplify its comprehension, the report is divided into three sections: the first deals with a brief resume of the fishery including fishing gear and methods, the second with a detailed account of the life history of the striped bass, and the third with a study of the commercial catch including general conclusions and recommendations. The striped bass investigation began late in 1925. From then to late in 1928, the entire program was given over to the collection of life history data, and the sampling of the commercial catch. The period from 1928 to the present time (July, 1930) has been spent in working up the available data which have culminated in the present report...|$|R
