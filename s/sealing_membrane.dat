The variation of stress in soil was equal {{to the difference between}} the values of pore pressure before and during vacuum preloading, indicating that water pressures on the <b>sealing</b> <b>membrane</b> could act as preloading loads.

50|$|Ronald Kaback became {{interested}} in membrane transport {{at a time when}} studies on biological membranes were in their infancy, and in the early phase of his career, he developed a cell-free membrane system to study active transport. The system consisted of osmotically <b>sealed</b> <b>membrane</b> vesicles of defined orientation (right-side-out) that catalyze active transport essentially as well as intact cells, but lack subsequent metabolism of the solutes accumulated. These vesicles were dubbed Kabackosomes by the Dutch scientist Wilhelmus N. Konings, Kaback’s close friend and early collaborator. In addition to transforming the field of transport from phenomenology to biochemistry, this seminal development caused him to forego the practice of pediatrics for a career in basic science. The use of membrane vesicles from various sources has become a standard tool for testing models and performing hypothesis-driven research.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{incidence}} of extensive roof greening {{structures in the}} contamination of roof runoff has been analysed for three families of organic micropollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], alkylphenols [APs], and bisphenol A [BPA]) by means of both laboratory leaching tests and field experiments. For PAHs, which {{do not have any}} local source on the green roof and originate only from atmospheric fallout, the green roof behaves as a sink and reduces by a factor 10 the emitted loads compared to a conventional flat roof. APs and BPA however can be emitted by the synthetic materials that constitute the roofing structure (e. g., roof sealing, drainage material, filter, evacuation pipes). Potential emissions of BPA and nonylphenol (NP) from the geotextile, the <b>sealing</b> <b>membrane</b> and PVC pipes have especially been identified. Field results confirm increased NP and octylphenol (OP) emissions in the green roof runoff.

40|$|In {{the thesis}} we firstly {{introduce}} dikes, their form, {{structure and the}} way of functioning. Theoretical bases of seepage and modes of failure, which {{can be caused by}} such a process, are explained. Further, optical fiber cables and the principle of their functioning in the monitoring of seepage are introduced. The method is based on thermal processes in a dike, because water affects its temperature conditions. By measuring the temperature using optical fiber cables the location and the rate of seepage can be accurately determined. Although the method is relatively new, it has already come into practical use, and one of the applications is present at the dike of the hydroelectric power plant Brežice. We made a study of permeability of the dike and analysed three different cases. In the first case we presupposed that the dike is homogeneous, in the second one we treated the real dike, and in the third one we presupposed that the <b>sealing</b> <b>membrane</b> is damaged, which we modelled by increasing its permeability.

40|$|A normal roofing {{membrane}} {{is exposed}} to various mechanical and climatic impacts which can reduce durability and the service life of the membrane. In so called inverted roofs the membrane is situated beneath the insulation layer - which is ballasted with gravel or vegetated substrate. Thus, the sealing is protected versus the above mentioned damaging influences. Drawback of this solution is the direct exposure of the insulation to the outdoor climate. Therefore only materials with a high vapour diffusion resistance shall be used to minimize the entry of water into the insulation. However, the long term experience shows that also XPS boards experience some moisture accumulation especially in case where the cover layer remains humid most of the time. This slows down the drying process towards the top compared to gravel ballasted roofs. Based on long term field tests of green roofs this paper provides new approaches to simulate the hygrothermal conditions in inverted roofs. The model includes the simulation of the moisture behaviour of the substrate and an estimation {{of the amount of}} rainwater remaining at the interface between the <b>sealing</b> <b>membrane</b> and the insulation boards. Applying this model allows to asses the moisture accumulation in the insulation and the subsequent increase in the material's thermal conductivity over the life time of the roof. Considering the long-term moisture behaviour helps to specify the thickness of the insulation layer required to maintain the aspired level of thermal resistance over the whole service life of the roof...|$|E
