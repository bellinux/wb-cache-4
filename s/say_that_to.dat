A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.

Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel does not voice them.

500|$|The {{financial}} {{failure of}} Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, {{which made the}} studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giants production considerably. [...] "Three-quarters" [...] of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff {{that there would be}} a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented [...] "They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good." [...] Bird regarded the trade-off as having [...] "one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule," [...] but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as [...] "fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the level that we can." [...] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; [...] "we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees," [...] said production designer Mark Whiting.|$|E

But nobody says that President Truman was a terrorist.

2500|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a street gang of {{children}} who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly, which they toss down a hill. [...] Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director: [...] "visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. [...] Buñuel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims". [...] The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with Buñuel's fee being the equivalent of $2,000. [...] During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways: [...] one technician confronted Buñuel and asked why he didn't make a [...] "real" [...] Mexican movie [...] "rather than a miserable picture like this one", the film's hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist's mother refuses to give him food ("In Mexico, no mother would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> her son."), another staff member urged Buñuel to abandon shooting on a [...] "garbage heap", noting that there were many [...] "lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas" [...] that were available, while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits.|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
