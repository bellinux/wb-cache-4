50|$|This texture can be {{confused}} with <b>spherulitic</b> and axiolitic texture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spherulitic</b> texture is {{the result}} of cooling and {{nucleation}} of material in a magma which has achieved supersaturation in the crystal component. Thus it is often a subsolidus process in supercooler felsic rocks. Often, two minerals will grow together in the spherulite. Axiolitic texture results from <b>spherulitic</b> growth along fractures in volcanic glass, often from invasion of water.|$|E

5000|$|The {{formation}} of hydroxylbastnasite (NdCO3OH) can also occur via the crystallization of an rare-earth bearing amorphous precursor. With increasing temperature, {{the habit of}} NdCO3OH crystals changes progressively to more complex <b>spherulitic</b> or dendritic morphologies. The development of these crystal morphologies has been suggested [...] {{to be controlled by}} the level at which supersaturation is reached in the aqueous solution during the breakdown of the amorphous precursor. At higher temperature (e.g., 220 °C) and after rapid heating (e.g. < 1 hr) the amorphous precursor breaks down rapidly and the fast supersaturation promotes <b>spherulitic</b> growth. At a lower temperature (e.g., 165 °C) and slow heating (100 min) the supersaturation levels are approached more slowly than required for <b>spherulitic</b> growth, and thus more regular triangular pyramidal shapes form.|$|E

5000|$|A lithophysa (plural lithophysae, from Greek lithos [...] "stone" [...] + physan [...] "to blow") is a felsic {{volcanic}} rock {{with a small}} <b>spherulitic</b> cavity and concentric chambers. Its shape is spherical or lenticular.|$|E
50|$|Monohydrocalcite forms via a Mg-rich {{amorphous}} {{calcium carbonate}} (ACC) precursor. This Mg-rich ACC forms rapidly (seconds) and then transforms to monohydrocalcite via dissolution and reprecipitation, with monohydrocalcite forming via a nucleation-controlled reaction like <b>spherulitic</b> growth.|$|E
5000|$|When {{polymers}} crystallize from an isotropic, bulk of melt or concentrated solution, the crystalline lamellae (10 to 20 nm in thickness) {{are typically}} organized into a <b>spherulitic</b> morphology as illustrated above. However, when polymer chains are confined {{in a space}} with dimensions of a few tens of nanometers, comparable to or smaller than the lamellar crystal thickness or the radius of gyration, nucleation and growth can be dramatically affected. As an example, when a polymer crystallizes in a confined ultrathin layer, the isotropic <b>spherulitic</b> organization of lamellar crystals is hampered and confinement can produce unique lamellar crystal orientations. [...] Sometimes the chain alignment {{is parallel to the}} layer plane and the crystals are organized as ‘‘on-edge’’ lamellae. In other cases, [...] "in-plane" [...] lamellae with chain orientation perpendicular to the layers are observed.|$|E
50|$|In some {{rocks the}} whole groundmass {{consists}} of <b>spherulitic</b> growths of fibrous quartz and feldspar; in their centres {{there is often}} a quartz or feldspar crystal; the outer boundaries of the spherulites are not usually circular but irregular, owing to the interlocking of adjacent spherulites at their margins. Such textures may document solid-state devitrification of glass.|$|E
50|$|Keith and Padden joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ in 1960. Not {{long after}} they arrived, they {{published}} a seminal paper on <b>spherulitic</b> crystallisation. They subsequently studied the crystalline structures of isotactic polypropylene, isotactic polystyrene, polyesters, various polypeptides (see Peptide), and other crystallisable polymers. In 1965, Keith and his collaborators explained the mechanical strength of polymers by discovering their intercrystalline links.|$|E
5000|$|Fossil dinosaur eggshells, like modern {{bird and}} reptile eggshells, {{are made up}} of calcium {{carbonate}} crystal units. The basic arrangement and structure of these eggshell units (called the ultrastructure) is used to divide fossil eggs into several basic types, including the <b>spherulitic,</b> prismatic, and ornithoid basic types, which contain dinosaurs. Dinosaur eggs further classified by the microstructural aspects of the crystalline structure of the eggshell units and by the type of their pores and their shell ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|Deakin Volcanics green {{grey and}} purple rhyodacite mostly covers Weston. The Deakin Volcanics green grey, purple and cream {{rhyolite}} {{can be seen}} between Parkinson St and Namatjira Drive and forms a large outcrop in the park {{to the east of}} Cooleman Court. A band of pink and green rhyolitic instrusive porphyry runs across Weston from west to east. It is fault uplifted on the southern side. Deakin Volcanics red-purple and green-grey rhyodacite with <b>spherulitic</b> texture is along Hindmarsh Drive on the southern border of the suburb.|$|E
50|$|Two main types may be {{recognized}} {{by means of the}} microscope; the felsitic and the microcrystalline. In the former the ingredients are so fine-grained that in the thinnest slices they cannot be determined by means of the microscope. Some of these rocks show perlitic or <b>spherulitic</b> structure, and such rocks were probably originally glassy (obsidians or pitchstones), but by lapse of time and processes of alteration have slowly passed into very finely crystal-line state. This change is called devitrification; it is common in glasses, as these are essentially unstable. A large number of the finer quartz-porphyries are also in some degree silicified of impregnated by quartz, chalcedony and opal, derived from the silica set free by decomposition (kaolinization) of the original feldspar. This re-deposited silica forms veins and patches of indefinite shape or may bodily replace a considerable area of the rock by metasomatic substitution. The opal is amorphous, the chalcedony finely crystalline and often arranged in <b>spherulitic</b> growths that yield an excellent black cross in polarized light. The microcrystalline ground-masses are those that can be resolved into their component minerals in thin slices by use of the microscope. They prove to consist essentially of quartz and feldspars, which are often in grains of quite irregular shape (microgranitic).|$|E
50|$|Artificial glass {{sometimes}} crystallizes {{and contains}} spherulites {{that may be}} {{as large as a}} marble. As the glass has little similarity in chemical composition to volcanic obsidians, these spherulites when analyzed throw little light on the mineral nature of spherulites in rocks. They show, however, that in viscous semi-solid glasses near their fusion point crystallization tends to nucleate at certain centers and to spread outwards, producing <b>spherulitic</b> structures. Many salts and organic substances exhibit the same tendency, yielding beautiful spherulite crystallizations when melted and cooled rapidly on a microscopic slide.|$|E
50|$|Rutley was {{the author}} of an {{exceedingly}} useful little book on Mineralogy (1874; 12th ed., 1900); also of The Study of Rocks (1879; 2nd ed., 1881), Rock-forming Minerals (1888), and Granites and Greenstones (1894); and of a number of petrographical papers, dealing with perlitic and <b>spherulitic</b> structures, with the rocks of the Malvern Hills, and other related topics. In 1882 he was appointed lecturer in mineralogy at the Royal College of Science, holding this post until ill-health compelled him to retire in 1898. He died in London on 16 May 1904.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} biomineralizing polychaetes are serpulids, sabellids and cirratulids. They secrete tubes of calcium carbonate. Serpulids have most advanced biomineralization system among the annelids. Serpulids possess very diverse tube ultrastructures. Serpulid tubes {{are composed of}} aragonite, calcite or mixture of both polymorphs. In addition to the tubes, some serpulid species secrete calcareous opercula. Some sabellids and cirratulids can secrete aragonitic tubes. Sabellid and cirratulid tubes have a <b>spherulitic</b> prismatic ultrastructure. There are thin organic sheets in serpulid tube mineral structures. These sheets have evolved as an adaptation to strengthen the mechanical properties of the tubes.|$|E
50|$|Changbaiite is {{nonmagnetic}} and breakable. Also, it possesses dual {{quality of}} translucent to transparent. It has perfect basal cleavage and distinct rhombohedral cleavage with hackly fracture, {{on the other}} side <b>spherulitic</b> grains are conchoidal. Ultraviolet light and cathode rays have no fluorescent effect on changbaiite and this is not soluble in hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or sulphuric acid but conditionally less soluble in hot phosphoric acid. Changbaiite has a hardness of 472.4 kg/mm2 on the Vickers hardness scale and 5.3 on mohs scale. In an optical spectrum changbaiite is uniaxial positive and it can be biaxial. Changbaiite reflectance, which is the fraction of incident radiation reflected by a surface, is 15.86 at 546 nm.|$|E
50|$|The {{innermost}} layer, {{known as}} the mammillary layer or the cone layer, is only found in theropod eggs (the prismatic and ornithoid basic types). It is composed of cone-shaped structures called mammillae {{at the base of}} each shell unit. Mammillae are {{the first part of the}} eggshell to form. Each mammilla forms from crystals radiating outward from an organic core until they touch neighboring mammillae and grow upwards into the next layer. In <b>spherulitic</b> eggs, the eggs of non-theropod dinosaurs, the eggshell units grow upward from their organic cores; the base of each eggshell unit is rounded, but is not a true mammilla because it does not have a distinct ultrastructure from the top of the unit.|$|E
50|$|Rhyolite can be {{considered}} as the extrusive equivalent to the plutonic granite rock, and consequently, outcrops of rhyolite may bear a resemblance to granite. Due to their high content of silica and low iron and magnesium contents, rhyolite melts are highly polymerized and form highly viscous lavas. They also occur as breccias or in volcanic plugs and dikes. Rhyolites that cool too quickly to grow crystals form a natural glass or vitrophyre, also called obsidian. Slower cooling forms microscopic crystals in the lava and results in textures such as flow foliations, <b>spherulitic,</b> nodular, and lithophysal structures. Some rhyolite is highly vesicular pumice. Many eruptions of rhyolite are highly explosive and the deposits may consist of fallout tephra/tuff or of ignimbrites.|$|E
50|$|Tachylites {{have the}} {{appearance}} of pitch and are often more or less vesicular and sometimes <b>spherulitic.</b> They are very brittle and break down readily under a hammer. Small crystals of feldspar or olivine are sometimes visible in them with the unaided eye. All tachylites weather rather easily and by oxidation of their iron become dark brown or red. Three modes of occurrence characterize this rock. In all cases they are found under conditions which imply rapid cooling, but they are much less common than acid volcanic glasses (or obsidians), the reason being apparently that the basic rocks have a stronger tendency to crystallize, partly {{because they are more}} liquid and the molecules have more freedom to arrange themselves in crystalline order.|$|E
50|$|The {{crystallization}} of ACC {{can occur}} in two stages: first, the ACC nanoparticles rapidly dehydrate and crystallize to form individual particles of vaterite. Secondly, the vaterite transforms to calcite via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism with the reaction rate controlled by the surface area of calcite. The second stage of the reaction is approximately 10 times slower. However, the crystallization of calcite has been observed {{to be dependent on}} the starting pH and presence of Mg in solution. A neutral starting pH during mixing promotes the direct transformation of ACC into calcite. Conversely, when ACC forms in a solution that starts with a basic initial pH, the transformation to calcite occurs via metastable vaterite, which forms via a <b>spherulitic</b> growth mechanism. In a second stage this vaterite transforms to calcite via a surface-controlled dissolution and recrystallization mechanism. Mg has a noteworthy effect on both the stability of ACC and its transformation to crystalline CaCO3, resulting in the formation of calcite directly from ACC, as this ion destabilizes the structure of vaterite.|$|E
50|$|A third mode of {{occurrence}} of tachylite is as the margins and thin offshoots of dikes or sills of basalt and diabase. They are sometimes {{only a fraction}} of an inch in thickness, resembling a thin layer of pitch or tar {{on the edge of a}} crystalline diabase dike, but veins several inches thick are sometimes found. In these situations tachylite is rarely vesicular, but it often shows very pronounced fluxion banding accentuated by the presence of rows of spherulites that are visible as dark brown rounded spots. The spherulites have a distinct radiate structure and sometimes exhibit zones of varying color. The non-spherulitic glassy portion is sometimes perlitic, and these rocks are always brittle. Common crystals are olivine, augite and feldspar, with swarms of minute dusty black grains of magnetite. At the extreme edges the glass is often perfectly free from crystalline products, but it merges rapidly into the ordinary crystalline diabase, which in a very short distance may contain no vitreous base whatever. The spherulites may form the greater part of the mass, they may be a quarter of an inch in diameter and are occasionally much larger than this. These coarsely <b>spherulitic</b> rocks pass over into the variolites by increasing coarseness in the fibers of their spherulites, which soon become recognizable as needles of feldspar or feathery growths of augite. The ultimate product of decomposition in this case also is a red palagonitic substance, but owing to the absence of steam cavities the tachylite selvages of dikes are more often found in a fresh state than the basic lapilli in ash-beds. Many occurrences of basaltic pitchstones have been reported from Skye, Mull, and the western part of Scotland; they are found also in connection with the intrusive diabase sills in the north of England and the center of Scotland. In the Saar district of Germany similar rocks occur, some of which have been described as weisselbergites (from Weisselberg).|$|E
40|$|The South Atlantic Aptian ‘Pre-salt’ {{reservoirs}} {{are formed}} {{by a combination}} of <b>spherulitic</b> carbonates and Mg-rich clays accumulated in volcanic alkaline lake settings with exotic chemistries. So far, outcrop analogues characterised by metre-thick successions deposited in lacustrine scenarios are elusive so disentangling the genesis of <b>spherulitic</b> carbonates represents a major scientific challenge with business impact. In particular the controls on spatial distribution and the environment of <b>spherulitic</b> facies formation remain poorly constrained, little studied, and hotly debated. To shed light on this conundrum, a <b>spherulitic</b> carbonate-rich, alkaline volcanic lacustrine succession has been analysed at outcrop scale: the Carboniferous East Kirkton Limestone (Scotland). Despite clays being very scarce and limited to layers of amorphous Mg-Si minerals, a diverse array of <b>spherulitic</b> calcitic components were formed, including coated grains, crusts, and build-ups. This setting enables the mechanisms of <b>spherulitic</b> calcite development and the patterns of sediment accumulation to be explored in a geobiological and hydrochemical scenario similar to the ‘Pre-Salt’ subsurface occurrences but divorced from clay influence. The integration of logs, borehole data, outcrop photomosaics and petrographic observations collectively allowed the reconstruction of a depositional model for the East Kirkton lacustrine succession. In this model, calcite spherule nucleation took place at the sediment-water interface in the littoral zone, driven by the co-occurrence of 1) high alkalinity, 2) Ca-Mg rich hydrochemistry, and 3) microbial-derived colloidal exopolymeric substances. These environmental conditions permitted the coeval development of <b>spherulitic</b> cementstone build-ups and <b>spherulitic</b> grainstone-packstone within the wave-agitated zone, and the accumulation of floatstones and laminites of <b>spherulitic</b> grains in deeper lake regions by means of downslope reworking. This model is consistent with the previously documented microbial bloom occurrences and highlights the need to better understand the complex ‘microbe-solution’ interactions before any reliable facies model is envisaged...|$|E
40|$|The {{calcareous}} operculum of Pyrgopolon ctenactis {{is composed}} of <b>spherulitic</b> prismatic structures. The opercular cup consists of regular <b>spherulitic</b> prismatic crystals; the talon has two layers, an inner with an irregular <b>spherulitic</b> prismatic structure (150 μm thick) and an outer with a regular <b>spherulitic</b> prismatic structure (110 μm thick). The outer regular structure has thick (1 μm) organic interprismatic sheets unique in biomineralization of this group, but {{similar to that of}} Bivalvia. We infer that control over biomineralization is stronger during the formation of the outer regular layer, with its thick organic interprismatic sheets, than during the formation of the inner irregular <b>spherulitic</b> prismatic structure, without such sheets. In Spirobranchus giganteus, opercular formation differs from that of P. ctenactis. S. giganteus has numerous pores in its opercular plate, and calcification starts with the formation of an outer irregularly oriented prismatic structure followed by an oriented prismatic structure without interprismatic sheets...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{formation}} of a <b>spherulitic</b> pattern in polymers that are spatially confined.

The model allows us to predict the rates of formation of the interspherulitic boundaries and also the distributions of distances from spherulite centers to the boundaries for an isothermal as well as a noniso thermal crystallization. The final length of interspherulitic lines and the final number of triple points between spherulites can also be calculated.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} devoted to the {{formation}} of a <b>spherulitic</b> pattern in a confined space. Thin poly(methylene oxide) films, one wide and the second of width of average spherulite diameter, were crystallized isothermally at the same temperature and studied. In the narrow sample, the number of spherulites per unit area increased, whereas the length of interspherulitic boundary lines per unit area and the number of triple points, impingement points of three spherulites, per unit area were significantly smaller than in the wide sample. Computer simulation of the <b>spherulitic</b> crystallization demonstrated not only a {{decrease in the number of}} boundary lines and triple points per unit area due to limits of space available for the <b>spherulitic</b> nucleation and growth but also differences in the progression of the <b>spherulitic</b> structure formation between wide films and narrow strips. A model of the <b>spherulitic</b> pattern development in narrow strips of the polymer based on probability theory is elaborated. The model allows one to predict the rates of formation of the interspherulitic boundaries and also the distributions of distances from the spherulites centers to the boundaries for an isothermal and a nonisothermal crystallization.

40|$|Addition of charged polypeptides, in {{particular}} poly(aspartate), to supersaturated solutions of calcium carbonate (CaCO_ 3) leads to unusual morphologies in the inorganic phase.
