5000|$|Typical <b>slewing</b> <b>drive</b> {{applications}} include but are {{not limited}} to: ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} {{in which the}} <b>slewing</b> <b>drive</b> can be utilized, primarily because it is perfect for applications that require both load-holding power and rotational torque strength.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slewing</b> <b>drive</b> is a modernized take on {{the worm}} drive {{mechanism}} that dates back many centuries and was widely used during the Renaissance Era. Pappus of Alexandria (3rd century AD), a Greek mathematician is credited for {{an early version of}} the endless screw, which would later evolve into the worm drive. This mechanism was also used by Leonardo da Vinci as a component in many of his designs for machines. It can also be found in the notebooks of Francesco di Giorgio of Siena. Many <b>slewing</b> <b>drive</b> concepts found prominence with the emergence of larger scale construction and engineering in the height of the Greek and Roman Empires.|$|E
50|$|As {{technology}} has improved, more <b>slewing</b> <b>drives</b> are using hourglass worm technology, {{in which the}} worm is shaped to engage more teeth in the gear. This increased tooth engagement results in greater strength, efficiency and durability.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{multiple}} uses, <b>slewing</b> <b>drives</b> {{come in a}} variety of model sizes, performance ranges and mounting characteristics. The drives are well suited for applications that require both load holding and rotational torque from the same gear box. They can also be made with dual axes of rotation, (turning axes at the same time) or with dual drives on the same axis, (two worm threads driving the same ring gear in one axis).|$|R
5000|$|Counter {{rotating}} <b>slewing</b> <b>drives</b> sandwiching a fixed {{angle support}} {{can be applied}} to create a [...] "multi-axis" [...] tracking method which eliminates rotation relative to longitudinal alignment. This method if placed on a column or pillar will generate more electricity than fixed PV and its PV array will never rotate into a parking lot drive lane. It will also allow for maximum solar generation in virtually any parking lot lane/row orientation, including circular or curvilinear.|$|R
50|$|The <b>slewing</b> <b>drive</b> is {{a gearbox}} that can safely hold radial and axial loads, {{as well as}} {{transmit}} a torque for rotating. The rotation can be in a single axis, or in multiple axes together. Slewing drives are made by manufacturing gearing, bearings, seals, housing, motor and other auxiliary components and assembling them into a finished gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Standard modern {{turbines}} all furl {{the blades}} in high winds. Since furling requires acting against the torque on the blade, it requires {{some form of}} pitch angle control, which is achieved with a <b>slewing</b> <b>drive.</b> This drive precisely angles the blade while withstanding high torque loads. In addition, many turbines use hydraulic systems. These systems are usually spring-loaded, so that if hydraulic power fails, the blades automatically furl. Other turbines use an electric servomotor for every rotor blade. They have a small battery-reserve {{in case of an}} electric-grid breakdown. Small wind turbines (under 50 kW) with variable-pitching generally use systems operated by centrifugal force, either by flyweights or geometric design, and employ no electric or hydraulic controls.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulations of a dual-axis solar tracker. This solar tracker works solely based on the output power of the PV panel mounted to it. It does not use any photosensors to orient the PV module. Describing the process in short, {{the position of the}} Sun is first calculated based on time and location information. Since this solar panel will be mounted here at UiT, Norges Arktiske Universitet, Narvik. So, it’s latitude and longitude is always fixed. Theoretically, PV panel should be placed such that it’s face is perpendicular to the Sun. But the optimal position for the PV module may be slightly different from the astronomical position (facing perpendicular to the Sun) due the reflection of snow and other factors. So to track for the optimal position, the panel is moved in the tilt direction first. And the tilt angle is increased slightly by a certain step size and the output power is compared in each tilt angles. The tilt angle that gives maximum power is set as optimal tilt angle. The PV panel is then kept at this optimal tilt angle and then the same process is repeated to find the optimal azimuth angle. For the movement of the PV panel a <b>slewing</b> <b>drive</b> has been selected by other student groups. The other half of this report deals with the control of the dc motors used in the <b>slewing</b> <b>drive.</b> The rotation of the dc motors are observed and controlled so that the PV module always faces the correct direction that is required during the tracking process. Strong wind can cause mechanical damage to the PV module. Therefore, when strong wind over the danger limit is detected, the PV panels is kept parallel to the ground to minimize the surface area that comes in contact with the strong wind. When the system starts for the first time or after a power failure then It should first put itself to the 90 ̊ tilt and 0 ̊ azimuth position. In short, this report details the complete control system for dual-axis solar tracker and the protection from strong Wind...|$|E
50|$|Active {{trackers}} use {{motors and}} gear trains {{to direct the}} tracker as commanded by a controller responding to the solar direction. In order to control and manage the movement of these massive structures special <b>slewing</b> <b>drives</b> are designed and rigorously tested. The technologies used to direct the tracker are constantly evolving and recent developments at Google and Eternegy have included the use of wire-ropes and winches to replace {{some of the more}} costly and more fragile components.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slewing</b> <b>drives</b> {{function}} with standard worm technology, {{in which the}} worm on the horizontal shaft acts as the driver for the gear. The rotation of the horizontal screw turns a gear about an axis perpendicular to the screw axis. This combination reduces {{the speed of the}} driven member and also multiplies its torque; increasing it proportionally as the speed decreases. The speed ratio of shafts depends upon the relation of the number of threads on the worm to the number of teeth in the worm wheel or gear.|$|R
50|$|To {{allow it}} to {{complete}} its duties, the superstructure of a BWE is capable of rotating about a vertical axis (slewing). The cutting boom can be tilted up and down (hoisting). The speeds of these operations are on the orders of 30 m/min and 5 m/min, respectively. <b>Slewing</b> is <b>driven</b> by large gears, while hoisting generally makes use of a cable system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical analyses that were carried out in order to evaluate how a change in a size of a clearance in a <b>slewing</b> motion <b>drive</b> system of a telescopic crane influences the movement of a load and the dynamic loads of a struc-ture. A computational model was developed based on a real structure of an experimental crane by using the ADAMS software. The analyses showed that a circumferential clearance at the output of a reduction gear, which is less than 1 º, does not adversely affect the precision of the load movement. An excessive clearance leads to losing fluidity of a body slewing motion and to changes in the trajecto-ry of the load...|$|R
