50|$|A major {{drawback}} of HVDC systems using line-commutated converters is {{that the}} converters inherently consume reactive power. The AC current flowing into the converter from the AC system lags behind the AC voltage so that, irrespective of the direction of active power flow, the converter always absorbs reactive power, behaving {{in the same way}} as a <b>shunt</b> <b>reactor.</b> The reactive power absorbed is at least 0.5 MVAr/MW under ideal conditions and can be higher than this when the converter is operating at higher than usual firing or extinction angle, or reduced DC voltage.|$|E

50|$|If VSS is {{used for}} line’s {{charging}} current elimination, {{it is not necessary}} to install <b>shunt</b> <b>reactor.</b> In single-phase cable lines, the VSS can eliminate the whole charging current because the operational capacity comprises of phase-to-ground capacity only. In three-phase and overhead lines, the operational capacity comprises not only of phase-to-ground capacity but also of phase-to-phase capacity. VSS eliminates only charging currents of phase-to-ground capacity in these networks, which stands for 60% to 70% of line’s operational capacity value (VSS is not designated for elimination of phase-to-phase capacity charging current in the lines). VSS contributes to a significant reduction of charging reactive power flow.|$|E
5000|$|Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power systems to counteract {{the effect of the}} line parasitic capacitance, thereby stabilizing the system voltage within acceptable limits. For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of capacitive current from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the sending end, thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving end voltage being higher than sending end voltage. In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system. Since inductors absorbs VARs, a reactor is connected in parallel with shunt capacitance of the line known as <b>Shunt</b> <b>Reactor,</b> ...|$|E
50|$|A Controlled <b>shunt</b> <b>reactor</b> (CSR) is a {{variable}} inductance, smoothly regulated by magnetic biasing of ferromagnetic elements of magnetic circuit. The magnetic system of a CSR single phase {{consists of two}} cores. Each core is equipped with control and power windings. In case of regulated DC voltage source connection to the control windings, biasing flow is increasing and directed to different sides in the adjacent cores. This resulted in saturation of CSR cores at relevant half-period of the current. Core saturation is resulted in initiation and increase of the current in the power winding due to non-linear characteristics of the magnetic core. Change in biasing current value leads to the power winding current change, due to which a stepless variation of voltage levels in CSR connection point {{as well as the}} value of reactive power consumed by the reactor is ensured.|$|E

50|$|Variable Shunt Reactors {{are used}} in high voltage energy {{transmission}} systems to stabilize the voltage during load variations. A traditional <b>shunt</b> <b>reactor</b> has a fixed rating and is either connected to the power line all the time or switched in and out depending on the load. Recently Variable Shunt Reactors (VSR) have been developed and introduced on the market. The rating of a VSR can be changed in steps, The maximum regulation range typically is a factor of two, e.g. from 100-200 Mvar. The regulation speed is normally in the order seconds per step and around a minute from max to min rating. VSRs are today available for voltages up to 550 kV. The largest three-phase VSRs in operation have a rating of 120-200 Mvar at 420 kV and single-phase variable shunt reactors banks rated 200-285 Mvar at 420 kV have been installed in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Magnetically {{controlled}} <b>shunt</b> <b>reactor</b> is the transformer-type device which additionally provides {{functions of}} semiconducting key apparatus; this is ensured {{by means of}} reactor magnetic system operation {{in the domain of}} deep saturation. The basing principle allowed optimal employment of existing designs both in transformer production industry, and in the field of power electronics.Magnetic system of MCSR single phase includes two cores with windings, vertical and horizontal yokes. Control windings with opposite connection and power windings with series (accordant) connection are arranged on CST magnetic system cores. MCSR magnetic system cores are free from nonmagnetic gaps, and owing to this effect in case of the reactor connection to the network it will be in no-load condition. Herewith, the value of reactive power consumed from the grid will not exceed 3% of nominal magnitude. To increase reactor load as for reactive power, its operating range should be offset to non-linear area of hysteresis characteristic; and this is achieved for the account of additional biasing of magnetic system. At connection of regulated dc voltage source to the control windings, increase of the bias flux is ensured.|$|E

5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled <b>shunt</b> <b>reactor</b> including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.|$|E
