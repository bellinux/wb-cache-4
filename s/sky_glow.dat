25|$|Under {{cloudless}} conditions, {{more interesting}} than the sunset itself is the view of the progression of the mountain's shadow across the California Central Valley to the distant Sierra Nevada, finally appearing for a few moments above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset <b>sky</b> <b>glow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Measuring {{the effect}} of <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> {{on a global scale}} is a complex procedure. The natural {{atmosphere}} is not completely dark, {{even in the absence of}} terrestrial sources of light and illumination from the Moon. This is caused by two main sources: airglow and scattered light.|$|E
25|$|A full cutoff fixture, when {{correctly}} installed, {{reduces the}} chance for light to escape above {{the plane of the}} horizontal. Light released above the horizontal may sometimes be lighting an intended target, but often serves no purpose. When it enters into the atmosphere, light contributes to <b>sky</b> <b>glow.</b> Some governments and organizations are now considering, or have already implemented, full cutoff fixtures in street lamps and stadium lighting.|$|E

25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} {{can allow}} for lower wattage lamps {{to be used}} in the fixtures, producing the same or sometimes a better effect, due to being more carefully controlled. In every lighting system, some <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> also results from light reflected from the ground. This reflection can be reduced, however, by being careful to use only the lowest wattage necessary for the lamp, and setting spacing between lights appropriately. Assuring luminaire setback is greater than 90° from highly reflective surfaces also diminishes reflectance.|$|E
25|$|Skyglow is made {{considerably}} {{worse when}} clouds are present. While this {{has no effect}} on astronomical observations (which are not possible at visible wavelengths under cloud cover), it is very important in the context of ecological light pollution. Since cloudy nights in artificially lit areas can be up to ten thousand times brighter than in natural areas, any organisms that are affected by <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> (e.g. zooplankton and fish that visually prey on them) {{are much more likely to}} have their ordinary behavior disturbed on cloudy nights.|$|E
25|$|U.S. federal {{agencies}} may also enforce standards and process complaints within their areas of jurisdiction. For instance, {{in the case}} of light trespass by white strobe lighting from communication towers in excess of FAA minimum lighting requirements the Federal Communications Commission maintains an Antenna Structure Registration database information which citizens may use to identify offending structures and provides a mechanism for processing citizen inquiries and complaints. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) has also incorporated a credit for reducing the amount of light trespass and <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> into their environmentally friendly building standard known as LEED.|$|E
60|$|The evening <b>sky,</b> <b>glowing</b> red, {{threw out}} the bold outline of the castle, and the quaint old edifices as they seemed to look down on us silently from their rocky heights, and the figure of Salisbury Crags marked itself against the red sky like a couchant lion.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} sun burst forth {{in all his}} golden glory. Water, earth, and <b>sky</b> <b>glowed</b> {{as if they had}} been set on fire.

25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} help {{to reduce}} <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal. Full cutoff typically reduces {{the visibility of}} the lamp and reflector within a luminaire, so the effects of glare are also reduced. Campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures, since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground. However, full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other types of luminaires, corresponding to lower luminaire efficiency, suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary.|$|E
500|$|The first verse {{refers to}} Pittsburgh as a [...] "smoky ol' town", {{and the third}} {{complains}} that the speaker does nothing more than [...] "cough and choke" [...] because of the steel industry's output. The smoke was an ever-present part of life in Pittsburgh {{at the time of}} the song's writing; steel mills on the banks of the city's three rivers made the <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> red and continually released smoke. Modern environmentalist reviewers of the song believe that the pollution-oriented verses show that the song was written to protest the environmental conditions in which workers were forced to live.|$|E
2500|$|Reducing light {{pollution}} implies many things, such as reducing <b>sky</b> <b>glow,</b> reducing glare, reducing light trespass, and reducing clutter. The method for best reducing {{light pollution}}, therefore, depends on {{exactly what the}} problem is in any given instance. Possible solutions include: ...|$|E

Space yawns beneath her, the waters roar in her ears, the red <b>sky</b> <b>glows</b> above. She sees Swanhild come and shrieks aloud.|$|R
60|$|November 11.--Sir William Rae read us prayers. Sauntered {{about the}} doors, and talked of old cavalry stories. Then drove to Melville, {{and saw the}} Lord and Lady, and family. I think I never saw {{anything}} more beautiful than the ridge of Carnethy (Pentland) against a clear frosty sky, with its peaks and varied slopes. The hills glowed like purple amethysts, the <b>sky</b> <b>glowed</b> topaz and vermilion colours. I never saw a finer screen than Pentland, considering that it is neither rocky nor highly elevated.|$|R
50|$|Other than Earth's Moon, {{no other}} {{body in the}} Solar System has been {{explored}} and examined for possible future human colonization more intently than Mars. In Wanderers, Wernquist starts with NASA photographs and crafts three scenes showing the possible Martian future: in the first, the cabin of a theorized space elevator descends down its cable, transporting supplies to a Mars colony below, in the second, workers in space suits wait {{near the edge of}} Victoria Crater for approaching dirigibles, and in the third, a group of hikers (who are presumably accustomed to watching red sunsets on Earth) enjoy the sight of the Martian <b>sky</b> <b>glowing</b> blue around the setting sun.|$|R
2500|$|Light {{trespass}} can {{be reduced}} by selecting light fixtures which {{limit the amount of}} light emitted more than 80° above the nadir. The IESNA definitions include full cutoff (0%), cutoff (10%), and semi-cutoff (20%). (These definitions also include limits on light emitted above 90° to reduce <b>sky</b> <b>glow.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Skyglow {{refers to}} the diffuse glow {{that can be seen}} over {{populated}} areas. It arises from light reflected from illuminated surfaces and from light escaping directly upward from incompletely shielded or upward-directed light fixtures, which then is scattered (redirected) by the atmosphere back toward the ground. The brightness of skyglow is affected strongly by the amount of light used, the shielding characteristics of the light fixtures, and by the color or spectral content of the light sources. Though it is commonly thought that Rayleigh scattering strongly increases the brightness of skyglow arising from white sources with strong blue and green emission, the dominant spectral effect has been shown to arise from the Purkinje effect instead. Because of the eye's increased sensitivity to blue and green light when adapted to very low luminance levels (such as those in even moderately polluted clear night skies), white light sources such as white LEDs contribute significantly more to skyglow than an equal amount of yellow light from sources such as high-pressure sodium, low-pressure sodium, [...] "phosphor-converted" [...] (PC) amber LED, or [...] "narrow spectrum" [...] amber AlGaInP LEDs. <b>Sky</b> <b>glow</b> is of particular irritation to astronomers, as it interferes with astronomical observations, but multitudes suffer from the decreased visibility of star-filled night skies.|$|E
6000|$|At {{seven o'clock}} {{the sun was}} down, though the gloom of the {{tropical}} evening had not yet come. The two ladies {{went out to the}} gate, which was but a few yards from the veranda, and there stood listening for the sound of Harry's horse. The low moaning of the wind through the trees could be heard, but it was so gentle, continuous, and unaltered that it seemed to be no more than a vehicle for other sounds, and was as death-like as silence itself. The gate of the horse paddock through which Heathcote must pass on his way home was nearly a mile distant; but the road there was hard, and they knew that they could hear from there the fall of his horse's feet. There they stood from seven to nearly eight, whispering a word now and then to each other, listening always, but in vain. Looking away to the west every now and then, they fancied that they could see the <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> with flames, and then they would tell each other that it was fancy. The evening grew darker and still darker, but no sound was heard through the moaning wind. From time to time Mrs. Growler came out to them, declaring her fears in no measured terms. [...] "Well, marm, I do declare I think we'd better go away out of this." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{games in}} the Tex Murphy series {{take place in a}} post-apocalyptic 21st century. All of the games take place mostly in a post-WWIII San Francisco. The <b>skies</b> <b>glow</b> red with radiation, and people who don't live in a better-sheltered city or lack genetic {{immunity}} to the radiation are disfigured and usually repulsive. Several San Francisco landmarks are still present, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower and Alcatraz, but most of them are completely abandoned; most damaged beyond repair from bombs in WWIII. The futuristic aspect borrows heavily from sci-fi books and films, most notably Blade Runner for its flying cars and impossibly dense tenements.|$|R

2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Kim Jong-il {{had died of a}} suspected heart attack on 17 December 2011 at 8:30a.m. while travelling by train to an area outside Pyongyang. It {{was reported}} in December 2012, however, that he had died [...] "in a fit of rage" [...] over construction faults at a crucial power plant project at Huichon in Jagang Province. He was succeeded by his youngest son Kim Jong-un, who was hailed by the Korean Central News Agency as the [...] "Great Successor". According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), during his death a fierce snowstorm paused and the <b>sky</b> <b>glowed</b> red above the sacred Mount Paektu and the ice on a famous lake also cracked so loud that it seemed to shake the Heavens and the Earth.|$|R

5000|$|Much {{discussion}} in the lighting industry and even by some dark-sky advocacy organizations (e.g. International Dark-Sky Association) of the <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> consequences of replacing the currently prevalent high-pressure sodium roadway lighting systems with white LEDs neglects critical issues of human visual spectral sensitivity, or focuses exclusively on white LED light sources, or focuses concerns narrowly on the blue portion (<500 nm) of the spectrum. All of these deficiencies lead to the incorrect conclusion that increases in <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> brightness arising from the change in light source spectrum are minimal, or that light-pollution regulations that limit the CCT of white LEDs to so-called [...] "warm white" [...] (i.e. CCT <4000K or 3500K) will prevent <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> increases. Improved efficiency (efficiency in distributing light onto the target area - such as the roadway - with diminished [...] "waste" [...] falling outside of the target area and more uniform distribution patterns) can allow designers to lower lighting amounts. But efficiency improvement sufficient to overcome <b>sky</b> <b>glow</b> doubling or tripling arising from a switch to even warm-white LED from high-pressure sodium (or a 4-8x increase compared to low-pressure sodium) has not been demonstrated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Pearl's Dream" [...] starts with Khan rising from a mist {{to find herself}} on a stage facing an empty auditorium. As Khan starts to dance, we see the planets and night <b>sky</b> <b>glowing</b> around her. A wolf appears with Khan, and seems to examine the surroundings. Khan then notices a blond woman in the audience, which we assume to be Pearl. Pearl watches Khan's show, {{seemingly}} unimpressed at first, but as it progresses she seems to become scared and makes her way slowly toward the stage, reaching to grab Khan by the neck as the wolf snarls and growls at her. The planets above shoot a laser at Pearl, effectively destroying her. She leaves behind her clothes and blond hair {{as if she has}} been disintegrated. The video then ends with stars falling from the sky onto Khan.|$|R
60|$|The April <b>skies</b> <b>glowed</b> with benevolence this Saturday morning. The Metropolitan Tower was singing, bright ivory {{tipped with}} gold, uplifted and {{intensely}} glad of the morning. The buildings walling in Madison Square were jubilant; the honest red-brick fronts, radiant; the new marble, witty. The sparrows {{in the middle}} of Fifth Avenue were all talking at once, scandalously but cleverly. The polished brass of limousines threw off teethy smiles. At least so Mr. Wrenn fancied as he whisked up Fifth Avenue, the skirts of his small blue double-breasted coat wagging. He was going blocks {{out of his way to}} the office; ready to defy time and eternity, yes, and even the office manager. He had awakened with Defiance as his bedfellow, and throughout breakfast at the hustler Dairy Lunch sunshine had flickered over the dirty tessellated floor.|$|R

50|$|The Ruler of Lotus, Lord British {{decides to}} {{pay a visit to}} Gradius and meets up with Stephanie. He offers her a {{beautiful}} robe and takes her to a secluded park or villa. Dan follows, keeping out of sight. As tLord British starts talking in flowery words, Dan comments sarcastically on each of them. Suddenly, the <b>sky</b> <b>glows</b> red/orange, and the salamander appears. It whacks the breath out of Lord British, grabs Stephanie, and goes back to whence it came from. Dan and Lord British both look at the sky, then the ground, and then at each other, in complete shock. Stephanie ends up in a place where she cannot move; she is stuck to a hammock-like device. She talks to Paula, who introduces her to Gofer, a man with a grotesque face and muscular body, the leader of the Bacterians. As some appendages lower to her, Stephanie goes into a series of flashbacks involving her family and her home. She awakens from the flashbacks shouting for Dan.|$|R
60|$|But now its {{pleasant}} and martial promenade changed suddenly to very serious work of war. As the Prince moved south {{he found that}} all, supplies had been cleared away from {{in front of him}} and that there was neither fodder for the horses nor food for the men. Two hundred wagons laden with spoil rolled at the head of the army, but the starving soldiers would soon have gladly changed it all for as many loads of bread and of meat. The light troops of the French had preceded then and burned or destroyed everything that could be of use. Now also for the first time the Prince and his men became aware that a great army was moving upon the eastern side of them, streaming southward in the hope of cutting off their retreat to the sea.
