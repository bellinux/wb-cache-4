500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes {{are few and far}} between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it [...] "all works out in the end".|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} of Breitbart's death on March 1, 2012, Sherrod released the following statement: [...] "The news of Mr. Breitbart’s death {{came as a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I was informed of it this morning. My prayers go out to Mr. Breitbart’s family as they cope during this very difficult time." [...] Andrew Breitbart's widow has taken his place as defendant in the ongoing lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|A jury at Southwark Crown Court {{unanimously}} acquitted Sgt White in November 2016. Rigg's sister Marcia said, [...] "The jury's {{verdict was}} a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and my family}} but {{we will continue to}} fight for full accountability for those officers who were on duty at Brixton police station. That a custody sergeant can give false evidence in connection with a death in custody, something he accepts he did, is a shocking state of affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The White House {{fostered the}} {{impression}} that the coup was purely Vietnamese in design. An unidentified administration source stated that [...] "the plot was news to us". The Democratic Party Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield asserted that [...] "the news of the coup came as a complete <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I am quite certain to the administration". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "this appears to be a purely Vietnamese affair which the Vietnamese should settle among themselves". Rusk publicly stated: [...] "We were not privy to these plans" [...] and that [...] "Americans were not involved in the planning nor were any Americans involved in the fighting. Rusk denied that the Americans had a [...] "decisive influence" [...] and insisted that it was a [...] "South Vietnamese affair" [...] but he realized that [...] "our press problem is likely to be pinpointed on US involvement". The State Department press officer followed the government line, stating [...] "I can categorically state that the US government was not involved in any way.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the canal}} {{approached}} Hancock, more construction problems surfaced. Limestone sinkholes and caverns caused the canal bottom to cave in near Shepherdstown, near Two Locks above Dam No. 4, around Four Locks, Big pool, and Roundtop Hill near Dam No. 6. On 6 December 1839, Chief Engineer Fisk wrote, [...] "These breaks have all evidently been occasioned by limestone sinks which exhibit themselves by a falling {{down of the}} bottom of the Canal into limestone caverns that are lower than, and extend out under the bed of the river: — in consequence of which the water from the Canal is at first conducted down below the canal bottom perhaps twenty or thirty feet and thence out along under the bed of the river ... It has been a matter of <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that our Canal thus far has suffered so little from limesinks. We may yet however have much trouble from this source near and above the breach at Lock No. 37. For about a mile, there is scarcely a hundred feet in length of the canal in which there are not several small lime sink holes...". He recommended costly but necessary repairs, which were done by 1840.|$|E
