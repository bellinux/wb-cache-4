5|$|A humanist <b>sans-serif</b> {{based on}} the letterforms of Jannon's type, created by Alan Meeks and {{published}} by Letraset and later ITC.|$|E
5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist <b>sans-serif</b> concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist <b>sans-serif</b> with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for Letraset and Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised <b>sans-serif</b> font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's serif design Joanna. It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E
5|$|Gill Sans is a <b>sans-serif</b> {{typeface}} {{designed by}} Eric Gill and {{released by the}} British branch of Monotype from 1928 onwards.|$|E
25|$|The 'g' of Akzidenz-Grotesk is a 'single-storey' design, like in {{many other}} German <b>sans-serifs,</b> but unlike the double-storey 'g' found in most serif fonts and {{in many of the}} {{earliest}} <b>sans-serifs</b> that had a lower-case. Walter Tracy describes this as a common feature in German <b>sans-serifs</b> of the period and influenced by the tradition of blackletter, which uses a single-story 'g' in upright composition. Blackletter was still very popular for general-purpose use in Germany in the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|Like most <b>sans-serifs</b> Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} of quite similar width, giving a sense of {{simplicity}} and an absence of adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative <b>sans-serifs</b> {{of the late nineteenth}} century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to Didone serif fonts such as Didot and Walbaum, most visibly in the folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’. Unlike the earliest <b>sans-serifs</b> designed in Britain and the United States, the 'g' of Akzidenz-Grotesk is a 'single-story' design, like in many other German <b>sans-serifs.</b> Walter Tracy describes this as a trait most commonly seen in German <b>sans-serifs</b> and influenced by the tradition of blackletter, still very popular for general-purpose use in Germany in the nineteenth century, which uses a single-story 'g' in upright composition.|$|R
5000|$|Geometric designs have no {{bracketing}} and evenly weighted {{stems and}} serifs. Early examples include Memphis, Rockwell, Karnak, Beton, Rosmini, City and Tower, several {{of which were}} influenced by geometric <b>sans-serifs</b> of the 1920s and 30s, especially Futura. Recent well-known geometric <b>sans-serifs</b> include ITC Lubalin, Neutraface Slab and Archer.|$|R
5|$|Jannon and Jannon Sans.gif|A {{specimen}} of František Štorm's revival of Jannon's type and his added bold and <b>sans-serif</b> derivatives.|$|E
5|$|František Štorm's 2010 revival with optical sizes {{is one of}} the few modern revivals of Jannon's work. Štorm {{also created}} a {{matching}} <b>sans-serif</b> companion design, Jannon Sans.|$|E
5|$|Several digitisations {{have been}} made of both ATF's {{original}} Garamond and the Linotype adaptation, most notably a 2015 digitisation by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original swash characters. A loose adaptation with <b>sans-serif</b> companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.|$|E
5000|$|Monotype {{also sold}} {{a few other}} {{general-purpose}} <b>sans-serifs,</b> listed her for convenience: ...|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} subgenre of <b>sans-serifs</b> {{is those}} such as Rothbury, Britannic, Radiant and National Trust with stroke contrast, {{which have been}} called 'modulated' <b>sans-serifs.</b> They are nowadays often placed within the humanist genre, although they predate Johnston which started the modern humanist genre. These may take inspiration from calligraphy or painted lettering, grotesque or humanist fonts.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Gill Sans {{compared}} to other <b>sans-serifs</b> of the period. Gill Sans does not use the single-storey [...] "g" [...] or [...] "a" [...] used by many <b>sans-serifs</b> and is less monoline than Johnston. Its structure is influenced by traditional serif fonts such as Caslon rather than being strongly based on straight lines and circles as Futura is.|$|R
5|$|More loosely, Syntax by Hans Eduard Meier {{is similar}} in some ways. Released in 1968 and praised by Tschichold, it was {{intended}} to be a more dynamic, handwriting-influenced <b>sans-serif</b> form. Its italic is, however, more of an oblique than Gill's. Hypatia Sans, designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe, was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design. Many other fonts are influenced by Gill Sans to some extent.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) {{overprint}}s debuted on 11 December 1922. This is a three-line overprint using a <b>sans-serif</b> typeface and {{was done}} by Thom, Harrison and the Government Printers. The last overprinted stamps were the Waterlow & Sons re-engraved King George V 2/6, 5/- and 10/- values that appeared in 1934 and were overprinted in 1937 for use in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a <b>sans-serif</b> font.|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} typefaces is {{described}} as straight-sided technical <b>sans-serifs</b> flexible for editorial and identity design.|$|R
25|$|The influences, {{sources and}} {{engravers}} of Akzidenz-Grotesk {{are not fully}} known, although it descends from a school of general-purpose <b>sans-serifs</b> cut in the nineteenth century. Research {{is complicated by the}} very large number of type foundries active in Germany during this period. <b>Sans-serifs</b> had become very popular in Germany by the late nineteenth century, with many type foundries offering different versions. Berthold literature from the 1920s dated the design to 1898.|$|R
500|$|The {{proportions}} of Gill Sans stem from monumental Roman capitals {{in the upper}} case, and traditional [...] "old-style" [...] serif letters in the lower. This gives Gill Sans a very different style of design to geometric <b>sans-serifs</b> like Futura, based on simple squares and circles, or realist or grotesque designs like Akzidenz-Grotesk, Helvetica and Univers influenced by nineteenth-century lettering styles. For example, compared to realist <b>sans-serifs</b> the [...] "C" [...] and [...] "a" [...] have a much less [...] "folded up" [...] structure, with wider apertures. The [...] "a" [...] and [...] "g" [...] in the roman or regular style are [...] "double-storey" [...] designs, rather than the [...] "single-storey" [...] forms used in handwriting and blackletter often found in grotesque and especially geometric <b>sans-serifs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a <b>sans-serif</b> Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} fourth batches of {{streamlined}} locomotives, Nos. 6225–6229 and 6235–6244, were painted in crimson lake, with banding in gold lined with vermilion and black. Nameplates had a black background. LMS shop grey was carried briefly in service on No. 6229 Duchess of Hamilton from 7 September 1938 until its return to Crewe Works later that year. It was then painted crimson lake and disguised as No. 6220, {{in preparation for the}} 1939 visit to the New York World's Fair. Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and crimson lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded <b>sans-serif.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their <b>sans-serif</b> Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
50|$|At {{first in}} Britain 'Egyptian' {{was used for}} <b>sans-serifs</b> and 'Antique' for slab-serifs; the two names later {{somewhat}} blurred or swapped.|$|R
5000|$|Industrial: used {{to refer}} to {{grotesque}} and neo-grotesque <b>sans-serifs,</b> that unlike humanist, geometric and decorative designs are not based on [...] "artistic" [...] principles.|$|R
25|$|Like most {{grotesque}} <b>sans-serifs,</b> Akzidenz-Grotesk's slanted form is {{an oblique}} {{rather than a}} true italic. This means that the letters are slanted without using handwriting forms.|$|R
25|$|Ming and <b>sans-serif</b> are {{the most}} popular in body text and are based on regular script for Chinese {{characters}} akin to Western serif and <b>sans-serif</b> typefaces, respectively. Regular script typefaces emulate regular script.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sans-serif</b> {{typeface}}s, called black typeface (黑体 / 黑體, hēitǐ) in Chinese and Gothic typeface (ゴシック体) in Japanese, {{are characterized}} by simple lines of even thickness for each stroke, akin to <b>sans-serif</b> styles such as Arial and Helvetica in Western typography.|$|E
25|$|The {{typeface}} {{used for}} the motto is sometimes a serif typeface and other times <b>sans-serif.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Antique - {{the first}} name used for {{slab-serifs}}, but in France often used for <b>sans-serifs.</b> Sometimes taken to mean slab-serifs in the nineteenth-century style with Didone letterforms and thick, square slab-serifs.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Gill Sans on the {{nameplate}} of Mallard. It was {{marketed as}} a sophisticated refinement of earlier <b>sans-serifs,</b> taking inspiration from Roman capitals and designer Eric Gill's experience carving monuments and memorials.|$|R
25|$|Like most <b>sans-serifs</b> Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} of quite similar width. This gives a sense of {{simplicity}} and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative <b>sans-serifs</b> {{of the late nineteenth}} century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard types in the nineteenth century, such as Didot and Walbaum. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of modern}} printed styles are Song from the Song Dynasty's {{printing}} press, and <b>sans-serif.</b> These {{are not considered}} traditional styles, and are normally not written.|$|E
25|$|New {{paragraphs}} start after {{chapter and}} section headings. Within each section, however, paragraph breaks are {{indicated by the}} traditional Chinese pilcrow, a thin, <b>sans-serif</b> circle {{about the size of}} a Chinese character.|$|E
25|$|In Hunmin Jeongeum, Hangul {{was printed}} in <b>sans-serif</b> angular lines of even thickness. This style {{is found in}} books {{published}} before about 1900, {{and can be found}} today in stone carvings (on statues, for example).|$|E
5000|$|... 'Gothic' was {{an early}} twentieth century term for <b>sans-serifs,</b> found mostly in the United States and Canada. It was also used in the UK, along with 'grotesque'. In Germany the term 'Grotesk' was used.|$|R
50|$|Arial is a neo-grotesque typeface: {{a design}} {{based on the}} {{influence}} of nineteenth-century <b>sans-serifs,</b> but made more regular and even to be more suited to continuous body text and to form a cohesive family of fonts.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the post-war}} period and {{particularly}} in Switzerland a revival in Akzidenz-Grotesk's popularity took hold, in {{what became known as}} the [...] "Swiss International Style" [...] of graphic design. This style often contrasted Akzidenz-Grotesk with photographic art, and did not use all caps as much as many older posters. Graphic designers of this style such as Karl Gerstner found the <b>sans-serifs</b> of the nineteenth-century more [...] "neutral" [...] and even than the more [...] "personal" [...] recent <b>sans-serifs</b> of the previous decades. Eskilson's Graphic Design: A New History comments that they [...] "conveyed the functionalist ethos without appearing too stylised...in the manner of the more geometrically pure types." ...|$|R
