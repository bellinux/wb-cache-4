5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|Steve Neal, McNary's biographer, {{describes}} McNary as {{a progressive}} who <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party in 1910 even when many progressives left {{the party in}} favor of West, a Democrat. McNary backed the Progressive Era reforms (the initiative, recall, referendum, primary elections, and the direct election of US senators) of Oregonian William Simon U'Ren, {{and he was an}} early supporter of public, rather than private, power companies. After West won the election, he chose McNary to be special legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative factions of the Oregon Republicans and with West.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} also {{focused on the}} divorce's effects on Milhouse {{and there was a}} subplot that {{involved}} Bart being jealous of Milhouse and wishing that Marge and Homer would also separate. Several scenes were written and animated for the episode, but ultimately they were cut because the script was very long. The third act of the episode shifts the focus from the Van Houtens to Homer and Marge because the writers felt that tertiary characters could not carry an audience's interest for an entire episode. Bill Oakley has said that he felt the episode would have failed had they <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Van Houtens for the third act and most of the other writers also felt that it was the right move.|$|E

25|$|Ford Australia {{introduced}} {{some local}} design {{changes to the}} XL in early 1962, such as a heavier suspension system with components from the Fairlane. Also, the appearance was changed with a new Thunderbird roofline. The slogan was 'Trim, Taut, Terrific'. Nevertheless, the Falcon was still widely perceived as unsuitable for local conditions and sales stagnated. Ford <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Falcon and sales gradually increased over the following years as improvements to durability and reliability were applied.|$|E

25|$|The {{life of a}} miner in {{the mother}} lode of California might have been {{somewhat}} of a shock to Fairfax, who grew up as a gentleman farmer, but he <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> endeavor for a while.

25|$|Dyson {{helped design}} the Sea Truck in 1970 while {{studying}} at the Royal College of Art.

Lockheed eventually selected the Rolls-Royce RB211, but Douglas <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CF6 and the DC-10 entered service in 1971. It was also selected for versions of the Boeing 747.

25|$|It was {{estimated}} that the IRA carried out 1,000 armed robberies in Northern Ireland, mostly of banks and post offices. It was accused {{of involvement in the}} biggest bank raid in Irish history—the 2004 Northern Bank robbery—when £26.5 million was stolen from the Northern Bank in Belfast city centre. The PSNI, the Independent Monitoring Commission and the British and Irish governments all accused the IRA of involvement. It is suggested that the IRA needed the money to pay pensions to its volunteers, and to ensure that hardliners <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> peace strategy. The IRA denied involvement, however.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{adopted by the}} armies of at least five European nations as their {{standard}} pistol cartridge before World War II; Czechoslovakia (Vz.38), Hungary (FEMARU 37M), and Italy, all of whom used domestic designs, as well as The Netherlands and Yugoslavia, both of whom adopted the FN Model 1922. It was also used extensively by Germany, who captured or purchased {{hundreds of thousands of}} pistols in this caliber during World War II. Popular German built commercial models, such as the Walther PPK were very popular with German officers.

25|$|The institutionally {{independent}} {{foundation of}} Paul Gerhardt Stift, located in Müllerstraße 58 {{at the corner}} with Barfusstraße within the parochial boundaries, was run by deaconesses. The staff was divided in its allegiances to the German Christians and the Confessing Christians. While the institution's two chaplains, Pastor Urner and Pastor Hermann Wagner <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Confessing Church, the matron deaconess sided with the German Christians. In the morning prayers led by her she included Adolf Hitler in her rogations, while the two pastors on their turn never did so. The deaconess leading the medical station of the Paul Gerhardt Stift, an active Confessing Christian in the neighbouring Nazareth Congregation, and other colleagues of her, continued to treat Jewish patients even after this was strictly forbidden in 1938 and therefore could not be invoiced to the health insurance anymore.|$|E
25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen {{for the fact that}} the land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, the taxpayers would be <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have been spending for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes on to explain that the accommodations made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E
25|$|By October 2010, {{no major}} {{redevelopment}} goals had been met. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee strongly criticized GSA {{in a report}} for mismanaging the Old Post Office Building. The report specifically accused GSA of not moving to redevelop the property during a real estate boom in 2006. When the boom ended, GSA was <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> property, and the House committee accused the agency of losing more than $25 million on maintenance rather than generating income. With pressure building on the White House to deal with billions {{of dollars worth of}} excess or underutilized federal property, the Barack Obama administration said it would take action to more quickly dispose of property like the Old Post Office. Rather than sell property at fire sale prices, the administration created a new independent advisory panel to help create a disposal plan for each individual building. D.C. area lawmakers pressed the advisory panel to act immediately on the Old Post Office. Douglas Firstenberg, a principal with StonebridgeCarras, a real estate property management firm that helped the federal government lease buildings, said that historic preservation restrictions and the large number of existing tenants made redevelopment difficult.|$|E

25|$|During the 2008 off-season, Wellwood broke a bone in {{his right}} foot while playing indoor soccer. With his {{contract}} set to expire, the Leafs placed him on waivers on June 24. He was claimed the following day by the Vancouver Canucks and was subsequently signed to a one-year, $998,000 contract. Reporting to training camp, he failed his initial fitness test and, although he passed a later evaluation, he was a healthy scratch to begin the season. On October 17, after having played just one game for the Canucks, he was placed on waivers by the team; after clearing, {{he was assigned to}} the Manitoba Moose of the AHL. Because the addition of Wellwood would have put the Moose over the limit for veteran players, Wellwood began assessing playing options in Europe; however, two days after clearing waivers, injuries to the Canucks prompted them to recall Wellwood to the NHL; he cleared re-entry waivers 24 hours later. Wellwood took advantage of this opportunity by scoring a goal and an assist in a 4–2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets, and he <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club. Later in the season, on February 17, 2009, Wellwood ended a streak of 159 games without a penalty by taking a high-sticking penalty against the Calgary Flames. It was his first penalty since April 11, 2006. Wellwood ended his first regular season in Vancouver with 18 goals and nine assists. Having never reached the Stanley Cup playoffs with Toronto, Wellwood made his NHL playoff debut with the Canucks in 2009 and scored his first NHL playoff goal in Game 4 of the first round against the St. Louis Blues, helping Vancouver complete a four-game sweep after a 3–2 overtime win.|$|E
