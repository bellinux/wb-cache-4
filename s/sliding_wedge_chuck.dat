40|$|The <b>slide</b> <b>wedge</b> device has {{at least}} one pair if opposingly movable <b>slide</b> <b>wedge</b> {{components}} (14), which by means of tension devices (16) are tensioned radially inwards, locating on the base plate (20) and the wedge pressure plate (12). The tension on the <b>slide</b> <b>wedge</b> components can be invalidated with little delay, and is adjustable. The wedge pressure plate may have one or more wedge surfaces with a wedge angle corresponding to that of the <b>slide</b> <b>wedge</b> components. The wedge pressure plate can be axially slidably movably accommodated in a housing (18) with an axial end stop for it. ADVANTAGE - With technically simple means, a secure press power transmission is made possible and the arrangement also offers a rapidly and easily releasable overload protection...|$|R
50|$|The A407 100mm {{anti-tank}} gun {{was the first}} artillery piece designed in Romania after World War II. The first variant of the gun, the M1975 (M stands for Model) had a semi-automatic horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> type breech lock.

25|$|Armstrong {{developed}} an alternative horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> {{version of his}} breechloader, for 40-pounder and 64-pounder guns, {{in an attempt to}} address the limitations of the screw breech, but the Government had already decided to return to muzzle-loading guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{central shaft}} was rotated by {{synchronous}} motor, driving an eccentric with a throw of about 2mm. (0.077 inch) Push-rods from this operated the contacts. The timing was critical, and was adjusted by rotating {{the position of}} the eccentric on its shaft, and by <b>sliding</b> <b>wedges</b> between the eccentric and push-rods.|$|R
30|$|The type {{of failure}} in tunnel is {{predictable}} using the strength factor. If the strength and in situ stress are close to each other, the failure in the tunnel would have structural control, i.e., falling and/or <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> from wall and roof. In this state, the behavior of discontinuities will be more important.|$|R
50|$|The F1 is {{fitted with}} a {{semi-automatic}} vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> breechblock, though fitted without a muzzle brake. Unlike the similar 105mm L7 tank gun, the F1 uses a compressed air scavenging system instead of a bore evacuator. The recoil mechanism uses two symmetrically opposed hydraulic brake cylinders with a single hydropneumatic recuperator cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|The 21 cm SK L/45 was {{constructed}} of A tube, {{two layers of}} hoops, a jacket and used a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> breech block.

2500|$|Every {{retaining}} wall supports a “wedge” of soil. The wedge {{is defined as}} the soil which extends beyond the failure plane of the soil type present at the wall site, and can be calculated once the soil friction angle is known.

50|$|The {{key feature}} of the Linotype {{is the use of}} molds which {{circulate}} through the machine in its various stages of operation. One type is a space band (a special two-part <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge)</b> and the other is a letter matrix made of brass. The matrices are stored in one or more magazines on top of the machine (providing the operator with a choice of fonts; these can also be exchanged with other extra magazines as desired) while the space bands are stored in a box closer to the keyboard.|$|R
50|$|The 15 cm SK L/45 was {{a widely}} used naval gun on many classes of World War I Dreadnoughts and Cruisers in both casemates and turrets.

50|$|Most late-19th-century {{warships}} mounted naval artillery of {{more than}} one caliber because of uncertainty about the relative destruction possible from a few large shells (which might miss) in comparison to the increased hit probability of a larger number of less damaging small-caliber shells fired within the same time period. Quick-firing guns were initially breech-loading weapons firing ammunition small enough to be loaded by hand. Later substitution of brass cartridges for silk powder bags allowed increased rates of fire using <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> breech blocks. Increasing mechanization ultimately enabled similar rates of fire from naval artillery calibers up to 8 in.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Hotchkiss and Nordenfelt guns loaded {{ammunition}} as {{a single}} cartridge with projectile, cartridge case and primer in a single unit. The cartridge case sealed the breech on firing and a vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> (block) locked it in place. These new guns incorporated recoil control devices which facilitated consistency of aim, allowed single-motion loading and could be fired {{as soon as the}} cartridge was inserted, and then ejected it after firing, these properties denoting a [...] "quick-firing" [...] gun. This set a new standard for artillery, and made firing cycles measured in seconds rather than minutes possible.|$|R
25|$|Since {{it weighs}} only 400 pounds {{more than the}} Model 41 cavalry gun, it is {{possible}} that the Model 95 may have been intended to replace that weapon. However, its use on Saipan and its close resemblance to the heavier Model 90 may indicate that the latter weapon was too heavy for efficient horse-draft, and too complex for the capabilities of Japanese industry. Though the Model 95 was split-trailed, it actually weighed less than the improved Model 38 75mm gun. The Model 95 was much lighter than its Schneider prototype, and had a <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> rather than an interrupted thread breechblock. It incorporated all features of modern Japanese design.|$|R

In addition to guns produced for the Imperial German Navy comparable export models were produced for the Royal Netherlands Navy and produced under license by Škoda for the Austro-Hungarian Navy.|$|R
50|$|For quick-firing guns {{the charge}} is {{contained}} in a brass case to which is fitted a primer for igniting the charge. This case is inserted into the gun, and when fired slightly expands and tightly fits the chamber of the gun, thus acting as an obturator and preventing any escape of gas from the breech. This class of ammunition is especially useful for the smaller calibres of guns, such as 3-pounder (1.4 kg), 6-pounder (2.7 kg) and field guns, but Messrs. Krupp also employ metallic cartridge cases for the largest type of gun, probably {{on account of the}} known difficulty of ensuring trustworthy obturation by any other means practicable with <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> guns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first version}} weighed 32 cwt, {{followed}} by the 35 cwt version which introduced a longer and stronger breech-piece. A 32 cwt variant having a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> breech instead of the Armstrong screw with vertical vent-piece was introduced in 1864 {{as an attempt to}} address the perceived weaknesses of the screw-breech design. It was withdrawn from service by 1877.From 1880 a small number of 35 cwt guns had their trunnion rings rotated to the left to allow the vent-piece to open horizontally to the right, being known as [...] "side-closing" [...] guns. They differed from the wedge guns in that the vent piece was still locked in place by tightening the screw behind it.|$|R
40|$|Mass {{movement}} {{processes of}} bedrock slopes are {{highly dependent on}} the orientations of structural discontinuities within the rock mass. The associated hazards are typically defined by the orientation of structures and associated mechanisms of slope failure such as planar <b>sliding,</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>sliding</b> and toppling. A typical rock mass with multiple weak surfaces, or discontinuities, may form a consistent pattern over a range of spatial scale. The type of hazard resulting from the pattern of discontinuities will {{vary according to the}} angle and direction of the slope face. Assessing the risk of rock slope instability involves understanding of the complex three-dimensional structural features of the rock mass. Recent developments in stereographic methods show advantages are gained by representing wedges by linking great circles rather than showing the intersection line on the stereograph. We applied these methods to three rock slopes where active mass movement has occurred. The case studies include a large rock slide-debris avalanche in the Philippines, coastal cliffs in Australia and mining excavation slopes in Ghana, West Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of tailings dams in earthquakes prone areas {{has become a}} matter of increasing concern as seismic knowledge has advanced. For the seismic slope stability assessment of tailings dam, majority of current design methodologies rely on the use of pseudo‐static approach. However, the crude estimate of finding approximate seismic accelerations makes the pseudo‐static approach too conservative to adopt in the stability assessment. In this paper, horizontal slice method is used which considers the seismic inertia forces acting on the <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> of the tailings dam by incorporating the effects of time, phase difference and amplification in shear and primary waves along with the horizontal and vertical seismic accelerations and other soil properties. Results are provided in the graphical form for the stability analysis of tailings dam...|$|R
5000|$|... == Construction == The Škoda 7 cm {{guns were}} {{developed}} and {{built at the}} Pilsen works between 1892 through 1918. The barrel was made of steel with a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> breech, they used fixed quick fire ammunition and most ranged in length between 26 and 45 calibers. There was a single hydraulic recoil cylinder beneath the barrel and most were aimed by shoulder pads. The G. L/18 was a landing gun which could be taken ashore to provide support for a landing party. Initially these guns were deployed as anti-torpedo boat guns and had an elevation of -10° to +20°. Škoda engineers later developed anti-aircraft mounts which could elevate from -10° to +90°, but the ballistic performance for the guns remained the same.|$|R
5000|$|The 10.5/50 system {{consists}} of an armored turret which is unmanned above ground, and an automatic magazine. The gun is a fully automatic, water-cooled <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> design which is automatically laid in both traverse and elevation.

Spent cartridges are ejected from a hatch on the turret's rear face. 10.5/50 is known for a switch located in the magazine which is marked [...] "war-peace" [...] (krig-fred). This selected between half and full rate of fire and was normally locked in the [...] "peace" [...] position using a padlock. The lower rate of fire was normally used in peacetime because it meant less wear on the various mechanical systems.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper briefly {{describes}} an experimental program of shaking table tests on reduced-scale models of seismic buffer systems used to mitigate earthquake-induced loads against rigid walls. The physical load-time responses from selected tests are compared to predictions using three different numerical approaches: (a) simple <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> (block); (b) dynamic {{finite difference method}} (FLAC) using linear-elastic plastic Mohr-Coulomb model with Raleigh damping, and (c) as (b) but using the equivalent-linear method (ELM) which incorporates hysteretic load-unload cycles using Masing-type functions and strain-dependent shear modulus and damping ratio functions. All three approaches captured the qualitative trends in measured load response {{and in many cases}} there was good quantitative agreement. The simple linear-elastic plastic Mohr-Coulomb model was judged to be sufficiently accurate for future parametric analyses of prototype-scale seismic buffer systems. ...|$|R

50|$|The failure {{mechanisms}} are divided in orientation dependent and orientation independent. Orientation dependent {{failure mechanisms}} {{depend on the}} orientation of the slope with respect to {{the orientation of the}} discontinuities in the rock mass, i.e. <b>sliding</b> (plane and <b>wedge</b> <b>sliding)</b> and toppling failure. Orientation independent relates to the possibility that a slope fails independently from its orientation, e.g. circular failure completely through newly formed discontinuities in intact rock blocks, or failing partially following existing discontinuities and partially new discontinuities.|$|R
50|$|The Type 1 37 mm AT Gun was {{basically}} a Type 94 37 mm AT gun with a slightly longer gun barrel. As with the Type 94, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a squat or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. It used a semi-automatic breech block with a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge.</b> When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected and upon loading a fresh shell the breech block closed automatically. A hydrospring recoil mechanism was housed under barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel disc wheels fitted with sponge rubber filled tires.|$|R
50|$|The 12/70 gun is a fully automatic, {{water-cooled}} vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> design {{mounted in}} an armored turret which is electrically traversed under computer control while the elevation motor is controlled manually (presumably a cost-cutting measure). It {{is fed from}} a magazine several meters below ground where the crew uses special air-cushion carts to feed cartridges onto a loading table. From the loading table the cartridge is fed through a hoist system and loaded into the gun using a pendulum loader. Spent cartridges are passed down a chute into a space {{at the bottom of}} the gun well, which is over 18 m deep on tapj 9101 and a few meters less on tapj 9102. The turret is manned by three men (gun commander, traverse operator and elevation operator) with the rest of the gun crew working in the magazine or the installation below.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet 130mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun KS-30 {{appeared in the}} early 1950s, closely resembling the German wartime 12.8 cm FlaK 40 antiaircraft gun. The KS-30 {{was used for the}} home defense forces of the USSR and some other Warsaw Pact countries. Recognition features are the heavy dual-tire carriage, a firing platform which folds up to a 45 degree angle when the piece is in travel, and the long clean tube without a muzzle brake. The breechblock is of the semi-automatic horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> type, and the piece is fitted with a power rammer and an automatic fuze setter. Fire control is provided by the PUAZO-30 director and the SON-30 radar. The ammunition is of the fixed-charge, separated type. It is not interchangeable with that of the 130mm field or coastal guns. The KS-30 is now held in war reserve since it was replaced by surface-to-air guided missiles.|$|R
