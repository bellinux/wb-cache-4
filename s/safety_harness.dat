5|$|One of the depot's wartime {{commanding}} officers was Wing Commander John Lerew, {{who held}} the post from December 1942 until November 1943. During his tenure, after investigating the crash of a Vultee Vengeance, he designed a clip to prevent the accidental release of the pilot's <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> which was later adopted for all such harnesses. By January 1945, No.1 AD's strength had increased to its highest level of 2,339 staff.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his <b>safety</b> <b>harness</b> broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E

5|$|The next {{scheduled}} {{match was}} a singles {{match for the}} WWF Intercontinental Title between The Godfather (champion) and the Blue Blazer. As Hart descended into the ring on a <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> the equipment gave way, and he fell. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) rushed him to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. The show was halted for 15minutes before it continued with the next match. The fourth scheduled contest was the Mixed tag team match that featured Val Venis and Nicole Bass facing Jeff Jarrett and Debra. At one point, Jarrett gained possession of a guitar and attempted to hit Bass with it, but Venis took the guitar away and lifted Jarrett from behind to drop him onto the mat; he then pinned Jarrett. In the fourth match of the evening, Billy Gunn defeated his former tag team partner Road Dogg, after hitting him with the time keeper's hammer.|$|E
25|$|When {{large amounts}} of weight are needed, a harness {{may be used to}} carry the load on the diver's shoulders, rather than around the waist, where it may tend to slip down into an uncomfortable {{position}} if the diver is working in a vertical posture, which is often the case. Sometimes this is a separate harness, worn under the <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> with pockets at the sides to carry the weights, and sometimes it is an integrated system, which carries the weight in pockets built into or externally attached to the <b>safety</b> <b>harness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surface-supplied divers often {{carry their}} weights {{securely}} attached {{to reduce the}} risk of accidentally dropping them during a dive and losing control of their buoyancy. These may be carried on a weight belt with a secure buckle, supported by a weight harness, connected directly to the diving <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> or suspended from the corselet of the helmet. Heavily weighted boots may also be used to stabilise the diver in an upright position.|$|E

25|$|The {{season finale}} {{required}} numerous computer-generated imagery. At {{the start of}} the episode, Jor-El's disembodied voice talks to Clark through the spaceship. For this scene, Entity FX created a completely computer-generated model of the ship, because the ship had to transform into multiple objects as the scene progressed, creating it digitally was the best option. Later in the episode, when Clark refuses to leave Smallville, Jor-El brands him with a Kryptonian tattoo. Brian Harding worked on the tattoo that is placed on Clark's chest, creating an effect {{based on the idea that}} it appeared to burn from the inside. For the same scene, Beck and his team had to digitally create a bare chest for Welling's stunt double, who had to wear a shirt to hide the <b>safety</b> <b>harness</b> he was wearing when they dropped him in the moment Clark is released from the ship's hold.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} rocket, the {{collapse}} of the gravity field causes Toby to reveal the mind of the Beast is still possessing him as he taunts the others while breathing out fire. Rose takes Captain Zach's bolt gun and shoots out the rocket's front window, unhooking Toby's <b>safety</b> <b>harness</b> to jettison the possessed man into space towards the black hole. The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket turns away from the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not have time to go back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E
500|$|The {{machine was}} a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot {{standing}} on a platform, secured by a <b>safety</b> <b>harness.</b> The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an outboard motor manufactured by Mercury Marine. The engine was controlled by a twist-grip motorcycle-style throttle and transferred power to the [...] diameter, contra-rotating rotors via belt drive with a chain reduction unit. The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags {{at the end of}} each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability, although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{hosted a}} press conference, where she {{introduced}} Volantis, a battery-powered vehicle described as [...] "the world's first flying dress." [...] The white vehicle, described by Entertainment Weekly as a [...] "hover dress", features a central column {{to which the}} wearer is clamped by a <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> in turn covered by a white plastic [...] "dress". The column also houses the batteries and other equipment. Six lifting fan units are mounted on booms in a hexagonal formation radiating {{from the top of}} the column, giving the device the ability to hover three feet above the ground. The dress was designed by TechHaus, the Haus of Gaga's technology branch, and it took them two years to create.|$|E
500|$|The film's SQUID scenes, {{which offer}} a point-of-view shot (POV), {{required}} multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce {{the effect of}} looking through someone else's eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially [...] "a stripped-down Arri that weighed {{much less than the}} smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses." [...] Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance. The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> took two years to co-ordinate. According to Cameron, [...] "It's a major set piece. For the jump alone, we built special cameras, special rigs. We designed transitions that would work seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn't look technical." ...|$|E
500|$|Thies's team {{extracted}} Koga's {{body from}} the plane by having Knack (the smallest crew member) crawl up inside the plane and cut his <b>safety</b> <b>harness</b> with a knife. [...] They searched it for anything with intelligence value, and buried Koga in a shallow grave near the crash site. Thies returned with his team to Dutch Harbor, where he reported the plane as salvageable. The next day (July 12), a salvage team under Lieutenant Robert Kirmse was dispatched to Akutan. This team gave Koga a Christian burial in a nearby knoll and set about recovering the plane, {{but the lack of}} heavy equipment (which they had been unable to unload after the delivery ship lost two anchors) meant their efforts failed. On July 15, a third recovery team was dispatched. This time, with proper heavy equipment, the team was able to free the Zero from the mud and hauled it overland to a nearby barge, without further damaging it. The Zero was taken to Dutch Harbor, turned right-side up, and cleaned.|$|E
50|$|Being filmed on {{the water}} (in the Polish Lake District Masuria), and largely within the {{confines}} of a sailboat and liferaft, the film was technically difficult. While the sailboat was large enough for the three actors, it was quite cramped for the film crew, who often had to hang {{over the side of the}} boat with <b>safety</b> <b>harnesses</b> in order to shoot.|$|R

500|$|Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base {{commands}} including RAAF Station Townsville, RAAF Station Nowra in New South Wales, and Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory. He led No.7 Squadron, operating Bristol Beauforts out {{of first}} Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He {{then returned to}} RAAF Station Laverton {{to take charge of}} No.1 Aircraft Depot (No.1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: [...] "...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No.1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a Vultee Vengeance flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.|$|E

2500|$|Project {{costs were}} between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's {{financial}} support (and with it, their demand of a <b>safety</b> <b>harness).</b> [...] "I'd dare say that {{never in the}} history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much," [...] said Wallenda. [...] The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. [...] "It's been a tough situation all around", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the <b>safety</b> <b>harness</b> for inhibiting sponsorship deals. [...] When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. [...] He eventually met his goal of $50,000. [...] Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. [...] Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. [...] The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. [...] After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was [...] "clearly worth it" [...] in the long term. [...] With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. [...] The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. [...] "I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case," [...] he commented.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{experiments}} performed on the show, many have not gone as expected. Sometimes, these mishaps have rendered the test equipment unusable, such as when the rocket in the [...] "Rocket Car Revisit" [...] exploded on ignition. Others have even resulted in minor injuries to the personnel involved with the show, such as when Tory banged his knee falling off a fire tower; the fall was expected and prepared for using a <b>safety</b> <b>harness,</b> but him injuring his knee was not foreseen.
