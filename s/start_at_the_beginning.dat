25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{with tape}} leaders {{was that the}} sound recording or playback did not <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the tape, forcing the user to cue forward {{to the start of}} the magnetic section. For certain applications, such as dictation, special cassettes containing leaderless tapes were made, typically with stronger material and for use in machines that had more sophisticated end-of-tape prediction. Home computers that made use of cassettes prior to the advent of floppy discs (i.e. Apple II, Commodore PET) were designed to not start writing or reading data until leaders had spooled past.|$|E

No DVDs have been released in the U.S. but were released on VHS.|$|E
25|$|Beginners {{often make}} the mistake of not {{relaxing}} the arm during the recovery and of moving the hand too high and too far away from the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often forget to use their shoulders to let the hand enter as far forward as possible. Some say the hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely bent down, giving thrust right from the <b>start.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.|$|E
