30|$|The {{fact that}} the active front of the initial {{condition}} covers the whole image has a special consequence, namely, separate, disjoint regions of the same object or multiple target objects can be found automatically without user interaction. For example, the grey matter of the brain on an MRI slice is disconnected and may be composed of 8 to 20 disjointed regions on the given slice. The problem of detecting all regions is greatly simplified with our dense initial condition. Similarly, the <b>selected</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> on a histology image shows this property as well. Additionally, histology images can be extremely large (2 to 30 Mpixel), and the performance gain of our proposed method (initial condition together with the parallel algorithm) becomes more expressed on larger images. A conventional sparse initialization can easily fail this task, with wrongly chosen initial condition, see for instance the initialization and evolution of a gold standard LS implementation of [25], which is a widely used framework for medical image segmentation and analysis.|$|E
40|$|It is {{intriguing}} that some pan-caspase inhibitors such as zVAD-fmk (zVAD) {{are capable of}} inducing necrotic cell death in a <b>selected</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> As earlier reports from our laboratory have ruled out the original notion that zVAD-induced necrosis in mouse fibrosarcoma L 929 cells was autophagic cell death, the main objective {{of this study was}} thus to determine the underlying mechanism of this form of cell death. In this study, we provided clear evidence that zVAD-induced necroptosis in L 929 cells and such cell death is dependent on autocrine production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) at the transcriptional level. More importantly, we identified that activating protein- 1 (AP- 1), but not nuclear factor κ-B, is the transcription factor controlling zVAD-induced TNFα transcription. Moreover, zVAD is able to activate AP- 1 through activation of two upstream mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Finally, we found that protein kinase C is the important upstream signaling molecule in mediating zVAD-induced activation of MAPKs and AP- 1, and subsequent autocrine production of TNFα and cell death. Data from this study reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying zVAD-induced necroptosis, an important form of programmed necrotic cell death with increasing understanding of its biological significance in health and diseases...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{free-standing}} microfluidic pipette made in poly(dimethylsiloxane) having a circulating liquid tip that generates a self-con-fining volume {{in front of the}} outlet channels. The method is flexible and scalable as the geometry {{and the size of the}} recirculation zone is defined by pressure, channel number, and geometry. The pipette is capable of carrying out a variety of complex fluid processing operations, such as mixing, multiplexing, or gradient generation at selected cells in cell and tissue cultures. Using an uptake assay, we show that it is possible to generate dose response curves in situ from adherent Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing proton-activated human transient receptor potential vanilloid (hTRPV 1) receptors. Using confined superfusion and cell stimulation, we could activate hTRPV 1 receptors in single cells, measure the response by a patch-clamp pipette, and induce membrane bleb formation by exposing <b>selected</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> to formaldehyde/dithiothreitol-containing solutions, respectively. In short, the microfluidic pipette allows for complex, contamination-free multiple-compound delivery for pharmacological screening <b>of</b> intact adherent <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{pulmonary}} hypertension, induced in rats breathing high oxygen at normobaric pressure, {{vascular cell}} hypertrophy and hyperplasia thicken {{the walls of}} lung microvessels (15 - 100 microns in diameter). Over a 28 -day time course, new contractile cells develop from intimal precursor smooth muscle cells, which include intermediate cells and interstitial fibroblasts. Cell labeling studies in vivo have shown that these cells proliferate more than other vascular cells and that most of this activity occurs between 4 and 7 days of hyperoxia. The growth factors responsible for this proliferation are unknown. In the present study, we investigate the expression of mRNA for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) -related protein, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a newly discovered mitogen for fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Northern analysis shows HB-EGF mRNA levels to be low in normal lung but increased 100 -fold by day 7 of hyperoxia. In situ hybridization identifies a <b>select</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> expressing HB-EGF mRNA. In normal lung, hybridizing cells are randomly distributed in the alveolar wall and space. By day 7, they increase in number and cluster around the microvessels. Histochemical techniques identify cells expressing HB-EGF mRNA as eosinophils...|$|R

40|$|Normal adult {{cerebellar}} Purkinje {{cells in}} the rat rarely express low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity. However, intense anti-low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor immunostaining was observed as early as one day after a lesion of the cerebellar cortex. Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity was confined to a <b>selected</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Purkinje <b>cells,</b> the number <b>of</b> which reached a maximum at three days postlesion, and, in some neurons, persisted up to 10 days after damage. The intensity <b>of</b> Purkinje <b>cell</b> immunolabeling decayed abruptly with distance from the lesion site.

Characteristically, most Purkinje cell axons exhibiting intense low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity had beaded, varicose morphology. Varicose fibres {{with the appearance of}} recurrent collaterals <b>of</b> Purkinje <b>cell</b> axons were also low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor-positive. Our results indicate that adult rat Purkinje cells increase low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive protein in response to injury, suggesting that, in the cerebellum, low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor or low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor-like molecules may be involved in regulating neuronal plasticity during adulthood.

40|$|When {{plants are}} {{infected}} with avirulent pathogens, a <b>selected</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>cells</b> rapidly die in a process commonly called the hypersensitive response (HR). Some mutations and overexpression of some unrelated genes mimic the HR lesion and associated defense responses. In all of these situations, a genetically programmed cell death pathway is activated wherein the cell actively participates in killing itself. Here we report a developmentally and environmentally regulated HR-like cell death in potato leaves constitutively expressing bacterial pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). Lesions first appeared {{on the tip of}} fully expanded source leaves. Lesion formation was accompanied by activation of multiple defense responses and resulted in a significant resistance toPhytophthora infestans. The transgenic plants showed a five- to 12 -fold increase in leaf tissue acetaldehyde and exported two- to 10 -fold higher amounts of sucrose compared to the wild-type. When plants were grown at a higher temperature, both the lesion phenotype and sucrose export were restored to wild-type situations. The reduced levels of acetaldehyde at the elevated temperature suggested that the interplay of acetaldehyde with environmental and physiological factors is the inducer of lesion development. We propose that sugar metabolism plays {{a crucial role in the}} execution <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> death programs in plants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from cuneate neurons of chloralose-anesthetized, paralysed cats to study the synaptic responses induced by electrical stimulation of the contralateral medial lemniscus. From a total <b>of</b> 178 <b>cells</b> sampled, 109 were antidromically fired from the medial lemniscus, 82 of which showed spontaneous bursting activity. In contrast, the great majority (58 / 69) of the non-lemniscal neurons presented spontaneous single spike activity. Medial lemniscus stimulation induced recurrent excitation and inhibition on cuneolemniscal and non-lemniscal cells. Some non-lemniscal neurons were activated by somatosensory cortex and inhibited by motor cortex stimulation. Some other non-lemniscal cells that {{did not respond to}} medial lemniscus stimulation in control conditions were transcortically affected by stimulating the medial lemniscus after inducing paroxysmal activity in the sensorimotor cortex. These findings indicate that different sites in the sensorimotor cortex can differentially influence the sensory transmission through the cuneate, and that the distinct available corticocuneate routes are selected within the cerebral cortex. From a total <b>of</b> 92 <b>cells</b> tested, the initial effect induced by low-frequency stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex was inhibition on most of the cuneolemniscal neurons (32 / 52) and excitation on the majority <b>of</b> the non-lemniscal <b>cells</b> (25 / 40). The fact that a substantial proportion of cuneolemniscal and non-lemniscal cells was excited and inhibited, respectively, suggests that the cerebral cortex may potentiate certain inputs by exciting and disinhibiting <b>selected</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> cuneolemniscal <b>cells.</b> Finally, evidence is presented demonstrating that the tendency of the cuneolemniscal neurons to fire in high-frequency spike burst...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} {{recognized that the}} tumor microenvironment plays {{a critical role in}} the initiation and progression of lung cancer. In particular interaction <b>of</b> cancer <b>cells,</b> macrophages, and inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to facilitate cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The specific molecular pathways in macrophages that immunoedit tumor growth are not well defined. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM- 1) {{is a member of the}} super immunoglobulin family expressed on a <b>select</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> myeloid <b>cells</b> mainly monocyte/macrophages. Recent studies suggest that expression of TREM- 1 in tumors may predict cancer aggressiveness and disease outcomes in liver and lung cancer however the mechanism of TREM- 1 expression in the setting of cancer is not defined. In this study we demonstrate that tumor tissue from patients with non-small cell lung cancer show an increased expression of TREM- 1 and PGE 2. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence confirmed that the expression of TREM- 1 was selectively seen in CD 68 positive macrophages. By employing an in vitro model we confirmed that expression of TREM- 1 is increased in macrophages that are co-cultured with human lung cancer cells. Studies with COX- 2 inhibitors and siCOX- 2 showed that expression of TREM- 1 in macrophages in tumor microenvironment is dependent on COX- 2 signaling. These studies for the first time define a link between tumor COX- 2 induction, PGE 2 production and expression of TREM- 1 in macrophages i...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{effort will}} identify genes and ultimately physiological mechanisms and pathways that are expressed under {{in situ conditions}} and are critical to functioning of aquifer dwelling anaerobic bacteria living in contaminated systems. The main objectives are: (1) Determine which Metal-reducer specific genes are important for activities in normal and contaminated subsurface sediment. To achieve these goals, we have generated a library of chromosomal mutants. These are introduced into contaminated sediments, incubated, allowed to grow, and then reisolated. A negative selection process allows us to determine which mutants have been selected against in sediments and thereby identify genes required for survival in subsurface sediments. (2) Delineate the function of these genes through GeneBank and Clusters <b>of</b> Orthologous <b>Groups</b> (COGs) comparisons and analyze other sediment microorganisms to determine if similar genes are present in these populations. After determining the sequence of the genes identified through the previous objectives, we delineate the role of those specific genes in the physiology of G 20, MR- 1 and perhaps other microorganisms.

40|$|Summary. -The {{formation}} of lung colonies by i. v. injected Lewis lung-tumour cells in syngeneic recipients was greatly enhanced by prior {{treatment of the}} mice with cyclophosphamide. The lung-cloning efficiency was linearly related to cyclo-phosphamide dose and the optimum time of treatment was 2 - 4 days before the injection <b>of</b> tumour <b>cells.</b> The resulting lung colonies had a similar size distribution to colonies in untreated recipients. Bleomycin, local thoracic irradiation and whole-body irradiation were much less effective in enhancing the lung-cloning efficiency. Cyclophosphamide also enhanced the take probability of i. m. implanted tumour <b>cells.</b> THE production <b>of</b> artificial lung meta-stases by i. v. injected cells {{has been used as}} a method of assaying the clonogenic capacity <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> removed from treated murine tumours. This approach was first described by Hill and Bush (1969) using the KHT sarcoma, and since that time it has been applied to a number of other mouse tumouirs including the C 22 LR osteosarcoma (van Putten et al., 1975) and the Lewis lung tumour and B 16 melanoma (Hill and Stanley, 1975). A high cloning efficiency in the lungs for i. v. injected cells is important in reducing the possibility that the colonies are formed by a <b>selected</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> tumour <b>cells</b> and also because the higher the cloning efficiency the greater the sensitivity of the assay. Brown (1973) showed that local thoracic irradiation increased the lung-cloning efficiency of the KHT sarcoma, and more recently van Putten et al. (1975) have shown that a variety of systemically administered cytotoxic agents enhance the lung-cloning efficiency of the C 22 LR osteosarcoma. The present work was designed to confirm that drug-induced enhancement of lung cloning also occurs with the Lewis lung tumour, and to investigate in 44 particular the considerable enhancement that is found using cyclophosphamide...|$|R

40|$|Comment on basal {{epithelial}} {{stem cells}} as efficient targets {{for prostate cancer}} initiation Letitia Wong and Wade Bushman* Human prostate adenocarcinoma is a multicentric disease with histological heterogeneity and variation in biological features. The present study showed that a cell with stem properties undergoing oncogenic transformation can produce prostate mouse lesions with varied histological phenotypes that resemble different grades of human prostate cancer. This powerful observation {{is consistent with the}} notion that a complex spectrum of prostate neoplasms may arise from a common <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> origin, facilitating future studies to understand the development of prostate disease. Even so, {{it must be noted that}} there is no conclusive evidence that stem cells are the source of human prostate cancer, and therefore additional studies are required comparing features and natural history of tumors generated by this approach with the process of oncogenesis in the human prostate. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is an epithelial malignancy that occurs in aging men. The normal prostatic epithelium is a pseudostratified epithelium with secretory luminal cells and interspersed basal cells. Prostate cancer generally exhibits a luminal cell morphology with a distinct absence <b>of</b> basal <b>cells.</b> Tumors are often multi focal and exhibit considerable variation in histologic morphology and grade [1, 2]. The present study identified a <b>select</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> basal <b>cells</b> with stem cell properties in the mouse prostate that is capable of cancer initiation following oncogenic transformation.
