50|$|The high {{working voltage}} makes them {{well suited for}} radio {{transmitters}} and valves remain in use today for very high power short wave radio <b>transmitters,</b> where <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> techniques would require many devices in parallel, and very high DC supply currents.

50|$|Nautel's {{introduction}} of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>transmitter</b> technology {{has had a}} large impact on the radio broadcast industry. As the benefits of solid state technology became clear, the industry began to shift away {{from the use of}} tube transmitters and began to adopt the more reliable and efficient solid state designs. By the early 1990s solid state transmitters were being widely used in radio broadcasting, while sales of vacuum tube transmitters began to decline. Since its inception in 1969, Nautel has focused solely on solid state broadcast technology with a lineup of 100% solid state radio transmitters at power levels ranging from 300 W to over 1000 kW. With the July 10, 2014 shutdown of Larcan, Nautel is the only Canadian manufacturer of broadcast transmitters.|$|E

50|$|The first {{advantage}} the ASR-11 offers {{is the use}} of a low-peak, <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>transmitter</b> with {{pulse compression}} technology, replacing the ASR-9's high peak, short pulse power system. This gives the radar the ability to provide the same amount of energy to a target at long range while making the radar less sensitive at shorter ranges. Any aircraft that comes closer than six nautical miles from the radar cannot be located with the long range pulse system built into the ASR-11. Installing additional radar equipment to the same antenna is required for close range location and weather detection. The second advantage of using an ASR-11 is the radars ability to utilize a pulse sequence diversity. This gives the radar system the capability to limit processing dwells to a small number of pulses. This feature becomes most important when monitoring air traffic is the primary use of the radar. Reducing the number of pulses sent out by the radar system also has a direct effect on the Doppler resolution, resulting in a decreased ability to process live weather conditions.|$|E

These upgraded variants of the P-18 {{can be referred to}} as the P-18M, P-18-1 or P-18-2 depending on the manufacturer, modification and radar nationality. The P-18 was superseded by the 1L13 [...] "Nebo" [...] VHF surveillance radar in 1984. Currently, the Russian-Belarusian company Defense Systems provides upgrades for P-18 radars. Also Retia, a Czech civil and military electronics company, developed its own, fundamental modernisation of the P-18 under the name ReVEAL. It is now solid state, digitized and fitted with upgraded IFF system, while allowing to utilise also the legacy IFF.

5000|$|Without an ATU, the SWR from a {{mismatched}} antenna and feedline can reflect {{power back}} into the transmitter (backlash current [...] ) heating and/or burning parts of the output stage. Modern <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>transmitters</b> will automatically reduce power when high SWR is detected, so some solid-state power stages only produce weak signals if the SWR rises above 1.5 to 1. Were it not for that problem, even the losses from an SWR of 2:1 could be tolerated, since only 11 percent of transmitted power would be reflected and 89 percent sent out through to the antenna.
