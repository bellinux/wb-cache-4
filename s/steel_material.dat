25|$|On December 10, 2004, the governor's office {{announced}} that the signature span concept had been scrapped, with the bridge to be the simple viaduct originally proposed. The design, having gone full circle, remained expensive due to the continued high cost of materials. Many argued {{that there would be}} little difference in final cost with this lesser proposal since that concept required obtaining new permits, perhaps adding another two or three years; furthermore, a viaduct may not even be able to obtain Coast Guard approval, since the maximum width of the ship channel would be reduced by almost half. Local reaction to this announcement was intense, with most suggesting that the bridge be built to appear as proposed— either in the <b>steel</b> <b>material</b> as bid or using a reinforced concrete tower of similar appearance but of lower cost.|$|E
2500|$|The train used {{extensively}} refurbished NZR 56-foot carriages that dated from 1937-40. Ten cars were built as two-lavatory 31-seat first class cars, later designated North Island Main Trunk first class cars, for expresses on this route, two (with staff/hostess compartments retained and augmented) as the South Island Main Trunk Main South Line single-lavatory 29 seat equivalent, along with four 16-berth sleeping cars. In their refurbished form, the day cars seated 30 {{in the same}} type of [...] "bucket" [...] seat and the day cars with staff compartments seated 25. The sleeping cars still each accommodated 16 (2 berths in 8 cabins). In 1973 larger train sets were planned with the fitting of 20 first class and sleeping cars (7 + 3 x 2) with Goko heaters from Tohzai Gongyo Boek the tender offer on 21 Jan 1973 from Gongyo in Japan was 4 million yen, for 20 carriage heaters and control systems resulting in a decision to use the old heavy steam vans which in itself limited, train size and suggested completely new trainsets of non stainless <b>steel</b> <b>material</b> would have cost less and allowed better use of the NZRs short staffed rolling stock fitters. However saving overseas funds became the priority after the 1973 war in the Middle East, multiplied oil costs and the final fit out of the train was not approved until November 1974 with instructions to complete the rebuild of the minimum rolling stock for the introduction of the Express replacement within 12 months.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{friction}} {{coefficients of}} different <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> are investigated and compared. Experiments {{are carried out}} when different types of steel discs such as stainless steel 201 (SS 201), stainless steel 301 (SS 301) and mild steel slide against mild steel pin. Experiments are conducted at normal load 5, 7. 5 and 10 N, sliding velocity 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 m/s and relative humidity 70 %. The effects of duration of rubbing on the friction coefficient of different <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> are investigated. Results show that during friction process, test disc takes less time to stabilize with the increased normal load or sliding velocity. It is found that friction coefficient decreases {{with the increase in}} normal load while it increases with the increase in sliding velocity for all the tested materials. As a comparison, it is found that at identical operating conditions, friction coefficients are different for different <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> depending on normal load or sliding velocity...|$|R

40|$|We use <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> for a car, an {{industrial}} machine, a building and so on. The <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> {{are used for}} the main parts of the machine. The <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> have good mechanical characteristics, however, higher mechanical characteristics by special treatment are often demanded. In this case, some evaluation methods are also required to monitor and control the mechanical characteristics of <b>steel</b> <b>materials.</b> Normally, mechanical destructive testing {{is used for the}} evaluation of them, however, all products on line cannot be evaluated because destructing samples are needed by mechanical testing. Therefore, non-destructive evaluation by electromagnetic method is focused on in this paper. We have developed a non-destructive evaluation for hardening steel named as a frequency sweep excitation and spectrogram (FSES) method [1]. This proposed method can evaluate mechanical characteristics non-destructively by using several frequency components of magnetic flux depending on hardening conditions [1]. Figure 1 shows the measured magnetic coercive force Hc and maximum magnetic field strength Hmax. The sample were hardened by induction heating with the current of 80 [A]. As shown in Figure 1, in the 8 - 12 [mm] and 16 - 22 [mm] sections, the spectrogram of the maximum magnetic field strength Hmax was changed locally in comparison of the one of the magnetic coercive force Hc. It has been made clear that the magnetic coercive force Hc could evaluate the hardening strength qualitatively and quantitatively [1]. Moreover, {{it is obvious that the}} local material changes can be evaluated by the maximum magnetic field strength Hmax as shown in Figure 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the influence of the <b>steel’s</b> <b>material</b> properties on the distribution of welding residual stresses of the butt-welded steel plate. First, S 15 C carbon <b>steel’s</b> <b>material</b> properties are varied in this study to calculate the corresponding welding residual stress by carrying out 3 D finite element analyses. Results show the maximum longitudinal tensile residual stresses increase linearly with increasing thermal expansion coefficient and increasing yield stress. The length of the tensile residual stress zone decreases linearly with increasing thermal conductivity. Finally, based on the relationship between material properties and welding residual stresses, a useful prediction equation is developed and verified in this study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a split Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar (SHPB) setup {{was used to}} test mechanical properties of Q 345 <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> used for industrial structure under high strain rate and high temperature loading conditions such as rocket launching.
