5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mold-like fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection {{results in}} {{necrosis}} of the mushroom tissue, {{and a yellow}} color caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (<b>single-celled</b> conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the <b>single-celled</b> zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic <b>single-celled</b> algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, <b>single-celled</b> microorganisms, {{initially}} establish themselves in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are <b>single-celled</b> organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E
5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest <b>single-celled</b> relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Seilacher has {{suggested}} the Ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists {{as the dominant}} life form. The modern xenophyophores are giant <b>single-celled</b> protozoans found throughout the world's oceans, largely on the abyssal plain. A recent genetic study suggested that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of Foraminifera. There are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders; one of which, Syringammina fragilissima, is among the largest known protozoans at up to 20 centimetres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of <b>single-celled</b> organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, <b>single-celled</b> organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and {{dendritic}} cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and <b>single-celled</b> organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) {{structures}} called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains {{a set of}} aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also <b>single-celled</b> fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{taste of}} the fruit body may have some role in insects {{avoiding}} it. The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T.felleus in North America, though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (<b>single-celled</b> conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with <b>single-celled</b> dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne {{infectious}} disease affecting humans {{and other animals}} caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of <b>single-celled</b> microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, <b>single-celled</b> protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Single-celled</b> {{microorganisms}} {{were the}} first forms of life to develop on Earth, approximately 3–4 billion years ago. Further evolution was slow, and for about 3 billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much {{of the history of}} life on Earth), all organisms were microorganisms. Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old, which shows that the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since the Triassic period. The newly discovered biological role played by nickel, however — especially that brought about by volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps — may have accelerated the evolution of methanogens {{towards the end of the}} Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
5|$|The <b>single-celled</b> choanoflagellates {{resemble}} the choanocyte cells of sponges {{which are used}} to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules {{have been used as}} morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals. Some studies have shown that sponges do not form a monophyletic group, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that comb jellies rather than sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of plant virus, but often they cause only a loss of yield, {{and it is not}} {{economically}} viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as vectors. These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms, and <b>single-celled</b> organisms {{have been shown to be}} vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} <b>single-celled</b> protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) {{remotely}} operated vehicle, KAIKO, collected sediment core from the Challenger Deep. 432 living specimens of soft-walled foraminifera {{were identified in}} the sediment samples. Foraminifera are <b>single-celled</b> protists that construct shells. There are an estimated 4,000 species of living foraminifera. Out of the 432 organisms collected, {{the overwhelming majority of}} the sample consisted of simple, soft-shelled foraminifera, with others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera Leptohalysis and Reophax. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled allogromids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. Small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns a mysterious entity is {{controlling}} the world's other lifeforms and sending {{them against the}} player. This entity {{turns out to be}} Bolbox, a lifeform that has evolved into a freakish and evil advanced being by consuming the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, but in reality is a gigantic <b>single-celled</b> organism. In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced civilization on Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and observe until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many <b>single-celled</b> eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and <b>single-celled</b> algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain <b>single-celled</b> algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a <b>single-celled</b> stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
25|$|Cells are of two types, eukaryotic, {{which contain}} a nucleus, and prokaryotic, which do not. Prokaryotes are <b>single-celled</b> organisms, while eukaryotes {{can be either}} <b>single-celled</b> or multicellular.|$|E
25|$|The <b>single-celled</b> {{protozoan}} produces {{mechanical stress}} on host cells and then ingests cell fragments after cell death.|$|E
25|$|Multicellular {{organisms are}} organisms that consist {{of more than}} one cell, in {{contrast}} to <b>single-celled</b> organisms.|$|E
25|$|Some simple pre-Cambrian {{horizontal}} traces {{could have}} been produced by large <b>single-celled</b> organisms; equivalent traces are produced by protists today.|$|E
25|$|Early {{life forms}} on Earth, {{starting}} at least 3.7 billion years ago, were <b>single-celled</b> organisms. Such organisms (prokaryotes, protozoans, algae) multiply by fissioning into daughter cells; thus do not age and are innately immortal.|$|E
25|$|For {{well over}} a billion years, {{silicification}} in and by cells has been common in the biological world. In the modern world it occurs in bacteria, <b>single-celled</b> organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates).|$|E
25|$|In <b>single-celled</b> algae, {{chloroplast}} {{division is}} the only way new chloroplasts are formed. There is no proplastid differentiation—when an algal cell divides, its chloroplast divides along with it, and each daughter cell receives a mature chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, Ernst Haeckel {{divided the}} animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals) and Protozoa (<b>single-celled</b> animals). The {{protozoa}} were later moved to the kingdom Protista, leaving only the metazoa. Thus Metazoa is now considered a synonym of Animalia.|$|E
25|$|For sexually {{reproducing}} populations, {{studies have}} shown that <b>single-celled</b> bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a <b>single-celled</b> bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a <b>single-celled</b> bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals. Further studies using Dictyostelium discoideum suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to kin selection. The studies with D. discoideum showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.|$|E
25|$|A {{group at}} the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, in a 2008 paper, stated they had {{isolated}} large amounts of lipids from <b>single-celled</b> fungi {{and turned it into}} biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, Cunninghamella japonica, and others, is likely to appear in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (also {{known as}} oriental sore, tropical sore, chiclero ulcer, chiclero's ulcer or Aleppo boil) {{is the most}} common form of leishmaniasis affecting humans. It is a skin infection caused by a <b>single-celled</b> parasite that is transmitted by the bite of a phlebotomine sandfly. There are about twenty species of Leishmania that may cause cutaneous leishmaniasis.|$|E
