25|$|V. <b>squamosa</b> is {{commonly}} called the southern yellowjacket. This species {{was discovered by}} Dru Drury around 1770. It {{is a member of}} the Vespidae family, which includes paper wasps (subfamily: Polistinae), pollen wasps (subfamily: Masarinae), potter and mason wasps (subfamily: Eumeninae), and yellow jackets (subfamily: Vespinae). The Vespidae family has about 4000 species, the majority of which are not social. Within the Vespinae subfamily, however, the roughly 80 species are all eusocial, including V. <b>squamosa.</b> They create either annual or perennial nests, and some species, including V. <b>squamosa,</b> are parasites to other Vespinae species. Within the subfamily of Vespinae, the four genera are Provespa, Vespa, Dolichovespula, and Vespula. Within the Vespula genus are 18 species. The southern yellowjacket is fairly closely related to V. maculifrons (eastern yellowjacket), and V. <b>squamosa</b> is a social parasite of V. maculifrons. V. <b>squamosa</b> is also closely related to V. rufa.|$|E
25|$|Vespula <b>squamosa</b> is {{a common}} {{parasite}} of V. maculifrons, though they are facultative, which means they can live both independently and parasitically. Roughly 80% of V. <b>squamosa</b> colonies are parasitic, which can be determined if any V. maculifrons workers are present or if the nest itself has {{the characteristics of a}} V. maculifrons nest, such as its typical small, tan cells. However, parasitic colonies were not as frequent in areas of unobstructed forest. In the colonies that do become parasitic, a V. <b>squamosa</b> queen forcibly takes control of the nest from the host queen. Then, the host colony’s workers raise the first brood of V. <b>squamosa,</b> until their own workers are mature. Eventually, all V. maculifrons workers will die out.|$|E
25|$|As seen in {{many social}} insects, cuticular lipids {{are a source}} of {{communication}} among adults. In general, cuticular lipids function to avoid dehydration by acting as a seal to keep moisture in. However, the hydrocarbons on the surface of cuticular lipids can also serve in identifying the individual’s species, and more importantly, kin. Kin recognition occurs because each species has a unique cuticular hydrocarbon composition. However, the composition between V. maculifrons and V. <b>squamosa</b> is very similar. This occurrence is advantageous to V. <b>squamosa</b> because the species is a social parasite of V. maculifrons, and their similar hydrocarbon compositions can act as a chemical camouflage to help V. <b>squamosa</b> parasitize nests. Also, minor differences occur between the cuticular hydrocarbon compositions of workers and queens.|$|E
25|$|For V. maculifrons {{workers to}} {{communicate}} {{with others in the}} nest about a potential predator, they have an alarm pheromone that stimulates defense. This pheromone is linked to the sting apparatus and prompts attraction and attack. When the alarm pheromone is expressed, wasps around the nest entrance are typically seen circling, outlining a zigzagging flight, and going directly towards the target. However, foragers that were not at the nest when the pheromone was expressed do not respond in a similar manner. The facultative social parasite of V. maculifrons, Vespula <b>squamosa,</b> responds to the alarm response of V. maculifrons, suggesting common chemistry between pheromones. Since V. <b>squamosa</b> is known to take over nests of V. maculifrons, selection for V. <b>squamosa</b> favors the ability to recognize and respond to alarm calls within the nest.|$|E
25|$|V. <b>squamosa</b> is {{typically}} {{about half an}} inch long and distinguishable by its black body and yellow striping pattern over its entire body. This species has clear wings and a hairless body. While the males and workers resemble other yellowjackets, the queen has a unique appearance. She is significantly larger than the males and workers and is more orange in color. In addition, both V. <b>squamosa</b> and the V. sulphurea have two stripes on their scuta, which differentiates them from other species.|$|E
25|$|Polyalthia longifolia, Polyalthia cerasoides, Annona <b>squamosa,</b> Annona reticulata, Annona discolor, Annona muricata, Goniothalamus cardiopetalus, Mitrephora heyneana and Uvaria narum of {{the family}} Annonaceae, Michelia doltospa, Michelia champaca, Milliusa tomentosum, Cinnamomum spp., and Artabotrys hexapetalus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the southeastern}} United States, where {{southern}} yellowjacket (Vespula <b>squamosa)</b> nests may persist through the winter, colony sizes {{of this species}} may reach 100,000 adult wasps. The same kind of nest expansion has occurred in Hawaii with the invasive western yellowjacket (V. pensylvanica).|$|E
25|$|Vespula <b>squamosa,</b> the {{southern}} yellowjacket, {{is a social}} wasp. This species can be identified by its distinctive black and yellow patterning and orange queen. These yellowjackets are typically found in the eastern United States, and its territory extends {{as far south as}} eastern Mexico and Guatemala. Within these territories, they create enormous, multiple-comb nests. The colonies may be either annual or perennial depending on the climate, and in many perennial nests, polygyny takes place. In addition, this species uses pheromones both as a sexual attractant and an alarm signal. This species feeds on insects and animal carcasses; it does not produce honey. V. <b>squamosa,</b> a social insect, has developed a parasitic relationship with the species V. vidua and V. maculifrons. Due to their painful, venomous stings, the species is considered a pest.|$|E
25|$|In Antirrhinum, the {{orthologous}} gene to AP1 is <b>SQUAMOSA</b> (SQUA), {{which also}} has a particular impact on the floral meristem. The homologs for AP2 are LIPLESS1 (LIP1) and LIPLESS2 (LIP2), which have a redundant function and are of special interest {{in the development of}} sepals, petals and ovules.|$|E
25|$|Most {{southern}} yellowjackets are parasitic, in {{that they}} benefit {{at the expense of}} another species, as seen in their nest formation, as they build their nests around those of another species. Only about 15% of the nests are independently founded. Evidence shows V. <b>squamosa</b> as a social parasite of V. vidua (ground hornet) and V. maculifrons (eastern yellowjacket. As this species depends on other species for part of its nest, the location of its nests is often contingent on the location of the host’s nests.|$|E
25|$|Southern yellowjackets' nests are {{typically}} built in unnatural or disturbed environments such as yards, picnic tables, and other artificial environments. They are usually made from chewed vegetable fibers. Colonies {{have been reported}} to contain from 9000 to more than 450,000 cells. One of the largest reported nests was 114.3cm in diameter at its widest point and had about 39 combs. It was about 3 m tall and had a 3-m diameter. While most social wasps have annual nests, many instances of multiple-season V. <b>squamosa</b> nests have been found, especially in the southern coastal areas of the species' range.|$|E
25|$|Southern yellowjackets are {{typically}} {{found in the}} eastern United States and {{as far south as}} Mexico and Guatemala. Their territory expands as far west as Texas and as far east as the Atlantic Ocean. These areas tend to have fairly warm weather and in some cases, tropical climates. Within these territories, nests {{are typically}} found in unnatural habitats, such as yards, parks, and sides of roads. Some colonies, though, are found in pine forests. Their parasitic relationship with V. maculifrons can result in V. <b>squamosa</b> colony formation in hardwood forests, a habitat more typical of V. maculifrons. Most nests are subterranean, though some have been found above ground or in walls, close to V. maculifrons nests.|$|E
25|$|As a form {{of defense}} of their nests, {{southern}} yellowjacket workers use alarm pheromones {{to communicate with each}} other to coordinate an attack. These behaviors are chemically mediated, and these alarm pheromones cause many social wasp species to leave the nest and attack whatever may be threatening it. Individuals can emit this pheromone from a few places in their bodies. Pheromone activity occurs in the stomach, and more specifically in a venom gland within the stomach. Odors on objects or people attacked by V. <b>squamosa</b> differ from the previously isolated chemical alarm pheromone, N-3-methylbutylacetamide. A second source of an alarm pheromone is found in the venom glands of the head of an individual. The alarm pheromones may be applied by the mandible.|$|E
25|$|The colony cycle for {{southern}} yellowjackets is fairly variable. Many annual colonies begin in late May or early June when the queen infringes {{on a small}} V. maculifrons colony (about 85% of colonies begin in this parasitic takeover, while only 15% of colonies are independent). Whereas workers do not survive the winter in annual colonies, the queen does survive, and in the spring, when she is ready to lay more eggs, she scouts for small V. maculifrons and V. vidua colonies {{to serve as the}} host colony. These “takeovers” can often be violent as evidenced by many dead queens found in the nests. This violence tends to be conspecific, meaning that multiple V. <b>squamosa</b> queens are fighting for control of the host nest or for control of the polygynous nest. A successful usurpation constitutes the beginning of the parasitic relationship between a V. <b>squamosa</b> colony and a V. maculifrons colony. These colonies are built around the host nest, thus increase the size of the initial host nest. The queen begins the building process by constructing queen cells and laying eggs that will hatch larvae. The larvae enter the pupal phase after about a month. Once more of these female workers have been produced (late July or early August), the colony size begins to grow significantly as worker cell construction begins. This period from July to August is the major growth period during which up to 4000 workers could be producing cells. Workers build smaller 4.0- to 5.0-mm-wide cells, while the queens build “queen cells” which are about 7.0mm wide. Most nests have their maximum number of queen and worker combs between October and December, the end of the seasonal colony cycle. As the season ends, the queen hibernates so she can, in many cases, begin a new colony the next year.|$|E
25|$|Vespula rufa is {{a member}} of the genus Vespula. Within the genus, this species is most closely related to Vespula <b>squamosa.</b> Other species in the Vespula genus include Vespula germanica, Vespula maculifrons, and Vespula vulgaris. Outside of the genus, Dolichovespula is the next most closely related genus. The {{northern}} red-banded yellowjacket was referred to as V. intermedia in North America. This differs from typical Red Wasps, V. rufa, of the western Palearctic that have ivory rather than yellow markings. Eastern Palaearctic populations also have ivory markings and this form has been called V. rufa schrenckii. Due to the variability of the brownish markings, which can be seen from specimens throughout its range, V. intermedia has become equivalent to V. rufa schrenckii. However, pale-marked populations also occur within the range of the V. rufa in Scandinavia and Central Asia. There are various wasps within the ‘subspecies’ of V. rufa, including Vespula acadica, however they are now viewed as little more than color forms rather than formal taxa, and the species is regarded as monotypic.|$|E
25|$|Southern yellowjackets have a {{polygynous}} mating system: {{a colony}} {{has more than}} one queen. In other Vespula species, polygyny tends to be found in mild climates where the colony can last more than a year. Given that many of this species live in temperate or subtropical environments, perennial nests have been observed. Polygynous perennial colonies occur when reproductive females (queens) reproduce in the colony instead of leaving it. As a result of the multiple queens and additional seasons and workers in perennial nests, these colonies tend to be much larger than their annual counterparts. While scientists have argued that a polygynous mating system would breed disease and reduce fitness, many examples of the polygynous nests are seen. The parasitic nature of the species {{goes hand in hand with}} their polygynous mating system. In a parasitic system, females lay eggs in a different species’ nests, and in a polygynous system a female of the same species lays eggs in the nest in the hopes of overtaking the current queen. Dead queens of the same species have been found in V. <b>squamosa</b> nests, supporting the idea of competition between queens as a result of polygyny. This polygyny may be tolerated in large multiple-season nests because the size of the nest reduces interactions between the competing queens. This process of seizing the nest within the species could provide the basis for parasitic nature of this species, as the takeover of a nest either within species or between species is a fairly similar process.|$|E

2500|$|V. rufa can be {{distinguished}} by its reddish-brown markings on the back. Specimens of this species with reduced spots on the abdomen have tissue that is segmented into three parts and four “anteriorly directed lobes.” [...] There are three main types of color patterns in the species. V. rufa lack the long, yellow lines that V. <b>squamosa</b> and V. sulphurea have. Workers and queens differ in their color patterns. While the basic color scheme {{appears to be the}} same in workers and queens, there are some slight differences. Workers have more expansive black color and less yellow or white than queens. That is, the queens have a greater display of yellow color than the workers. In the workers, the yellow tissue of the abdominal segment is thin and triply divided, while the yellow tissue segments in the queen are larger. In queens lateral divisions become black spots. However, this is not always the case as often workers have divisions replaced by black spots, and queens occasionally have the less patterned appearance characteristic of workers. The differences in color pattern correspond to the size, with more colored workers being more likely to be large and less colored ones more likely to be small. Workers have the smallest fore wing length (10.0-11.0mm), followed by males (11.0-12.0mm), and females have the longest fore wings (12.5-13.0mm).|$|E
2500|$|The speartooth shark {{seems to}} be {{relatively}} sluggish in nature, moving with the tides so as to conserve energy. Its activity levels are unaffected by day or night, reflecting the constant darkness of its environment. Small eyes and abundant ampullae of Lorenzini suggest that this shark relies more on electroreception than sight to hunt, while the large second dorsal fin enhances its ability to maneuver at slow speeds in fast currents. It has slender teeth adept for catching bony fishes and crustaceans, mostly {{on or near the}} bottom. Known prey of juveniles include Macrobrachium prawns, Taenoides or Trypauchen burrowing gobies, ariid catfish, the threadfin Polydactylus macrochir, the gudgeon Prionobutis microps, the benthic croaker Nibea <b>squamosa</b> and the bream Nematalosa erebi. Very {{little is known about the}} feeding habits of adults, but many bony fish spines and a stingray spine were found embedded in the jaws of the only documented adult female. As in other requiem sharks, the speartooth shark is viviparous: when the developing embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Birthing seems to occur from October to December, near the end of the dry season, with newborns measuring around [...] long. Upon being captured a female gave birth to a single fully developed pup, about [...] long, and anecdotal information indicates a litter size of 6-7. The growth rate of young sharks is probably around [...] per year.|$|E
