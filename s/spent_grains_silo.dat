40|$|This {{creative}} project explores {{a conceptual}} site development and adaptive reuse {{proposal for a}} site located in Seymour, Indiana. The site contains a historic <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> elevator, representing {{a fraction of the}} demolished <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> elevators that once existed from the late 1800 ’s to the late 1970 ’s across the North American landscape. As large structures dispersed throughout Indiana’s landscape, <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> elevators contain potential, providing an opportunity to produce new innovative land and property use. This project focuses on analyzing the site in Seymour and generating appropriate and innovative ideas for a proposal. To successfully produce a site proposal, this creative project will examine literature on related topics such as historic preservation, adaptive reuse and renovations on similar buildings and structures. Further, case studies of completed <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> elevator reuse projects along with interviews with developers of said projects will provide perception on the repurposing process and results. Lastly, the results from research will conclude in a final proposal recommending specific uses incorporating the site where the existing <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> elevator sits and the surrounding parcels as well. This site has the potential to create a number of opportunities for the Seymour community, aide its growth and resilience and inspire future development. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R.
