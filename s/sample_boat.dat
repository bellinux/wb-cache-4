40|$|This {{document}} {{provides an}} explanation on how shrimp trawler owners/operators can analyze {{the effects of}} changing costs and ex-vessel prices on the profitability of operating a shrimp trawler. An Excel spreadsheet is provided with <b>sample</b> <b>boat</b> costs and revenues. The spreadsheet allows the trawler owner/operator to enter costs and revenues data for their own vessel. This {{can be used to}} estimate average costs of landing a pound of shrimp by the vessel owner/operator and the profit (loss) per pound of landed shrimp. As input costs vary for key items like fuel, ice, BRDS, etc, the trawler owner can estimate the impact of these input costs on the total average cost of landing a pound of shrimp. Similarly, as the ex-vessel (landed) price for a pound of shrimp changes, the vessel owner/operator can estimate the impact of these price changes on the profitability of operating the trawler.

40|$|Objectives. The {{overarching}} {{objective of}} this project was to support the indigenous people in Kwakoegron, Suriname, in self-diagnosis of public and environmental health problems. The specific objectives, defined {{by the people of}} Kwakoegron were: (1) to determine for themselves if they are at risk of exposure to mercury (Hg) contamination, (2) to measure the extent of the Hg contamination problem, and (3) to initiate an intervention plan. Methods. Field work was conducted from June 2005 to April 2006. Community members were trained to collect hair samples for analysis using methods designed to maximize sample quality and consistency and minimize cross-contamination. Each hair sample, of approxi-mately 20 mg, was weighed, added to the <b>sample</b> <b>boat,</b> and analyzed immediately without preservation or storage. Technicians educated in analytical chemistry and trained in the oper-ation of the portable Lumex Zeeman Hg analyzer measured the total Hg (THg) for each hair sample. Confidential meetings were held with each person sampled and any questions were an-swered. Afterwards, a community meeting was held to reflect on the process, outcome, and fu-ture needs. Results. Hair samples from 16 of the 22 participants had Hg levels of 2. 2 – 20. 2 µg/g THg...|$|E
30|$|Pyrolysis {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} a quartz pyrolysis tube heated with a split-tube furnace [9]. Typically, the pyrolysis sample (6.00  g) {{was placed in a}} quartz <b>sample</b> <b>boat</b> that was then positioned {{in the center of a}} pre-heated pyrolysis tube. A K-type thermal couple was immersed in the sample powder during the pyrolysis to measure the heating rate. The pyrolysis tube was flushed with nitrogen gas, and the flow rate was adjusted to a value of 500  mL min− 1 and then inserted in the pre-heated (600 °C) furnace. The outflow from pyrolysis was passed through two condensers, which were immersed in liquid N 2. (Note: Liquid N 2 was used for experimental convenience). Upon completion of pyrolysis (~ 10 minutes), the reaction tube was removed from the furnace and allowed to cool to room temperature under constant N 2 flow. The condensers were then removed from liquid nitrogen. The pyrolysis char and oil were collected for subsequent chemical analysis. In general, the liquid products contained two immiscible phases referred to as heavy and light oil. The light oil was acquired by decantation. The heavy oil was recovered by washing the reactor with acetone followed by evaporation under reduced pressure. Char yields were determined gravimetrically, and gas formation was calculated by mass difference.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Characterize {{personal}} {{exposure to}} airborne hydrocarbons, particularly carcinogenic benzene, during spill {{of two different}} fresh crude oils at sea. Methods: The study included 22 participants taking part in an «oil on water» field trial in the North Sea. Two types of fresh crude oils (light and heavy) were released six times over two consecutive days followed by different oil spill response methods. The participants were distributed on five boats; three open <b>sampling</b> <b>boats</b> (A, B, and C), one release ship (RS), and one oil recovery (OR) vessel. Assumed personal exposure was assessed a priori, assuming high exposure downwind {{and close to the}} oil slick (<b>sampling</b> <b>boats),</b> low exposure further downwind (100 – 200 m) and upwind from the oil slick (main deck of RS and OR vessel), and background exposure indoors (bridge of RS/OR vessel). Continuous measurements of total volatile organic compounds in isobutylene equivalents were performed with photoionization detectors placed in all five boats. Full-shift personal exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, naphthalene, and n-hexane was measured with passive thermal desorption tubes. Results: Personal measurements of benzene, averaged over the respective sample duration, on Day 1 showed that participants in the <b>sampling</b> <b>boats</b> (A, B, and C) located downwind and close to the oil slick were highest exposed (0. 14 – 0. 59 ppm), followed by participants on the RS main deck (0. 02 – 0. 10 ppm) and on the bridge (0. 004 – 0. 03 ppm). On Day 2, participants in <b>sampling</b> <b>boat</b> A had high benzene exposure (0. 87 – 1. 52 ppm) compared to participants in <b>sampling</b> <b>boat</b> B (0. 01 – 0. 02 ppm), on the ships (0. 06 – 0. 10 ppm), and on the bridge (0. 004 – 0. 01 ppm). Overall, the participants in the <b>sampling</b> <b>boats</b> had the highest exposure to all of the compounds measured. The light crude oil yielded a five times higher concentration of total volatile organic compounds in air in the <b>sampling</b> <b>boats</b> (max 510 ppm) than the heavy crude oil (max 100 ppm) but rapidly declined to < 20 ppm within 24 min after release of oil, indicating short periods of exposure...|$|R

40|$|Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and HB-Line designed, developed, tested, and {{successfully}} deployed {{a system for}} the distillation of chloride salts. In 2011, SRNL adapted the technology {{for the removal of}} fluoride from fluoride-bearing salts. The method involved an in situ reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the fluoride salt to yield potassium fluoride (KF) and the corresponding oxide. The KF and excess KOH can be distilled below 1000 {deg}C using vacuum salt distillation (VSD). The apparatus for vacuum distillation contains a zone heated by a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air. During a vacuum distillation operation, a <b>sample</b> <b>boat</b> containing the feed material is placed into the apparatus while it is cool, and the system is sealed. The system is evacuated using a vacuum pump. Once a sufficient vacuum is attaned, heating begins. Volatile salts distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile material in the feed boat. Studies discussed in this report were performed involving the use of non-radioactive simulants in small-scale and pilot-scale systems as well as radioactive testing of a small-scale system with plutonium-bearing materials. Aspects of interest include removable liner design considerations, boat materials, in-line moisture absorption, and salt deposition...|$|E

For each sample, 0.4  g of homogenized oyster tissue (wet weight) was accurately weighed and transferred into a 25  mL quartz vessel together with 5  mL of concentrated (65 %) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 1  mL of (35 %) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). The extraction vessel {{was placed in a}} microwave digestion system (Milestone ETHOS PLUS, Italy), and the digestion program was run in 2 steps (step (1) 25 – 180 °C for 30  min at 1000  W; step (2) 180 °C for 15  min at 1000  W). All the digested samples were diluted to 25  mL with milliQ water in pre-acid washed standard flasks and used for analysis. Cadmium and lead were analyzed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP AES, ICPE- 9000, Shimadzu, Japan) at 220  nm for cadmium and 210  nm for lead. A standard torch for this instrument was used with an outer argon gas flow rate of 15  L min- 1 and an intermediate gas flow of 0.9  L min- 1. The applied power was 1.0  kW. For mercury, 0.1  g of oyster soft tissue was accurately weighed in a <b>sample</b> <b>boat,</b> and total mercury was determined using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA- 80, Milestone, Italy) without further sample preparation. Typical repeatability was 3.2 - 4.4 % for cadmium, 2.4 – 4.7 % for lead and 2.5 – 3.8 % for mercury. Good reproducibility of the method was obtained, yielding the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations less than 5 %. The instrument detection limits were 0.01  mg kg- 1 for cadmium 0.02  mg kg- 1 for lead and 0.5  ng g- 1 for mercury.|$|E

Zinc and iron removal studies from BOS by-product were investigated by means of chlorination roasting. Chlorination roasting of the BOS material by means of pyrometallurgical extraction was undertaking, assessing parameters such as roasting temperature, roasting time and chemical stoichiometry. A preliminary study was carried out using a solid chlorination agent, Ammonium Chloride (NH 4 Cl) in a muffle furnace for a 3 stage roasting conducted for 15 minutes to 180 minutes at 450 C to 750 C. Selected {{studies were carried out}} with 1 -stage roasting.

30|$|To {{measure the}} {{distribution}} of inorganic nutrients of the fishing grounds (Stations 1 – 3) off Tiruchendur coastal waters, seawater samples were collected in 1  l pre cleaned polythene bottles at monthly intervals for 2  years. A fishing vessel made of Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) was employed to collect the water samples throughout the study period. Samples were collected at early morning of the day between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. Usually, <b>sampling</b> <b>boat</b> would start at 4 a.m.– 5 a.m. from the shore and reach the fishing ground between 6.30 a.m. and 7.00 a.m. Niskin water sampler (1  l capacity) was used to collect the water sample and then transferred to the pre cleaned polythene bottles to estimate the nutrients. Collected samples were immediately kept in icebox and transported to the laboratory for the further analyses. The seawater samples were filtered using a Millipore filtering system through whatman membrane filter paper of 0.45  µ porosity. The quantity of the dissolved nutrients of ammonia-N, nitrite-N, nitrate-N, phosphate-P, silicate-Si present in the filtered water samples were determined, following the standard methods as described by Strickland and Parsons (1972).|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} of chloride salts from {{plutonium oxide}} (PuO{sub 2 }) and simulant PuO{sub 2 } {{has been previously}} demonstrated at Department of Energy (DOE) sites using kilogram quantities of chloride salt. The apparatus for vacuum distillation contains a zone heated using a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air. During a vacuum distillation operation, a <b>sample</b> <b>boat</b> containing the feed material is placed into the apparatus while it is cool, and the system is sealed. The system is evacuated using a vacuum pump. Once a sufficient vacuum is attained, heating begins. Volatile salts distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile materials in the feed boat. The application of vacuum salt distillation (VSD) is {{of interest to the}} HB-Line Facility and the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Both facilities are involved in efforts to disposition excess fissile materials. Many of these materials contain chloride and fluoride salt concentrations which make them unsuitable for dissolution without prior removal of the chloride and fluoride salts. Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and HB-Line designed, developed, tested, and successfully deployed a system for the distillation of chloride salts. Subsequent efforts are attempting to adapt the technology for the removal of fluoride. Fluoride salts of interest are less-volatile than the corresponding chloride salts. Consequently, an alternate approach is required for the removal of fluoride without significantly increasing the operating temperature. HB-Line Engineering requested SRNL to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of an alternate approach using both non-radioactive simulants and plutonium-bearing materials. Whereas the earlier developments targeted the removal of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl), the current activities are concerned with the removal of the halide ions associated with plutonium trifluoride (PuF{sub 3 }), plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF{sub 4 }), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }), and calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2 }). This report discusses non-radioactive testing of small-scale and pilot-scale systems and radioactive testing of a small-scale system.

40|$|The small {{fishing boats}} “wasen”, Japanese style vessels were mainly {{propelled}} with scull or sails {{before the last}} War. Nowadays, however, the wasens are mostly equipped with an outboard engine and their wooden hulls are replaced with fiberglass-reinforced plastics (FRP). Accordingly, the wasens made of wood and their boat-building techniques are gradually disappearing from fishing villages. In this research, though wasen was left from the mainstream of the present age, I promoted to the wasens for its rationality of the hull-type and provided to them and their boat-builders to the historical and the technical rank throughout the wasen's model resistance test of fundamental kinematic performance and theory for security of stability. Therefore, I visited about 200 boat-builders in Kyushu, mainly within Nagasaki Prefecture and collected over 1, 000 memorandums of their boat dimensions and board drawings of hull structures from 1975 to 1985. Hull lines of wasen were redrawn from the collected data. Therefore, standing on the current state mentioned above, {{this study was conducted}} to record accurately the wasen’s structure. Also, collection of hull line records, model tests and analysis of the wasens were made to clarify its characteristics. Stasistical analysis were conducted on the principal dimentions measured from the hull lines and various characteristics were probed according to type, sea area and period of use. The procedure of clarifying the wasens of their hull-type and characteristics mentioned above were intended in the first department, “Survey of hull-type and statistical analysis for wasens”, and showed them in the second to 4 th Chapter. Next, the investigation of the wasens for their rationality, kinematic performance of resistance and stability in the first department were intended in the second department, “Hull-type and its kinematic performance”, and showed them in the 5 th to 7 th Chapter. The general result was as follows: 1) I classified and showed their characteristics about 600 various wasens which could be read necessary dimensions according to application such as fishing boat, angling, seiner, whaling, carrier and other boat from field survey. So I showed each genus of the stem post, “Miyoshi” geometry that represented wasens and made its usage clear. 2) I measured around 25 major parts of hull dimensions and showed the hull-type changes by the period and characters of the sea area usage for angling and seiner wasens. In angling wasens became small all principal dimensions and tended constant length of stern keel, “tomogawara” to approach modern times by degrees. In seiner wasens the depth became large against for the length or width of principal dimensions to approach the modern times. The characteristic usages of sea area, in angling wasens were constructed wider for the length and high stability boat around the Goto inlands and western coast of Nagasaki prefecture, and in seiner wasens were constructed so as to be applied for the fishing ground by kind and size of net fishing. 3) Next stage, I selected and produced restoring scale-models of 22 high-speed wasens used mainly as whale chaser boat from the lines of board drawings for the tank test. For the examination, there were 6 stages with full or half load condition and 3 kinds of trims, by the head and stern about 1 % extended mainly in even keel for the resistance test of the towing tank. From the tank test, I showed the dimensionless total resistance coefficient sγt for actual boat and same for 5 tonnage 5 γt, mean full-load displacement the <b>sample</b> <b>boat</b> used for comparison of hull-type, that were converted from model total resistance. As a result of 5 γt coefficient was 0. 04 to 0. 07 in low speed in Fn and near by the last hump of high-speed in Fn around 0. 17 for full-load and 0. 15 for half-load. 4) Therefore I tried analysis about propulsion performance of wasen through the above-mentioned resistance performance and the method of sweeping propulsion force of a “Ro” for the skill seaman. As the result of wasen’s effective horsepower was of 0. 04 to 0. 05 ps in average and was calculated 0. 06 ps for the maximum in a “Ro” of the skill seaman. So I inspected and suggested the possibility of the boat speed about eight knot from historical fact for the 8 sweeping pieces whale chaser “ 8 -cho-ro, Iki-seko-bune”. 5) I examined the stability of the 22 wasens above-mentioned, to compare with “standard of stability of a small fishing boat”. I decided the KG as the gravity center of height from the keel was 65 % for depth (KG= 0. 65 D) from the field survey, and calculated the stability from inlet angle and static stability of cross-curve calculation. As a result, I understood maximum righting lever was 12 to 28 cm and restoring angle was 17 to 41. 5 degrees for half-load, and same as 7 to 25 cm, 11 to 31. 5 degrees for full-load condition to the actual boat of wasen. The estimation of dynamical stability was calculated the examination of rolling period and result of the radius gyration from the inclining test for the representative models. From the result, the consequence that satisfied a safety level was provided and the wasens were recognized as the construction that maintained security. 6) On the other hand, I examined damping coefficient about roll decay (N coefficient) from angling and seiner representative model boat. The angling boat has comparatively greatly upper stack and apron stage of chine part. When the list seemed to be buried in water damped by one swing and N coefficient was about 0. 035 of 10 degrees of inclining test. But seiner boat did not show the same characteristic, N coefficient about 0. 018 same as 10 degrees of inclining test. As the result, I utilized it in application of ships stability law of next section. 7) The Japanese-style fishing boat wasen by the human power propulsion with a “Ro” was the mainstream investigated from the Meiji era to the last War in Showa had been moved in FRP boat of with outboard engine equipment in present. Therefore I examined the present situation and the stability of the small fishing boat that originated from wasen for the small size fishing boat safety level and stability law. I estimated the metacentric height of GM and displacement of the each small fishing boat from the experiment of its inclining and rolling test used by the result of radius gyration before mentioned for the trawling and long-line fishing boat at Mogi-town in Nagasaki city. The consequence that examined rationality of wasen’s hull type was as follows: 1) The principal dimensions of angling and seiner fishing wasens were clarified by period and usage of sea area. 2) The total resistance performances of selective 22 fishing wasens were clarified. 3) The propulsion performance of wasen was clarified from resistance test by towing tank and the sweeping test of a “Ro” of skill seaman. For the “ 8 -cho-ro” whaling chaser was described the possibility of the velocity of historical fact in Edo-era. 4) The selective 22 fishing wasens were confirmed security with a small fishing boat safety level. 5) The roll damping coefficient of wasens were clarified from the still water rolling experiment using the models of angling and seiner fishing boat. 6) The security of stability and current state of the small fishing boats originated from wasens were identified...|$|E

40|$|In aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{invasive species}} {{are among the}} most important threats to biodiversity worldwide. Understanding the dispersal mechanisms of aquatic invaders is very important for protection and management of vulnerable water bodies. Here we ask how recreational boats that are transported overland could contribute to the dispersal of invasive zebra mussels among lakes in Switzerland. Using a questionnaire sent to registered boat owners, we surveyed properties of transported boats and collected information on self-reported mussel fouling and transport activities of boat owners. We also <b>sampled</b> <b>boat</b> hulls at launching ramps and harbors for biofouling invertebrates. Boats that were kept seasonally or year-round in water were found to have high vector potential with mussel fouling rates of more than 40 %. However, only about 6 % of boats belonging to these groups were transported overland to other water bodies. Considering that approximately 100, 000 recreational boats are registered in Switzerland, we estimated that every year around 1400 boats fouled with mussels are transported overland. Such boats pose a high risk of distributing zebra mussels between water bodies. Our results suggest that there is a considerable risk that recreational boats may spread new fouling species to all navigable water bodies within the study area. We speculate that one such species could be the quagga mussel, which has not yet invaded lakes in Switzerland. On a more positive note, our study has identified the group of high-risk boats so that possible control measures would only affect {{a relatively small number of}} boat owners...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of organic carbon in soils has traditionally used dichromate oxidation procedures including the Wakley and Black and the Heanes methods. The {{measurement of}} carbon in soils by high temperature combustion is now widely used providing a rapid automated procedure {{without the use}} of toxic chemicals. This procedure however measures total carbon thus requiring some means of correction for soil samples containing carbonate and charcoal forms of carbon. This paper examines the effects of known additions of charcoal to a range of soil types on the results obtained by the Walkley and Black, Heanes and combustion methods. The results show, that while the charcoal carbon does not react under Walkley and Black conditions, some proportion does so with the Heanes method. A comparison of six Australian Soil and Plant Analysis Council reference soil samples by the three methods showed good agreement between the Heanes method, the combustion method and only slightly lower recoveries by the Walkley and Black procedure. Carbonate carbon will cause an overestimation of soil organic carbon by the combustion method thus requiring a separate determination of carbonate carbon to be applied as a correction. This work shows that a suitable acid pre-treatment of alkaline soils in the <b>sample</b> <b>boats</b> followed by a drying step eliminates the carbonate carbon prior to combustion and the need for an additional measurement.

40|$|Key Findings: 1. Torres Strait {{seagrass}} provides {{critical habitat}} for commercial and traditional fishery species, {{and an important}} food resource for dugong and green turtle populations. 2. This study consolidated seagrass spatial data collected between 2002 and 2014 by TropWATER and the TSRA into a Geographic Information System (GIS) database documenting {{the current state of}} knowledge of intertidal and subtidal meadows across the region. 3. The sampling methods applied were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and CSIRO for seagrass habitat surveys of subtidal meadows; and TropWATER methods for port surveys and intertidal surveys in areas considered at high risk from shipping accidents in the Torres Strait. These included <b>sampling</b> by <b>boat</b> (free divers, underwater video camera, grabs, sled with net backing), helicopter, and walking. 4. Twelve seagrass species from 3 families were identified in intertidal and subtidal meadows between 2002 and 2014. Seagrass was present at 53...|$|R
40|$|In July 2005, four {{stretches}} of the River Elbe were surveyed. In each river stretch, 3 sections were sampled: under the weir, middle zone and above the weir. Adult fish were <b>sampled</b> by <b>boat</b> electrofishing, juvenile fish by seine netting and electrofishing. Totally, 22 species of adult fish were caught. Bleak, chub and roach were the most abundant adult species. Species richness was similar in all river stretches. Fish abundance decreased slightly downstream, both between and within river stretches. 14 species of juvenile fish were caught, most of them represented by a few individuals. Bleak and bitterling were the most common juvenile species. Chub and common bream were co-dominant species in some sections. Fish assemblage of the surveyed sections was relatively poor with a negligible natural reproduction. Despite of the strong pollution source, geomorphological and hydrological stream character {{seems to be the}} most important for fish assemblage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the combination of some sampling gears operated in different biotopes on fish species richness and species composition. Fish were collected from five different types of biotopes in the Upper Parana River floodplain, according to the most suitable sampling gear for the characteristics of each biotope. A total of 116 fish species were identified in the samples and the highest species richness (68 species) was recorded in streams <b>sampled</b> with <b>boat</b> electrofishing. Rivers and open lakes sampled with gillnets showed the greater similarity between the biotopes, while creeks sampled with electrofishing and open lakes sampled with gillnets showed the least. There were significant differences in species composition among the combinations of biotopes/fishing gears. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of using a variety of fishing methods to sample the different biotopes within a region. We emphasize the importance of well-conducted inventories that take into account the particularities of individual environments...|$|R

40|$|A {{mail survey}} of tournament shark anglers and party boat shark anglers was {{completed}} {{to examine their}} fishing activity, attitudes, trip expenditures, and consumer surplus. A sample of 700 shark anglers was selected from tournaments in the Gulf of Mexico during 1990, and a <b>sample</b> of party <b>boat</b> shark anglers was drawn from Port Aransas, Tex., party boat anglers {{during the summer of}} 1991. A response rate of 58 % (excluding nondeliverables) was obtained from tournament anglers. The <b>sample</b> of party <b>boat</b> shark anglers was too small to provide useful results. Tournament shark anglers reported fishing an average of 58 days per year and targeted sharks and other large marine species. Tournaments occupy a small portion of their fishing effort. If this group of anglers were not able to fish for sharks, one-third indicated no other species would be an acceptable substitute, while others were willing to substitute other large marine species. Shark trip expenditures averaged $ 197 per trip with a consumer surplus of $ 111 per trip. Based on MRFSS {{estimates of the number of}} shark fishing trips, we estimate a total of $ 43, 355, 000 was spent by shark anglers in the Gulf of Mexico with a consumer surplus of $ 23, 865, 000 for a total gross value of the shark fishery of $ 66, 220, 000.

40|$|Fishing ground {{condition}} is usually affected by oceanographic parameters. One of the oceanographic parameter {{that had been}} used in forecasting the availability of pelagic species such as skipjack is sea surface temperature (SST). Skipjack fish is the main target for boat seine net fishery in Palabuhanratu Bay from June to October 2007. Information on skipjack fishing ground availability is very important in order to optimize fishing operation. The purposes of the study are: to determine the SST distribution, to analyze the catch composition of skipjack, to determine the relationship between SST and skipjack catch, and to forecast the skipjack fishing ground in Palabuhanratu Bay from August to October 2007. The research consist of two stages. The first stage was conducted in Palabuhanratu Bay waters in August-October 2007, using survey method, with ten <b>samples</b> of <b>boat</b> seine net (payang).

40|$|Summary of Proposed Work: Commercial fishing {{crews are}} a {{component}} of the overall fishing industry in the North Pacific about which perhaps the least is known. This is a pilot project aimed at investigating the effects of the BSAI Crab Rationalization program on crew, in particular crew remuneration. The project will consist of initial exploratory interviews with randomly selected crewmembers. Notably, the random selection process will be based on the pre-rationalization fleet (c. 300 vessels) as opposed to the post-implementation fleet (100 vessels). With the pre-implementation list of crab vessels serving as the <b>sampling</b> universe, <b>boats</b> will be drawn at random and crew from the selected boats will be interviewed regarding changes, if any, in their personal relations of production (again with a particular, though not exclusive, focus on remuneration). Most interviews are expected to take place in Seattle, Washington {{due to the nature of}} the crab fleet. Additional travel to Oregon and Alaska may be necessary. Part of the project will be to test methods of gaining information on this allegedly most elusive component of the fishing industry. Total Funding Requested From NPRB...|$|R
30|$|The {{soils and}} biochar samples were ground to < 2  mm for all {{chemical}} analysis but for Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface area. For total element, C, N, NH 4 NO 3 extractable trace elements and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses, samples were milled with a planetary ball mill {{to achieve a}} homogeneous fine powder (Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). Similarly, the completely dried lettuce (oven drying at 65  °C for at least 72  h) was ground, ball-milled to achieve a homogeneous fine powder. The pH of biochar in water was determined in 1 : 20 (w/v) ratio after occasionally stirring over an hour (Cheng et al. 2006). The pH of the soils in water suspensions were determined in 1 : 2.5 (w/v) ratio after shaking over 2  h. The EC of the biochar was determined after an hour equilibration of 1  g of biochar with 20  ml of distilled water. The EC of the soil samples were determined after 2  h equilibration of 1  g of soil with 2.5  ml of distilled water. For total element analysis, 0.25  g samples of biochar and plant were placed into 50  ml vessels, followed by addition of 10  ml concentrated HNO 3. The mixtures were left over night and then heated in 1.6 kilowatts microwave oven for 30  min. After cooling to room temperature, 10  ml of double distilled water were added into the vessels and filtered via 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter papers. Finally, the filtrates were subjected to the total element analysis using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). Olsen-P (available P) was extracted by placing 1  g sample of soil in 20  ml of NaHCO 3 for 30  min. Similar amount of biochar samples were placed in 20  ml of NaHCO 3 for 30  min. The suspensions were vacuum filtered via 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter papers and analyzed using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). For C and N analyses, 3.5  mg for biochar, 5  mg for plant and 40  mg for soil, samples were weighted into <b>sample</b> <b>boats</b> and determined using C and N analyzer (Elementar Analyse GmbH, Hanau, Germany). The exchangeable cations and CEC of biochar were determined using BaCl 2 method. The exchangeable cations and CEC of soils were determined using NH 4 Cl method. NH 4 NO 3 (1  M) extractable fractions of trace nutrients and toxic elements were also determined following the extraction procedure proposed by the German national standard (DIN ISO 10730 2009).|$|R
