50|$|A large {{test system}} may require more rows and/or columns {{than a single}} <b>switch</b> <b>card</b> can accommodate, but it’s {{possible}} to expand a matrix by joining the rows and/or columns of several cards together. Depending on the <b>switch</b> <b>card</b> and mainframe selected, the rows of the cards may be connected together through the backplane of the mainframe or the rows may be wired externally.|$|R
50|$|Solo was a {{debit card}} in the United Kingdom {{introduced}} as a sister to the then existing Switch. Launched on 1 July 1997 by the <b>Switch</b> <b>Card</b> Scheme, it was designed for use on deposit accounts, {{as well as by}} customers who did not qualify for a <b>Switch</b> <b>card</b> (or, later, Maestro card) on current accounts such as teenagers. The Solo card scheme was decommissioned permanently on 31 March 2011.|$|R
50|$|The merger {{was also}} {{intended}} {{to increase the}} acceptance of foreign Maestro cards in the UK. However, despite the Maestro brand name, point of sale transactions in the UK were still processed by <b>Switch</b> <b>Card</b> Services Limited, later S2 Card Services Limited. Consequently, many retailers who advertise that they accept Maestro could only accept UK-issued <b>cards,</b> i.e. former <b>Switch</b> <b>cards</b> that supported both UK Domestic Maestro (UKDM) and Maestro International functionality.|$|R

50|$|Using {{a matrix}} <b>switch</b> <b>card</b> allows {{connecting}} any input to any output by closing the switch {{at the intersection}} (crosspoint) of a given row and column. The most common terminology to describe the matrix size is M rows by N columns (MxN). Matrix <b>switch</b> <b>cards</b> generally {{have two or three}} poles per crosspoint. As shown in Figure 3, a 5VDC source can be connected to any two terminals of the device under test (DUT). A function generator supplies pulses between another two terminals. Operation of the DUT can be verified by connecting an oscilloscope between two other terminals. The DUT pin connections can easily be programmed, so this system can be used to test a variety of components.|$|R
50|$|Back at {{the gaming}} table, it appears Londo is <b>switching</b> <b>cards</b> using {{some parts of}} his anatomy, later {{revealed}} {{to be one of}} his six tentacle penises, which is clearly cheating. When discovered, this causes a fight to break out, with Lennier courageously defending Londo.|$|R
40|$|Switching on a vertex of a graph {{involves}} swapping {{the sets}} of neighbours and non-neighbours of the vertex. The resultant graph {{is called a}} <b>switch</b> <b>card</b> of the original graph. The switch deck of a graph is the collection of all of its <b>switch</b> <b>cards.</b> The vertex-switch reconstruction problem then asks which graphs (termed non-VSR graphs) cannot be uniquely determined from their switch decks. A review of the published knowledge about this problem is followed by an improved bound {{on the number of}} edges in a non-VSR graph, and a bound {{on the size of the}} automorphism group of a non-VSR graph. Finally, the results of a computer search are presented, showing that no non-VSR graphs of order 8 or 12 exist...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two general}} types of Catalyst switches: fixed {{configuration}} models {{that are usually}} one or two rack units in size, with 12 to 80 ports; and modular switches in which virtually every component, from the CPU card to power supplies to <b>switch</b> <b>cards,</b> are individually installed in a chassis.|$|R
50|$|Given {{that the}} relays are {{isolated}} from each other, the terminals of each channel on the <b>switch</b> <b>card</b> are independent from the terminals {{of the other}} channels. As shown in Figure 5, each isolated Form A relay has two terminals. Two-pole isolated relays would have four terminals (two inputs and two outputs). A Form C isolated relay would have three terminals.|$|R

When the service was added, it became possible to make payments with a multifunctional card that combined ATM, cheque and debit card and international ATM facilities through MasterCard Cirrus or Visa Plus and sometimes the British Link ATM system. Their functionality was similar to the British <b>Switch</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R

Robin tries to stop Lily from opening the gift and finally <b>switches</b> <b>cards</b> with another present to disguise her gift.

40|$|Transparent pricing is a {{prerequisite}} for an efficient, competitive market and responsible consumer behavior. If the card industry were required to price its products in a straightforward manner, and it were less costly for consumers to <b>switch</b> <b>cards,</b> deceptive practices would be harder to maintain, Truth-in-Lending disclosures would be more effective, as consumers would be able to easily compare cards and make informed decisions about card usage, and competitive pressures would push down total card, prices, forcing the card industry to operate more efficiently, benefiting all consumers. I strongly urge Congress to pass legislation that creates transparency in credit card pricing and that creates an on-going regulatory system that is capable of quickly evaluating and responding to innovations in the consumer financial products marketplace...|$|R

50|$|Internal {{connections}} to the time switch (network) are on 2.56 Mbit/s (DS-30) Speech Links, each carrying thirty channels plus synchronization and data channels, on four wires plus a ground wire. Connections to the network are handled by the NT6X40AA DS-30 interface card on an LGC or LTC and these link may also be DS-512 optical interfaces. Using the NT6X44AA time <b>switch</b> <b>card,</b> LGCs and LTCs internally map channels on the NT6X48AA DS-30 & NT6X50AA/AB DS1 interface links to available channels on NT6X40AA DS-30 or NT6X40FA DS-512 interfaces out to the network. European PDTCs were complemented by the DTCOI2 and DTCO2. The DTCOI2 was designed to run PRI and DPNSS services as per existing PDTCOI and MSB7 peripherals. The DTCO2 was designed to carry CAS and SS7 as per existing PDTCO peripheral.|$|R
