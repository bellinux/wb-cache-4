It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E

The thesis is approached by the analytical method using classical four methods of interpretation and is based mainly on foreign sources: English, American, Canadian and German in particular.
