The approach is elaborated for two commonly seen (normal and deep) sliding modes. In terms of compatibility conditions across sliding and stable layers, new coupled elastic (<b>sliding</b> <b>layer)</b> -elastic (stable layer) (E-E) solutions, and plastic (<b>sliding</b> <b>layer)</b> -elastic-plastic (stable layer) (P-EP) solutions are developed.

40|$|Hard sphere {{colloidal}} particles are a basic model system for general research into phase behavior, ordering and out-equilibrium glass transitions. Experimentally {{it has been}} shown that oscillatory shearing of a monodisperse hard sphere glass, produces two different crystal orientations; a Face Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal with the close packed direction parallel to shear at high strains and an FCC crystal with the close packed direction perpendicular to shear at low strains. Here, using Brownian dynamics simulations of hard sphere particles, we have examined high volume fraction shear-induced crystals under oscillatory shear as well as the same volume fraction glass counterparts. We find that, while the displacements under shear of the glass are isotropic, the sheared FCC crystal structures oriented parallel to shear, are anisotropic due to the cooperative motion of velocity-vorticity <b>layers</b> of particles <b>sliding</b> over each other. These <b>sliding</b> <b>layers</b> generally result in lower stresses and less overall particle displacements.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{deals with}} the design of lined rockcaverns used for the storage of gas under high {{pressures}} (20 - 25 MPa). This storage technique has been developed in Swedenduring the last 20 years. The concept has been named LRC (LinedRock Cavern). The goal of the research has been to develop a methodologyfor {{the design of the}} cavern wall so that it can fulfil thesafety demands put placed upon it by the society. To achievethis, an extensive knowledge about the properties of the wallmaterials, and how they interact, is required. The proposed design methodology is based on the cavern wallbuild-up principles that have emerged during the many years ofdevelopment of the LRC concept. The cavern wall consists, inshort, of (from inside outwards) : a gastight steel lining, asliding layer of bitumen, a reinforced concrete lining, ashotcrete layer and finally the rock mass. In the thesis, a step-by-step approach is proposed toanalyse the deformations and strains that the cavern wall issubjected to as the rock caverns expands as a result of thepressurisation. The analysis begins with an assessment of thedeformation properties of the rock mass and proceeds with anestimation of the deformation in the most strained part of therock cavern. The analysis continues with an examination of howthe rock deformation is transmitted through the wall structure,ending in an assessment of the strain in the most strained partof the steel lining. The final step in the methodology is tocompare the calculated steel strain with the acceptable strain,derived from acceptable risk criteria or extracted fromrelevant codes. As an LRC storage is subjected to hundreds ofload cycles (with potentially high strain levels in the steellining) during its lifetime, the dimensioning load case is lowcycle fatigue. The methodology is based on several assumptions regardingthe properties of the structural parts included in the cavernwall and how they react to the pressure load, both as singleparts and in interaction with adjacent structural parts. Theassumptions regard e. g. the deformation properties of the rockmass, the behaviour of the rock mass during repeatedhigh-pressure loading, the crack distributing effect of thereinforcement and the properties of the <b>sliding</b> <b>layer.</b> Support for these assumptions has been gathered fromtheories, previous experiences and performed practical tests. The long concept development work has included numeroustechnical studies and tests, which have been used in thecreation of the design methodology. The experiences gained fromthe Pilot tests in Grängesberg have been especiallyvaluable to this end. A series of laboratory tests on themechanical properties of the <b>sliding</b> <b>layer,</b> for the load casein question, have been performed as part of this licentiatework. The proposed design methodology for the cavern wall is basedon a probabilistic approach. This approach has been chosen forseveral reasons, among others because LRC is a new technologywithout established design practice and because a probabilisticview {{is a good way to}} manage the uncertainties, which in thepresent case originates from the stochastic nature of the rockmass. The properties of the rock mass vary within the volumeand are better described by an interval or a distributioninstead of a deterministic value. The calculation tools used are in themselves rather simple. The basis is an elastoplastic analytical solution for thedeformation of the rock cavern during pressurisation. Thecalculations are performed as Monte Carlo simulations in aspreadsheet model. The choice of calculation tool was done fortwo main reasons, partly to get a lucid method where each stepin the process can be followed, partly because of limitationsin time and budget. However, a large number of FEM calculationshave been used, in addition to the observed behaviour of thePilot Plant, to verify and calibrate the model. The proposed methodology shows one practicable way ofdesigning an LRC storage. The methodology has already beenapplied in the design of the world 9 ̆ 2 s first large scale LRCstorage (the LRC Demo Plant at Skallen, near Halmstad insouth-western Sweden). Areas where it is judged possible to improve or supplementthe proposed design methodology are: 9 ̆ 5 A thorough evaluation of the deformationbehaviour of the Demo Plant can be used to check the validityof the assumptions made.

40|$|Interaction {{between two}} {{surfaces}} in relative motion can {{give rise to}} energy dissipation and hence sliding friction.

We describe exactly solvable model of planar layer strength and sliding with an arbitrary homogeneous distribution of local critical stresses. The macroscopic stress threshold of the athermal sliding is found. Kinetics of thermally-activated creep of the <b>sliding</b> <b>layer</b> is described. The rate of the thermally activated sliding is tightly connected with parameters of the low temperature strength. The sliding activation volume scales with the applied external stress as σ ^-β, where β < 1. The proposed model accounts for mechanisms and the yield stress of the low temperature deformation of polycluster metallic glasses, since intercluster boundaries of a polycluster metallic glass are natural sliding layers of the described type.

40|$|International audienceGiven that clay-rich {{landslides}} {{may become}} mobilized, leading to rapid mass movements (earthflows and debris flows), they pose critical problems in risk management worldwide. The most widely proposed mechanism leading to such flow-like movements is {{the increase in}} water pore pressure in the sliding mass, generating partial or complete liquefaction. This solid-to-liquid transition results in a dramatic reduction of mechanical rigidity in the liquefied zones, which could be detected by monitoring shear wave velocity variations. With this purpose in mind, the ambient seismic noise correlation technique {{has been applied to}} measure the variation in the seismic surface wave velocity in the Pont Bourquin landslide (Swiss Alps). This small but active composite earthslide-earthflow was equipped with continuously recording seismic sensors during spring and summer 2010. An earthslide of a few thousand cubic meters was triggered in mid-August 2010, after a rainy period. This article shows that the seismic velocity of the sliding material, measured from daily noise correlograms, decreased continuously and rapidly for several days prior to the catastrophic event. From a spectral analysis of the velocity decrease, it was possible to determine the location of the change {{at the base of the}} <b>sliding</b> <b>layer.</b> These results demonstrate that ambient seismic noise can be used to detect rigidity variations before failure and could potentially be used to predict landslides...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a special {{type of failure}} in <b>layered</b> materials with <b>sliding</b> <b>layers</b> that develops as a progressive breakage of layers forming a narrow zone. This zone propagates as a "bending crack", i. e. a crack that can be represented as a distribution of disclinations. This situation is analysed using a 2 D Cosserat continuum model. Edge dislocations (displacement discontinuities) and a disclination (the discontinuity in the derivative of layer deflection) are considered. The disclination does not create shear stresses along the axis perpendicular to the direction of layering, while the dislocation does not create a moment stress along the same axis. Semi-infinite and finite bending cracks normal to layering are considered. The moment stress concentration at the crack tip has a singularity of the power - 1 / 4. The possibility to derive equilibrium conditions for cracks and disclinations from J-type path independent integrals is also pointed out...|$|R
40|$|The {{plastic strain}} rate plays {{a central role}} in {{macroscopic}} models on elasto-viscoplasticity. In order to discuss the concept behind this quantity, we propose, first, a kinetic toy model to describe the dynamics of <b>sliding</b> <b>layers</b> representative of plastic deformation of single crystalline metals. The dynamic variable is given by the distribution function of relative strains between adjacent layers, and the plastic strain rate emerges as the average hopping rate between energy wells. We demonstrate the behavior of this model under different deformations and how it captures the elastic-to-plastic transition. Second, the kinetic toy model is reduced to a closed evolution equation for the average of the relative strain, allowing us to make a direct link to macroscopic theories. It is shown that the constitutive relation for the plastic strain rate does not only depend on the stress, but also on the macroscopic applied deformation rate, contrary to common practice...|$|R
