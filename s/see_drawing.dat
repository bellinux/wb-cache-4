5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (<b>see</b> <b>drawing).</b> Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E

2500|$|Games: Random {{numbers were}} first {{investigated}} {{in the context}} of gambling, and many randomizing devices, such as dice, shuffling playing cards, and roulette wheels, were first developed for use in gambling. The ability to produce random numbers fairly is vital to electronic gambling, and, as such, the methods used to create them are usually regulated by government Gaming Control Boards. Random drawings are also used to determine lottery winners. [...] Throughout history, randomness has been used for games of chance and to select out individuals for an unwanted task in a fair way (<b>see</b> <b>drawing</b> straws).|$|E
2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a three-terminal resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} potentiometer {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (<b>see</b> <b>drawing)</b> is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electric}} current flowing in a wire creates {{a magnetic field}} around the wire, due to Ampere's law (<b>see</b> <b>drawing</b> below). To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side by side. The magnetic field of all the turns of wire passes {{through the center of}} the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there. A coil forming the shape of a straight tube (a helix) is called a solenoid.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{discharging}} battery or a galvanic cell, the cathode is {{the positive}} terminal since {{that is where}} the current flows out of the device (<b>see</b> <b>drawing).</b> This outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the electrolyte to the positive cathode (chemical energy is responsible for this [...] "uphill" [...] motion). It is continued externally by electrons moving inwards, this negative charge moving inwards constituting positive current flowing outwards. For example, the Daniell galvanic cell's copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode.|$|E
