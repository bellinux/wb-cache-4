5|$|Madeleine {{was born}} in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At the request of her parents, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court {{statutory}} powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde haired, with blue-green eyes, a <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a <b>small,</b> <b>brown</b> Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E
5|$|There {{was nothing}} to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.|$|E

25|$|Leptothorax acervorum is a <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> {{to yellow}} ant in the {{subfamily}} Myrmicinae. It was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793. L. acervorum is vastly distributed across the globe, most {{commonly found in}} the coniferous forests of Central, Western and Northern Europe. The morphology of L. acervorum is extremely {{similar to that of}} other Leptothorax ants. The difference arises in the two-toned appearance of L. acervorum, with the head and metasoma being darker than the mesosoma segment of the body, and hair across its body. Following Bergmann's rule—unusually, for ectothermic animals—body size increases with latitude.|$|E

25|$|The yellowfin whiting is a sandy brown to pale silvery grey colour, with {{a darker}} dorsal surface and paler underside. There is a narrow silver mid-lateral band with a {{brownish}} band above, although these bands may be pale or indistinct. The dorsal fins are both hyaline {{with rows of}} <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> spots and the anal fins are pale yellow with a cream margin. The ventral fins are also yellowish, and the pectoral fin is pale yellow to hyaline with a fine dusting and lacks a dark spot at the base. As yellowfin whiting grow, the yellow colour of the fins often fades and in large specimens may be completely absent. The caudal fin is greyish.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, the parapatric {{relatives}} of the L. excubitor are the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) from East Asia and the northern shrike (L. borealis) and loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus) from North America. The northern grey shrike is sympatric in winter quarters with each of its three close relatives at the north of their range. Their overall colouration is – apparently plesiomorphically – shared in sub-Saharan Africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey-backed fiscal (L. excubitoroides) which is found from the Sahel eastwards, and Mackinnon's fiscal (L. mackinnoni) of the Congo Basin region. The lesser grey shrike (L. minor, Balkans to Central Asia) seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike superspecies between Eastern Europe and Central Asia; {{it may be more}} closely related to the <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> shrikes and resemble the bold, aggressive and hard-to-catch grey shrikes because of Batesian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E

25|$|A. guttatus {{is easily}} {{differentiated}} from {{other members of}} the A. ischnosoma group by a slender (vs. moderately thick) humeral process (maximum width 10.011.8% its length vs. 13.218.4). A. mahakamensis is differentiated from other members of its group by a rounded (vs. angular) anterior margin of the anal fin, and a more slender body. A. septentrionalis can be differentiated by members of the A. ischnoma group by a smaller dorsal to adipose distance (4.45.7% standard length vs. 6.29.8), fewer branchiostegal rays (4 vs. 56) and an almost uniformly cream colour pattern with few very <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> spots (vs. a variegated colour pattern with numerous brown patches). A. strigosus can be differentiated from members of the A. ischnosoma species group by a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin of the adipose fin and a more slender body; the genital papilla in male A. strigosus is also morphologically different from other members of its species group (short and thick vs. long and thin). A. ischnosoma is distinguished from {{other members of the}} A. ischnosoma group by a greater distance between the dorsal fin and adipose fin (9.010.1% SL vs. 4.48.7) and a greater exposure of the premaxillary teeth when the mouth is closed (one-third vs. less than one-fifth to none). A. gyrinus can be distinguished from its congeners by a concave posterior margin of the pectoral fin.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a <b>small</b> <b>brown</b> stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on his cheek, and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt on his cheek and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E
