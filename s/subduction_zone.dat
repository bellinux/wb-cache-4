5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a <b>subduction</b> <b>zone.</b> A <b>subduction</b> <b>zone</b> is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E

Therefore topography and gravimetry confirm the existence of two separate classes of <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> which appear to be independent of the age and nature of the subducting slab.

The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly {{and one more}} by heart failure.

5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average <b>subduction</b> <b>zone</b> thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical <b>subduction</b> <b>zone</b> earthquake.|$|E

A large M7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault in 900 C.E. may have generated a tsunami in Puget Sound. The 1872 event east of the Cascades is not understood well {{due to the lack of}} instrumental records and reliable felt intensity reports.|$|E
40|$|Two main {{types of}} <b>{{subduction}}</b> <b>zones</b> call be distinguished: (1) those where the subduction hinge migrates {{away from the}} upper plate; and (2) those in which the subduction hinge migrates toward the upper plate. Apart from a few exceptions, this distinction seems to apply particularly for W-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> and E- or NE-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. Moreover, the rate of subduction {{is larger than the}} convergence rate along W-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones,</b> whereas it is smaller along E- or NE-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> Along W-inclined slabs, the subduction rate is the convergence rate plus the slab retreat rate, which tends to equal the backarc extension rate. Along E- or NE-dipping slabs, the shortening in the upper plate decreases the subduction rate, and no typical backare basin forms. Relative to the mantle, the W-directed slab hinges are fixed, whereas they move west or southwest along E- or NE-direeted <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> The single vergent accretionary prism related to W-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> is formed at the expenses of the shallow layers of the lower plate. The orogens generated by E- and NE-dipping subductions are double vergent since the early stages, and upper plate rocks mostly compose them until continental collision takes place, eventually involving the rocks of the lower plate more extensively. The convergence/shortening ratio in this type of orogens is higher than 1 and is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the upper plate. The higher the viscosity the smaller the shortening and faster the subduction rate. The convergence/shortening ratio along W-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> is instead generally lower than 1. W-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> provide larger volumes of lithospheric return into the mantle than the opposite E- or NE-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> The latter may contribute to refertilize the shallow upper mantle. These observations suggest that <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> are passive features with respect to the far-field velocity of plate motions and the relative "eastward" mantle flow, implicit with a net "westward" rotation of the lithosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Mediterranean <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> and their deep slab structure started during the Late Cretaceous and {{is a result of}} the relative movement of the African and European plate including the independent motion of five microplates (Adria, Iberia, Alcapia, and Tiszia), which caused <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> consuming the Tethys Ocean – a Mesozoic Ocean preserved in the Alps. This subduction of the Alpine Tethys since Late Cretaceous caused a very complex plate-boundary-reorganization between seven (micro-) plates. Since the last 45 Ma until today the Alpine Tethys is still consumed by four main still active <b>subduction</b> <b>zones,</b> on which will mainly be focused in this paper: The Alps-Betics or Alpine-Betic and the Dinarides-Hellenides-Taurides <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> with an eastwards- or north-eastwards-direction and the Apennines-Maghrebides and Carpathian <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> with a westward-direction.

40|$|Giant {{earthquakes}} (Mw≥ 8. 5) usually {{occur on}} the boundary between subducting and overriding plates of converging margins, {{but it is not}} yet clear which (if any) <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> are more prone to produce such a kind of events. Here we show that <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> may have different capabilities to produce giant earthquakes. We analyze the frequency-magnitude distribution of the interplate earthquakes at <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> that occurred during 1976 – 2007 and calculate the propensity (defined as the average annual rate) of giant events for about half of the <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> We find that the b value of interplate earthquakes is significantly different among the <b>subduction</b> <b>zones,</b> and out-of-sample giant earthquakes (before 1976 and after 2007) have occurred preferentially in high-propensity areas. Besides the importance for seismic hazard assessment and risk mitigation, our results seem to indicate that a higher seismicity rate does not necessarily imply a higher likelihood to generate giant earthquakes, {{and the way in which}} the stress is released at a subduction interface does not change significantly after the occurrence of such events...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAttempts {{to explore}} the {{dynamics}} of convergent boundaries are essentially based on the confrontation of the observed kinematics to the intrinsic dynamic properties of <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> Which often mismatch. On {{the basis of the}} mantle flow model of Conrad and Behn (2010), I explore the role of the often neglected basal drag that the flowing mantle exerts underneath each plate. After computing the total torque underneath each plate, I find that (i) the net torque due to basal drag systematically drives plates away from their ridges and towards <b>subduction</b> <b>zones,</b> conformably to the plate circuit; (ii) compressive zones are found where the net drag forces from upper and lower plates are converging, and diverging for extensive zones; (iii) trench migration is dictated by the difference between the upper plate drag force and lower plate drag force. In other words, trenches advance where upper plates pulls the <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> and the lower plate pushes it. These results indicate that differences in the dynamics of plate boundaries arise from the global mantle circulation more than the from the local properties of <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> The often neglected drag force thus appears crucial to reconcile the kinematics and dynamics of <b>subduction</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The rate of {{subduction}} {{is larger}} than the convergence rate along W-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones,</b> whereas it is smaller along E- or NE-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> Along W-directed slabs, the subduction rate is the convergence rate plus the slab retreat rate, which tends to equal the backarc extension rate. Along E- or NE-directed slabs, the subduction rate is decreased by the shortening in the upper plate. The two opposite kinematics predict a subduction hinge migrating away from (W-directed subduction), or toward the (E-NE-directed subduction) upper plate. Relative to the mantle, the W-directed slab hinges are fixed, whereas they move west or southwest along E-or NE-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> With a given convergence rate, the amount of shortening in the orogens related to E- or NE-directed <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the upper plate, i. e., higher the viscosity, smaller the shortening and faster the subduction rate. The convergence/shortening ratio in this type of orogens can be a useful tool for mapping upper plate viscosity values. In the central Andes the ratio is 2. 2. These observations suggest that <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> are passive features with respect to the far field velocity of plate motions and the relative “eastward ” mantle flow. The slab pull is questioned as not a first order force for plate motions. Mantle convection is also inadequate to explain the Earth’s surface kinematics. The Earth’s rotation seems to be the simplest candidate to explain the asymmetry along <b>subduction</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia <b>Subduction</b> <b>Zone.</b> Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later.

Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> <b>zone</b> are very infrequent.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> <b>zone</b> in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E

30|$|The {{property}} {{and behavior of}} deep subduction-zone fluids are substantial to the mass transfer at the slab-mantle interface in subduction channels. This is also a particularly important challenge because the fluids mediate the recycling of crustal components into the mantle and the reworking of the crust itself. Continental deep subduction triggers metamorphic dehydration and partial melting at the slab-mantle interface, {{but it did not}} create juvenile crust like arc volcanics above oceanic <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> Nevertheless, partial melting of the SSC ultramafic metasomes gives rise to mafic igneous rocks in collisional orogens. The geochemical differentiation through dehydration melting and melt-peridotite reaction in continental <b>subduction</b> <b>zones</b> generally resembles that in oceanic <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> However, this represents a different type of recycling of the continental crust compared to the more common recycling of terrigenous sediment in oceanic <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> Partial melting of the continental SSC ultramafic metasomes also represents a different way of crustal growth and crust-mantle interaction with element fractionation from that in the much better studied case of arc volcanism above oceanic <b>subduction</b> <b>zones.</b> Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate comprehensively UHP metamorphic rocks and their associated assemblages such as ophiolites, peridotites, and pyroxenites in order to unravel the geochemical behavior of fluids and element recycling in the subduction factory.|$|R
