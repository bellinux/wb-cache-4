40|$|Cyclic voltammetric {{studies of}} electrosynthetically {{prepared}} pure and doped thin films of cobalt hydroxide (on a platinum foil substrate) in 1 M KOH show that Co(OH) 2 undergoes a quasi-reversible redox reaction between a nearly quadrivalent black oxidic phase and a trivalent brown bronze-like phase. The coulombic efficiency is 60. A common scheme is {{proposed for the}} electrode reactions of oxide electrodes in alkaline media, namely: MII(OH) 2 âHMIIIO 2 âMIVO 2, where M = Mn, Co, Ni. The three metals execute different steps in this two-electron redox reaction, either reversibly or quasireversibly. Based on this scheme, new compounds are suggested as possible electrode materials for <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> systems. The effect of eight, different, dopant metal ions on the redox reactions of Co(OH) 2 is investigated. Only La 3 + ions are found to influence favourably the performance of Co(OH) 2 as an electrode material. Â© 1991...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to minimizing of energy consumption by addressing battery management techniques that exploit the charge recovery effect inherent to many <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> <b>batteries.</b> We review results that pertain to the capacity of a battery and its dependence on the intensity of the discharge current. The phenomena of charge recovery that takes place under bursty or pulsed discharge conditions is identified as a mechanism that can be exploited to enhance the capacity of a battery. The bursty nature of many data traffic sources suggests that data transmissions may provide natural opportunities for charge recovery. We explore stochastic models to track charge recovery in conjunction with bursty discharge processes. Using the postulated model, we identify the improvement to battery capacity that results from pulsed discharge driven by bursty stochastic discharge demand. The insight from this analysis leads us to propose discharge shaping techniques that trade-off energy efficiency with delay...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a period}} of some 5 years Canadian Astronautics Limited (CAL) has {{developed}} a system to autonomously manage, and thus prolong the life of, <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> <b>batteries.</b> During the development, the system was aimed at the space vehicle application using nickel cadmium batteries, but {{is expected to be}} able to enhance the life and performance of any rechargeable electrochemical couple. The system handles the cells of a battery individually and thus avoids the problems of over, and under, drive that inevitably occur in a battery of cells managed by an averaging system. This individual handling also allow cells to be totally bypassed in the event of failure, thus avoiding the losses associated with low capacity, partial short circuit, and the catastrophe of open circuit. The system has an optional capability of managing redundant batteries simultaneously, adding the advantage of on line reconditioning of one battery, while the other maintains the energy storage capability of the overall system. As developed, the system contains a dedicated, redundant, microprocessor, but the capability exists to have this computing capability time shared, or remote, and operating through a data link. As adjuncts to the basic management system CAL has developed high efficiency, polyphase, power regulators for charge and discharge power conditioning...|$|R

40|$|Electroluminescent {{devices such}} as {{light-emitting}} diodes (LED) and high-energy density batteries. These new polymers offer cost savings, weight reduction, ease of processing, and inherent rugged design compared to conventional semiconductor materials. The photovoltaic industry has grown more than 30 % {{during the past three}} years. Lightweight, flexible solar modules are being used by the U. S. Army and Marine Corps for field power units. LEDs historically used for indicator lights are now being investigated for general lighting to replace fluorescent and incandescent lights. These so-called solid-state lights are becoming more prevalent across the country since they produce efficient lighting with little heat generation. Conductive polymers are being sought for battery development as well. Considerable weight savings over conventional cathode materials used in <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> make portable devices easier to carry and electric cars more efficient and nimble. Secondary battery sales represent an $ 8 billion industry annually. The purpose of the project was to synthesize and characterize conductive polymers. TRACE Photonics Inc. has researched critical issues which affect conductivity. Much of their work has focused on production of substituted poly(phenylenevinylene) compounds. These compounds exhibit greater solubility over the parent polyphenylenevinylene, making them easier to process. Alkoxy substituted groups evaluated during this study included: methoxy, propoxy, and heptyloxy. Synthesis routes for production of alkoxy-substituted poly phenylenevinylene were developed.

40|$|One {{application}} domain {{the mobile}} computing community {{has not yet}} entered is that of grid computing [...] the aggregation of networkconnected computers to form a large-scale, distributed system used to tackle complex scientific or commercial problems. In this paper we present the challenge of harvesting the increasingly widespread availability of Internet-connected wireless mobile devices such as PDAs and laptops to be beneficially used within the emerging national and global computational grid. The integration of mobile wireless consumer devices into the Grid initially seems unlikely due to the inherent limitations typical of mobile devices, such as reduced CPU performance, small <b>secondary</b> <b>storage,</b> heightened <b>battery</b> consumption sensitivity, and unreliable low-bandwidth communication. However, the millions of laptops and PDAs sold annually suggest that this untapped abundance should not be prematurely dismissed. Given {{that the benefits of}} combining the resources of mobile devices with the computational grid are potentially enormous, one must compensate for the inherent limitations of these devices in order to successfully utilise them in the Grid. In this paper we identify the research challenges arising from this problem and propose our vision of a potential architectural solution. We suggest a proxy-based, clustered system architecture with favourable deployment, interoperability, scalability, adaptivity, and fault-tolerance characteristics as well as an economic model to stimulate future research in this emerging field...|$|R
40|$|The zinc protoporphyrin/haemoglobin (ZPP/Hb) {{ratio was}} {{measured}} in the field with a haematofluorometer. A significant increase in ZPP/Hb ratio with advancing age was found in 1295 men who denied any excess exposure to lead. Ninety-seven per cent of the results were below 110 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (4. 4 microgram ZPP/g Hb). The ZPP/Hb ratio was determined in a lead-exposed population of 2275 men, and in 305 a blood lead analysis was also performed. A blood lead limit of 2. 9 mumol/l (60 microgram/ 100 ml) corresponds to about 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (20 microgram/g). This limit was exceeded in workers engaged in <b>secondary</b> lead smelting, <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> manufacture, car radiator repair, crystal glass manufacture, <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> repair, ship breaking, metal foundries, the ceramic industry, scrap metal handling, and PVC plastic manufacture. Other occupations caused lower lead exposures with ZPP/Hb ratios between 110 and 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) : such ratios were found in men from shooting ranges, in leaded pane manufacturers, gunsmiths, car paint sprayers, type setters, steel rolling mill workers, shipbuilders and welders, car mechanics, lead pigment handlers, and solderers. Increased ZPP/Hb ratios and blood lead levels in 210 workers were associated with a decrease in haemoglobin concentration in the blood. Thus, the haematofluorometer {{has proved to be}} very useful for screening purposes. A blood lead determination should be performed if the ZPP/Hb ratio exceeds 300 microgram ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (12 microgram/g) ...|$|R
