5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, gave <b>some</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> East Anglian events, but Yorke {{suggests}} that the annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written {{by a member of the}} religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by Henry of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated in {{his efforts}} to {{intercept}} the convoy at anchor, Willaumez determined to meet it at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for the convoy, seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained <b>some</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} Wallace didn’t {{come back to}} Neptune to play basketball, as he {{originally}} said.

Veronica shows <b>some</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan stole a boat. However, when the boat is searched they do not find anyone—just evidence that people were there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away {{while he was in}} it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to characterize the historic food web of the San Francisco Estuary because of the dramatic changes in geography, hydrology, and species composition {{that have occurred in}} the past century. However, monitoring begun in the 1970s gives <b>some</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the historic dynamics of the foodweb. Prior to the 1980s the LSZ was dominated by a phytoplankton-driven foodweb, a stable mesoplankton population dominated by the copepod Eurytemora affinis, and large macrozooplankton typified by San Francisco bay shrimp and mysid shrimps. These provided nutrition and energy to native filter feeders such as the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and planktivores such as delta smelt and juvenile salmon.|$|E
