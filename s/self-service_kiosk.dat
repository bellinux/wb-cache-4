40|$|Background Although {{medication}} reconciliation (MR) {{can reduce}} medication discrepancies, {{it is challenging to}} operationalise. Consequently, {{we developed a}} health information technology (HIT) to collect a patient medication history and make it available to the primary care (PC) provider. We deployed a <b>self-service</b> <b>kiosk</b> in a PC clinic that permits patients to indicate a medication adherence history. Patient responses are immediately viewable in the legacy electronic health record. This paper describes a survey developed to assess PC provider perceptions of our HIT and HIT implementation effectiveness. Methods We developed and administered a survey to all PC providers to assess technology implementation effectiveness. The survey included scales measuring (1) user attitudes towards MR, (2) perceptions of our HIT and (3) the local organisational climate for implementation. We also assessed the consistency and quality of tool use. Results Nearly 90 % of PC providers responded to the survey and 58 % indicated that they were familiar with the technology and had seen the tool output. Most providers believed that MR represented an important safety intervention, although 43 % did not believe that they had the necessary resources to manage discrepancies. Composite scale scores for the 58 % of respondents familiar with the HIT indicate that the majority favoured our tool over usual care. However, composite scale scores suggest that the climate for implementation at our facility was suboptimal. Overall, the quality and consistency of tool use among providers was very heterogeneous. Conclusions A patient <b>self-service</b> <b>kiosk</b> offers an efficientmechanismto collect amedication adherence history; provider survey responses indicate that they appreciated and used the MR kiosk output. Nonetheless, opportunities exist to improve data displays and embed decision support to facilitate discrepancy management...|$|E
40|$|This study {{intends to}} propose "Self-Service Technology Adoption Model" by {{utilizing}} {{the knowledge and}} experiences of front line experts. The Agent-Based Model has a fuzzy inference system to let passengers choose a check-in option: a conventional style check-in position or a <b>self-service</b> <b>kiosk.</b> The experiments are conducted with observed data, which are collected from the airline’s Departure Control System (DCS). We tried approximating the experimental space to “the real world” and evaluating the proposed model by measuring how it reproduces the observed self-service usage rate in “the real world”. This study also suggests the efficient practice of air–travel passenger handling with self-service kiosks in an international passenger terminal by the simulation of the proposed agent-based model. Through conducting the experiments, the scenario and the key factor are indicated, which may possibly accelerate the self-service usage rate with cost effective way and less impact for customer services...|$|E
