40|$|In {{parliamentary}} systems, parties {{compete for}} votes and {{offices in the}} electoral arena, but in many systems they also cooperate in the legislative arena. This article examines {{the question of how}} the government <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> affects their legislative behaviour. We develop a simple spatial model that includes parties’ positional goals (vote, office, etc.) to formalize the notion of accommodating legislative behaviour. The model implies that government parties are most accommodating while opposition parties are least accommodating. The hypothesis is evaluated by comparing two pairs of similar political systems: Danish and Finnish coalition governments, as well as German and Australian bicameralism. The case studies support the main hypothesis that government status systematically affects parties’ level of accommodation. We discuss the implications for two seminal approaches in comparative institutional analysis advanced by Lijphart (1999 b) and Tsebelis (2002) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{reviews the}} essence of the restorative justice principle as an approach in the settlement of criminal cases, and it aims to provide an overview of the construction of the restorative justice principle in criminal law enforcement. The outcomes of the research indicate that the restorative justice principle has been subject to frequent study in its understanding as an alternative criminal case settlement method, by way of positioning outside the criminal judiciary system. As it turns out in practice, however, it has certain weaknesses, particularly in view of the accountability and legitimacy aspects of its establishment. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a scientific investigation process for the purpose of determining the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> involved in a case, as well as for positioning the case concerned. Based on such view, the restorative justice principle appears to be the ideal approach to be applied in the criminal judiciary system...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{studies the}} effect of being an {{incumbent}} party on the support of voters in the multi-party system of the Netherlands. We test the responsibility hypothesis by specifying how the ‘incumbency effect’ is moderated by voters’ perception of government performance, as well as voters' ability to assign responsibility for this performance to specific parties in the coalition government. A conditional logit regression on respondents’ vote intention from a pooled, cross-sectional data set of six Dutch parliamentary election studies, shows a positive effect of incumbency status on party support for larger parties and a negative effect for smaller parties. Larger parties benefit from {{the positive effect of}} incumbency status {{to such an extent that}} it compensates for a bad performance of government. This confirmation of the responsibility hypothesis contrasts with the results from previous studies. Taken together, the results suggest that the incumbency <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties,</b> government performance, and parties’ perceived responsibility for this performance affects voting behavior in a more complex way than suggested by previous research...|$|E

40|$|Government Status and Legislative Behavior Ganghof/Bräuninger 2 In {{parliamentary}} systems, parties {{compete for}} votes and {{offices in the}} electoral arena but in many systems they also cooperate in the legislative arena. This paper examines {{the question of whether}} the government <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> affects their legislative behaviour and, hence, policy outcomes. We develop a simple veto player model that includes parties ’ positional goals (vote, office, etc.) to formalize the notion of accommodat-ing legislative behaviour. The model predicts that government parties are most accommodating while opposi-tion parties are least accommodating. The hypothesis is then tested by comparing two pairs of most similar political systems: Danish and Finnish coalition governments, as well as German and Australian bicameral-ism. The case studies support the main hypothesis that government status systematically affects parties ’ level of accommodation. We conclude that this has important implications for the two major approaches in com-parative institutional analysis advanced by Lijphart (1999) and Tsebelis (2002). Whilst Lijphart’s distinction between joint and divided responsibility cannot provide a consistent theoretical rationale of his two-dimensional map of democracies, Tsebelis ’ conception of purely policy-seeking actors may be insufficient t...|$|E
40|$|With {{increased}} {{level of}} globalisation and Europeanization in society, political parties {{are faced with}} new challenges in how to organise themselves. But these changes also apply for political scientist, {{in the sense that}} one must (re) consider the theoretical framework in understanding the nature of political parties. This paper analyses different theoretical perspectives on political parties, with particular focus on the ontological <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties.</b> Examining cleavage-oriented and more functionalistic-oriented perspective the role of the nation-state vis-à-vis political parties is depicted. The role of the nation-state in social science has also been under scrutiny for some time, and has lead several researchers to argue that social science is dominated by what is dubbed as ‘methodological nationalism’. The question is whether the theories on political parties assume that there exist a nation-state or if political parties are possible without it or at transnational level? Following this debate a cosmopolitan perspective is used as a starting point in evaluating how cleavage-based theories of political parties can be used in explaining transnational parties. The paper concludes that from both a cleavage and functionalistic perspective a transnational party seems possible, but that the reasons for this are based on different ontological views of what a party is. political parties; Europeanization; Norway; political science...|$|E

It examines both established principles and recent developments relevant to the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s role. Part II discusses some {{of the rules of}} legal ethics that provide both guidance and restraints on corporate counsel. It focuses on the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s duty to provide the client with independent professional judgment and to keep the client informed about the representation. It also explores the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s duty to maintain the confidentiality of client information and duties specific to representing an organizational client. Part III explains recent developments that may affect the role of corporate counsel, including the first comprehensive revision of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct since 1983 and the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s promulgation of rule 205 pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Part IV assesses {{the obligations of}} lawyers in light of the cumulative effect of the two systems: laws and ethics rules. It concludes that a system of justice based on the principle of rule of law must take account of public policy articulated by legislative and judicial authority and must make judgments based on conduct rather than the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> involved in legal issues...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} the mediation {{as one of the}} methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The main reason for choosing this topic was topicality of issues because in the last years the mediation has been developing in our country. A relatively recent adoption of The Mediation Act No. 202 / 2012 Sb., which is effective since 1 st September 2012, contributed to this development. The thesis involves seven chapters that are further subdivided. In the Chapter One, basic information relating to an alternative dispute resolution are summarized. Characteristic features are shown there and there are more details of each method of ADR. Chapter Two examines basic characteristic of the mediation as a method of ADR. This chapter consists of four subchapters that analyze in more detail historical development of the mediation, basic characteristic features of the mediation, basic principles of the mediation and finally also advantages and disadvantages of the mediation. The status of the mediator is discussed in the Chapter Three of this thesis. The main focus is on the question of impartiality and independence of the mediator, as well as its duty of confidentiality. Chapter Four includes basic information about the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> to the conflict because {{they are the ones who}} have [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of trade unions in the public and political dimension associated with maintaining by them socio-political movements, which in different periods of political history had the status of social movements. Among these movements are a social democratic and labor movements in Europe, which later acquired the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties.</b> In addition, social movements are informal and very broad associations that need support group of values, or focused on single-step action, such as changing the current ruling power. In these circumstances, trade unions have to choose cooperation or dismissal from the social movements. The main cause of optimum interaction of trade unions and social movements are spontaneous occurrence of the latter. However, the broad social base, which is natural {{in the social and}} political movements, based on the negative perception of individuals and groups surrounding social reality. In this regard unions can support or deny certain facts of social life. The {{development of}} social movements is an important feature of democratic political life. Access to political participation is determined by the ability of self-organization and freedom to nominate requirements. The trade union movement at this stage has the ability to mobilize citizens to defend their labor rights that are under regulatory pressure correction and minimization by reviewing the priorities of the welfare state. New typological features of social movements are formed {{on the basis of a}} new type of social and communication links.

40|$|American {{political}} parties, {{throughout their}} history, have functioned as central institutions of governance and democracy. While their legislative and policy making role remains vital today, {{their identity as}} a link between citizens and government has changed markedly in this century. A major reason for their shifting electoral role has been the emergence of state governments as active regulators {{of the political process}} in the Progressive Era. ^ Since the late 19602 ̆ 7 s, the U. S. Supreme Court has adjudicated a series of disputes involving this legalized electoral environment, becoming in the process a major interpreter of the legal status of political parties. The absence of any reference to parties in the text of the Constitution has given the justices of the Court significant authority in structuring the constitutional <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties.</b> The dissertation examines the ideas which have guided the exercise of that authority, and explores their implications for the American party system and American democracy. ^ Analysis of Court opinions involving ballot access, party organization/nomination procedures, campaign finance, and patronage reveals two opposing schools of thought among the justices of the Court. One viewpoint envisions politics as a 2 ̆ 2 natural order 2 ̆ 2 nurtured by wide party competition and access to the electoral arena, and perverted by many state regulations. A contrasting vision sees politics as a 2 ̆ 2 constructed order 2 ̆ 2 nurtured by stable party competition and best preserved by state regulation. These differing ideas of party politics are reflected in the justices 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of political competition and choice, party structure and functions, judicial standards of review, and the proper role of government in the electoral process. ^ The political implications of these contending viewpoints extend beyond the purely judicial realm, shaping the future of the American electoral system and efforts to build stronger parties. An analysis of these schools of thought using a set of 2 ̆ 2 strong party/responsible party 2 ̆ 2 attributes concludes that, while the 2 ̆ 2 natural order 2 ̆ 2 offers parties some increase in autonomy, neither viewpoint offers a clear road to stronger parties. The quest for party renewal must ultimately be as political as it has been judicial. In addition, these opinions reflects a broader, continuing debate over whether democracy is best understood as expression (access, competition) or governance (legislative representation, stability). ...|$|E
