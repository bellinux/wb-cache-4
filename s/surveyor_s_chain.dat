40|$|Most murine {{and human}} T cells express an antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) {{composed of a}} disulfide-linked heterodimer of two Ig-like proteins, termed a and (3, {{that is associated with}} an invariant complex of proteins termed CD 3 (1). Recently, a second TCR was found on the surface of a small percentage of thymocytes and peripheral T cells (reviewed in reference 1). This TCR consists of two chains termed y and S, which can be either disulfide linked or noncovalently associated (2). Like the TCR a/R, the TCRy/S is expressed on the cell membrane in association with the CD 3 complex (2 - 5). The biological functions and ligands for the TCRy/S are unknown. We previously described a CD 3 +, IL- 2 -dependent normal human thymocyte clone, termed CII, that expressed a CD 3 -associated heterodimer composed of a 40 -kD y chain noncovalently associated with a 38 -kD protein presumably representing a <b>S</b> <b>chain</b> (3).

40|$|The Viking Orbiters {{determined}} that the surface of Mars northern residual cap is water ice. Many researchers have related observed atmospheric water vapor abundances to seasonal exchange between reservoirs such as the polar caps, but {{the extent to which}} the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere remains uncertain. Early studies of the ice coverage and albedo of the northern residual Martian polar cap using Mariner 9 and Viking images reported that there were substantial internannual differences in ice deposition on the polar cap, a result that suggested a highly variable Martian climate. However, some of the data used in these studies were obtained at differing values of heliocentric solar longitude (Ls). Reevaluation of this dataset in indicated that the residual cap undergoes seasonal brightening throughout the summer, and indicated that this process repeats from year to year.
