5|$|Several documentaries {{have told}} Vrba's story, {{including}} Genocide (1973), directed by Michael Darlow for ITV in the UK; Auschwitz and the Allies (1982), directed by Rex Bloomstein and Martin Gilbert for the BBC; and <b>Shoah</b> (1985), directed by Claude Lanzmann.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the <b>Shoah</b> Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit {{organization}} with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work. Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998).|$|E

25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The <b>Shoah</b> must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The <b>Shoah</b> has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Announced in June 2006, the testimonies of 52,000 survivors, rescuers {{and others}} {{involved}} in the Holocaust is housed in the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences {{as a part of}} the USC <b>Shoah</b> Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, {{there has}} been some reassessment, given the {{conditions}} of the times. The Last of the Unjust, released in 2013, is a documentary centring on interviews with Murmelstein that were filmed by Claude Lanzmann in 1975, during the production of his masterwork <b>Shoah.</b> The interviews were not used in the earlier film.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, French Tunisia {{was ruled}} by the collaborationist Vichy {{government}} located in Metropolitan France. The antisemitic Statute on Jews enacted by the Vichy was also implemented in Vichy North Africa, and overseas French territories. Thus, the persecution, and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943, {{was part of the}} <b>Shoah</b> in France.|$|E
25|$|Anson Rabinbach accused Nolte of {{attempting}} to erase German guilt for the Holocaust. Ian Kershaw wrote that Nolte was claiming that the Jews had essentially brought the Holocaust down on themselves, and were the authors of their own misfortunes in the <b>Shoah.</b> Elie Wiesel called Nolte, together with Klaus Hildebrand, Andreas Hillgruber, and Michael Stürmer, one of the “four bandits” of German historiography.|$|E
25|$|Chernivtsi was {{inhabited}} by Ukrainians, Romanians, Poles, Ruthenians, Jews, Roma, and Germans.

In December 2014, the company came to a $60 million compensation settlement with French Holocaust survivors living in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans criticized Nolte, {{accusing him}} of taking too seriously the work of Holocaust deniers, whom Evans called cranks, not historians. Likewise, Evans charged that Nolte was guilty of making assertions unsupported by the evidence, such as claiming that SS massacres of Russian Jews were a form of counterinsurgency, or taking at face value the self-justifying claims of German generals who professed to be ignorant of the <b>Shoah.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch {{immigrants}} to Amsterdam were mostly Huguenots, Flemings, Sephardi Jews and Westphalians. Huguenots {{came after the}} Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the Eighty Years' War. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was Jewish. Just twenty per cent of them survived the <b>Shoah.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1979 John Paul II {{visited the}} Auschwitz {{concentration}} camp in Poland, {{where many of}} his compatriots (mostly Jews) had perished during the Nazi occupation in World War II, the first pope to do so. In 1998 he issued We Remember: A Reflection on the <b>Shoah,</b> which outlined his thinking on the Holocaust. He became the first pope known to have made an official papal visit to a synagogue, when he visited the Great Synagogue of Rome on 13 April 1986.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{all these factors}} had had their effect on the {{valuation}} of the confiscated assets, very little was left. In total, NOK 7.8 million was awarded to principals and heirs of Jewish property confiscated by the Nazis. This was less than the administrative fees charged by governmental agencies for probate. It did not include assets seized by the government that belonged to non-Norwegian citizens, and that of citizens that left no legal heirs. This last category was formidable, as 230 entire Jewish households were killed {{during the course of}} the <b>Shoah.</b>|$|E
25|$|USY's {{trips to}} Israel, USY Israel Pilgrimage, consist of an {{optional}} week in Poland or Eastern Europe {{followed by a}} month in Israel, learning about Jewish communities and the <b>Shoah</b> (Holocaust). Pilgrimage trips visit every major city and region, including Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Tiberias, Beersheba, and Eilat. In addition to city life, the program incorporates many hiking opportunities and outdoor experiences, in areas including the Golan Heights, the Jordan River, the Galilee the Mediterranean Sea, Masada, the Dead Sea, the Negev, the Red Sea, and archaeological digs of ancient Jewish civilization, all led by professional tour guides.|$|E
25|$|The Holocaust {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} many films, {{including}} Oscar winners Schindler's List, The Pianist and Life Is Beautiful. With the aging population of Holocaust survivors, there has been increasing attention in recent years to preserving the memory of the Holocaust. The result has included extensive efforts to document their stories, including the Survivors of the <b>Shoah</b> project and Four Seasons Documentary, as well as institutions devoted to memorializing and studying the Holocaust, including Yad Vashem in Israel and the US Holocaust Museum. The historic tale of the Danish Jews fleeing to Sweden by fishing boat is recounted in an award-winning American children's novel.|$|E
25|$|Lantos {{described}} some of {{his experiences}} in the Academy Award-winning documentary film, The Last Days (1998), produced by Steven Spielberg's <b>Shoah</b> Foundation. In his floor speeches as a congressman, he sometimes referred to himself {{as one of the}} few living members of Congress who had fought against fascism. In 1981, Lantos sponsored a bill making Wallenberg an Honorary Citizen of the United States and became a member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. In January 2006, he traveled to Hungary and attended a ceremony commemorating the 61st anniversary of the liberation of the Budapest Ghetto. The event was held at the Great Synagogue in Budapest, , today the largest synagogue in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 World War II {{began and}} until 1941 Hitler {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} Europe, including Poland—where millions of Jews were living at that time—and France. In 1941, following {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, the Final Solution began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This genocide, in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty, is known as The Holocaust or <b>Shoah</b> (Hebrew term). In Poland, more than one million Jews were murdered in gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp alone.|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} various large and tragic events were to impact the region, {{which can be}} {{considered}} as the most horrific of places {{during the first half of}} the 20th century. Among these events, ranging from a few positive to news headlines to crimes against humanity, were: the pogroms, the co-opted 1905 Russian Revolution, founding of the Folkspartei, the First World War, the February Revolution followed by the October Bolshevik, the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Versailles Treaty, the Polish–Soviet War, the Weimar inflation, the U.S.A. Immigration Act of 1924, exile of Leon Trotsky by Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Gulag, the Great Depression, collectivization of the Ukraine, the Nazi regime, the Nuremberg racial laws, Stalin's Great Purge, Kristalnacht, the 1939 White Paper, the Nazi–Soviet Pact, the Second World War, the Soviet-Nazi War, and the <b>Shoah.</b> The catastrophe of the genocide claimed the life of the aged historian.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, {{with the}} rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany, the Jewish {{situation}} became more severe. Economic crises, racial anti-Semitic laws, and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to Palestine, to the United States and to the Soviet Union. In 1939 World War II began and until 1941 Hitler occupied almost all of Europe, including Poland—where millions of Jews were living at that time—and France. In 1941, following {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, the Final Solution began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This genocide, in which approximately six million Jews were methodically exterminated, is known as The Holocaust or <b>Shoah</b> (Hebrew term). In Poland, three million Jews were killed in gas chambers in all concentration camps combined, with one million at the Auschwitz concentration camp alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{proceedings}} of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but, {{a new generation of}} teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed {{in the name of the}} German people. In 1963, a German court ruled that a KGB assassin named Bohdan Stashynsky who had committed several murders in the Federal Republic in the late 1950s was not legally guilty of murder, but was only an accomplice to murder as the responsibility for Stashinsky's murders rested only with his superiors in Moscow who had given him his orders. The legal implications of the Stashinksy case, namely that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers can be held legally responsible for any murders committed and that anyone else who follows orders and commits murders were just accomplices to murder was to greatly hinder the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the coming decades, and ensured that even when convicted, that Nazi criminals received the far lighter sentences reserved for accomplices to murders than the harsher sentences given to murderers. The term executive decision-maker who could be found guilty of murder was reserved by the courts only for those at the highest levels of the Reich leadership during the Nazi period. The only way that a Nazi criminal could be convicted of murder was to show that they were not following orders at the time and had acted on their initiative when killing someone. One courageous attorney, Fritz Bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz death camp and about twenty were put trial in Frankfurt between 1963-1965 in what came to be known as the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials. The men on trial in Frankfurt were tried only for murders and other crimes that they committed on their own initiative at Auschwitz and were not tried for anything that they did at Auschwitz when following orders, which was considered by the courts to be the lesser crime of accomplice to murder. Because of this, Bauer could only indict for murder those who killed when not following orders, and those who had killed when following orders were indicted as accomplices to murder. Moreover because of the legal distinction between murderers and accomplices to murder, an SS man who killed thousands while operating the gas chambers at Auschwitz could only be found guilty of being accomplice to murder because he had been following orders, while an SS man who had beaten one inmate to death on his initiative could be convicted of murder because he had not been following orders. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the <b>Shoah</b> was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term 'Holocaust' for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when an American mini-series with that name was shown on German television.) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} criticized by filmmaker and {{lecturer}} Claude Lanzmann, {{director of the}} nine-hour Holocaust film <b>Shoah,</b> who called Schindler's List a [...] "kitschy melodrama" [...] and a [...] "deformation" [...] of historical truth. [...] "Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced {{that there is a}} ban on depiction [...] ", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust {{through the eyes of a}} German, saying [...] "it is the world in reverse." [...] He complained, [...] "I sincerely thought that there was a time before <b>Shoah,</b> and a time after <b>Shoah,</b> and that after <b>Shoah</b> certain things could no longer be done.

500|$|All the while, these {{uncertainties}} and the reparations {{from the}} Yom Kippur War polished the sheen on the <b>Shoah.</b> The collective memory resurfaced {{and looked to}} reconcile its history of difficulties, suffering and sacrifices. A new elite arose from the Sephardic Jews and the [...] "can-do" [...] of Menahem Begin. In this context, the [...] "myth" [...] of Latrun derived from the frustrations {{and the death of}} the new immigrants and was catalysed by their integration in a society where [...] "the survivor of <b>Shoah</b> carried the new collective memory, immigrant refugees who had troubled pasts, and then were confronted with hostility and threat and still took their place with their blood and taking part in the war".|$|E
500|$|This {{version was}} put into several poems by the celebrated provocative poet Gabi Daniel (pseudonym of Benjamin Harushovsky-Harshav) and {{entitled}} [...] "Peter the Great".

500|$|In the 1980s, a schism arose {{within the}} post-Zionism movement, {{and the history}} of the battle of Latrun came to {{represent}} the culpability of the Israeli state and a way of pointing out that it was born in the context of massacres and the exodus of the Palestinian population. It shouted [...] "hypocrisy", [...] "false truths", and [...] "the blood of the escapees of <b>Shoah</b> who came to find a new life and yet found death".|$|E
500|$|The work {{included}} {{sorting through}} the arrivals' property on the [...] Judenrampe at Auschwitz II, where trains carrying Jews arrived, and removing the dead from the trains. Some new arrivals {{were selected to}} work as slave labour, but most {{went straight to the}} gas chamber. Vrba worked there from 18 August 1942 until 7 June 1943. He told Claude Lanzmann, in interviews in 1978–1981 for the documentary film <b>Shoah</b> (1985), that he had seen around 200 trains arrive during those 10 months.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Nurnberg, Littell's {{literary}} agent, {{said that}} a possible one-line description of the novel would be: [...] "The intimate memoirs of an ex-Nazi mass murderer." [...] When asked why he wrote such a book, Littell invokes a photo he discovered in 1989 of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a female Soviet partisan hanged by the Nazis in 1941. He adds that a bit later, in 1992, he watched the movie <b>Shoah</b> by Claude Lanzmann, which left an impression on him, especially the discussion by Raul Hilberg about the bureaucratic aspect of genocide.|$|E
500|$|An {{extensive}} [...] "Author's Note" [...] {{details the}} fate of the people Syvia interacted with in the Ghetto, including how the survivors in her immediate family settled initially in Paris.

As of 2006, Sylvia, now widowed, had moved to Maryland, and volunteers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. [...] She gave a videotaped interview to the <b>Shoah</b> Foundation, which records the personal recollections of Holocaust survivors.|$|E
500|$|Influenced by the 1985 {{documentary}} film <b>Shoah,</b> Spielberg {{decided not to}} plan the film with storyboards, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days. Spielberg felt that this gave the film [...] "a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject." [...] He filmed without using Steadicams, elevated shots, or zoom lenses, [...] "everything that for me might be considered a safety net." [...] This matured Spielberg, who felt {{that in the past}} he had always been paying tribute to directors such as Cecil B. DeMille or David Lean.|$|E
