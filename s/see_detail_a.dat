Our “MobileEye ” software suite turns a camera enabled mobile device into a multi-purpose vision tool that helps individuals with visual disabilities. MobileEye consists of four subsystems for different types of visual disabilities. A color channel mapper helps distinguish colors, a software magnifier helps low vision individuals <b>see</b> <b>detail,</b> <b>a</b> pattern recognizer helps the severely impaired recognize objects and a document retriever provides access to printed materials. We apply cutting edge computer vision and image processing technologies on the mobile devices and tackle the challenges of limited computational resources and low image quality. We also consider the usability for the visually impaired so our system requires minimum keyboard operation. We provide a full software solution which runs on Symbian and Windows Mobile handsets. This paper provides a high level overview of the system. ...|$|E

50|$|This {{has led to}} {{the desire}} to view live {{biological}} cell interactions in a real time, natural environment, and the need for subwavelength imaging. Subwavelength imaging can be defined as optical microscopy with the ability to <b>see</b> <b>details</b> of <b>an</b> object or organism below the wavelength of visible light (see discussion in the above sections). In other words, to have the capability to observe, in real time, below 200 nanometers. Optical microscopy is a non-invasive technique and technology because everyday light is the transmission medium. Imaging below the optical limit in optical microscopy (subwavelength) can be engineered for the cellular level, and nanometer level in principle.|$|R

There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to <b>see</b> smaller <b>details.</b> <b>A</b> disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, X-ray optics, and high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} with standard route maps is accessing to multi-scale routing information. The user needs to display maps in both a large scale to <b>see</b> <b>details</b> and <b>a</b> small scale to see an overview, but this requires tedious interaction such as zooming in and out. We propose to use a hierarchical structure for a route map, called a “Route Tree”, to address this problem, and describe an algorithm to automatically construct such a structure. A Route Tree is a hierarchical grouping of all small route segments to allow quick access to meaningful large and small-scale views. We propose two Route Tree applications, “RouteZoom ” for interactive map browsing and “TreePrint” for route information printing, to show the applicability and usability of the structure. We conducted a preliminary user study on RouteZoom, and {{the results showed that}} RouteZoom significantly lowers the interaction cost for obtaining information from a map compared to a traditional interactive map...|$|R

This means only adults can purchase the album; additionally, it must not be displayed in stores where minors have access (<b>see</b> BPjM for <b>details).</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, the album was re-released in Germany on 16 November in an edited version without the censored track and picture. The band still played the instrumental version song live in Germany until it was ultimately banned from live performances.|$|R
