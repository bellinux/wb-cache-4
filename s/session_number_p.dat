30|$|In our {{previous}} work [9], {{we proposed a}} way of measuring the quality of an admission control mechanism based on the trade-off {{between the number of}} servers used and six important QoS metrics: number of overloaded servers, <b>session</b> throughput, <b>number</b> of aborted <b>sessions,</b> <b>number</b> of deferred <b>sessions,</b> <b>number</b> of rejected <b>sessions</b> and average response time for all admitted sessions. The goal is to minimize the values of these metrics, except for session throughput, that should be maximized. The results from the two approaches will be compared based on these criteria.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} method to improve genetic {{programming}} with multiple trees (GPCN). An individual in GPCN comprises multiple trees, and each tree has a <b>number</b> <b>P</b> that indicates the number of repetitive actions based on the tree. In previous work, a method for updating the <b>number</b> <b>P</b> has been proposed to obtain P suitable to the tree in evolution. However, in the method efficiency becomes worse as the range of P becomes wider. In order to solve the problem, in this study, two methods are proposed: inheriting the <b>number</b> <b>P</b> of a tree from an excellent individual and using mutation for preventing the <b>number</b> <b>P</b> from being into a local optimum. Additionally, {{a method to}} eliminate trees consisting of a single terminal node is proposed...|$|R
