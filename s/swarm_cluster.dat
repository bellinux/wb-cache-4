40|$|Extracting natural {{groups of}} the unlabeled data is known as clustering. To improve the {{stability}} and robustness of the clustering outputs, clustering ensembles have emerged recently.

40|$|Exploring {{a set of}} unlabeled data {{to extract}} the similar clusters, known as data clustering, is an {{appealing}} problem in machine learning. In other words, data clustering organizes the underlying data into different groups using a notion of similarity between patterns. A new approach to solve the data clustering problem based on multiple cooperative swarms is introduced. The proposed approach is inspired by the social swarming behavior of biological bird flocks which search for food situated in several places. The proposed approach is composed of two main phases, namely, initialization and exploitation. In the initialization phase, {{the aim is to}} distribute the search space among several swarms. That is, a part of the search space is assigned to each swarm in this phase. In the exploitation phase, each swarm searches for the center of its associated cluster while cooperating with other swarms. The search proceeds to converge to a near-optimal solution. As compared to the single <b>swarm</b> <b>clustering</b> approach, the proposed multiple cooperative swarms provide better solutions in terms of fitness function measure for the cluster centers, as the dimensionality of data and number of clusters increase. The multiple cooperative <b>swarms</b> <b>clustering</b> approach assumes that the number of clusters is known a priori. The notion of stability analysis is proposed to extract the number of clusters for the underlying data using multiple cooperative swarms. The mathematical explanations demonstrating why the proposed approach leads to more stable and robust results than those of the single <b>swarm</b> <b>clustering</b> are also provided. Application of the proposed multiple cooperative <b>swarms</b> <b>clustering</b> is considered {{for one of the most}} challenging problems in speech recognition: phoneme recognition. The proposed approach is used to decompose the recognition task into a number of subtasks or modules. Each module involves a set of similar phonemes known as a phoneme family. Basically, the goal is to obtain the best solution for phoneme families using the proposed multiple cooperative <b>swarms</b> <b>clustering.</b> The experiments using the standard TIMIT corpus indicate that using the proposed clustering approach boosts the accuracy of the modular approach for phoneme recognition considerably...|$|R

40|$|Swarming is an {{essential}} part of honeybee behaviour, wherein thousands of bees cling onto each other to form a dense cluster that may be exposed to the environment for several days. This cluster has the ability to maintain its core temperature actively without a central controller, and raises the question of how this is achieved. We suggest that the <b>swarm</b> <b>cluster</b> is akin to an active porous structure whose functional requirement is to adjust to outside conditions by varying its porosity to control its core temperature. Using a continuum model that takes the form of a set of advection-diffusion equations for heat transfer in a mobile porous medium, we show that the equalization of an effective "behavioural pressure", which propagates information about the ambient temperature through variations in density, leads to effective thermoregulation. Our model extends and generalizes previous models by focusing the question of mechanism on the form and role of the behavioural pressure, and allows us to explain the vertical asymmetry of the cluster (as a consequence of buoyancy driven flows), the ability of the cluster to overpack at low ambient temperatures without breaking up at high ambient temperatures, and the relative insensitivity to large variations in the ambient temperature. Finally, our theory makes testable hypotheses for how the cluster bee density should respond to externally imposed temperature inhomogeneities, and suggests strategies for biomimetic thermoregulation.

40|$|Many {{biological}} systems {{need to control}} transport of nutrients and ventilation. Unlike many nonliving porous media, they modify themselves to meet these demands; they are active. Using a combination of experiment, theory, and computation, we investigate several living porous media. First we consider termite mounds, meter-sized structures built by insects nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the mounds themselves. It is widely accepted {{that the purpose of}} these mounds is to give the colony a controlled microhabitat that buffers the organisms from strong environmental fluctuations while allowing them to exchange energy and matter with the outside world. However, previous work toward understanding their functions has led to conflicting models of ventilation mechanisms and little direct evidence to distinguish them. By directly measuring air flows inside mounds of the Indian termite Odontotermes obesus, we show that they use diurnal ambient temperature oscillations to drive cyclic flows inside the mound. These cyclic flows in the mound flush out CO 2 from the nest and ventilate the colony, in a novel example of deriving useful work from thermal oscillations. We also observe the same diurnally-driven flows in mounds of the African termite Macrotermes michaelseni, evidence that this is likely a general mechanism. We then consider the problem of honeybee swarming, wherein thousands of bees cling onto each other to form a dense cluster that may be exposed to the environment for several days. During this period, the cluster has the ability to maintain its core temperature actively without a central controller. We suggest that the <b>swarm</b> <b>cluster</b> is akin to an active porous structure whose functional requirement is to adjust to outside conditions by varying its porosity to control its core temperature. Using a continuum model that {{takes the form of a}} set of advection-diffusion equations for heat transfer in a mobile porous medium, we show that the equalization of an effective "behavioral pressure", which propagates information about the ambient temperature through variations in density, leads to effective thermoregulation. Our model extends and generalizes previous models by focusing the question of mechanism on the form and role of the behavioral pressure, and allows us to explain the vertical asymmetry of the cluster (as a consequence of buoyancy driven flows), the ability of the cluster to overpack at low ambient temperatures without breaking up at high ambient temperatures, and the relative insensitivity to large variations in the ambient temperature. Our theory also makes testable hypotheses for the response of the cluster to external temperature inhomogeneities, and suggests strategies for biomimetic thermoregulation. Finally, we consider a generic model of an active porous medium where the conductance of the medium is modified by the flow and in turn modifies the flow, so that the classical linear laws relating current and resistance are modified over time as the system itself evolves. This feedback coupling is quantified in terms of two parameters that characterize the way in which addition or removal of matter follows a simple local (or non-local) feedback rule corresponding to either flow-seeking or flow-avoiding behavior. Using numerical simulations and a continuum mean field theory, we show that flow-avoiding feedback causes an initially uniform system to become strongly heterogeneous via a tunneling (channel-building) phase separation; flow-seeking feedback leads to an immuring(wall-building) phase separation. Our results provide a qualitative explanation for the patterning of active conducting media in natural systems, while suggesting ways to realize complex architectures using simple rules in engineered systems. by Samuel Alan Ocko.

40|$|From the {{formation}} of animal flocks {{to the emergence of}} coordinate motion in bacterial swarms, at all scales populations of motile organisms display coherent collective motion. This consistent behavior strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. Guided by this universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely alignment rules at the individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations. However, more complex collective behaviors have been systematically found in experiments including {{the formation}} of vortices, fluctuating <b>swarms,</b> <b>clustering</b> and swirling. All these model systems predominantly rely on actual collisions to display collective motion. As a result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behavior of the populations therefore depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings. Here, we demonstrate a new phase of active matter. We reveal that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rollers self-organize to achieve coherent motion along a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either {{in the form of a}} single macroscopic flock at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations.

A unifying representation for ACC methods and Emergent Self-Organizing Maps is presented in this paper. ACC terms are related to corresponding mechanisms of the SOM.
