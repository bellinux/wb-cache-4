5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E
5|$|Charles's only {{recourse}} was {{to return}} to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, {{and placed in the}} custody of the army the following day. In Pride's Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively a military coup.|$|E

5|$|Leopold's {{decision}} to surrender was seized {{on by the}} British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilité de régner), and resolved to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly denounce the King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and in <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges Mandel to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society {{and supported by the}} church, led to a big loss of public support and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.|$|E
5|$|The Rhondda {{also has}} a strong history of {{communist}} <b>sympathy,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda Socialist Society being {{a key element in}} the coalition that founded the Communist Party of Great Britain. By 1936 there were seven Communists on the Rhondda Urban District Council and was publishing its own Communist newspaper The Vanguard. In the 1930s Maerdy became such a hotspot of Communist support it was known as Little Moscow producing left wing activists such as Merthyr born Arthur Horner and Marxist writer Lewis Jones. The Rhondda miners were also active in socialist activities outside the valleys. In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support of some of the largest hunger marches, while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the International Brigades than the total number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.|$|E
5|$|The next year, 1894, saw {{pay cuts}} and labor disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E

5|$|During the uprising, the Sejm {{realized}} {{the need for}} unified national insignia {{that could be used}} by the Polish military. On February 7, 1831 it adopted white and red, the tinctures (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued to regard the revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising.|$|E

25|$|Other unions, {{particularly}} in the building trades, began to strike in <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Teamsters.

25|$|Two years later, on November 21, 1948, {{speaking}} to the same group, he again lauded the Soviet Union, calling it a nation which has recognized the dignity of all people, a nation wherein discrimination against anybody on account of race is a crime, and which was in fundamental <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> progress of mankind.|$|E

25|$|Many Classical Chinese poems appear simple on the surface, but contain deeper, more {{profound}} ideas.

25|$|A craft unionist {{might argue}} the miners {{would have been}} better off {{sticking}} to their own business. After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed. But Haywood took away from this experience the conviction that labor needed more, not less, industrial unionism. The miners had struck in <b>sympathy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E
