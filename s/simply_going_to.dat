500|$|Titanic Ventures Inc., a Connecticut-based consortium, co-sponsored {{a survey}} and salvage {{operation}} in 1987 with the French oceanographic agency IFREMER. The expedition produced an outcry, {{not least because}} of the damage that it caused to the wreck. When the crow's nest bell was pulled from the mast, the crow's nest itself, where the lookouts first saw the iceberg, collapsed. A Titanic survivor, Eva Hart, was outspoken in her condemnation of what many saw as the looting of a mass grave: [...] "To bring up those things from a mass sea grave just {{to make a few}} thousand pounds shows a dreadful insensitivity and greed. The grave should be left alone. They're <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it as fortune hunters, vultures, pirates!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Initially, {{this was}} <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be {{an album of}} piano and voice", Wainwright stated in a May 2007 {{interview}} with The Independent Nick Duerden. That was, however, until he visited Berlin, which influenced the album's lush sound. Wainwright declared, [...] "Basically, a huge wave of German Romanticism descended on the recording process, and almost drowned me." [...] Wainwright cited two reasons for the change in direction and the heightened dramatic flare: the cancer diagnosis received by his mother (folk musician Kate McGarrigle) during the album's genesis, which he found [...] "fueled his creative intensity {{in some kind of}} displaced attempt to get her well", and the New York Metropolitan Opera's commissioning Wainwright to write an opera, making Release the Stars a way of training for such a large project. Revealing the overall theme in January 2007, Wainwright declared the album was about opening up and following impulses. [...] "Whether it's the environment, politics or religious warfare", Wainwright stated in an interview with The Japan Times, [...] "it's time {{to get out there and}} be a part of the solution, whatever that is." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 17 July 2008, Gore gave {{a speech}} at the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. in which he called for a move towards {{replacing}} a dependence upon [...] "carbon-based fuels" [...] with Green energy by the United States within the next ten years. Gore stated: [...] "When President John F. Kennedy challenged our nation to land {{a man on the moon}} and bring him back safely in 10 years, many people doubted we could accomplish that goal. But 8 years and 2 months later, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface of the moon." [...] Some criticized his plan. According to the BBC, [...] "Robby Diamond, president of a bipartisan think tank called Securing America's Future Energy, said weaning the nation off fossil fuels could not be done in a decade. 'The country is not going to be able to go cold turkey [...] We have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be made obsolete.' [...] " ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, but I must," [...] said Lucy in her sharp, decided tone. [...] "I must go. I {{was bound}} to wait till I heard from Mr. Greystock, because it is my first duty to obey him. But of course I cannot stay here after what has passed. As Nina says, it is <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> prison when Lord Fawn comes here." ...|$|E
60|$|To an onlooker it {{certainly}} didn't seem so simple. I never knew the meanness, the trickery, of the mining business, the sheer obstinate {{determination of the}} bigger capitalists not to make money when they might, till I heard the accounts of Jeff's different mines. Take the case of Corona Jewel. There was a good mine, <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ruin for lack of common sense.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "I {{have nothing}} to ask you for this time. Instead, I am <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> mention certain facts, and leave you {{to act on the}} {{information}} in the only way open to you; that is, to get out of Vancouver as soon as possible. I am giving you the opportunity in order to save Miss Merril the pain of seeing you prosecuted. You are in our hands now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Clarence, I am <b>simply</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{let you go}} in. You {{are sick}} enough as it is, {{and if you are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let that awful old man spend the whole evening here, and drain the life out of you! I will see him, and tell him"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Then with an {{instinct}} {{to improve the}} situation, he added quickly [...] "I don't {{want to go to}} bed to-night, either. I'm <b>simply</b> tired of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed, every night." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{seemed to}} be an unnatural stillness everywhere, amid which the {{crunching}} of the dry snow sounded with a distinctness that almost frightened the boy, who was <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> his uncle Robert's to spend a day or two. But finally Dan was on the main road, where the snow was frozen so hard that his footsteps could not be heard as distinctly, and where the two tracks worn smooth by the runners of the sleighs lay spread out before him, looking like two satin ribbons on white broadcloth.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm glad I {{left the}} cake with her," [...] she said resolutely. [...] "Poor little thing! It means {{so much to}} her. It meant only 'a good feed,' as Josie says, to me. I'm <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it my {{business}} next term to be good friends with the other Ida Mitchell. I'm afraid we third-year girls are very self-centred and selfish. And I know what I'll do! I'll write to Abby Morton in Trenton to send me Mrs. Henderson's address, and I'll write her a letter and ask her not to let Ida know she didn't send the cake." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{he had not}} {{repeated}} {{to himself}} {{so many times that}} he was not running away from home, but <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> uncle Robert's, to save poor ~ Crippy's life, Dan would have felt that he was doing something wrong because of the warning cries uttered by everything around. The stable door, when he tried to close it softly, shut with a spiteful clatter, and even the snow gave forth a sharp, crunching sound, such as he had never heard before. But he must keep on, for to remain would be to see the plump, brown body of poor Crippy on the Thanksgiving dinner-table, while to go on would be, at the worst, but a few hours' discomfort, with Crip's life as the reward.|$|E

40|$|All {{agree that}} in {{hindsight}} the rapid adoption of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) using cleavage stage biopsy and fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) in routine clinical practice without proper evaluation of (cost-) effectiveness basically resulted in couples paying more money for a less effective treatment. Now, almost 20 years later, we {{are on the verge of}} a new era of PGS. But have things really changed or are we <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> the future...|$|R

6000|$|White Buffalo had by {{this time}} joined those of his tribe who were with him. His speech to his {{followers}} was as peculiar in its effects as had been the mysterious incantations of the magicians upon himself. Two voted to follow Pontiac, while the others {{said they would not}} do so under any circumstances. [...] "The squaws can return to the trading-post," [...] said the chief. And thus were the others dismissed. A short while after this all were on the trail of Pontiac, who, contrary to expectations, had taken with him a young brave known by the extraordinary name of Foot-in-His-Mouth, a Wyandot famous for his accuracy at shooting. Foot-in-His-Mouth had often won prizes at target shooting, both among the Indians and the French, and he was called one of the best hunters in the Ohio valley. Both Pontiac and his escort were on horseback, and they rode so swiftly along the forest trail that the others had all they could do to keep close to them. White Buffalo led, and never once did he allow those he was following to suspect his presence. Whenever they slowed up so did he, and instead of passing over an open space he invariably rode around it, keeping his steed in the shelter of the trees and brushwood. [...] "If he is <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> his home on the Detroit River, we'll have our ride for nothing," [...] observed Dave, after six or eight miles had been covered.|$|E
5000|$|You {{are sending}} another {{powerful}} message to Number 10 {{and to the}} White House {{that we are not}} <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow the atrocities of September 11 to be replaced with further atrocities in Afghanistan.|$|E
5000|$|TIMEs James Poniewozik {{called it}} [...] "another tense and {{gripping}} episode", and praised {{the interplay between}} Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin. Poniewozik described the closing scene as [...] "a genuine, out-of-left-field stunner, and a sign that Homeland is not <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> conservatively husband its story to keep it spinning out as long as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, you must. Why, {{suppose it}} is yours! It may mean a fortune. The stalls were <b>simply</b> packed. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ring up the theatre now and engage a seat for you, and pay for it myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{certainly}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen," [...] the girl said, with {{an acceptance of}} the plural which deepened the intimacy of the situation, and which was not displeasing to Verrian when she added, [...] "If our friend's vehicle holds out." [...] Then she turned her face full upon him, with what affected him as austere resolution, in continuing, [...] "But I can't let you suppose that you're conveying a society person, or something of that sort, to Mrs. Westangle's." [...] His own face expressed his mystification, and she concluded, [...] "I'm <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> there <b>to</b> begin my work." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dave Bauer {{stated that}} there is a [...] "depressingly small library of {{software}} available for the Leapster... but some more varied software would make it much more interesting for (my son)... no platform that has ever been successful without third-party software.... Besides that, a strong hobbyist platform would be amazing." [...] Ian Bogost stated [...] "the potential for improved educational game design is <b>simply</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come from inside the LeapFrog corporation." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Kitabatake Chikafusas 14th-century account, Mototsune {{resolved}} {{the problem of}} succession by <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> visit Tokiyatsu-shinnō, where the kampaku addressed the prince as a sovereign and assigned imperial guards. The prince signaled his acceptance by going into the imperial palaquin, which then conducted him to the emperors residence within the palace. Curiously, he was still wearing the robes of a prince {{when he decided to}} take this ride into an entirely unanticipated future.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 November 2001, Marsden {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of the Stop the War {{demonstration}} against the war in Afghanistan in London. Marsden {{was one of the}} principal speakers along with Tony Benn and George Galloway in Trafalgar Square with 100,000 protesters. He accused Blair of being [...] "drunk with power" [...] and [...] "we are not <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow the atrocities of September 11 to be replaced with further atrocities in Afghanistan".|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} programming, direct {{style is}} the usual style of sequential programming, in which control is passed implicitly by <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the next line, by subroutine calls, or by constructs such as , , or [...] It is contrasted with continuation-passing style, in which control is passed explicitly {{in the form of}} a continuation. Direct style programming is widely viewed as easier to write and understand than continuation-passing style, and thus a number of programming language constructs exist to eliminate or minimize the need to explicitly use continuations.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{characters}} that player can choose from, {{each of them}} having four distinct stages {{to his or her}} weapon. The player can switch characters at any point during game play <b>simply</b> by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the character select screen and choosing a different character. While this is a powerful asset, once a character dies, he or she cannot ever be revived. This effectively limits the total [...] "lives" [...] of the player to four - once the last character is dead, the game is over.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim was <b>simply</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work as a fighter. On several {{occasions}} the CH stations directed the fighters to a successful radar capture, {{only to have the}} target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|R
50|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that many of the prospectors who chose the Chilkoot <b>simply</b> were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> survive the arduous terrain and harsh weather, Canada's North-West Mounted Police (now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) declared that prospectors could only enter Canada if they had at least one ton of gear (enough to supply a prospector for one year.

50|$|Many {{innovative}} short {{films were}} shown in between segments. These {{could be anything}} from animation (a face forming out of vegetable), art (a woman carving a puppet out of an apple) or children's testimonials. Many of these shorts depicted real-life activities that viewing children could either relate to (kids playing) or learn from if they happened {{to be from the}} opposite end of the spectrum (city life v. country life). Many also aimed to teach about daily happenings, from going to the dentist, getting x-rays, starting school, playing with friends (or alone), cleaning your bike, or <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996 the Lahore High Court {{ruled that}} an adult Muslim woman {{could not get}} married {{without the consent of}} her male {{guardian}} (wali). Women, who chose their husbands independently, could be forced to annul their marriages and the repercussions were highlighted by Jahangir, who also took on such cases (i.e. the case of Saima Waheed); [...] "Hundreds have already been arrested. This is <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> open up the floodgates for the harassment of women and girls by their families and the authorities. The courts have sanctioned their oppression.

He also praises his students who chose to do research, as there is no mandatory research component for the chemistry major at Connecticut College, who have gone on to successful careers.

5000|$|Overall, Gradius V {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} magazines and websites and amassed a Metacritic rating index of 82, based on 46 reviews. Positive response tends {{to focus on}} the intricate level design, graphical excellence, and [...] "old school" [...] appeal of the shoot 'em up genre. Most negative criticism highlights the difficulty of the game, as well as what is deemed an over-reliance on established genre conventions.

40|$|Imagine you {{had promised}} your friend or partner {{that you would}} go with them to watch a movie each week for a full year. Imagine then, having made this commitment, that your friend or partner did not consult with you about which movies to watch – they simply {{selected}} the movie each week, irrespective of your own preferences or tastes, and expected you to come along. You might {{put up with it}} for awhile. You would likely develop resentment about the situation. Eventually, as an adult, you might confront your friend and explain your feelings and try to change things. If they didn’t change, in all likelihood, you would <b>simply</b> stop <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the movies with them. For children and young people in schools, the school curriculum is like being forced to go to the movies, to see things they often don’t like or can’t see the point of, but where {{they do not have the}} adult prerogative, legally at least, of <b>simply</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school. Trapped in schools with an unresponsive curriculum, feelings amongst young people towards school can and frequently do include resentment, apathy and disengagement. Every teacher commonly experiences these feelings amongst their children, and not just amongst the children who are the lowest academic achievers. We should not underestimate the power of an unexplained and unresponsive curriculum as a factor in child and youth disengagement from school. Nor should it be underestimated as an explanation for any perceived decline in international education standards among western nations where, in most facets of life, young people influence and exercise considerable choice in most other areas of their lives expect in school. • Steve Wilson is an emeritus professor at Western Sydney University, and an adjunct professor in the university’s School of Education...|$|R
