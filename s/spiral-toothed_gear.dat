50|$|During the First World War the Steiger firm {{repaired}} aeroplanes and aeroplane engines. In 1917 {{the owner}} and his engineer, Paul Henze, began to work on motorized vehicles. Plans for the manufacture of tractors were abandoned in favour {{of the development of}} automobiles. Their first model, the Steiger 10/50 PS, was produced in 1920. This touring model with a 2.6 litre four cylinder engine (50 hp / 37 kW) became Steiger’s most significant product, and was still in production when the firm collapsed in 1926. Its modern OHC engine was distinctive because of an overhead camshaft driven by <b>spiral-toothed</b> bevel <b>gear</b> wheels. These cars, with ‘u’ shaped pressed steel frames, two axles with leaf spring suspension and a pointed radiator, were considered to be the most significant technical innovation of the early 1920s and the most progressive German serially-produced cars of their time.|$|R
