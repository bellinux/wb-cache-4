5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a <b>scooter,</b> but unlike a <b>scooter</b> the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a <b>scooter,</b> were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel <b>scooter.</b>|$|E

40|$|In Taiwan, the {{government}} considers the zero-emission <b>scooters</b> to be a sustainable form of transport like walking, cycling and public transport, which {{play a vital}} role to support sustainable urban mobility. Therefore, the development of zero-emission <b>scooters</b> is an important strategy in constructing the sustainable transport network of Taiwan. It is also {{the government}}'s priorities about the policy of emission-reduction and energy-conservation in the transportation sector. Recently, Taiwan launched a new program for subsidy of purchasing zero-emission <b>scooters,</b> which aimed to shift the petroleum-powered <b>scooters</b> to the electric <b>scooters.</b> The present paper is providing an update review of the promotional programs in developing zero-emission <b>scooters</b> in Taiwan. It introduces the status of the establishment and progress of policy, standards, subsidies to users and manufacturers, practice infrastructure, and technology development. Moreover, the contribution of replacing petrol <b>scooters</b> by zero-emission <b>scooters</b> such as battery-powered electric <b>scooters</b> and fuel cell <b>scooters</b> to reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and improvement in energy efficiency is evaluated.

5|$|The <b>Scooter</b> {{is another}} storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot.

The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter.

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch <b>scooter</b> wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a <b>scooter,</b> car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

25|$|Moto Guzzi {{was limited}} in its endeavors to {{penetrate}} the important <b>scooter</b> market as motorcycle popularity waned after WWII. Italian <b>scooter</b> competitors would not tolerate an incursion from Moto Guzzi. By innovating the first large-wheeled <b>scooter,</b> Guzzi competed less directly with manufacturers of small-wheeled scooters such as Piaggio (Vespa) and Lambretta. To illustrate the delicate balance within the Italian post-war motorcycle and <b>scooter</b> markets, when Guzzi developed their own prototype for a small-wheeled <b>scooter,</b> Lambretta retaliated with a prototype for a small V-twin motorcycle threatening to directly compete on Moto Guzzi's turf. The two companies compromised: Guzzi never produced their small-wheeled <b>scooter</b> and Lambretta never manufactured the motorcycle.
