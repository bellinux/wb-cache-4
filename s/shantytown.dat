5|$|The plan {{to set up}} a <b>shantytown</b> in Washington, D.C., {{was carried}} out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King's plan was subdued {{in the wake of his}} death, and the SCLC {{received}} an unprecedented wave of donations for the purpose of carrying it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating <b>shantytown</b> slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, efforts {{began to}} turn a city dump into a landmark. The project was to {{construct}} a municipal stadium (now called Modern Woodmen Park). The project was financed by bonds, and cost more than $150,000. Special features included reserved seats, box seats, and night lighting. The stadium was home to the Saint Ambrose University football games, and boxing matches. Today the stadium {{is home to the}} Quad Cities River Bandits baseball team. By 1932, thousands of Davenporters were on public relief due to the Great Depression. A <b>shantytown</b> grew in the west end of the city along the Mississippi River. Sickness, hunger, and unsanitary living conditions plagued the area. Through county and municipal government, the federal Civil Works Administration gave employment to thousands of men. They worked to extend the seawall along the riverfront. More than 200 jobs were created by the construction of Lock and Dam 15 project, in 1932. Hundreds of state employees worked on completing the Kimberly Road Outerbelt Bypass in 1936.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The goal of <b>shantytowns</b> {{redevelopment}} is {{to improve}} urban appearances and inhabitant's environments and enhance urban images and inhabitant's qualities of life. So far, numerous cities in China set about to reconstructing the project of <b>shantytowns.</b> However, the majority of <b>shantytowns</b> redevelopments have focused on dismantling houses rather than systematically rebuilding the <b>shantytowns.</b> Aiming at this issue, we explored the relations of <b>shantytowns</b> redevelopment and urban regeneration and drew on {{quite a lot of}} domestic and foreign experiences and lessons of slum redevelopment, which suggested that <b>shantytowns</b> redevelopment is involved in not only the pure physical regeneration, but also social regeneration, associated with economic recovery, community rebuilding and cultural reconstructions. By analyzing the case of <b>shantytowns</b> redevelopment of Fuxin city in Liaoning Province, we found a large quantity of questions exhibited by the current <b>shantytowns</b> redevelopment. Urban Regeneration and Slum Redevelopment City is an organic whole, which is included in human, natural environment and economic activities. It is tied with all the things obeyed social rules [1]. Aiming at urban problems in different history period...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] article explores three utopian visions which have shaped past and present experiences within Buenos Aires shantytowns: those of upgraded <b>shantytowns,</b> of universal housing, and of a city where <b>shantytowns</b> have been eliminated. The article argues that these visions are collective conceptions that entail a socio-political critique which is translated into space and which points to an ideal future. The visions proposed emerge from the examination of historical evidence and are a key conceptual tool for understanding previous and current discussions of <b>shantytowns</b> in Latin America...|$|R

Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967–1968, he organized a Poor People's Campaign to occupy the National Mall with a <b>shantytown.</b>|$|E

For safety during the stagecoach drop stunt, Canutt devised modified yokes and tongues, to give extra handholds and extra room between the teams. Ford told him that whenever Ford made an action picture and Canutt wasn't working elsewhere, he was on Ford's payroll. Also in 1939, Canutt doubled Clark Gable in the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind; he also appeared as a renegade accosting Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) as she crosses a bridge in a carriage driving through a <b>shantytown.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mokattam {{village is}} {{situated}} {{at the foot of}} the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. More recently, in 2008, another rock slide from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another <b>shantytown</b> in the Mokattam district. These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen. Some attribute these frequent rock slides to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.|$|E

40|$|Data for two {{different}} types of low–income bousing (sub–systems) are presented for Mexico City and are compared to highlight the differences between <b>shantytowns</b> (ciudades perdidas) and squatter settlements (colonias paracaidistas). <b>Shantytowns</b> are largely rental and are distributed in the inner–city and intermediate ring. They show little evidence or potential for physical improvement. Squatter settlements are invariably peripheral and, once ocupance is assured, they are upgraded through government intervention and auto–construction {{on the part of the}} squatters. Planning policies must recognise the differences between the two sub–systems so that the treatment of each reflects their respective attributes and potential for improvement...|$|R

500|$|The broad {{circulation}} of Gordon produced a persistent southerly flow across Hispaniola, causing orographic lift in mountainous regions. This caused {{a prolonged period}} of heavy rainfall, reaching [...] in Les Cayes in a 24‑hour period, and over [...] in the same duration in the capital city, Port-au-Prince. In Jacmel, Gordon dropped [...] in about 12 hours. The rains resulted in flooding and landslides across the country. There was knee-deep flooding in the <b>shantytown</b> of Cité Soleil, and in Jacmel, the rains increased levels along three rivers. There, the storm washed out the road connecting with Port-au-Prince, and three bridges were destroyed. In Jacmel, 725houses were destroyed, forcing 1,500people to stay at shelters. Gordon left portions of southeastern Haiti without water access. About 10,800houses were damaged to some degree, and an additional 3,500homes were destroyed. About 1.5million people were directly affected in the country, mostly near Port-au-Prince and in the southern portion, and more than 89,000people were left homeless. In Port-au-Prince, about 20,000homes were flooded, and the bridge connecting the city with northern Haiti was also flooded. Overall damage in the country was estimated at $50million.|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the essay, Gibson briefly covers two {{applications}} of the death penalty by the Singaporean justice system; he excerpts a report from The Straits Times about , a Malay man sentenced to death for attempting to smuggle a kilogram of cannabis into the city-state, and follows this with a description of the case of Johannes van Damme, a Dutch engineer found with significant quantities of heroin with the same consequence. He expresses reservations about the justice of capital punishment and describes the Singaporeans as the true bearers of zero tolerance. After hearing the announcement of van Damme's sentencing, Gibson decides to leave, checks out [...] "in record time" [...] from the hotel, and catches a cab to the airport. The trip is conspicuous for the absence of police along the road, but there is an abundance of them at the Changi Airtropolis, where Gibson photographs a discarded piece of crumpled paper, incurring their ire. Flying into Hong Kong he briefly glimpses the soon-to-be-destroyed <b>shantytown</b> Kowloon Walled City {{at the end of one}} of the runways at the chaotic Kai Tak Airport, and muses about the contrast with the staid and sanitized city-state he has left behind. The essay ends with the declaration [...] "I loosened my tie, clearing Singapore airspace." ...|$|E
500|$|The rooftop chase across favelas {{was filmed}} in Puerto Rico, where the {{production}} could {{have more control}} over the area. The main and second filming units began filming in and around the capital, San Juan. The island's mixture of tropical greenery and wide streets allowed the production to re-create the densely populated favelas of Rio while completing the larger action and external scenes without incident. Production designer Peter Wenham had the task of transforming Puerto Rico and Atlanta into the previously scouted Rio locations in four weeks, as the production deemed Rio unsuitable for filming many of the larger scenes. Wenham had to reinforce buildings to support the heavy camera equipment, and to alter the colors of more than 30 buildings in the city to make them suitable for filming. His team needed to alter the buildings and strew debris to make the area look disheveled and appear as a Rio <b>shantytown.</b> Wenham remarked that, though the development was difficult, in part due to the heat, it was [...] "a walk in the park" [...] compared with filming in the Rio favelas themselves. Wenham aimed to maintain a monochromatic color scheme for the film, with muted blacks and grays, including his choice of colors for the cars used. He only chose to add a multitude of colors in the favela set. The Teodoro Moscosco bridge connecting San Juan to neighboring Isla Verde was used to film the final showdown between Dom and Reyes, while a U.S. Navy base pier 60 miles outside San Juan stood in for the bridge for scenes involving the vault smashing cars. Action scenes were also filmed in the Hato Rey and Río Piedras districts of San Juan.|$|E
