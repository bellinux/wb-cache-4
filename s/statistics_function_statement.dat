40|$|The {{simulation}} model described below {{is based on}} the assumption that the periphyton community can be treated as a unit, without a quantitative concern for the dynamics of its many constituent populations. The <b>function</b> <b>statements</b> and parameter estimates incorporated into the model are based on experimental work with laboratory streams and some observational data from Berry Creek Experimental Stream. The approach used here to model the dynamics of periphyton communities in streams is essentially the same approach employed by Jay W. Forrester to model industrial and urban systems. A particular system is identified by establishing a boundary within which the system interactions take place. Level (state) variables and rate (flow) variables are linked together by a complex system of feedback loops and various intermediate concepts (modules), and these components represent the basic structural elements within the boundary. <b>Function</b> <b>statements</b> that represent relation between structural components of the system are written and programmed in some suitable simulation language (for example, MIMIC or DYNAMO).

50|$|The usual {{alternative}} is to use named functions and named recursion. Given an anonymous function, {{this can be done}} either by binding a name to the function, as in named function expressions in JavaScript, or by assigning the function to a variable and then calling the variable, as in <b>function</b> <b>statements</b> in JavaScript. Since languages that allow anonymous functions generally allow assigning these functions to variables (if not first-class functions), many languages do not provide a way to refer to the function itself, and explicitly reject anonymous recursion; examples include Go.|$|R
