Two types of vertically <b>lapped</b> nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated for suitability as materials for hip-protective pads. The force attenuation capacity of pads made from these fabrics was studied using drop impact tests, and performance relevant to thermophysiological wear comfort measured using a sweating guarded hot plate. The results indicate that vertically <b>lapped</b> nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> are suitable materials for soft hip-protective pads. They provide effective protection for the hip bone, and have similar force attenuation capacity to closed-cell foam.

To evaluate outcomes and cost-effectiveness of double compared to <b>single</b> <b>cord</b> blood transplantation, we analyzed 134 transplants in adults with acute leukemia in first remission. Transplants were performed in France with reduced intensity or myeloablative conditioning regimens. Costs were estimated from donor search to 1 year after transplantation. A Markov decision analysis model was used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness ratio within 4 years. The overall survival at 2 years after <b>single</b> and double <b>cord</b> blood transplants was 42 % versus 62 %, respectively (P= 0. 03), while the leukemia-free-survival was 33 % versus 53 %, respectively (P= 0. 03). The relapse rate was 21 % after double transplants and 42 % after a single transplant (P= 0. 006). No difference was observed for non-relapse mortality or chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The estimated costs up to 1 year after reduced intensity conditioning for <b>single</b> and double <b>cord</b> blood transplantation were € 165, 253 and € 191, 827, respectively. The corresponding costs after myeloablative conditioning were € 192, 566 and € 213, 050, respectively.

40|$|Acoustical {{insulation}} and absorption properties of nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically <b>lapped</b> <b>fabrics</b> are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure acoustical insulation in this research. This paper provides a description of the measurement devices and acoustical measurement data for vertically <b>lapped</b> nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> made from three different polyester fiber shape and two denier levels...|$|R

Methods: Twelve subjects with DC were enrolled, each with ≥ 3 contractures caused by palpable cords.

40|$|More than 40, 000 {{unrelated}} {{cord blood}} transplantations (UCBT) {{have been performed}} worldwide as treatment for patients with malignant or non-malignant life threatening hematologic disorders. However, low absolute numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within a <b>single</b> <b>cord</b> blood unit has remained a limiting factor for this transplantation modality, particularly in adult recipients. Further, because UCB contains low numbers of mostly naïve T cells, immune recovery after UCBT is slow predisposing patients to severe infections. Other causes of UCBT failure has included graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and relapse of the underlying disease. In this article, we first review the current landscape of cord blood engineering aimed at improving engraftment. This includes approaches of UCB-HSPCs expansion and methods aimed at improving UCB-HSCPs homing. We then discuss recent approaches of cord blood engineering developed to prevent infection (generation of multivirus-specific cytotoxic T cells (VSTs) from UCB), relapse (transduction of UCB-T cells with tumor-specific chimeric receptor antigens (CARs)) and GVHD (expansion of regulatory T cells from UCB).

We identified unrelated recipients that were dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) - 88 (class I) and DLA-DRB 1 (class II) allele-matched with cryopreserved units. Each unit contained ≤ 1. 7 × 107 TNC/kg.

Radioactive globin chains [alpha,beta,G gamma, and A gamma (Ala- 136) ] were analyzed by either isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels and fluorography or carboxymethylcellulose chromatography.

Morever, the G gamma-to-A gamma ratios demonstrated in single bursts appeared to be directly correlated with the respective gamma-to-beta ratios. These data suggest that both the gamma leads to beta and the G gamma leads to A gamma switches are mediated via mechanisms modulating the relative activities of the different genes in the non-alpha globin gene cluster rather than via selection of clones committed to the preferential synthesis of beta and A gamma globins.

As in mature cells, degranulation can be stimulated by intracellular application of guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (GTP) gamma S after 10 days in culture, simultaneously {{with the first}} morphological appearance of granules. These results demonstrate that the fusion machineries for exocytotic fusion are present and functional {{as soon as the}} granules are formed, presumably at the myeloblast stage. In the third week, the total amount of granules exocytosed upon stimulation is similar to that in mature eosinophils from peripheral blood. The capacitance step size distributions in promyelocytes and myelocytes confirm that mature large specific granules are formed by homotypic fusion of unit granules with similar size. Homotypic fusion is facilitated during early stages of differentiation associated with granulogenesis. Between day 10 and day 35 in culture the plasma membrane area of resting cells decreases from approximately 700 microns 2 to approximately 400 microns 2, approaching the value of mature cells from peripheral blood.
