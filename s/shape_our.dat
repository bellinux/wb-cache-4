5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on {{the contents of the}} human mind (see noema) and how processes <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{difficulties}} assigning appropriate sex {{for most}} infants with CAH. Genetic males have normal male genitalia and gonads and simply need hormone replacement. Most virilized females are assigned and raised as girls {{even if their}} genitalia are ambiguous or look more male than female.

500|$|Subsequently, {{several of}} Rihanna's songs and music videos have courted {{controversy}} for their violent themes, which Hobson attributes to the leaking of a photo showing the singers [...] "battered face" [...] {{on the evening}} of the assault by TMZ which circulated the internet without the permission of Rihanna. Hobson writes: [...] "Because of this, Rihanna has had to wrest back control of the 'victim' image foisted on her, and she in turn has challenged us rhetorically and visually to question and examine the power, danger, and violences that <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> relationships." [...] She continued to highlight the music videos for [...] "Russian Roulette", [...] "Hard", [...] "We Found Love", [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] with Eminem which documents domestic violence, and [...] "S", which contains references to bondage and fetishism and is, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics, as examples.

It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

2500|$|Intersectionality is the {{examination}} of various ways {{in which people are}} oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality [...] "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the core}} of Unger's {{philosophy}} are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity {{of the world and}} the reality of time. The premise behind the infinity of the individual is that we exist within social contexts but we are more than the roles that these contexts may define for us—we can overcome them. In Unger's terms, we are both [...] "context-bound and context-transcending; [...] "we appear as [...] "the embodied spirit;" [...] as [...] "the infinite imprisoned within the finite." [...] For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> beings and our interactions, we can change both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us.|$|E
