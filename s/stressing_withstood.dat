40|$|Moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia L.), {{a drought}} {{resistant}} legume, possesses high nutritional value. Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential {{and the most}} toxic heavy metal in plants. The {{present study was to}} test the hypothesis of whether moth bean being a drought resistant legume can <b>withstand</b> the cadmium <b>stress.</b> Ten-day-old moth bean seedlings were subjected to cadmium stress and investigated for a period of 15 days every 3 -day intervals. Cadmium quantification in moth bean tissues suggests root accumulation and translocation to aerial parts in a concentration dependent manner. Results of physiological and biochemical studies revealed that cadmium has affected the growth parameters like shoot and root lengths and tissue dry weights. Significant alternations in relative water content and cell membrane stability were observed in stressed seedlings. Similarly superoxide radical, lipoxygenase activity, membrane lipid peroxidation products, protein carbonyls, and reduced glutathione and nonprotein thiols were found increased in stressed seedlings compared to controls. However, hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic acid levels were not altered significantly in both stressed and control seedlings. Cadmium translocation ability from roots to aerial parts and elevated levels of nonenzymatic antioxidants in stressed seedlings suggest the cadmium <b>stress</b> <b>withstanding</b> ability of moth bean...|$|R
40|$|Due to its simple {{construction}} and excellent mechanical/thermal <b>stress</b> <b>withstanding</b> capability, induction motor with solid-rotor structure {{is widely used}} in many high-speed, high pressure application fields. In this paper, a novel solid-rotor induction motor with skewed slits in both radial and axial directions is presented. The performance of the proposed solid rotor is simulated using time stepping finite element method (FEM). Because {{of the existence of}} the axial slits, the magnetic flux in the slit-rotor motor can penetrate, relative to those without slits, deeper into the rotor. Analysis shows that its torque is about 3. 46 times of that of the motor with no rotor slits. By skewing the rotor slits in the radial direction in the novel motor being proposed, the torque is further increased by about 37. 7 % when compared with that of the motor with its rotor slits not skewed along the radial direction. Although more torque ripples are generated in rotors with skewed slits in the radial direction, it is shown that the torque ripples can be easily reduced by skewing of the slits along the axial direction.

40|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and the stiffest tissue in the human body. The enamel {{undergoes}} multidirectional <b>stresses,</b> <b>withstands</b> multimillion chewing cycles, all while protecting the internal dentin and pulp from damage due to mechanical overload and exposure to the harsh chemical environment of the mouth. Raman spectroscopy allows to study enamel mineral content in a non-destructive and site-specific way. While Raman spectroscopy has been applied in other studies to assess tooth mineralization, there are no studies that {{examine the relationship between}} micro-hardness and mineral content of the untreated enamel. An understanding of this relationship is extremely important in a clinical context. The effect of various agents on enamel hardness was investigated, though the relationship between healthy enamel mineral content and micro-hardness remains obscure. Twenty human incisor teeth were obtained in compliance with the NIH guidelines and imaged site-specifically with a Raman microscope and evaluated with a Brinell hardness measurement device. The front portion of each tooth was divided into apical, medium and cervical regions and subsequently imaged with a Raman microscope in these three locations. The results demonstrated that enamel mineral content varies significantly between individuals and is correlated with the hardness of the enamel. Non-invasive, sample preparation free Raman spectroscopy was successfully employed to measure the mineral content of healthy enamel and it correlated the mineralization score to the hardness measurements of the selected cervical location. The overall level of enamel mineral content may serve as a robust predictor of patients? susceptibility to developing caries, and overall enamels wear resistance, thus allowing for the prevention of caries via clinically available methods of remineralization, fluoride treatment and frequent cleaning...|$|R
50|$|Adobe {{walls are}} load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the {{foundation}} {{rather than by}} another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300 lbf/in2 (2.07 newton/mm2) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed {{so as to avoid}} lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile <b>stresses.</b> To <b>withstand</b> such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50 lbf/in2 (0.345 newton/mm2) for the finished block.|$|R
