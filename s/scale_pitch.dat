Here we characterize {{the structure of}} the ground state of the twist-bend phase of the bent dimer CB 7 CB and its mixtures with 5 CB over a wide range of concentrations and temperatures, showing that the contour length along the molecular direction for a single turn of the helix is approximately equal to 2 πRmol, where Rmol is the radius of bend curvature of a single all-trans CB 7 CB molecule. This relation emerges from a model which simply relates the macroscopic characteristics of the helical structure, which is mostly biaxial twist and has little bend, to the bent molecular shape. This connection comes about through the presence in the fluid of self-assembled oligomer-like correlations of interlocking molecules, arising from the nanosegregation of rigid and flexible molecular subcomponents, forming a brickwork tiling of pairs of molecular strands into a duplex double-helical chain.

Materials and MethodsWe compared the vocal aspects (GRBASI <b>scale,</b> <b>pitch,</b> loudness, CPF and resonance) and videolaryngoscopic from 567 individuals who participated in the National Pro-Voice Campaign 2005 in a tertiary university hospital. Resultsthe most frequent laryngeal alteration was laryngo-pharyngeal reflux (LFR) (43. 5 %), followed by benign lesions (17 %) and suspected malignant lesions (1 %). The sensitivity of the auditory voice-perception assessment was of 91 % for patients with benign lesions and 100 % in those with suspected malignant lesions; however, it was only 76 % in LFR. Of those tests considered normal, there were vocal alterations in 52 %. The positive predictive value was of 71 % and the negative was 61 %.

Curs: 2015 / 2016 Individual {{differences}} in music perception skills and {{in levels of}} pleasure induced by music can be easily found in general population. The present study aims at examining whether music perception skills can influence the ability to experience positive emotional responses (i. e., pleasure) to music. We also explored whether these differences are related to {{differences in}} gray matter volume in auditory and reward areas. A sample of 125 participants completed the Spanish version of Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ) and two online auditory, music perception tests; Jake Mandell Tone Deaf Test (JMTDT) of pitch discrimination and a simplified version of Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) which {{is divided into three}} subtests: <b>Scale</b> (<b>pitch</b> discrimination), Off-beat (detect a delay) and Out-of-key (identify incongruent notes). In addition, voxel-based morphometry was measured in 58 of these participants. Results showed that success rates in JMTDT were positively correlated to BMRQ scores. Moreover, higher pitch discrimination was related to greater volume of gray matter in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), and levels of music reward, measured with the BMRQ, were negatively related to gray matter volume of the bilateral caudate and nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that pitch discrimination skills may influence individual sensitivity to the pleasurable aspects of music listening. On the other hand, using a voxel-based morphometry approached, this study provides evidence about a relationship between pitch discrimination skills and the volume of different brain areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{extracted}} the notes of Iranian scale {{from the traditional}} music played by the great musician Shahnazi on the TAR. Then, by analyzing the spectrum of the notes and by using our special averaging we have found the pitch attributed to the components’ frequency and found the interval between the notes. The results are in comple agreement with Pythagorean <b>scale.</b> <b>Pitch</b> is a subjective quantity that attribute auditory sensation in terms of which sounds maybe ordered on a scale extending from low to high. For a pure tone pitch depends mainly on {{the frequency of the}} sound stimulus, but for complex tones or musical sounds pitch depends on partials of the complex tone and when the partials of a complex tone are not harmonic however the determination of pitch is more subtle. Indeed the vibrations of string instruments give rise to overtones which are not exactly multiples of fundamental, so the pitch of musical sound that we perceive is a subjective quantity related to frequencies of the overtones. In this paper we study the effect of partials in pitch of musical notes and by averaging between partials we introduce a subjective quantity which represents the pitch of musical note which is in quite agreement with experiments. As we know there are two famous scales for music, Aristoxenuss and Pythagoraean scale.

40|$|Spectra of Stimuli (in dB SPL) In the {{experiment}} we proof the paradoxical perception of pitch. A tone sequence demonstrates this paradox: the sequence {{is perceived as}} descending, although {{the first and last}} tone are identical. The intransitivity of pitch perception generalizes (Shepard 1964). It applies also to harmonic complex tones with variate amplitude envelope and partials that are arranged in intervals different from octaves. The paradox perception in this experiment {{as well as in the}} Shepard scale is modeled by a formula (spectrum of pitch differences) that extends the virtual pitch algorithm (Terhardt 1998) to pitch intervals. Experiment: Judgment on Pitch Comparison Circular structures A relation ‘ ’ is termed circular, if there are elements with. In contrast to a linear order ‘ ’ is not transitive. The paradox of our experiments is based on this circularity and intransitivity of pitch relation. According to common notion any tone is assigned to one pitch on a linear <b>scale.</b> <b>Pitch</b> relation is thus identified with ‘ ’ resp. ‘ ’ for real numbers. But this order is linear and transitive and thereby- as we will see- in contradiction to our experiments. Description of the Experiment The stimuli consist of tone pairs. Six tone pairs form a logical block. To each tone pair there exists another tone pair in reverse order. In addition every tone pair exists in 9 transpositions. One block contains six distinct harmonic complex tones (cf. Figure 1). Those are combined to six tone pairs: 1 with 2; 2 with 3; [...] .; 5 with 6; 6 with 1. Each of the 18 subjects has to give a judgment on pitch comparison to each tone pair: 1) ‘first tone higher’, 2) ‘second tone higher’, 3) ‘both tones are equal’, 4) ‘undecidable’. The sequence of tone pairs is presented in random order. Result A subject has perceived six tones of a block paradoxically, if there is at least one ascending tone pair and all...|$|E
40|$|As modem silicon CMOS {{has been}} scaled down to {{extremely}} small dimensions, {{there is an}} urgent need for technological innovations of new devices architectures {{that would allow the}} continuation of Moore's Law into the future. In particular, for CMOS with nanometer <b>scale</b> <b>pitch</b> size, the intrinsic electronic properties of silicon as channel material represent a significant hindrance to further scaling. As a result, new channel materials are being investigated all over the world that would enable the push into the sub- 10 nm regime. Among them, certain III-V compound semiconductors have emerged as the most promising candidates to replace silicon in future generations of CMOS. In particular {{and as a result of}} their extraordinary electron or hole transport properties, InGaAs, InAs, and InGaSb enable transistors with faster operation at a lower power consumption. This is the key to enable future scaling. One of the major challenges of extremely-scaled III-V logic MOSFETs is the series resistance. To achieve the performance goals, it is necessary to fabricate source and drain ohmic contacts with ultra-low contact resistance, perhaps as low as 50 [Omega] · [mu]m. This is particularly difficult to achieve as the device size shrinks down to the 10 - 20 nm length range since the contact resistance increases drastically for small contact lengths. Moreover, it is not clearly known how to characterize nano-scale metal-semiconductor ohmic contacts. All available test structures and models, such as the transmission line model (TLM), are designed for relatively large ohmic contacts, on the order of micrometers, and are unable to make accurate measurements of extremely small contact resistance. To deal with nano-scale contacts for III-V CMOS, we need a more accurate test structure capable of extracting extremely small values of contact resistance on very small contacts. In this thesis, a novel test structure, nano-TLM, is developed to address this issue. We demonstrate how the nano-TLM is capable of providing accurate measurements of the contact resistance, metal resistance, and semiconductor resistance of an ohmic contact system at the same time. We demonstrate this new technique in Mo/n⁺-InGaAs ohmic contacts where we have achieved an extremely low contact resistance of 32. 5 [Omega] · [mu]m with contact length as small as 19 nm. This contact resistance at this contact length is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported value to date. Our proposed new test structure will help understand and characterize ohmic contacts suitable for future III-V CMOS device fabrication. by Wenjie Lu. Thesis: S.
