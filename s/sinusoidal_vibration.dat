The results of previous laboratory based research investigating the biomechanical response of the seated human to vibration has been used to develop models that can be used within tools that are capable of predicting the response of seats. Several studies in the literature have reported apparent masses of seated human subjects whilst exposed to either random or <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration.</b> Although these studies have shown similar trends, there have been no systematic comparisons of apparent mass for the same subjects exposed to random and <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration.</b> This paper reports a study where twelve male subjects were exposed to random whole-body vibration at 1. 0 m/s 2 r. m. s. and to <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration</b> at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 Hz. The modulus of the apparent masses were nominally identical when measured using random or <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration.</b> The phase of the apparent masses were similar at 1, 2 and 4 Hz, when measured using random or <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration,</b> but showed consistent differences at 8, 16 and 32 Hz. As the results between experiments using different waveforms are similar, models derived from experimental work based on one type of stimulus could be applied in scenarios involving the other type of stimulus.

40|$|The {{detection}} of a vibration {{may be reduced}} {{by the presence of}} another vibration: a phenomenon known as ‘masking’.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) gain of a parallel array of nonlinear elements that transmits a common input {{composed of a}} periodic signal and external noise. Aiming to further enhance the SNR gain, each element is injected with internal noise components or high-frequency sinusoidal vibrations. We report that the SNR gain exhibits two maxima at different values of the internal noise level or of the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude. For the addition of internal noise to an array of threshold-based elements, the condition for occurrence of stochastic resonance is analytically investigated {{in the limit of}} weak signals. Interestingly, when the internal noise components are replaced by high-frequency sinusoidal vibrations, the SNR gain displays the vibrational multiresonance phenomenon. In both considered cases, there are certain regions of the internal noise intensity or the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude wherein the achieved maximal SNR gain can be considerably beyond unity for a weak signal buried in non-Gaussian external noise. Due to the easy implementation of <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration</b> modulation, this approach is potentially useful for improving the output SNR in an array of nonlinear devices.

40|$|These {{experiments}} assessed {{whether the}} impairment in proprioceptive acuity {{in the hand}} during ‘interfering’ cutaneous stimulation could be caused by inputs from Pacinian corpuscles. The ability to detect passive movements at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the index finger was measured when vibrotactile stimuli were applied to the adjacent middle finger and thenar eminence at frequencies and amplitudes that favour activation of rapidly adapting cutaneous afferents. Inputs from Pacinian corpuscles are favoured with high-frequency vibration (300 Hz), while those from Meissner corpuscles are favoured by lower frequencies (30 Hz). Detection of movement was significantly impaired when 300 Hz (20 μm peak-to-peak amplitude) complex vibration or 300 Hz (50 μm) <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration</b> {{was applied to the}} middle finger and thenar eminence. In contrast, detection of movements was not altered by low-frequency <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration</b> at 30 Hz with an amplitude of 50 μm or with a larger amplitude matched in subjective intensity to the 300 Hz sinusoidal stimulus. Thus {{it is unlikely that the}} impairment in detection was due to attention being diverted by vibration of an adjacent digit. In addition, an increase in amplitude of 300 Hz vibration led to a greater impairment of movement detection, so that the impairment was graded with the input. The time taken to nominate the direction of applied movement also increased during 300 Hz but not during 30 Hz <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibration.</b> These findings suggest that stimuli which preferentially activate Pacinian, but not Meissner corpuscles, impair proprioceptive acuity in a movement detection task...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} detect <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibrations</b> on the skin surface is {{dependent}} on the activation of two classes of receptors. The density of such receptors varies across the skin surface and is a factor in determining the sensory acuity of each skin area. However, the acuity of many sensory systems is known to deteriorate with advancing age. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if vibrotactile sensibility of several skin surfaces deteriorated equally with advancing age. Methods Vibration detection thresholds for two frequencies of vibration (30 Hz and 200 Hz) were determined using a method of limits protocol, in two groups of healthy adults, one group aged 17 to 27 years and the other aged 55 to 90 years. <b>Sinusoidal</b> <b>vibrations</b> were generated by a computer and delivered to the skin surface via the probe (diameter = 2 mm) of a mechanical vibrator. Four skin sites (palmar surface of the tip of the middle finger, volar surface of the forearm, lateral aspect of the shoulder, cheek just caudal to the zygoma) were tested. Results The fingertip was the most sensitive site for vibrotactile detection at both frequencies in a substantial majority of subjects. The older group of subjects showed significantly higher detection thresholds for both frequencies at all sites, except the fingertip, when compared to young subjects. Conclusion The study confirms the deterioration of vibrotactile acuity at several skin sites previously reported in the literature. However, there appears to be no significant reduction in vibrotactile detection at the fingertips in older subjects. This may reflect the high receptor density of this area, or the functional importance of vibrotactile sensibility of the fingertips or some combination of both of these factors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This {{systematic}} review {{was performed to}} summarize the current evidence for whole body vibration (WBV) interventions on postural control in elderly. Methods English and German language papers in Medline, PEDro, Cinahl and the Cochrane databases were searched. Two reviewers extracted data on patients' characteristics, type of WBV intervention and outcomes. Two independent reviewers rated the methodological quality of these studies. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Results Fifteen papers reporting quantitative data were included. Results from 15 papers could be pooled for a meta-analysis. The studies involved 933 participants. In 7 studies the authors investigated the effects of vibration plates generating vertical <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibrations</b> (VS-WBV) and 7 papers described the use of side-alternating <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>vibrations</b> (SS-WBV). One study investigated both VS-WBV and SS-WBV. Weak to moderate evidence of an overall effect {{as a result of}} VS-WBV and SS-WBV was observed for (a) static balance for post-intervention values with a standardized mean difference (SMD) - 0. 06, 95 % CI - 0. 31 to 0. 18 and for change values SMD - 0. 26, 95 % CI - 1. 09 to 0. 57, and (b) dynamic balance for post-intervention-values SMD - 0. 34, 95 % CI - 0. 60 to - 0. 08. For functional balance (c) an overall outcome for post-intervention values with SMD of 0. 34, 95 % CI - 0. 19 to 0. 87 was found. Conclusions The 15 studies reviewed were of moderate methodological quality. In summary, SS-WBV seems to have a beneficial effect on dynamic balance in elderly individuals. However, the current results should be interpreted with caution because of the observed heterogeneity of training parameters and statistical methods. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of WBV on postural control in an elderly population. </p...|$|R
