40|$|This study {{observes the}} {{structures}} of coordination used in Insurance Policy. The structure of coordination is the only structure in English which has more than two immediate constituents: clearly, a series has as many immediate constituents as there are items in the series. This refers to the sentences in the Insurance Policy, which are constructed in very long and complex sentences. This thesis aims at finding out the construction of structures of coordination in Erection All Risks Policy. Therefore, the writer analyzed the structure of coordination based on Nelson Francis' theory. A structure of coordination consists {{of two or more}} syntactically equivalent units joined in a structure which functions as a single unit. The units so joined may be any of the parts of speech or more complex structures. The joining is accomplished by coordinators and punctuation marks in written form. The coordinators could be either present or not. The other supported theories are Sidney Greebaum and Randolph Quirk in coordination (1990); Enno Klamer in the components and punctuation (1977); and John E. Warriner in punctuation (1982). The details of the theories are to be discussed in chapter 11. The writer uses qualitative approach to analyze {{the structures of}} coordination in the sentences of Insurance Policy. The approaches of this study are the kinds of structures of coordination, the components of the structures of coordination, the linkers of the structures of coordination, the syntactic functions of the structures of coordination, and to count their occurrence used in the Insurance Policy. From this study, it is found out that there are four types of' structure of coordination. They are common and syndetic, series and asyndetic (with comma); series and asyndetic (with semicolon); then series and poiysyndetic (without comma). The components of structures of coordination arc parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, and adverb), phrases (noun phrase, verb phrase, and prepositional phrase), and clauses (independent and <b>subordination</b> <b>clause).</b> The linkers of structures of coordination are coordinating conjunction anti, or, but, {{and with the help of}} punctuation marks comma and semicolon. The syntactic functions of the structures of coordination function as subject, predicate, main verb (part of predicate), direct object, objective complement, object of preposition, head, and modifier. Through this analysis, the writer expects that the results will help the readers read the Insurance Policy easily...|$|E

Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as [...] "yesterday" [...] or [...] "now" [...] or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.|$|R

Thisstudy {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} syntactical modification of teacher talk in High School. This study also reveals the types of syntactical modification of teacher talk. Those are measures of length of utterances, measures of subordination, measures of markedness, measures of grammatically, and measures of distribution (Chaudron: 1990). The language that they use with the learners when teaching differ from the language in the daily activity. The teachers have to manage their talking in syntactical modification because it influences learners’ language knowledge especially for English lesson in language class. Furthermore, it affects the student language acquisition. Language acquisition is the natural process. (Keith Johnson, 2001 : 76). It means that the leaning process of learners is influenced by teacher talk. There are two aims that contains in this research. First aim is to explore the syntactical modification of teacher talk in EFL classroom. It means that researcher aims to analyze the syntactical modification that occurs {{in the process of}} learning. Furthermore, the second aim is to explorelearners’ understanding toward syntactical modification of teacher talk. It will describe how the learnersunderstand what the teacher says in process of English learning. This studyuses qualitative method. It focuses to use descriptive qualitative. Dawsan’s (2007 : 15 - 16) points out that qualitative research explored attitudes, behavior and experiences through such methods as interview or focus group. Moreover,this studyis conducted in Madrasah AliyahNegeri of BuntetPesantren, Astanajapura, Cirebon. In this study, the researcher takes two teachers. The first respondent is male teacher who teach English in first grade of language class. Meanwhile, the second teacher is female teacher who teach in the second grade of language class. The data is taken by doing observation, questionnaire, and interview. The result of research showsthat:(1) Male and female teacher uses syntactical modification in the listening and speaking section. They do five types of syntactical modification of teacher talk. Those are using shorterutterances, using fewer <b>subordination</b> <b>clauses,</b> using less marked sentences, avoiding ungrammatical sentences, and using more declarative sentences. Moreover, teachers simplify their talk {{in order to make the}} learners understand by using syntactical modification. (2) Learners at second grade of language class understand what female teacher says. In contrast, the learners at first grade of language class do not catch what the male teacher says clearly although he has been used syntactical modification. After exploring the reason, another side shows that male teacher ignored the phonological and interactional area whereas female teacher applies all of characteristics of teacher talk, so learners are easy to understand her talk.

40|$|In the dialects of the Inuit {{continuum}} (Eskaleut family), {{two main}} features of <b>clause</b> <b>subordination</b> stand out: {{first of all}} the lack of subordinating conjunctions, as subordinate clauses are indicated by verbal morphology and synthetic devices; second, there is a structural and formal parallelism between several verb forms found in subordinate clauses and possessive noun phrases. Alongside verbal morphology indicating subordination, several markers found within the verb phrase also indicate subordination. Taking examples from East Greenlandic Tunumiisut, we will emphasize the frequency and role of multiple subordinate clause-chaining in discourse. Our findings show that the supposed dichotomy between the verbal markers found in dependent sentences and those found in independent sentences might be less rigid in oral narratives. This leads us to take dependency phenomena into consideration on a different level, that of discursive paragraphs or sequences of sentences. In a general manner, we will exemplify the language's preferential use of synthetic processes to mark clausal subordination...|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the structure of}} Ateso, an Eastern Nilotic language. Based on interview and recorded data from fieldwork conducted in both Uganda and Kenya, where Ateso is spoken, the study provides the first comprehensive description of the phonology, morphology and syntax of the language. The main {{findings of this study}} are as follows: The key feature of Ateso's phonological structure is that vowel alternation strategies are constrained by three harmony rules: root-control, feature-control, and, finally, mid-vowel assimilation. While Ateso shares this structure with the other Eastern Nilotic languages, it has its unique features as well. For example, while {{the other members of the}} Eastern Nilotic family have lost the vowel */ä/, Ateso has retained it phonetically. Ateso's noun morphology has noun-inflectional affixes associated with gender- and number marking. The language employs noun prefixes for gender and uses suffixes to express number and to derive words from others. With regard to its verbal morphology, Ateso verb forms are inflected for a variety of functions. Inflectional categories such as person, number, tense, aspect and mood are marked on the verb either segmentally or supra-segmentally. Tense is expressed suprasegmentally by tone on the nucleus of verb roots, while different morphemes mark person, number, aspect and mood. The discussion of Ateso verb morphology covers verbal derivations and extensions; namely, causatives, ventives, itives, datives, iterative, passives and instrumentals. Regarding its syntactic structure, as a VS/VO language, Ateso allows for a complete clause made up of an inflected verb only, or an inflected verb followed by one or two NPs/or an NP and a pronoun. The language can also have sentence structures involving strategies such as coordination, <b>subordination</b> and <b>clause</b> chaining...|$|R
40|$|Sign {{language}} grammars, {{just like}} spoken language grammars, generally provide various means to generate {{different kinds of}} complex syntactic structures including <b>subordination</b> of complement <b>clauses,</b> adverbial clauses, or relative clauses.

40|$|A {{small-scale}} {{study at}} a British university investigated two issues: {{the effect of}} task familiarity on language production; {{and the effects of}} the task on oral production. Three university students of differing language backgrounds, all non-native speakers of English, were interviewed in autumn and again 3 months later. On both occasions they were asked a range of general questions about their studies and reasons for choosing the university. In the first interview they were also asked to describe a short picture story, and in the second they were asked to recount the old story and a new picture story. Changes in the performance on the first story were analyzed for whether they: (1) could be attributed to knowledge of the first story; or (2) were also reflected in performance on the second story. Analysis looked at pauses (filled and unfilled), repairs, vocabulary complexity, and syntactic complexity.

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged that word-order patterns in earlier {{stages of the}} English language are more variable than those of Present-Day English. Two main word-orders compete in early English, namely VO and OV, which follow some principles in their distribution in the language. These two word-orders correlate with the degree of <b>subordination</b> of the <b>clause,</b> VO being associated with non-subordinate clauses and OV with subordinate ones. More recently, {{it has been observed}} that the above correlation does not match with the existing data and demonstrated that there are other linguistic factors intervening in the non-random distribution of word-order patterns, as is the case of the presence of object pronominal items or negative constituents. Regarding relative clauses in early English, word-order has been generally associated with the relativizer used to introduce the relative clause, ultimately linked to the status of the clause, with relative clauses introduced by a pronominal item showing a tendency for VO and those introduced by an indeclinable relativizer for OV. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show an alternative explanation to account for word-order patterns in relative clauses in early English, and illustrate how the word-order patterns of these clauses in particular are more influenced by the type of relative clause, whether restrictive or non-restrictive, than by the wor...|$|R

An introductory chapter gives the typological characteristics of Ika, an SOV language, and summarizes phonology and morphophonemics. Following chapters discuss the major word classes, the noun phrase, case marking and postpositional phrases, the verb phrase, basic clause types, sentence formation, subordination, and pragmatics. ^ Several areas of special interest include: split ergativity, with limited ergative patterns in what is essentially a nominative-accusative language; a limited noun class system {{similar to that of}} the Athabaskan languages; a verb prefix that enables possessor ascension; zero anaphora and the participant reference system; topic continuity; and optional auxiliary verbs which serve to give clauses a topic-comment structuring. ^ The discussion of <b>subordination</b> includes relative <b>clauses,</b> nominalized clauses, and various types of complementation (e. g., indirect questions and resultant state complements). The chapter on sentence formation outlines the use of clause chaining to combine clauses into sentences, a process common in SOV languages. Some attention is given to the ways in which various grammatical phenomena interact with narrative structure, including, for example, a verb prefix which speakers may use to help specify important locations within a narrative. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates {{the use of}} different question prompts and the discourse they generate in the SLE:OI, an ACTFL-variant second language oral proficiency interview test. One hundred and fifty-two question prompts used to elicit the test task of 'supporting an opinion,' were transcribed from 27 SLE:OI tests administered between July and November, 2000. From this, 30 categories of question prompts were identified by 6 SLE:OI raters acting as judges. Independently, the researcher and the judges determined task difficulty/complexity to be the predominant feature differentiating the categories. Using the 30 categories as a basis, the Question Prompt Complexity Questionnaire was produced and administered to the 6 judges. Analysis of the questionnaire data indicated a clear consensus for 3 categories into 'easy' and 'difficult' groups. Subsequently, candidate responses to 11 question prompts from the easy group, and 10 from the difficult group were transcribed, and discourse analyses were carried out to ascertain response levels of L 2 fluency (by type-token ratio; frequency of silent and filled pauses, repetitions, and self-repairs), accuracy (by verb morphology and lexical use), and complexity (by <b>clause</b> <b>subordination).</b> The results demonstrated that those candidates tested with 'easy' and 'difficult' question prompts showed strong, significant differences in two aspects of their response fluency, but {{no significant differences in}} the accuracy or complexity of their responses.

40|$|A major {{contribution}} of recent research in theoretical linguistics, corpus linguistics and psycholinguistics {{has been to}} provide convergent evidence that lexis and grammar are closely intertwined (Sinclair, 1991; Stefanowitsch & Gries, 2003; Goldberg, 2006, Ellis & Cadierno, 2009; Römer, 2009). It has also been convincingly demonstrated that language is essentially made up of word combinations that constitute single choices and that words acquire meanings from their context (Sinclair, 1991; Biber et al., 1999; Wray, 2002). The construct of linguistic complexity, however, is still typically narrowed down to syntactic complexity in second/foreign language acquisition research (Ortega, 2003). When lexical complexity is investigated, it is also often restricted to lexical variation and sophistication and analyzed by means of single word-based measures such as type/token formulas and frequency word lists (Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998 : 101 - 115; Lu, 2012). The main objective of this presentation {{is to examine the}} potential role of the lexis-grammar interface in interlanguage complexity research by comparing measures of syntactic and lexical complexity with indices tapping lexico-grammatical complexity. The data used are extracted from the Varieties of English for Specific Purposes dAtabase (VESPA, [URL] a learner corpus made up of 123 research papers written by French EFL learners in the context of BA and MA linguistics courses (c. 370, 000 words). Each of the learner texts was assigned a grade according to the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR; Council of Europe, 2001) by two professional raters (plus a third one in case of substantial disagreement). Following Norris and Ortega (2009), I measure overall syntactic complexity (mean length of T-unit), complexity by <b>subordination</b> (<b>clauses</b> per T-unit), and complexity by subclausal or phrasal elaboration (e. g. mean length of clause, complex nominals per clause) with the L 2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (Lu, 2010). Lexical complexity is investigated by means of a large battery of text-internal and text-external measures available in the Lexical Complexity Analyzer (Lu, 2012). Lexico-grammatical complexity is approached via a number of corpus-based methods: (1) a macro analysis centred on the routine aspects of learner language that investigates the frequency, structure and function of recurrent word combinations (Paquot, 2014); (2) a co-occurrence analysis that uses association tests to identify statistically salient collocations (Paquot, forthcoming); and (3) a collostructional analysis which aims at measuring the degree of attraction that words exhibit to syntactic patterns or constructions (Stefanowitsch & Gries, 2003). I will also discuss results cross-linguistically in the light of three recent studies I conducted on the influence of the first language on French and Spanish EFL learners’ use of recurrent word combinations (Paquot, 2013 a; Paquot, 2013 b; Paquot, 2014 b).

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{proposals}} {{of a number}} of psychological and computational accounts of focusing and pronoun interpretation in view of obtaining experimental evidence for the questions raised by the accounts. Four distinct but related studies were conducted with the aim of bringing together various frameworks as a step towards developing an integrated model of the processes of comprehension. Experiments 1 - 3 in Chapter 2 show that thematic role and surface position focusing take precedence over the salience from naming, but that naming effects are seen in the absence of thematic role focusing. Experiments 4 - 5 in Chapter 3 show the effect of <b>clause</b> <b>subordination</b> in certain complex sentences, with main clauses being more prominent than subordinate ones. Experiments 6 - 8 in Chapter 3 show that this effect may not be generalised to different types of complex sentences, however. Experiments 9 - 18 in Chapter 4 show that animacy has a strong effect on prominence, overriding thematic role and surface position effects. The presence of these latter two effects is crucially dependent on the pattern of animacy. Experiments 19 - 21 in Chapter 5 show the effects of grammatical parallelism, in which the features of both the anaphor and the antecedent have an influence, which overlays structural focusing. These results show that a variety of constraints can complete in determining the accessibility of discourse referents. The structural, semantic, and pragmatic discourse context in which referents are introduced and the attributes of the cue used to re-access them have a role. The findings are discussed in terms of an activation-based framework, whereby pronoun resolution is determined by the relative activation of the potential antecedents in the mental representation of the discourse. They suggest a dynamic model of focusing in which an antecedent’s features establish and update the focus, and in which certain linguistic elements may trigger the current focus to be modified...|$|R
40|$|Karbi is a Tibeto-Burman (TB) {{language}} spoken {{by half a}} million people in the Karbi Anglong district in Assam, Northeast India, and surrounding areas in the extended Brahmaputra Valley area. It is an agglutinating, verb-final language. This dissertation offers a description of the dialect spoken in the hills of the Karbi Anglong district. It is primarily based on a corpus that was created during a total of fifteen months of original fieldwork, while building on and expanding on research reported by Grüßner in 1978. While the exact phylogenetic status of Karbi inside TB has remained controversial, this dissertation points out various putative links to other TB languages. The most intriguing aspect of Karbi phonology is the tone system, which carries a low functional load. While three tones can be contrasted on monosyllabic roots, the rich agglutinating morphology of Karbi allows the formation of polysyllabic words, at which level tones lose most of their phonemicity, while still leaving systematic phonetic traces. Nouns and verbs represent the two major word classes of Karbi at the root level; property-concept terms represent a subclass of verbs. At the heart of Karbi morphosyntax, there are two prefixes of Proto-TB provenance that have diachronically shaped the grammar of the language: the possessive prefix a- and the nominalizer ke-. Possessive a- attaches to nouns that are modified by preposed elements and represents the most frequent morpheme in the corpus. Nominalization involving ke- forms the basis for a variety of predicate constructions, including most of Karbi subordination {{as well as a number}} of main clause constructions. In addition to nominalization, <b>subordination</b> commonly involves <b>clause</b> chaining. Noun phrases may be marked for their clausal role via -phān `non-subject' or -lòng `locative' but frequently remain unmarked for role. Their pragmatic status can be indicated with information structure markers for topic, focus, and additivity. Commonly used discourse constructions include elaborate expressions and parallelism more generally, general extenders, copy verb constructions, as well as a number of final particles. Audio files are available of the texts given in the appendices, particular examples illustrating phonological issues, and phonetic recordings of tone minimal sets.

40|$|Based on the {{description}} above, {{it can be}} concluded that: 1) 	Osong chant and Mebala Kollong speech is a ritual speech at the ceremonyRambu Soloq of Toraja Culture when carrying bodies to rante, venue of the ceremony along with collects all the buffalo to be sacrificed to ask for salvation for all the family and all the condolence visitorsin order of deliverance from all danger during and after the ceremony. 2) 	Osong chant ritual speech and Mebala Kollongare akada silopak (parallelism and pair speech) in the form of stanzas that poured in forms of tropes or figure of speech such as repetition, symbolic, metaphor, and parallelism, and tautology. 3) 	Because it is a trope, Osong chant and Mebala Kollong ritual must be explained by denotation or primer and connotation meaning or secondary meaning to interpret cultural symbols. 4) 	Geerally, based on denotative and connotative meaning, the meaning of second line of each stanza is deeper and broader than the meaning of the first line becausethe meaning of the second row gives emphasis to the meaning in the first row. 5) 	Particularly, paradigmatic form between lines in each stanza shows that the words in the first line is hyponym of words in the second row as the <b>subordination</b> and the <b>clause</b> on the first line that inclusion with a clause on the second line. 6) 	Connotatively simbolistically, Osong chant ritual speech and Mebala Kollong express the relationship between man and man, man and animals as well as socialcultural religious values such as petition, respect, rules-ban- doubt, hope, majesty, and pray. 7) 	It is needed to carry out more researches systematically and in-depth about the topic of the ritual speechin this analysis as well as other ritual speech in the culture of Toraja to document efforts in order to preserve the culture. This study aims to explain parallelism and metaphor in Osongchant death ritual speech and Mebala Kollong speechat ritual ceremony Rambu Soloqat Toraja culture. This study was a participative observation conducted in Ao Gading village, Sa???danand Balusu district of North Toraja regency, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The data werein the form of social situations and events ie Osong and Mebala Kollong speech obtained through recording, interview, and note taking. The data were analyzed by interpretive-qualitative technique. The results showed that denotative utterances of Osong deathchant ritual speech and Mebala Kollong speech constructed by some kinds of style such as a metaphor, parallelism, symbolic, tautology, and repetition. While, connotatively-symbolic this ritual speech expressed social relations and values of socio-cultural forms of supplication, reverence, worship, praise, hope, majesty, prayers and others...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} what is discoverable about {{the structure of the}} hundreds of Aboriginal languages that were spoken on the vast Australian continent before their postcolonial demise, is contained in nineteenth-century grammars. Many were written by fervent young missionaries who traversed the globe intent on describing the languages spoken by heathens, whom they hoped to convert to Christianity. Some of these documents, written before Australian academic institutions expressed any interest in Aboriginal languages, are the sole relics of languages spoken by the people who successfully occupied Australia. This history of the early description of Australian Aboriginal languages traces a developing understanding and ability to describe Australian morphosyntax. The corpus of early grammatical descriptions written between 1834 and 1910 is identified in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses the philological methodology of retrieving data from these grammars. Chapters 3 - 9 consider the grammars in roughly chronological order, commencing with those written in the earliest-established Australian colony of New South Wales: L. Threlkeld, 1834 (Chapter 3), and W. Günther, 1838 and 1840 (Chapter 4). Chapters 5 - 9 investigates the large body of grammars of languages spoken in South Australia: C. G. Teichelmann & C. W. Schürmann 1840 (Chapter 5), H. A. E. Meyer 1843 (Chapter 6), C. W. Schürmann 1844 and M. Moorhouse 1846 (Chapter 7), grammars of Diyari (Chapter 8,) and grammars of Arrernte (Chapter 9). Analyses made by other corpus grammarians are discussed throughout these chapters, by way of comparison, notably: C. Symmons (1841), G. Taplin (1867; 1872 [1870]; 1874; 1878), W. Ridley (1875 [1866; 1855 a]; 1855 b; 1856 b), H. Livingstone (1892), W. E. Roth (1897; 1901), and R. H. Mathews’ analyses of some of the many languages he described. Some material is presented as appendices. Appendix 1 examines the context in which grammars of languages spoken in New South Wales and Queensland were written. G. Taplin’s (1867; 1872 [1870]; 1874; 1878) grammars of Ngarrindjeri are examined more closely in Appendix 2. By focussing on grammatical structures that challenged the classically-trained grammarians: the description of the case systems, of ergativity, and of bound pronouns, Chapters 3 - 9 of this historiographical investigation identify the provenance of analyses, and of descriptive techniques, thus identifying paths of intellectual descent. The extent to which missionary-grammarians, posted across far-flung regions of the country, were aware of each others’ materials has not previously been well understood. Three schools of descriptive practice are shown to have developed in the pre-academic era. The earliest, instigated by L. E Threlkeld (1834) (Chapter 3), is found to have been less influential than previously assumed (Carey 2004 : 264 - 269). Two later descriptive schools are identified, one spawned by W. E. Roth’s grammar of Pitta-Pitta (1897), and the other by Teichelmann & Schürmann (1840) in the earliest grammar of a language spoken in South Australia. The strength and duration of the school which was inspired by Teichelmann & Schürmann and which was dominated by South Australian Lutheran missionaries is further demonstrated through examination of the description of processes of <b>clause</b> <b>subordination</b> (Chapter 10). By studying the type of analyses characteristically generated when the European classical descriptive framework was applied to Australian grammatical structures, or the nature of the ‘looking glass’ through which Australian morpho-syntactic structures were observed, this thesis refines a philological methodology of extracting morphosyntactic data from antique grammatical records.
