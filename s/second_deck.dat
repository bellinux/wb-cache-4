5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E
5|$|Nevada {{became a}} prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers {{during the second}} wave. Japanese pilots {{intended}} to sink her in the channel ostensibly to block the harbor. Tactically target selection was wrong as 14–18 dive bombers attacking her wouldn't be able to sink a battleship with 250kg bombs and the channel's width of 1200 feet made the idea of bottling up the harbor impossible. As she steamed past Ten-Ten Dock at about 09:50, Nevada was struck by five bombs. One exploded over the crew's galley at Frame 80. Another struck the port director platform and exploded {{at the base of}} the stack on the upper deck. Yet another hit near No. 1 turret inboard from the port waterway and blew large holes in the upper and main decks. Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15; one passed out through the side of the <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> before exploding, but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{specifications}} {{called for}} a five-hold steel cargo ship with raked stem and cruiser stern, complete shelter and <b>second</b> <b>decks,</b> and a third deck in Nos. 1-4 holds. Dimensions of the hatches were 20 ft × 30 ft, except for No. 2, which was 20 ft × 50 ft, allowing such cargo as locomotives, naval guns, long bars, etc. Ventilation to the holds was provided by hollow kingposts, which also served as cargo masts. Cargo handling gear consisted of fourteen 5-ton cargo booms, plus two 30-ton booms at Nos. 3 and 4 hatches.|$|R
25|$|The Board of Estimate {{approved}} the highway, now costing $13.5 million on June 14, 1926. It {{was to be}} built so a <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> could be added {{at a later time}} for about $9 million if traffic warranted. Controller Charles W. Berry questioned the proposal until he realized the money would come from tax assessments, at which time he agreed with the project.|$|E
25|$|The George Washington Bridge was {{completed}} in 1931, linking Fort Lee to Manhattan.

25|$|The new stadium--roughly {{corresponding}} to {{the lower half of}} the current structure's east and west grandstands--opened later that year. By 1929, the stadium had become a 32,890-seat horseshoe, with temporary seating for an additional 5,000. The space inside the horseshoe was sufficient to allow a track surrounding the field. Capacity was raised to 41,500 in 1953 when a partial <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> and a pressbox were added at a cost of $346,000.|$|E

25|$|Compartments are {{identified}} by the deck forming the floor of that compartment. Different types of ships have different deck naming conventions. Passenger ships often use {{letters of the alphabet}} sequentially down from A deck (the highest) above B deck, and B deck above C deck, and so forth. Another popular naming convention is numbering the main deck 1, the deck below it 2 (or the <b>second</b> <b>deck),</b> and the deck below that the third deck, and so forth. Decks above the main deck may be named, like the bridge deck or poop deck, or they may be numbered upwards from the main deck with a zero prefix: 01 above the main deck, 02 deck above 01, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|For {{two and a}} half seasons, 1999 to 2001, the Vandals used WSU's Martin Stadium {{in nearby}} Pullman as its home field, as Idaho transitioned back to Division I-A from Division I-AA. When Dennis Erickson {{returned}} as head coach in 2006, there was talk of adding a <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> to the Kibbie Dome to increase the football seating to 25,000, and building a new basketball arena. In February 2007, {{the state board of education}} appropriated funds to study expansion possibilities. On December 6, the board approved funding to begin design work for $52 million in improvements, including an expansion to 20,000 seats, lowering the elevation of the playing field, and other various safety and spectator improvements.|$|E

25|$|Turner Field also {{featured}} the Georgia's Own Credit Union Club and Superior Plumbing Club, consisting of 152 collective premium seats located directly adjacent {{to each side}} of the press box. The original club, sponsored by Georgia's Own Credit Union and featuring 80 seats, was added to the ballpark for the 2012 season and also contained multiple upscale dining options and in-seat food and beverage services. Instead of stadium seats, patrons faced the field in chairs around semicircular tables. A slightly-smaller second section, sponsored by Superior Plumbing and featuring 72 seats, was added for the 2013 season {{on the opposite side of}} the press area. The Club Level was another indoor premium concourse level located on the <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> of the ballpark. This level featured multiple VIP suites that could be purchased for individual games and used for party-style affairs, among other events. For Turner Field's final few seasons, the Club Level had no title sponsor; in previous years, it was known as the Lexus Level and Golden Moon Casino Level.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia opened interleague {{play against}} the Boston Red Sox on May 21, {{defeating}} them, 5–1; J. C. Romero collected his second save {{of the season}} to close Hamels' fifth victory, and Werth {{hit a home run}} to the <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> in left field. Boston's Daisuke Matsuzaka nearly no-hit the Phillies in the second game until Juan Castro singled with two outs in the eighth inning; it was Philadelphia's only hit of the game, as they were defeated, 5–0. The Red Sox took the final game, 8–3, by scoring six earned runs against Halladay, his second consecutive loss and the most runs allowed in a start by the right-hander so far during the season. Traveling to New York for their second series against the Mets, the Phillies were shut out in consecutive games: 8–0 on May 25 by knuckleballer R. A. Dickey; and 5–0 on May 26 by Hisanori Takahashi. Philadelphia was held scoreless for 37 of 38 consecutive innings, with the only runs coming in the final inning of the last game against Boston, and increased that total to 46 of 47 after being shut out again in the final game of the series, 3–0; the Phillies became the first defending league champion in Major League Baseball history not to score a run in a three-game series. It was the first time Philadelphia was shut out in three consecutive games since 1983, the season that they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. The streak ended at 30 consecutive innings (49 of 50) when the Phillies scored in the fourth inning of the May 28 contest to open the Memorial Day weekend series with Florida; they defeated the Marlins, 3–2, after taking their first lead in a game in a week. Philadelphia completed its second consecutive victory in a pitcher's duel between Halladay and Marlins ace Josh Johnson; Johnson allowed only an unearned run through seven innings, but Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in major league history, and the second in franchise history (Jim Bunning), striking out 11 and retiring all 27 Florida batters in order. The tables were turned the following afternoon as the Marlins shut out the Phillies, 1–0, behind Aníbal Sánchez, and the month was finished with a 9–3 loss to Atlanta.|$|E

50|$|The Far West {{was built}} in Pittsburgh in 1870 for the Coulson Packet Company. The Far West was 190 ft long with a beam of 33 ft and had three decks, a cupola like pilot house and two tall smoke stacks. She drew only 20 in of water {{unloaded}} and 30 in fully loaded with 200 tons of freight. Between her first and <b>second</b> <b>decks</b> were two powerful high-pressure steam engines built by Herbertson Engine Works of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, each with 15 in pistons and a 5 ft stroke. The engines were powered by steam from three boilers that consumed as many as 30 cords of wood a day. The engines drove a single 30 ft stern wheel. The Far West also had two steam capstans, {{one on each side}} of the bow, being the first boat built with more than one.|$|R

50|$|In 1964, {{the vessel}} was built {{as one of}} seven Victoria class ferries. Like her sister ships, she was {{lengthened}} in 1973 at Burrard Dry Dock. After the ship damaged a crankshaft beyond repair, she was re-engined with four Wärtsilä engines, had the car deck platform ramps removed and was raised to add a <b>second</b> car <b>deck</b> at Vancouver Shipyards in 1991. After being raised for a <b>second</b> car <b>deck,</b> she would normally be considered a Victoria class ferry as she shares most {{of the characteristics of}} that class, but because of her improved powerplants and higher clearance car decks, she is unique. Her two remaining sister ships are the Burnaby class vessels Queen of Nanaimo and Queen of Burnaby, which are also not considered Victoria class vessels because they did not receive the additional car deck which created the final Victoria class ferries.|$|R
500|$|As designed, the Montanas {{used the}} [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor philosophy, {{with most of}} the armor {{concentrated}} on the citadel that includes the machinery spaces, armament, magazines, and command and control facilities. Unlike the previous Iowa-class, the Montana-class design returned to an external armor belt due to the greater beam providing sufficient stability while having the required belt inclination; this arrangement would have made construction and damage repairs much easier. The belt armor would be [...] Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor mounted on [...] Special Treatment Steel (STS), inclined at 19 degrees. Below the waterline, the belt tapered to [...] To protect against potential underwater hits, the ships would have a separate [...] Class B homogeneous Krupp-type lower belt that would also have served as one of the torpedo bulkheads, inclined at 10 degrees; this lower belt would taper to 1 inch at the keel. The ends of the armored citadel would be closed by [...] Class A traverse bulkhead front and [...] Class A in the aft. The deck armor would be in three layers, consisting of a laminated [...] STS weather deck, a combined [...] Class B and STS <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> on the centerline, and a [...] splinter deck; the outboard section would have a [...] Class B and STS <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> and a [...] splinter deck.

500|$|The Andrea Doria-class ships had a {{complete}} waterline armor belt {{with a maximum}} thickness of [...] that reduced to [...] towards the stern and [...] towards the bow. Above the main belt was a strake of armor [...] thick that extended up to the lower edge of the main deck. Above this strake was a thinner one, 130 millimeters thick, that protected the casemates. The ships had two armored decks: the main deck was [...] thick in two layers on the flat that increased to [...] on the slopes that connected it to the main belt. The <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> was [...] thick, also in two layers. Fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected the belt to the decks.|$|E
500|$|As bomb damage became evident, Nevada {{was ordered}} to proceed to {{the west side of}} Ford Island to prevent her from sinking in deeper water. Instead, she was {{grounded}} off Hospital Point at 10:30, with the help of [...] and , though she managed to force down three planes before she struck the shore. Gasoline fires prevented damage control parties from containing flooding forward of the main torpedo defense system. Flooding the main magazine and counterflooding to keep the ship stable lowered the bow allowing water to enter the ship at the <b>second</b> <b>deck</b> level. Lack of watertight subdivision between the second and main decks from frame 30 to frame 115 allowed water entering through bomb holes in the forecastle to flow aft through the ship's ventilation system to flood the dynamo and boiler rooms.|$|E
