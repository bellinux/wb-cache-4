30|$|Biosurfactants are {{the surface}} active {{compounds}} produced by micro-organisms. The eco-friendly and biodegradable nature of biosurfactants makes their usage more advantageous over chemical surfactants. Biosurfactants encompass {{the properties of}} dropping surface tension, stabilizing emulsions, promoting foaming and are usually non- toxic and biodegradable. Biosurfactants offer advantages over their synthetic counterparts in many applications ranging from environmental, food, and biomedical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The important environmental applications of biosurfactants include bioremediation and dispersion of oil spills, enhanced oil recovery and transfer of crude oil. The emphasis of present review shall be {{with reference to the}} commercial production, current developments and future perspectives of a variety of approaches of biosurfactant production from the micro-organisms isolated from various oil- contaminated sites and from the by-products of oleo-chemical industry wastes/ by-products viz. used edible oil, industrial residues, acid oil, deodorizer distillate, <b>soap-stock</b> etc.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas putida KT 217 {{was grown}} on a complex medium {{comprised}} of co-products of the ethanol and biodiesel industries {{to assess the}} organism’s capability to produce medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA). The growth phase {{was carried out in}} a medium containing 400 g/L condensed corn solubles (CCS), supplemented with am-monium hydroxide as a nitrogen source. Following the exponential phase, co-products of the biodiesel industry (<b>soap-stock</b> and glycerin) were fed into the reactor to trigger PHA production. When glycerin was added to the bioreactor (75 g/L total addition), the final cell dry weight (CDW) and PHA content were 30 g/L and 31 %, respectively. The mono-meric composition in the PHA formed was relatively uniform throughout incubation with 3 -hydroxydecanoate domi-nating. When a total of 153 g/L of sunflower soapstock was added to the bioreactor in a fed-batch manner, the final CDW and PHA content were 17 g/L and 17 %, respectively. Following addition of soapstock the monomeric composi-tion of the polymer changed dramatically, with the 3 -hydroxyoctanoate monomer becoming dominant and greater un-saturation present in the PHA...|$|E
