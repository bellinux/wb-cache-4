Along with the light cruisers , , and , Friedrich Carls subdivision {{was attached to the}} I Squadron of the Active Fleet. Friedrich Carl was the flagship of Rear Admiral Schmidt, the commander of the Cruiser Division. A <b>second</b> <b>subdivision,</b> composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the II Squadron. On 20 September 1906, Franz von Hipper took command of the ship. Under his leadership, the gunners aboard Friedrich Carl won the Kaiser's Prize for best shooting in the fleet in 1907. Hipper remained in the position until March 1908.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{commissioning}} in 1902, Prinz Heinrich {{served with}} the fleet. She was the flagship of the Cruiser Division, along with the protected cruiser [...] and eight light cruisers. In August 1902 she accompanied the SMY Hohenzollern with Emperor Wilhelm II on board to Reval, where she took part in combined fleet maneuvers with ships from the Imperial Russian Navy. In January 1904, the cruiser and two passenger ships went to the Norwegian town of Ålesund {{in the aftermath of}} a fire that destroyed the town. The ships carried supplies and medical stores to the port and assisted with the relief effort. She was reassigned to the II Subdivision of the Cruiser Division of the Active Fleet in 1905, after the arrival of the new armored cruiser [...] The II Subdivision also included the light cruisers , , and , and was attached to the II Squadron of the Active Fleet. A <b>second</b> <b>subdivision,</b> composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the I Squadron.|$|E
500|$|After her commissioning, Hamburg {{served with}} the fleet. She was {{assigned}} to I Subdivision of the Cruiser Division of the Active Fleet. The unit consisted of the light cruisers [...] and [...] and the armored cruiser , the flagship. The ships were attached to the I Squadron of the Active Fleet. A <b>second</b> <b>subdivision,</b> composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers {{was attached to the}} II Squadron. In April 1909, Hamburg was cruising in the Mediterranean. On 21 April, she was dispatched from Corfu to Mersin, where rioting threatened German interests. She was joined there the following day by several British and French warships, including the battleship [...] By 1912, she was withdrawn from front-line service for use as the second command flagship for the I U-boat Flotilla. After the outbreak of World War I, she rejoined the fleet, but continued in her role as the I Flotilla flagship. On 6 August, she and the cruiser [...] escorted a flotilla of U-boats into the North Sea in an attempt to draw out the British fleet, which could then be attacked by the U-boats. The force returned to port on 11 August, without having encountered any British warships.|$|E

2500|$|In Hebrew, {{the word}} נָבִיא (nāvî), [...] "spokesperson", {{traditionally}} translates as [...] "prophet". The <b>second</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the Hebrew Bible, TaNaKh (for [...] "Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim"), {{is devoted to}} the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of navi is perhaps described in Deuteronomy 18:18, where God said, [...] "...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." [...] Thus, the navi was thought to be the [...] "mouth" [...] of God. The root nun-bet-alef ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself [...] "open". Cf. Rashbam's comment to Genesis 20:7.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1719 and 1996, the {{province}} was subdivided in two administrative counties (län), Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County, each under a governor (landshövding) {{appointed by the}} central government of Sweden. When the first local government acts took effect in 1863, each county also got an elected county council (landsting). The counties were further divided into municipalities. The local government reform of 1952 {{reduced the number of}} municipalities, and a <b>second</b> <b>subdivision</b> reform, carried out between 1968 and 1974, established today's 33 municipalities (...) in Scania. The municipalities have municipal governments, similar to city commissions, and are further divided into parishes (församlingar). The parishes are primarily entities of the Church of Sweden, but they also serve as a divisioning measure for the Swedish population registration and other statistical uses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{work done}} in the <b>second</b> <b>subdivision</b> is of the {{greatest}} importance for questions of history, canon law, and general and medieval culture. The all-pervading activity of the medieval popes has been richly illustrated by various investigators, e. g. Göller on {{the records of the}} [...] "Pœnitentiaria"; Kirsch and Baumgarten on the finances (officials, administration) of the College of Cardinals; Baumgarten on the respective offices of the vice-chancellor and the [...] "Bullatores", the residence-quarters of the Curia, its Cursores or messengers; Watzl, Göller, and Schäfer on the finance bureau of the Curia; von Ottenthal on the secretaries and the [...] "Chancery rules"; Tangl and Erler respectively on the [...] "Chancery regulations" [...] and the [...] "Liber Cancellariæ"; Kehr, Berlière, and Rieder on the petition files (libelli supplices), etc. The student will find quite helpful illustration of these delicate labours in the remarkable editions of the [...] "Liber Pontificalis" [...] by Duchesne; the [...] "Liber Censuum" [...] by Duchesne-Fabre; the [...] "Italia Pontificia" [...] by Kehr; the [...] "Hierarchia Catholica Medii Ævi" [...] by Eubel; the [...] "Catalogue of Cardinals" [...] by Cristofori; the [...] "Acts of the Council of Trent", by Ehses, Merkle, and Buschbell, not to speak of numerous other valuable works. As to the third subdivision, i. e. the purely political, or politico-ecclesiastical activities of the popes, no clearly defined distinction can be made, either in the Middle Ages or in more modern times, between these activities and the exercise of purely ecclesiastical authority; their numerous manifestations may be studied in the publications briefly described above. Abundant information {{is to be found in}} the publications of the papal [...] "Regesta" [...] and the [...] "Camera" [...] or treasury, records. We learn from them many curious items of profane history, e. g. the population of various kingdoms, grants of tithes to kings and rulers for political purposes, etc. The nunciature reports are rich in this information.|$|E
