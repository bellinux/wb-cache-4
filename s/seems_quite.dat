25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} at Rome, {{although}} he never {{rose to a}} position of real independence, and had always a hard and close struggle with poverty, he seems to have known everybody, especially every one of any eminence at the bar or in literature (friend to all). In addition to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his manifold friends or more intimate acquaintances Silius Italicus, Juvenal, the younger Pliny; and there were many others of high position whose society and patronage he relished. The silence which he and Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having common friends and treating often of the same subjects, maintain in regard to one another may (nay must certainly) be explained by mutual dislike or want of sympathy or healthy rivalry or simple disgust. Martial in many places shows an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which Statius's reputation chiefly rests; and it <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> natural in the mind of an eminent litteraturist that the respectable author of the Thebaid and the Silvae should feel little admiration, nay perhaps even outright contempt, for either the life or the works of the populist and unsophisticated bohemian epigrammatist.|$|E

500|$|According to a {{reviewer}} at California Newsreel, [...] "Few musical {{groups have}} expressed so eloquently or consistently {{the aspirations of}} their people as the Malagasy septet Mahaleo."

[...] A Radio France Internationale journalist asserts, [...] "In the highlands of Madagascar, building a bonfire without playing or singing Mahaleo <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> simply inconceivable, so strongly has this group's musical repertoire taken hold in Malagasy people's hearts." ...|$|E

The Moscow premiere was held on 7 March 1934, after which the film was released in London as The Tsar Wants to Sleep and in Paris as Le Lieutenant Nantes. Prokofiev did not rate the film highly, although he was pleased with his music. After the New York release in December 1934, the critic for The New York Times described the film as [...] "calculated to entertain lovers of detail and genuine atmosphere in semi-historical films. Even the introduction of a little slapstick comedy <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> in keeping with the Russian tradition." [...] Prokofiev's contribution to the film is not acknowledged in this review.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs for}} Spiritual Machines were written and {{partially}} recorded during {{a year in}} which the band was doing extensive touring of Canada, the United States, and Europe. According to lead singer Maida, the live stage-context inspired the band to [...] "keep it really basic and not try to add too many textures... to not overdo it." [...] and giving the technically inclined record an ironically acoustic feel at times. According to Maida, half of the record was completed before the book and its ideas even entered the equation. During an interview in late 2001, he stated, [...] "... even though it <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> intrinsic to the record, really, it only represents about four or five songs." [...] While the lyrics of several songs were inspired by the futuristic theories of Kurzweil, they were also written as a response to them, saying that the human spirit would always prevail. [...] "Lyrically, this album is about finding the spirituality within ourselves." [...] This is the case with the opening song, [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)", which Raine said, [...] ".. not an 'f-you' to Kurzweil. It's like 'I believe [...] what you're saying, but we're going to fight it as well because there is a soul and there is a spirit.'" [...] Following [...] "Mafia" [...] is the song [...] "In Repair", which muses on how the human body can be [...] "repaired," [...] whether through heart surgery or after an accident. This song is countered by the following track, [...] "Life" [...] which, explained Maida, [...] "recognizes the pain our minds can experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|During this process, RNA and DNA primers are removed, {{allowing}} the Okazaki fragments to {{attach to the}} lagging DNA strand. While this process <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> simple and repetitive, defects in Okazaki fragment maturation can cause DNA strand breakage which can cause varying forms of [...] "chromosome aberrations". Severe defects of Okazaki fragment maturation may halt DNA replication and induce cell death. However, while subtle defects do not affect growth, they do result in future varying forms of genome instabilities. Based on the dangers associated with a failure in the DNA process, Okazaki fragments maintain our evolutionary development.|$|E

2500|$|Most asteroids {{outside the}} [...] "big four" [...] (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) {{are likely to}} be broadly similar in appearance, if {{irregular}} in shape. 50-km (31-mi) 253 Mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroid's radius, and Earth-based observations of 300-km (186-mi) 511 Davida, one of the largest asteroids after the big four, reveal a similarly angular profile, suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters. Medium-sized asteroids such as Mathilde and 243 Ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface. Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid. Ceres <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will be expanded with the Dawn spacecraft, which entered Ceres orbit on 6 March 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The {{executive}} producer of Neighbours, Richard Jasek, teased the crash storyline during a July 2012 interview with Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly. Jasek stated that the show had [...] "a dramatic storyline coming up", which would have consequences that last {{for the rest of}} the year. He told Kilkelly, [...] "All I can say is 'the gang shouldn't have gone out that night…'" [...] A writer for Channel 5's Neighbours website later revealed that the storyline would highlight [...] "two of the major causes of road fatalities and injuries among young Australian drivers – distraction and overloading cars." [...] Jasek told the writer that when the team were plotting the story, they were surprised to learn how common it is for younger drivers to be persuaded into allowing more passengers in the car than legally allowed and how easily they are distracted. In the show's storyline it is peer pressure that decides the character's fate. Jasek explained [...] "Ironically the character who is driving is the most responsible of all our teens but succumbs to pressure to allow one too many passengers. It is one of those decisions that at the time <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> harmless because they're not traveling very far but like real life situations, distance has nothing to do with it." ...|$|E

[...] He believes both ships drifted southwards, {{with at least two}} crew remaining until the final destruction of their vessels. One broke up, but Inuit hunters arriving at their summer hunting grounds reported discovering another ship floating in fresh ice in a cove."They're not very strong on location or date," [...] Grenier said. [...] "They have all the space and time in the world, but what they reported <b>seems</b> <b>quite</b> clear."The ship, probably the Terror, was very neat and orderly, but the Inuit descended into the darkness of the hull with their seal-oil lamps, where they found a tall dead man in an inner cabin. [...] Grenier believes it was there they recovered the copper, which was more valuable than gold to them, and tools including shears from the ship's workshop with which to work it. [...] Hauntingly, they also reported that one of the masts was on fire. Grenier wonders if what they saw was the funnel from the galley still smoking from a meal cooked that morning, before the last of Franklin's men disappeared from history.|$|E
