Revealing that <b>subclones</b> are not rare in B-cell lymphoma cell lines, 6 / 49 IG hypermutated cell lines (12 %) consisted of <b>subclones</b> with individual IG mutations. <b>Subclones</b> were also identified in 2 / 284 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines exhibiting bimodal CD marker expression. We successfully isolated 10 <b>subclones</b> from four cell lines (HG 3, SU-DHL- 5, TMD- 8, U- 2932).

40|$|Immunoglobulin {{repertoire}} sequencing {{has successfully}} {{been applied to}} identify expanded antigen-activated B-cell clones that {{play a role in}} the pathogenesis of immune disorders. One challenge is the selection of the Ag-specific B cells from the measured repertoire for downstream analyses. A general feature of an immune response is the expansion of specific clones resulting in a set of <b>subclones</b> with common ancestry varying in abundance and in the number of acquired somatic mutations. The expanded <b>subclones</b> are expected to have BCR affinities for the Ag higher than the affinities of the naive B cells in the background population. For these reasons, several groups successfully proceeded or suggested selecting highly abundant <b>subclones</b> from the repertoire to obtain the Ag-specific B cells. Given the nature of affinity maturation one would expect that abundant <b>subclones</b> are of high affinity but since repertoire sequencing only provides information about abundancies, this can only be verified with additional experiments, which are very labor intensive. Moreover, this would also require knowledge of the Ag, which is often not available for clinical samples. Consequently, in general we do not know if the selected highly abundant <b>subclone(s)</b> are also the high(est) affinity <b>subclones.</b> Such knowledge would likely improve the selection of relevant <b>subclones</b> for further characterization and Ag screening. Therefore, to gain insight in the relation between <b>subclone</b> abundancy and affinity, we developed a computational model that simulates affinity maturation in a single GC while tracking individual <b>subclones</b> in terms of abundancy and affinity. We show that the model correctly captures the overall GC dynamics, and that the amount of expansion is qualitatively comparable to expansion observed from B cells isolated from human lymph nodes. Analysis of the fraction of high- and low-affinity <b>subclones</b> among the unexpanded and expanded <b>subclones</b> reveals a limited correlation between abundancy and affinity and shows that the low abundant <b>subclones</b> are of highest affinity. Thus, our model suggests that selecting highly abundant <b>subclones</b> from repertoire sequencing experiments would not always lead to the high(est) affinity B cells. Consequently, additional or alternative selection approaches need to be applie...|$|R
