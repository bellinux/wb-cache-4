40|$|Three-dimensional {{characteristics}} of the mean velocity and turbulence structure in the annulus-wall region of a moderately loaded compressor rotor have been investigated experimentally by employing triaxial hot-wire probes. Results are presented which indicate that the flow within and downstream of the rotor passage is highly complex due to {{the interaction of the}} annulus-wall boundary layer, blade boundary layers, tip leakage flow, and passage secondary flow. An understanding of the reported viscous flow interactions is important for establishing improved aerodynamic design criteria and efficiency, for predicting noise levels, and for determining the stall, <b>surge,</b> <b>vibration,</b> and flutter {{characteristics of}} turbomachinery...|$|E
50|$|During {{conventional}} flight, {{the lift}} engines would be inactive; shortly prior to entering vertical flight, compressed air {{provided by the}} single cruise engine {{would be used to}} accelerate the startup of the lift engines. Considerable attention was paid during development to the design of the air intake for the engines, while involved a set of 7 variable hinged grills which open in a forward-facing position to increase airflow to the lift engines; flow into the engines had to be relatively consistent and stable to avoid issues such as engine <b>surges</b> and <b>vibration.</b> Initially, the series of scuttles were fitted to the exit nozzles of the lift engines to maintain a low-pressure environment beneath the engines and ensure that that the turbine blades rotated in the correct direction; due to the effectiveness of the intake and engine refinements, the scuttles became unnecessary.|$|R
40|$|During regular operation, power {{transformer}} windings are continuously exposed to electromechanical stresses and <b>vibrations.</b> <b>Surges</b> during lightning or short circuits may cause {{the weakening of}} the mechanical structure and the mechanical reinforcing parts of the core and windings. Any distortion of the projected geometry of the winding will reduce its ability to withstand subsequent overstressing, {{which can lead to}} a large deformation of the windings and major system faults. This paper presents an analysis of the frequency response of the transformer windings (Sweep Frequency Response Analysis - SFRA) as a method of determining the integrity of the core and winding geometry. The paper presents the results obtained experimentally and those from field tests on real transformers...|$|R
40|$|Strain-gage {{measurements}} were taken under operating conditions from blades of {{various stages of}} the 19 XB axial-flow compressor {{in an effort to}} determine the reason for failures in the seventh and tenth stages. First bending-mode vibrations were detected in the first five stages of the compressor caused by each integral multiple of rotor speed from three through ten. Lead-wire failures in the last five stages resulted in incomplete data. The dynamic-vibration frequencies at various rotor speeds were compared with statically measured frequencies analytically corrected for the influence of centrifugal force. Large increases in vibration ani~litude with increased pressure ratio were observed. During <b>surging</b> operation, blade <b>vibrations</b> were not present. The effects of pressure ratio and surge indicate the existence of aerodynamic excitation as the cause of the blade vibrations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:With the {{improvement}} of the load and speed of belt conveyor, the dynamic characteristic problem of belt conveyer appears especially outstanding. This paper analyzed the force situation of the conveyer by the discrete dynamics model, divided n viscoelastic properties mass units in advance, then built system analysis dynamics model by vibration mechanics, built modal neutral file of the flexible belt block by means of finite element analysis software, and built the virtual prototype model of the belt conveyor using ADMAS program. It analyzed the effect of stiffness and damping of belt on the starting process by dynamic characteristics simulation method. The simulation results showed that the speed wave period of belt with the smaller stiffness was longer and the peak was bigger, the belt speed easily occurred stronger <b>surge,</b> the transverse <b>vibration</b> of belt conveyor became more violent. With the increasing of stiffness, the belt speed wave peak value decreased. As the same time, the speed surge also decreased when other operation parameters of the belt conveyer system are fixed, with increasing of the damping, the dynamic tension force peak became smaller gradually, it led to decrease of vibration curve peak. Damping coefficient played the important role in decreasing the vibration intensity, the research result offers a new basis for the analysis and study of the dynamic characteristics of belt conveyor...|$|R
25|$|The {{builders}} {{had tested}} the hull form {{in their own}} tank, and hoped to attain a speed of 20 knots (37.04km/h) with the turbine machinery. On 14 June the first steam trial was supervised personally by C. A. Parsons and John Williamson, then on 17 June during manoeuvring trials in calm weather the mean speed of two runs over the measured mile at Skelmorlie was 18.66 knots (34.56km/h). After full hull cleaning at Scott's of Greenock a further series of trials took place on 24 June: in seven return runs over the mile, the best mean speed attained was 19.7 knots (36.48km/h). On {{the next day at}} the Pointhouse yard of A. & J. Inglis the central propeller of 4ft (1.22 m) diameter was exchanged for one of 4ft 9inches (1.45 m) diameter, and the outer propellers of 2ft 10inches (0.86 m) diameter were exchanged for propellers 3ft 4inches (1.02 m) diameter. Trials on 26 June with smooth sea conditions and a light breeze achieved a mean of 20.48 knots (37.93km/h) and a fastest single run at 20.57 knots (38.1km/h). At the official trial on 28 June, invited guests came aboard off Craigendoran, and the ship then sailed to Campbeltown with intermediate visits to Dunoon, Rothesay, Largs, Fairlie and Lochranza, where Duchess of Hamilton waited with a special party of members of the Institute of Naval Architects. The two ships raced down Kilbrannan Sound and King Edward passed the paddle steamer without difficulty. A dinner in the after saloon was presided over by Peter Denny, who with other speakers commented on the speed and smoothness of the turbine steamer, in contrast to the rhythmic <b>surging</b> motion and <b>vibration</b> associated with all paddle steamers.|$|R
