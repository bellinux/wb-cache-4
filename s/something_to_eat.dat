5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
25|$|Qazi {{climbed back}} into his vehicle and drove to a nearby park. After 90 minutes of waiting, he {{realized}} that he was not being actively sought and drove back to his Reston apartment. He hid the rifle in a green plastic bag under a sofa, went to a McDonald's for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and booked into a Days Inn for the night. He learned from CNN news reports that police had misidentified his vehicle and did not have his license plate number. The next morning, he took a flight to Quetta, Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not only}} the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The {{greatest}} suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed... The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts had dried up from hunger... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.|$|E
25|$|A boastful donkey {{refuses to}} behave or obey {{the orders of}} its masters. Having {{a mind of its}} own, it leaves {{whatever}} master it has and manages to wander through Judea. Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
6000|$|When Mrs Null had gone, {{promising}} to send Aunt Patsy <b>something</b> nice <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> {{the old woman}} turned to her great-grand-daughter, and said, [...] "Did anybody come wid her?" ...|$|R

500|$|With {{the rapid}} advance, [...] "disorganization and {{improvisation}} {{in the medical}} service are inevitable," [...] with clearing stations lacking [...] "the most elementary comforts." [...] These problems were multiplied by the huge numbers of prisoners, among whom many became ill with Spanish Flu. In a hospital located in a convent in Haifa about 3,000 sick were treated. [...] "It is {{the survival of the}} fittest, if one is able to be up & about there is a chance of getting <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> but if stretcher case, you get no attention whatever, the staff can't cope with the numbers." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{automobiles}} made it {{much easier}} for black Americans to be independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the National Urban League puts it, [...] "so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers." [...] Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations. To avoid such problems on long trips, African Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars. Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the Washington Post recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family would have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> along the way the next day.|$|E
2500|$|... "It was {{so crowded}} {{that there was}} even no way of {{entering}} it. We went to a canteen to have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> when there was suddenly a big blast. Everyone panicked, running to all directions. Many of them were blocked at {{the gate of the}} park. Dead bodies can be found everywhere." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{thought he}} began to look thinner and discouraged. Her heart ached <b>to</b> add <b>something</b> good <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>to</b> his meagre purchase, but her courage failed at the act. She did not dare affront him. She knew the pride of artists.|$|R
6000|$|The youngster took a {{long time}} in getting on with it. He said, [...] "Red sent me in for <b>something</b> good <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> but I don't exactly know what he meant. I didn't like to say so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what is the}} law? It don't forbid us {{to shelter}} those poor creatures a night, does it, and <b>to</b> give 'em <b>something</b> {{comfortable}} <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and a few old clothes, and send them quietly about their business?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{the most}} visible Berlin Wall checkpoint, Checkpoint Charlie is {{frequently}} featured in spy movies and books. A famous cafe and viewing place for Allied officials, armed forces and visitors alike, [...] ("Eagle Café"), is situated right on the checkpoint. It was an excellent viewing point to look into East Berlin while having <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and drink.|$|E
2500|$|Then Mendoza, the chaplain, asked Menéndez {{to spare}} {{the lives of those}} who should prove to be [...] "Christians." [...] Ten Roman Catholics were found, who, but for the intercession of the priest, would have been killed along with the heretics. These were sent by boat to St Augustine. The {{remainder}} confessed that they were Protestants. They were given <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and drink, and then ordered to set out on the march.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with NBC's Tim Russert on May 4, 2008, Obama said, [...] "...we've got a serious food problem around the world. We've got rising food prices here in the United States." [...] "There's no doubt that biofuels may be contributing to it. And what I've said is, my top priority {{is making sure that}} people are able to get enough to eat. And {{if it turns out that}} we've got to make changes in our ethanol policy to help people get <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> then that's got to be the step we take." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was all {{the fault}} of the jackal,' replied the rabbit; 'he tied me up like this, and told me he would give me <b>something</b> nice <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> It was all a trick just to get at our water.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But for {{a little}} she made no answer, putting down her empty cup and yearning over the table as for <b>something</b> more <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Suddenly she raised her head and broke out with vehemence: [...] "I will, I will, I will!" ...|$|R
60|$|With more {{vegetables}} displayed {{close in}} front of them, the two billy goats mounted the fire-escape quite nimbly, being rewarded with <b>something</b> more <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> when they stood on the landing {{in front of}} the door leading into the upper hallway.|$|R
2500|$|Hitler {{called his}} {{political}} party [...] "National Socialist", {{but he was}} clear {{to point out that}} his interpretation of socialism [...] "has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism," [...] saying that [...] "Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not." [...] At a later time, Hitler said: [...] "Socialism! That is an unfortunate word altogether... What does socialism really mean? If people have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and their pleasures, then they have their socialism." [...] He also expressed a wish that he had called his party [...] "social revolutionary" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|While {{assigned}} to General Forrest's command the battery {{had been given}} the nickname, the [...] "Arkansas Rats". Following the success at Johnsonville, General Forrest announced that he was re-baptizing the unit as the [...] "Arkansas Braves". [...] One sergeant listening to the General's complements allegedly respoinded [...] " [...] General, talking may be very good, but <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> would be a heap better: we have been living on wind for two days." [...] Generla Forrest responded by providing the battery with a feast of ham and hard tack from the stores of his own headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|One {{evening in}} early February, Powell (using the alias [...] "Mr. Wood") {{appeared}} at Mary Surratt's boarding house 604 H Street in Washington, D.C. [...] Mary was John's mother, {{and she had}} taken up residence in the boarding house {{in the fall of}} 1864 after renting out her tavern in Surrattsville (now Clinton), Maryland, to former D.C. police officer John M. Lloyd. Powell asked for John Surratt, who was not at home. He then requested <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and a place to stay, and Mrs. Surratt granted both requests after her son returned home and vouched for [...] "Mr. Wood". Powell told Louis Weichmann, who was a boarder in the house, that [...] "Wood" [...] was a clerk in Parr's china shop in Baltimore. Powell left the next day.|$|E

6000|$|... "We may {{hit upon}} something," [...] Andrew said cheerfully. [...] "What {{are you doing}} for lunch? Will you come round to the 'Travellers' with me? It's the only London club I've kept going, but I dare say we can get <b>something</b> fit <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jonathan," [...] said Mrs. Eagle, coldly, [...] "do not reproach our {{offspring}} {{for their}} hunger.

2500|$|Clarissa {{takes her}} off for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and, {{momentarily}} alone, Jeremy starts {{to investigate a}} desk in the room, quickly looking through the drawers until he is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Miss Mildred Peake, a big hearty country woman who lives in a cottage on the estate and acts as gardener. Having delivered her message for Clarissa she leaves and Pippa reappears eating a bun and carrying a book she has bought which she mysteriously describes as a [...] "recipe book" [...] although it strangely speaks of candles. Asked by Jeremy if she likes living at Copplestone Court, Pippa enthuses over the house and shows Jeremy a hidden door {{at the back of the}} room which leads to a small recess. This in turn has another hidden door at the back which leads to the library.|$|E
2500|$|As king, Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana soon showed {{himself to}} be {{stubborn}} and lacking in common sense. Several years into his rule, popular dissatisfaction was widespread. A widely respected political adviser and elder of the noble class named Andriamampandry {{took it upon himself}} to examine both brothers and rally the people to support a change in leadership. Andriamampandry visited the king and requested <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> but Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana claimed not to have anything available to share on that day. Before leaving, Andriamampandry asked the king, [...] "How many hearts do you have?", to which the king replied that he had only one heart. Andriamampandry then visited prince Andrianjakanavalondambo, who acknowledged that it should normally be the king's right to enjoy the honor of showing hospitality to Andriamampandry, but offered to share his meal with the elder nonetheless. Afterward, Andriamampandry asked the prince how many hearts he had, to which the prince replied that he had two.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next morning}} Dorothy and Billina wash ashore to an unknown region. Once on dry land, Dorothy picks <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> from a lunch-box tree. She guesses {{that they are}} in a [...] "fairy country" [...] because lunch boxes do not grow on trees in {{ordinary}} countries, and only in a fairy country would an animal like Billina be able to talk. However, Dorothy knows they are not in the Land of Oz because that country has no coastline. After the meal they come across a message inscribed in the sand: [...] "BEWARE THE WHEELERS"! Soon they meet these gaudily dressed, loud-yelling baddies who have wheels instead of hands and feet, and roll around on all fours. Dorothy and Billina climb a small rocky mountain to escape them and find a door carved into its side. Having found the key by the door, they open it and find Tik-Tok, a round copper mechanical man whom they activate by winding up all three of his clockwork motors (one each for thinking, motion and speech) with the key like a wind-up toy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he ejaculated, [...] "if you {{can raise}} steam {{on that kind}} of truck, I most {{certainly}} can't. The first of the boys who drives by to the settlement is going to bring us out <b>something</b> fit <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> if I have to pay for it." ...|$|R
60|$|Since he {{had been}} a prisoner, Chatterer had learned to think very {{differently}} of Farmer Brown's boy from what he used to think. In fact, he and Farmer Brown's boy had become very good friends, for Farmer Brown's boy was always very gentle, and always brought him <b>something</b> good <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you," [...] said Dorothy. [...] "It's lucky {{we started}} you first, for I'm hungry, {{and you can}} be cooking <b>something</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> while we match the other folks together." ...|$|R
