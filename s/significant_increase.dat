In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Baird {{was given}} {{additional}} responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8, 2001.

40|$|Using a radial {{immunodiffusion}} technique {{the levels}} of four serum pro-teins, albumin, transferrin, slow =a-globulinand =g-globulin, were measured in normal rats {{to determine the effects}} on these proteins of age, sex, preg-nancy and of the administration of oestrogen (mestranol) and progestogen(ethynodiol diacetate). <b>Significant</b> <b>increases</b> in albumin, slow =a-globulin and =g-globulin were found with increasing age, and highly significant differences in albumin and slow =a-globulin occurred between male and female rats. During pregnancy <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> in slow =a-globulin and transferrin were found but albumin and =g-globulin concentrations fell. Oestrogen administration resulted in <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> in slow =a-globulin and transferrin, but albumin and =g-globulin were unaltered.

Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E
5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E
