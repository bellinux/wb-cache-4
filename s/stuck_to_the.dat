5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination (rapid shuffling steps and a forward-flexed posture when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plan and signed an oath that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. Saddled with a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative agenda, and <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the Democrats in the summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E

25|$|The ET model range <b>stuck</b> true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wasp/aero design principles. It was lighter, more aerodynamic, had an {{automatic}} gearbox and {{could take a}} series of engines from a 50cc in either two-stroke or four-stroke, up to a 150cc four stroke.|$|R
5|$|Here, Lenin revived his polemics {{against the}} Mensheviks, who objected to his {{advocacy}} of violent expropriations and thefts {{such as the}} 1907 Tiflis bank robbery, which the Bolsheviks were using to fund their activities. Lenin also became heavily critical of Bogdanov and his supporters; Bogdanov believed that a socialist-oriented culture had to be developed among Russia's proletariat for them to become a successful revolutionary vehicle, whereas Lenin favoured a vanguard of socialist intelligentsia who could lead the working-classes in revolution. Furthermore, Bogdanov– influenced by Ernest Mach– believed that all concepts of the world were relative, whereas Lenin <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orthodox Marxist view {{that there was an}} objective reality to the world, independent of human observation. Although Bogdanov and Lenin went on a holiday together to Gorky's villa in Capri, Italy, in April 1908, on returning to Paris, Lenin encouraged a split within the Bolshevik faction between his and Bogdanov's followers, accusing the latter of deviating from Marxism.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a sit-down {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E

25|$|After the Empire {{fell and}} the Republic was {{established}} in 1824, a Federation name form was adopted; which was, at most times, more de jure than de facto.

25|$|Like Einstein's {{theory of}} the Photoelectric effect, Bohr's formula assumes that during a quantum jump a {{discrete}} amount of energy is radiated. However, unlike Einstein, Bohr <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> classical Maxwell {{theory of the}} electromagnetic field. Quantization of the electromagnetic field was explained by the discreteness of the atomic energy levels; Bohr {{did not believe in}} the existence of photons.|$|E

2500|$|In retirement, Lavelle <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> his position. <b>The</b> strikes {{were within}} {{the rules of}} {{engagement}} because the air defense radars were constantly activated against his aircraft.

25|$|Retention factor (kappa prime) {{measures}} {{how long}} {{a component of the}} mixture <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a chromatogram (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time). Each chromatogram peak will have its own retention factor (e.g. kappa1 for the retention factor of the first peak). This factor may be corrected for by the void volume of the column.|$|E
25|$|Upon Harroun's {{declared}} victory, second-place finisher Mulford supposedly protested, contending he had lapped Harroun {{when the}} Marmon limped {{in on the}} torn tire, an argument appearing plausible to some, due to an accident disrupting the official timing and scoring stand at nearly the same time. However, race officials were quick to note Mulford's subsequent pit stop forced the Lozier crew to spend several minutes themselves changing a tire which <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wheel hub; Mulford's protest was thus denied.|$|E

Universal Gravitation veered away from the [...] "Nintendo" [...] design; but for DS, Artoon <b>stuck</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original concept.|$|R
25|$|Wellington's {{government}} fell in 1830. In {{the summer}} and autumn of that year, a wave of riots swept the country. The Whigs {{had been out of}} power for most years since the 1770s, and saw political reform in response to the unrest as the key to their return. Wellington <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tory policy of no reform and no expansion of suffrage, and as a result lost a vote of no confidence on 15 November 1830.|$|E
25|$|Baby mice, called pinkies or pups, {{are born}} blind, naked, and deaf. Their {{eyes are closed}} and their ears are <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sides of their heads. Mothers may eat any dead or sickly offspring. Pups begin to grow hair at two to four days. Ears open at three to five days, and the pups will start vocalizing. Eyes open at 14 days, and the babies will start {{exploring}} the world around them. At three weeks old they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At four weeks the males in the litter should be separated out so as to not cause the mother and sisters to become pregnant, while the females can be left in with the mother.|$|E
25|$|Ben Wilson (born 1963) is an English {{wood carver}} and {{outsider}} artist. The {{son of an}} artist, Wilson {{grew up in a}} creative environment and attended art school. His distaste for industrial waste, cars and rubbish eventually turned into an art form. He creates tiny works of art by painting chewing gum <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pavement. Initially, his work garnered him unwanted attention from the authorities, but because he is not defacing private property but merely painting rubbish, he was found to be breaking no law. In addition to the chewing gum art, Wilson paints and sculpts. He has exhibited his paintings and sculptures in England, the United States, Germany, Ireland, Finland, France and Serbia.|$|E

25|$|United States v. Rock Royal Cooperative, Inc., – This {{was one of}} {{the first}} cases in which Reed wrote the {{majority}} opinion. The case was especially important to Reed because of his prior career as an attorney for agricultural cooperatives (Rock Royal was a milk producers co-op). Reed <b>stuck</b> closely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> facts in the case, quoting at length from the statute, regulations and agency order.|$|R
25|$|Observations of {{variations}} in {{animals and plants}} {{formed the basis of}} the theory of natural selection. For example, Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a close relationship that allows the pollination of the plants. He noted that orchids have a variety of structures that attract insects, so that pollen from the flowers gets <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> insects' bodies. In this way, insects transport the pollen from a male to a female orchid. In spite of the elaborate appearance of orchids, these specialised parts are made from the same basic structures that make up other flowers. In his book, Fertilisation of Orchids (1862), Darwin proposed that the orchid flowers were adapted from pre-existing parts, through natural selection.|$|E
25|$|The other {{important}} figure is Uehara Naohiko, a radio personality and songwriter of the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation. Around 1970, he visited Amami Ōshima and was taught the name shima-uta by local singers. He <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mixed writing (島うた). He {{claimed that the}} name {{had been used in}} Okinawa too, but Takahashi found no evidence to support his claim. His notion of shima-uta was drastically different from that of academics: he applied the term not only to traditional folk songs but to shin min'yō (contemporary folk music) and even to pop music. He used his radio programs and musical events to popularize the name shima-uta in Okinawa. Uehara was different from Nakasone in that he engaged in transforming folk songs into popular music.|$|E
25|$|India was on {{the charge}} from the {{beginning}} of their innings when debutante Yusuf Pathan started aggressively by hitting one four and one six. But {{he was the first to}} fall for 15 runs at 25/1 at over 2.4. Then Indian scoring rate was going down. Robin Uthappa(8 run from 11 ball), Yuvraj Singh(14 run from 19 ball), MS Dhoni(6 run from 10 ball) all departed soon and while Gambhir was <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other end. His 75 from 56 hit 8 four and 2 six and Rohit Sharma's 30 not out of 16 hit 2 four and one six at last stage took India to 157–5 in 20 overs. Umar Gul took 3–28 to be the best performer for Pakistan.Mohammad Asif and Sohail Tanvir take one wicket each.|$|E
50|$|From was the {{starting}} goalkeeper as Denmark won silver medals at the 1960 Olympic football tournament.

50|$|Fantagraphics chose <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> artwork computer-recolored, {{using the}} {{original}} comics as color guides, rather than reprinting {{with the original}} off-register colors {{as they have in}} many of their other archival projects. Colorist Rich Tommaso has <b>stuck</b> closely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original colors, although muting the originally garish ones somewhat in a concession to modern readers. Sometimes the colors were changed when it was known that Barks hadn't liked them, or when it was felt they could be corrected or improved.|$|R
50|$|Discrete lipid domains {{with differing}} composition, and thus {{membrane}} fluidity, can coexist in model lipid membranes; {{this can be}} observed using fluorescence microscopy. The biological analogue, 'lipid raft', is hypothesized to exist in cell membranes and perform biological functions. Also, a narrow annular lipid shell of membrane lipids in contact with integral membrane proteins have low fluidity compared to bulk lipids in biological membranes, as these lipid molecules stay <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> surface of <b>the</b> protein macromolecules.|$|R
