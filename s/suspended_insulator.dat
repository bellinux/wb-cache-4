50|$|The {{transmission}} line from Newcastle, which operated at 33,000 volts, was becoming overloaded and in about 1946 the Railways decided {{to raise the}} voltage to 66,000 volts. This would enable four times the power to be transmitted. This was firstly done by adding two more insulator discs to the <b>suspended</b> <b>insulators</b> of the line, a pole at a time. Naturally the line had to be deadened {{for this to be}} done. To keep disruption to a minimum this work was carried out on a Sunday.|$|R

40|$|Along three transects {{of medium}} voltage power {{lines in the}} steppe of Central Kazakhstan, surveys for bird {{casualties}} were carried out in summer 2006 in order to estimate the quantitative and qualitative impact of power lines on bird mortality in this area. In total, 409 dead birds of 34 different species were found. Raptors represented 44 % of the total (179 individuals, 10 species). Most of them died due to elec trocution. The proportion of raptors strongly varied between early and late summer, the increase in August suggests that especially young birds are prone to electrocution. The den sity of raptor casualties varied from 0. 1 to 7. 6 birds per line km and month. Adverse effects of power lines on bird life could be avoided by changing the pole construction (use of <b>suspended</b> <b>insulators)</b> or protective measures (e. g. caps) ...|$|R

But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of {{telegraph}} wires against the sky line, across the top of the viaduct, for the first time.

5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are <b>suspended</b> on V-shaped <b>insulators.</b> The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrostatic}} deflector in the Chalk River super-conducting cyclotron is in a dee, {{and has a}} single, fixed deflector electrode <b>suspended</b> {{from two}} <b>insulators</b> located above the midplane. One of them contains a high-voltage cable and a series water resistor to limit energy available to a spark and to isolate the high-voltage cable and dc power supply from rf pickup. The other insulator is a conventional cylindrical post. The insulators have been changed from the original design to make them less prone to thermal damage from rf heating. Details are given of the water system electrical performance and of insulator modifications and performance. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} hopping {{conduction}} in a composite made of straight metallic nanowires randomly and isotropically <b>suspended</b> in an <b>insulator.</b> Uncontrolled donors and acceptors in the insulator lead to random charging of wires and hence finite bare {{density of states}} at the Fermi level. Then the Coulomb interactions between electrons of distant wires result in the soft Coulomb gap. At low temperatures the conductivity is due to variable range hopping of electrons between wires and obeys the Efros-Shklovskii (ES) law σ∝ -(T_ES/T) ^ 1 / 2. We show that T_ES∝ 1 /(nL^ 3) ^ 2, where n is the concentration of wires and L is the wire length. Due to enhanced screening of Coulomb potentials, at large enough nL^ 3, the ES law is replaced by the Mott law. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Sandstorm has {{influence}} on the the electrical properties of outdoor insulator, and {{the analysis of the}} electric field characteristics of insulator under sandstorm condition is very important. The electrostatic field finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the electric field distribution along long rod insulator under sandstorm condition with FEM software after calculating the one under clean condition. The results of calculation show that the sand deposition decreases the electric field strength of insulator covered with sand, and increases the field strength of the corresponding shed key points. The electric field strength of the non-sand region will increase, when the non-sand region appears in sand layer on <b>insulator.</b> <b>Suspended</b> sand particles in the ambient air can distort the electric field distribution along insulator, and which is significantly affected by the size, the quantity, the charge-to-mass ratio and the charge polarity of sand particles. </p...|$|R
40|$|Overhead ground wires (GW) {{of extra}} high voltage (EHV) power {{transmission}} lines, apart from lightning-induced overvoltage protection are frequently used for carrier-current communication. In {{this case the}} ground wires are <b>suspended</b> on <b>insulators,</b> the dielectric strength of which should be sufficient for the line operational conditions. The insulation level is defined from {{the condition of the}} single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault, thus insulator protecting spark gaps should not be flashed-over during such conditions - in order to maintain continuity of the communication channel along the line. Overvoltages during such faults depend on many parameters such as fault place, fault angle, pre-fault load etc. Therefore, designers should investigate the problem for determination of the worst-case scenario. In this paper, dependence of the overvoltages on 750 kV power transmission line ground wires upon the SLG fault place and pre-fault load of the line in transient and steady states is investigated. The analysis was performed by using dynamic are model incorporated into the EMTP program. The provided simulations show that adequately introduced primary and secondary are models are decisive factors for an accurate simulation of the electromagnetic phenomena in the EHV transmission lines during an are crossing-over there the primary are plays an important role) and during so called dead-time, when the secondary are takes place. This paper gives some recommendations for the insulator strings coordination in the 750 kV earth wires on the basis of computer simulation results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.

50|$|Brunel {{was quick}} to see the {{possible}} advantages of the early electric telegraph system for use in running the railway. In 1838 he persuaded Sir Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke to install their five-needle telegraph system between Paddington Station and West Drayton and to carry out experiments. It proved to be useful, so the viaduct thus carried the world's first commercial electrical telegraph, on 9 April 1839.At first, the seven-core cables were carried inside cast iron pipes, on short wooden spikes, {{a few feet from}} the side of the railway line. But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of telegraph wires against the sky line, across the top of the viaduct, for the first time.

40|$|In Australia {{and many}} other countries, power {{distribution}} lines are carried on wooden poles. These lines <b>suspended</b> on <b>insulators,</b> which are fixed to wooden poles, pass cities as well as bushlands. Under different weather conditions, insulators become contaminated, and in particular, with damp weather, these insulators lose their ability to provide a perfect insulation between the high voltage conductor and the ground (through high impedance objects such as wood). A leakage current, small in magnitude, starts flowing from the high voltage conductor to the ground across the polluted insulator and through the wooden pole. If this phenomenon continues over some time, the currents start heating the wood where there is an abundance of wood-to-metal contact. At a certain stage, it will start smoking and this {{may lead to a}} pole fire. The obvious consequences of this are the loss of power to customers, public safety hazards and potential disasters such as bushfires. This thesis aims at determining which measure or combination of measures of leakage current are best suited for creating a &lsquo;Leakage Current Health Index&rsquo; (LCHI) that can be later used to provide a power system operator with health status for a feeder or system, indicating how urgent a response is needed. To achieve this goal, the impedance characteristics of wooden poles altering the leakage current from insulators are investigated to better understand the role of wood in leakage current signatures. The effective impedance of wood used for poles in Victoria, Australia is established for the first time. Examining the impedance properties of typical Copper Chromium Arsenate (CCA) impregnated wood for 66 kV distribution poles shows dangerous conductance properties of wood at this voltage, providing an explanation for these poles catching fire at triple the rate of 22 kV distribution poles. After a systematic investigation of wood used for poles, a typical impedance characteristic is established for a weathered CCA impregnated wooden pole operating at 22 kV under both dry and wet weather conditions. Next, the leakage current from a single high voltage insulator is examined for various contamination levels and under different weather conditions. A new nonlinearity measure is established which utilises the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the degree of leakage current nonlinearity and to build leakage current profiles of a single insulator under different conditions prior to flashover. Several fractal dimensions are also considered {{for the first time to}} measure characteristics of the leakage current profile of a single insulator. These measures are able to quantitatively differentiate between various levels of insulator contamination and different weather conditions, showing an enhanced level of nonlinear activity in the stage prior to insulator flashover. After developing an understanding of a single insulator, systematic modelling is used to build measure profiles of leakage currents for a simple power line, a lossless power line and a lossy power line. Finally, power utility zone substation data for a pole top fire are examined to verify the validity of the profiles observed utilising the measuring techniques determined suitable for establishing a LCHI...|$|R
