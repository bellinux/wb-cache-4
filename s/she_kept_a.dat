5|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria {{wrote an}} average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> {{detailed}} journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell was matriculated {{into the}} West Virginia University (WVU) in 1901 {{and decided to}} study fine art. While her {{education}} was paid for by her father, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> strict account of her expenditures and took a job coloring photographs at Frieds, a studio in Morgantown. She took drawing and art history classes from William J. Leonard and studied with Eva E. Hubbard. In June 1905 Lazzell was graduated, earning her degree in fine arts. She continued to study at WVU off and on until 1909, furthering her art studies and twice substituting as a painting teacher for Hubbard. During this time she learned ceramics, gold etching, and china decoration.|$|E
5|$|At the {{military}} fort, Alex's reflection {{appears in a}} mirror, giving Alex advice. A ghost then questions them and possesses Jonas, revealing that the ghosts are the passengers of the submarine USS Kanaloa, thought lost at sea. Alex creates another rift that revives Jonas. They find Clarissa, but time loops to her jumping to her death, and then disappearing. Nona, Alex, Jonas and Ren regroup at Harden Tower. Unable to send a radio transmission off the island, Ren suggests finding the key to Maggie Adler's estate, where <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> boat. The group go to Adler's estate. A possessed Clarissa talks with Ren; her conversations and scattered letters left behind by Maggie Adler reveal that Adler mistakenly interpreted scrambled messages from Kanaloa as an enemy transmission, and the submarine was sunk by friendly fire. The crew were not killed, however, but transported to another dimension due to the sub's experimental nuclear reactor. Adler and her friend Anna attempted {{to communicate with the}} Kanaloa crew via a radio, but Anna was absorbed through the gateway. The Kanaloa crew intend on using Alex and her friends' bodies to escape the dimension, keeping them on the island long enough for their possession attempts to be successful.|$|E

Throughout her troubled childhood, she {{had continued to}} aspire to a future career; <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management and mechanical engineering. She began junior college at Ogontz School in Rydal, Pennsylvania, but did not complete her program.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years of Claudius' reign, Claudius was married to the infamous Empress Valeria Messalina. Although Agrippina was very influential, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> very low profile and stayed away from the {{imperial}} palace and the court of the emperor. Messalina was Agrippina's second paternal cousin. Among the victims of Messalina's intrigues were Agrippina's surviving sister Livilla, who was charged with having adultery with Seneca the Younger. Seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to Nero.|$|E

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> {{low profile}} when {{diplomatic}} necessity or Obama's involvement required it, but maintained an influential {{relationship with the}} president and in foreign policy decisions. Her first 100days found her travelling over , having no trouble adapting to being a team player subordinate to Obama, and gaining skills as an executive. Nevertheless, she remained an international celebrity with a much higher profile than most Secretaries of State. Her background as an elected official gave her insight into the needs and fears of elected officials of other countries.|$|E
25|$|She {{maintained}} a highly theatrical lifestyle {{in her house}} on the rue de Rome. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. She cared for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in her own bed, while she slept in the coffin. She posed in it for photographs, adding to the legends she created about herself.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems obvious}} that Gerda is the murderer. Henrietta steps forward {{to take the}} {{revolver}} from her hand, but apparently fumbles and drops it into the swimming pool, destroying the evidence. However, the pistol that Gerda was holding was not the gun used to kill John. None of the witnesses has seen Gerda shoot John. It seems difficult to build a case against {{any of the other}} potential suspects. Lucy was the next suspect, as <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> pistol concealed in her basket of eggs. However, the pistol was the wrong calibre. Henrietta is the next suspect, having left an unusual doodle in the pavilion around the time John was killed. When the murder weapon turns up in Poirot's hedge, it has fingerprints that match none of the suspects.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
25|$|Despite that it {{was unusual}} for women to {{participate}} in archaeology at the time, in 1901, encouraged by Howard Carter, Lady William Cecil began excavations at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan. Her family was wintering {{in the area and}} while exploring on {{the west bank of the}} Nile had discovered what she thought might be an ancient cemetery. Carter, who in 1899 had been appointed by the Antiquities Service as one of two European Chief Inspectors and in charge of excavations in the Nile Valley south from Qus to the Sudanese border, came to see the find the following day. He arranged for permits to excavate and provided an inspector and workers to assist in the dig. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> diary of the details of the expedition in which multiple tombs were found, as well as wooden anthropoid coffins of the Saite Era. Though the entire necropolis was infested with termites, Tomb 21 yielded two burial boxes. The male's coffin disintegrated when it was touched, but the female's coffin remained intact and was removed. The exterior was painted in yellow and devoid of any inscription. The mummy was covered with a blue network of beading. A coarse blue glaze was used on the winged scarabs and Amenti gods depicted on the canopic jars. The sole adornment of the mummy was a one inch by half inch opaque green stone. Lady William's diary recorded that the names found in the tomb were Bao-bao, daughter of Pawebas and Shepentanefet and her brother Waher. She also reported remnants of a former burial, which may have been the tomb of Shepentanefret.|$|E

500|$|Gibbons {{maintained}} a wide circle of friends, who in her later years included Adams, the entertainer Barry Humphries and the novelist John Braine. From the mid-1970s she established {{a pattern of}} monthly literary tea parties in Oakshott Avenue at which, according to Neville, [...] "she was known to expel guests [...] if they were shrill, dramatic, or wrote tragic novels." [...] As her own productivity dwindled and finally ceased altogether, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> commonplace book {{in which she was}} recording her thoughts and opinions on literature as late as 1988.|$|E

But she apparently {{made no secret of}} her orientation: her friends said <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> fairy wand on her desk. When she told her roommate she was attracted to men, he responded by suggesting they not speak to each other. Manning's working conditions included 14- to 15-hour night shifts in a tightly packed, dimly lit room.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1933 Hepburn was a {{respected}} film actress, but she yearned to prove herself on Broadway. Jed Harris, {{one of the most}} successful theatre producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump. He asked Hepburn to appear in the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary. Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film Spitfire (1934). Hepburn's role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. It is widely considered one of her worst films, and Hepburn received poor reviews for the effort. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> picture of Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life to [...] " [...] me humble." ...|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{lived in}} France in the pre-war years. In 1937, {{they made a}} {{high-profile}} visit to Germany and met Adolf Hitler at the Berghof, his Berchtesgaden retreat. After the visit, Hitler said of Wallis, [...] "she {{would have made a}} good Queen". The visit tended to corroborate the strong suspicions of many in government and society that the Duchess was a German agent, a claim that she ridiculed in her letters to the Duke. U.S. FBI files compiled in the 1930s also portray her as a possible Nazi sympathiser. Duke Carl Alexander of WÃ¼rttemberg told the FBI that she and leading Nazi Joachim von Ribbentrop had been lovers in London. There were even rather improbable reports during the Second World War that <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> signed photograph of Ribbentrop on her bedside table.|$|E

She returned to the library in California for a sunset memorial service and interment, where, overcome with emotion, she lost her composure and cried in public for the first time during the week. After accepting the folded flag, she kissed the casket and mouthed [...] "I love you" [...] before leaving.

500|$|On March 5, MartÃ­nez {{testified against}} Cisneros {{and told the}} jury that she ordered Fischer's murder. MartÃ­nez said that Cisneros told her to keep the plan a secret and that she wanted him [...] "good and dead". Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, MartÃ­nez leaned forward in her seat and pointed at Cisneros, saying she told her exactly that. Defense {{attorneys}} tried to discredit MartÃ­nez' testimony and show the jury {{that she was a}} con-woman. They presented letters from several of her former clients who had paid around US$600 for love potions. One woman from San Antonio said that MartÃ­nez consulted her after she began having problems with her boyfriend and did not see positive results. MartÃ­nez denied knowing who the writers were, but changed her mind when the defense read the letters to her and the jury. She admitted that she used herbs, oils, and holy water in her sessions, and that <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> human skull in her shop. She did not call herself a curandera (fortune teller) because she did not study for to earn the title. MartÃ­nez was then asked to read her cards for one of the attorney's in the courtroom to show the jury how she worked.|$|E
