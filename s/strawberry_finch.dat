50|$|Examples of more recent, and {{sometimes}} unwelcome, arrivals are the Asian tiger mosquito from Southeast Asia, the {{citrus long-horned beetle}} from China, the citrus pest cottony cushion scale, the pumpkinseed fish, the mosquitofish, the Louisiana crayfish, the zebra mussel, the <b>strawberry</b> <b>finch,</b> the Eastern grey squirrel, Finlayson's squirrel and the coypu. Two introduced parrot species, the monk parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet, are found in city parks.|$|E
50|$|The red avadavat, red munia or <b>strawberry</b> <b>finch</b> (Amandava amandava) is a sparrow-sized bird of {{the family}} Estrildidae. It {{is found in the}} open fields and grasslands of {{tropical}} Asia and is popular as a cage bird due to the colourful plumage of the males in their breeding season. It breeds in the Indian Subcontinent in the monsoon season. The species name of amandava and the common name of avadavat are derived from the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India, from where these birds were exported into the pet trade in former times.|$|E
40|$|Most {{vertebrates}} communicate acoustically, but few, {{among them}} humans, dolphins and whales, bats, and three orders of birds, learn this trait. FOXP 2 {{is the first}} gene linked to human speech and has {{been the target of}} positive selection during recent primate evolution. To test whether the expression pattern of FOXP 2 is consistent with a role in learned vocal communication, we cloned zebra finch FoxP 2 and its close relative FoxP 1 and compared mRNA and protein distribution in developing and adult brains of a variety of avian vocal learners and non-learners, and a crocodile. We found that the protein sequence of zebra finch FoxP 2 is 98 % identical with mouse and human FOXP 2. In the avian and crocodilian forebrain, FoxP 2 was expressed predominantly in the striatum, a basal ganglia brain region affected in patients with FOXP 2 mutations. Strikingly, in zebra finches, the striatal nucleus Area X, necessary for vocal learning, expressed more FoxP 2 than the surrounding tissue at post-hatch days 35 and 50, when vocal learning occurs. In adult canaries, FoxP 2 expression in Area X differed seasonally; more FoxP 2 expression was associated with times when song becomes unstable. In adult chickadees, <b>strawberry</b> <b>finches,</b> song sparrows, and Bengalese finches, Area X expressed FoxP 2 to different degrees. Non-telencephalic regions in both vocal learning and non-learning birds, and in crocodiles, were less variable in expression and comparable with regions that express FOXP 2 in human and rodent brains. We conclude that differential expression of FoxP 2 in avian vocal learners might be associated with voca...|$|R
