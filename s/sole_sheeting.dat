40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to find best formulation for rubber <b>sole</b> <b>sheeting</b> for sandal. The formulation of the compounds were made by variation ratio of natural rubber and sintetic rubber SBR as follow : 100 / 0, 75 / 25, 50 / 50, 25 / 75 and 0 / 100, where as the variation ratio of carbon black N 330 and aluminium silicate filler 100 / 0, 60 / 40 and 20 / 80 respectively. Compounding process was carried out on two roll mill. The rubber compounds were vulcanized at temperature 150 oC and pressure of 150 kg/cm 2 with curing time as indicated by curometer. Vulcanized rubber were tested based on SNI. 06 - 0899 - 1989 : Rubber sheeting for sole. The best formulation was consist of natural rubber 75 phr, sintetic rubber SBR 25 phr, stearic acid 3 phr, zinc oxide 5 phr, Minarex B oil 5 phr, car bon black 100 phr, MBTS 1 phr, PBN 1 phr and sulfur 2 phr. The physical properties of the best compound were : tensile strength 185, 42 kg/cm 2, elongation at break 276, 64...|$|E
