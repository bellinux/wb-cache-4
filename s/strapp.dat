50|$|In 2008, Angel Air Records {{released}} a live album titled Live at the Rainbow 1977, recorded at the Rainbow Theatre, London, during one show where <b>Strapps</b> opened for The Ian Gillan Band.|$|R
50|$|His next {{band was}} <b>Strapps.</b> Their eponymous debut album was {{recorded}} in 1976 at Ian Gillan's Kingsway Recorders studio in London, produced by former Episode Six colleague Roger Glover. They then toured as support act on Deep Purple's tour of the UK, {{and went on to}} release three further albums.|$|R
50|$|<b>Strapps</b> {{fourth and}} final album Ball of Fire was {{recorded}} at Ian Gillan's Kingsway studios and during recording Underwood was asked by Gillan if he could use {{a couple of hours}} of their studio time to lay down a vocal with his latest band, Gillan.

50|$|In 1977 <b>Strapps</b> {{took the}} support slot on the UK {{tour of the}} Ian Gillan Band. Disappointingly, the band's success on stage, {{especially}} in Japan, did not translate into sales. Unable to sell sufficient records to appease their record company, they were dropped from the roster. Thankfully, however, the Far East had not forgotten the band, {{and they were able}} to strike up a new, smaller deal for distribution in Japan only. A third album, Prisoner Of Your Love, was recorded at The Manor, with Pip Williams at the helm. For the fourth and what was ultimately to be the band's final album, Ball Of Fire, the sessions took place once again at Kingsway Recorders. By then Noel Scott has left the band and instead a second guitarist, Ray McRiner, was hired. <b>Strapps</b> folded when Mick Underwood accepted Ian Gillan's offer to join his new band Gillan in 1979.|$|R
50|$|Underwood {{began his}} career with The Outlaws in 1961 and {{has been one of}} the most {{influential}} figures in the British rock genre ever since, along the way playing in The Herd (with Peter Frampton), Episode Six, Quatermass, Peace with Paul Rodgers, <b>Strapps,</b> Gillan (with four UK top twenty albums, two of which were top three), and Quatermass II. Beginning with famed producer Joe Meek, Underwood has also performed as a session musician on hundreds of recordings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Strapps</b> came {{to being}} when drummer Mick Underwood {{met up with}} an Australian singer-guitarist Ross Stagg. The line-up was {{completed}} by bassist Joe Reed and keyboard player Noel Scott. The band went into a period of prolonged rehearsal before eventually being signed up to EMI's Harvest label, and subsequently recorded their first album at Ian Gillan's Kingsway Recorders studio in London, which was produced by Roger Glover. Glover also got the band a TV show performance at Supersonic, on 26 March 1977.|$|R

50|$|<b>Strapps</b> {{were soon}} {{out on the}} road touring the album. Unfortunately, the band's {{marketing}} strategy didn't go down equally well with everyone - publicity photographs for their eponymous album with a topless model raised the ire of some radical feminists. The women subsequently fronted up at some of their university gigs and made things pretty uncomfortable for the band. Despite this minor blaze of negative publicity, they were given the support slot on labelmate Deep Purple's final tour in the UK and Japan, gaining invaluable exposure with their target audience.|$|R
5000|$|His third son, Joseph Henry Horwood (1841 [...] - [...] 17 April 1913) {{worked at}} the Bendigo Iron Works {{constructing}} mining equipment. He returned to Adelaide in 1867 to supply the Montacute goldmine with a ten head stamp battery, which he bought back the following year and installed at the Echunga goldmine. He then {{spent some time with}} his mining engineer brother John William Horwood in Castlemaine, Victoria before returning to Adelaide in 1872. He built a crushing plant in the Barossa Valley, then moved to Moonta to work on the copper mines, but withdrew in 1874 after being singled out for retribution for his part in suppressing the miners' strike. On 18 March 1875 he married Maria Brooks, and in the same year started work for Francis Clark & Sons, managing their machinery dealership on Grenfell Street then Blyth Street which they sold in 1882. He took over Strapps' foundry in Currie Street, then, with Samuel <b>Strapps</b> (c. 1840-1913), founded a machinery manufacturing and sales business in Currie Street, bringing foreman Thomas Ward with him. Horwood's specialty was well-drilling and he built the first steam-powered rock drilling machine, as well as being a pioneer in tube-lined bores. His fence-wire tensioning device and windmills won several prizes at the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society shows. The business moved to Franklin Street in 1906 and became J. H. Horwood and Co. Ltd. in 1912.|$|R

50|$|Charlie <b>Strapp</b> and Froggy Ball had {{appeared}} {{as parts of}} Swedish radio shows since the mid 40s, but portrayed by regular actors. In the early 50s Funck started to do the voice of Charlie <b>Strapp.</b> The big breakthrough came in 1954, when all voices {{for the first time}} were provided by Funck himself, only with help of a guitar for sound effects. The radio performances were followed by several records with the same concept, a cartoon drawn by Nils Egerbrandt and from 1955 a series of books with illustrations by Einar Norelius.|$|E
5000|$|Rich Horton {{described}} [...] "Time Is the Traitor" [...] as [...] "glorious" [...] and [...] "madly odd". Fiona Kelleghan {{considered that}} John Strapp's name [...] ""suggests both punishment and restraint", observing that <b>Strapp</b> was [...] "tormented by flashbacks" [...] and [...] "compelled {{to repeat the}} same actions over and over", while Arthur D. Hlavaty of The New York Review of Science Fiction called <b>Strapp</b> {{an example of the}} [...] "union of the artist and the criminal that is often considered Bester's defining theme." [...] Kirkus Reviews judged it to be [...] "more style than substance." ...|$|E
5000|$|Outraged by Strapp's incompetence, Captain Fancey {{travels with}} the {{sergeant}} {{to the village}} of Upper Denture near to where the majority of Turpin's hold-ups are carried out. There they encounter the mild-mannered Reverend Flasher, who is really Turpin in disguise, with Tom as his church assistant and Harriet as his maidservant. They confide in the rector their true identities and their scheme to apprehend Turpin. They agree to meet at the seedy Old Cock Inn, a notorious hang-out for criminals and sleazy types, and where Desiree and her showgirls are performing. Fancey and <b>Strapp</b> pose as two on the run crooks - and <b>Strapp</b> dubs his superior [...] "Dandy Desmond" [...] - and they hear from the greasy old hag, Maggie (Marianne Stone), a midwife who removed buckshot from Turpin's buttock, that Turpin has a curious birthmark on his manhood. <b>Strapp</b> wastes no time in carrying out an inspection in the public convenience of the Old Cock Inn.|$|E

50|$|One day Charlie Strapp's {{good friend}} The Chicken is kidnapped by two villains Pudding and Karlsson. Charlie <b>Strapp,</b> {{who has just}} been invited by Froggy Ball to get in his new car, {{constructed}} by Sheet-Niklas and himself mainly out of an old shoe and a well-shaken soda bottle, begins the chase. But the start is miserable as their other friend The Parrot also ends up being kidnapped. It turns out, though, that the kidnappers might not be purely evil after all: they work as stage magicians and just happen to need a hen for a trick they are performing. Charlie <b>Strapp</b> and the others continue to chase the kidnappers through air, {{on the ground and}} on water skis until the final showdown. Maybe they can find another trick.|$|E
50|$|Bonfiglioli's {{style and}} novel {{structure}} {{have often been}} favourably {{compared to that of}} P. G.

The author makes a nod to this comparison by having Mortdecai reference Wodehouse in the novels.|$|E
