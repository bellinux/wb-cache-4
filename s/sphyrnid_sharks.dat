40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{form and function}} {{is often used to}} elucidate the biological role of a structure. Hammerhead sharks offer a unique opportunity to study form and function through phylogeny. Because <b>sphyrnid</b> <b>sharks</b> display a range of cranial morphologies this group can be used to address questions about the evolution of cranial design and investigate the effects of changes in head morphology on feeding structures and bite force. Geometric morphometrics, volumetric analyses, morphological dissections, and phylogenetic analyses of the cephalofoil were used to gain insight into changes in cranial design through evolutionary history. External morphometrics and internal volumetric analyses indicated that while the external shape of the cephalofoil and placement of the sensory structures is variable through evolutionary history, the volumes of the internal cranial elements do not change. Constructional constraints within the cephalofoil were confined to sensory structures while feeding morphology remained relatively unchanged. Analysis of the morphology and biomechanics of the feeding apparatus revealed that through phylogeny the feeding system does not change among sphyrnid species. However, size-removed bite force was lower than predicted for all sphyrnid species except Sphyrna mokarran. Despite differences in head morphology between sphyrnid and carcharhinid sharks, the feeding bauplan is conserved in <b>sphyrnid</b> <b>sharks</b> with few changes to the feeding structures. Instead the chondrocranial and sensory structures are modified around the relatively static feeding core. Finally, the durophagous S. tiburo was found to consume hard prey {{in a manner that is}} biomechanically and morphologically different from other durophagous fishes. Furthermore, the diet of S. tiburo is constrained by the properties of its preferred prey...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} adaptive significance of the sphyrnid cephalo-foil, including potential advantages of spacing the olfac-tory organs at the distal tips of the broad surface. We employed comparative morphology to test whether the sphyrnid cephalofoil provides better stereo-olfaction, in-creases olfactory acuity, and samples a greater volume of the medium compared {{to the situation in}} carcharhiniform sharks. The broadly spaced nares provide sphyrnid spe-cies with a significantly greater separation between the olfactory rosettes, which could lead to an enhanced ability to resolve odor gradients. In addition, most sphyrnid spe-cies possess prenarial grooves that greatly increase the volume of water sampled by the nares and thus increase the probability of odorant encounter. However, despite a much greater head width, and a significantly greater number of olfactory lamellae, scalloped hammerhead sharks do not possess a greater amount of olfactory epi-thelial surface area than the carcharhiniform sandbar sharks. Therefore, <b>sphyrnid</b> <b>sharks</b> might not possess any greater olfactory acuity than carcharhinids. Despite this, there are clear olfactory advantages to the cephalofoil head morphology that could have led to its evolution, persistence, and diversification. J. Morphol. 264 : 253 â€“ 263...|$|E
