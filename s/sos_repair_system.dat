The Use of Radiation-Induced Bacterial Promoters in Anaerobic Conditions: A Means to Control Gene Expression in Clostridium-Mediated Therapy for Cancer. Radiat. Res. 155, 716 - 723 (2001). Apathogenic clostridia, {{which have}} been genetically {{engineered}} to express therapeutic genes, will specifically target hypoxic and necrotic regions in tumors. This specificity can be improved further if the expression of these genes is controlled by a radiation-induced promoter, leading to spatial and temporal control of gene expression. We isolated two radiation-inducible genes of the <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> of Clostridium. Northern blot experiments confirmed radiation activation of the recA and recN genes at a dose of 2 Gy. The promoter region of these genes was isolated and used to regulate expression of the lacZ gene under anaerobic conditions. For the recA promoter, a significant increase of beta-galactosidase activity of 20 - 30 % was seen after 2 Gy irradiation. The recN promoter did not show a significant induction and had a 50 - 100 times lower basal expression. Treatment of the recombinant clostridial cultures with the cytostatic agent mitomycin C also resulted in a significant increase of beta-galactosidase activity that was {{under the control of}} recA or recN promoter.

40|$|The heterodimeric HU protein, {{isolated}} from Escherichia coli, {{is associated with}} the bacterial nucleoid and shares some properties with both histones and HMG proteins. It is the prototype of small bacterial DNA binding proteins with a pleiotropic role in the cell. HU participates in several biological processes like cell division, initiation of DNA replication, transposition, and other biochemical functions. We show here that bacteria lacking HU are extremely sensitive to gamma irradiation. Expression of either one of the subunits of HU in the hupAB double mutant nearly restores the normal survival rate. This shows that the sensitivity is due to the absence of HU rather than being the result of a secondary mutation occurring in the hupAB cells or a modification of the <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system,</b> since SOS genes are induced normally in the absence of HU. Finally, in vitro studies give an indication of its potential role: HU protects DNA against cleavage by gamma-rays...|$|E

40|$|The oncogenic role of Bcl- 2 is {{generally}} attributed to its protective effect against apoptosis. Here, we show a novel role for Bcl- 2 : the specific inhibition {{of the conservative}} RAD 51 recombination pathway. Bcl- 2 or Bcl-xL overexpression inhibits UV-C-, γ-ray- or mutant p 53 -induced homologous recombination (HR). Moreover, Bcl- 2 recombination inhibition is independent {{of the role of}} p 53 in G 1 arrest. At an acute double-strand break in the recombination substrate, Bcl- 2 specifically inhibits RAD 51 -dependent gene conversion without affecting non-conservative recombination. Bcl- 2 consistently thwarts recombination stimulated by RAD 51 overexpression and alters Rad 51 protein by post-translation modification. Moreover, a mutant G 145 ABcl- 2, which is defective in Bax interaction and in apoptosis repression, also inhibits recombination, showing that the death and recombination repression functions of Bcl- 2 are separable. Inhibition of error-free repair pathways by Bcl- 2 results in elevated frequencies of mutagenesis. The Bcl- 2 gene therefore combines two separable cancer-prone phenotypes: apoptosis repression and a genetic instability/mutator phenotype. This dual phenotype could represent a mammalian version of the bacterial <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The basic {{underlying}} problem in reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data {{is that the}} expression of a gene encoding the regulator provides only limited information about its protein activity. The proteins, which result from translation, are subject to stringent posttranscriptional control and modification. Often, it is only the modified version of the protein that is capable of activating or repressing its regulatory targets. At present there exists no reliable high-throughput technology to measure the protein activity levels in real-time, and therefore they are, so-to-say, lost in translation. However, these activity levels can be recovered by studying the gene expression of their targets. Here, we describe a computational approach to predict temporal regulator activity levels from the gene expression of its transcriptional targets in a network motif with one regulator and many targets. We consider an example of an <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system,</b> and computationally infer the regulator activity of its master repressor, LexA. The reconstructed activity profile of LexA exhibits a behavior that is similar to the experimentally measured profile of this repressor: after UV irradiation, the amount of LexA substantially decreases within a few minutes, followed by a recovery to its normal level. Our approach can easily be applied to known single-input motifs in other organisms. ...|$|E
40|$|The dif locus (deletion-induced filamentation) of Escherichia coli is a resolvase site, {{located in}} the {{terminus}} region of the chromosome, that reduces chromosome multimers to monomers. In strains in which this site has been deleted, {{a fraction of the}} cells is filamentous, has abnormal nucleoid structure, and exhibits elevated levels of the <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system.</b> We have demonstrated that a 33 -bp sequence, which is sufficient for RecA-independent recombination and which shows similarity to the cer site of pColE 1, suppresses the Dif phenotype when inserted in the terminus region. Flanking sequences were not required, since suppression occurred in strains in which dif as well as 12 kb or 173 kb of DNA had been deleted. However, location was important, and insertions at a site 118 kb away from the normal site did not suppress the Dif phenotype. These sites were otherwise still functional, and they exhibited wild-type levels of RecA-independent recombination with dif-containing plasmids and recombined with other chromosomal dif sites to cause deletions and inversions. It is proposed that the functions expressed by a dif site depend on chromosome location and structure, and analysis of these functions provides a way to examine the structure of the terminus region...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in the DNA {{mismatch}} <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> increase mutation and recombination. They may thereby {{promote the}} genetic divergence that underlies speciation, {{after which the}} reacquisition of a functional <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> may sustain that divergence by creating a barrier to recombination. We tested several lines of Escherichia coli, derived from a common ancestor and evolved for 20, 000 generations, for their recombination ability. Some lines, but not others, had become mismatch repair-defective mutators during experimental evolution, providing different opportunities for DNA sequence divergence. We knocked out the <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> in lines that had retained this function, and we restored function to those lines that had become defective. We then estimated recombination rates in various crosses between these repair-deficient and -proficient strains.

40|$|We {{show here}} that {{expression}} of the colicin gene of the ColE 1 plasmid is greatly derepressed in Escherichia coli K- 12 strain DM 1187 spr tif sfi, which is a constitutive tif mutant, altered in the lexA gene, and which shows constitutive expression of various pathways of the recA-dependent, lexA-blocked (<b>SOS)</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system.</b> In this strain colicin E 1 synthesis is at least 100 -fold greater than that observed in uninduced control strains (spr+ tif sfi and spr+ tif+ sfi). This result confirms the regulatory role of the lexA product in colicin E 1 synthesis. Colicin yields by the uninduced strain DM 1187 are {{as high as the}} maximum yields from mitomycin-induced control strains and often are several-fold higher. When the nonconstitutive tif sfi strain GC 467 is raised to 43 degrees C to induce the SOS system, a low level of colicin synthesis is observed which is less than one-tenth of the yield obtained by induction with mitomycin C. Addition of adenine at the time of shift-up can increase the colicin yield of tif sfi to about one-third of the yield obtained with mitomycin C. We have also found that colicin overproduction can be detected by altered colony appearance in an overlay assay with colicin-sensitive bacteria. In addition, the lethality of the process of colicin synthesis is observed here without the use of bacteriostatic inducing agents...|$|E
40|$|Colon {{cancer is}} the second most common type of cancer in the United States. Its {{incidence}} is linked epidemiologically to high levels of bile acids in the feces. Bile acids have been implicated as promoters and cocarcinogens in the etiology of colon cancer and as comutagens and mutagens in bacteria. These observations suggest the hypothesis that bile acids may damage DNA. By using the DNA-damage inducible SOS system in Escherichia coli, this study shows that when bacteria are exposed to bile acids there is induction of the <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> and preferential survival of cells undergoing repair. Additionally, differential killing assays using repair defective bacteria show strains defective in recombinational repair or excision repair have lower survival when treated with bile acids than their parental wild-type counterparts. Human fibroblasts were treated with bile acids and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) was measured. UDS is considered to represent the DNA synthesis step in excision repair. UDS, measured by autoradiography, was found to significantly increase in human fibroblasts upon treatment with bile acids. In addition, differential cytotoxicity assays with Chinese Hamster Ovary cells showed that different DNA-repair pathway defective cells were sensitive to different bile acids. Introduction of DNA damage and induction of DNA-repair by bile acids implicates them as possible direct carcinogens in the etiology of colon cancer...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory {{networks}} {{consist of}} genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) and the genes they activate or repress. Various types of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) {{have been proposed}} to model these networks, ranging from linear to Michaelis-Menten approaches. In practice, a serious drawback to estimate these models is that the TFs are generally unobserved. The reason is the actual lack of high-throughput techniques to measure abundance of proteins in the cell. The challenge is to infer their activity profile together with the kinetic parameters of the ODE using level expression measurements of the genes they regulate. In this work we propose general statistical framework to infer the kinetic parameters of regulatory networks {{with one or more}} TFs using time course gene expression data. Our approach is also able to predict the activity levels of the TF. We use a penalized likelihood approach where the ODE is used as a penalty. The main advantage is that the solution of the ODE is not required explicitly as it is common in most proposed methods. This makes our approach computationally efficient and suitable for large systems with many components. We use the proposed method to study a <b>SOS</b> <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> in Escherichia coli. The reconstructed TF exhibits a similar behavior to experimentally measured profiles and the genetic expression data are fitted properly. ...|$|E

40|$|DNA repair {{processes}} are crucial in maintaining genome integrity. Postreplication <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> target specific misincorporations which occur during DNA replication. The mismatch <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> corrects most base pair mismatches, the nucleotide excision <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> corrects bulky lesions {{and the very}} short patch <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> of E. coli, repairs G-T mismatches {{that occur in the}} CCWGG sequence context. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the roles of very short patch repair, mismatch repair and nucleotide excision <b>repair</b> <b>systems,</b> and their interactions in the presence of mutagen induced lesions caused by 2 -aminopurine and 5 -azacytidine. We have examined the regulation of the dcm and vsr genes of the very short patch <b>repair</b> <b>system,</b> and have found that Vsr is growth phase regulated while Dcm levels remain constant throughout the various stages of the cell's growth. The Vsr regulation was also found to be post-transcriptional and also, although to a lesser extent, operon structure regulated. This helps explain why 5 -methylcytosines are hotspots for mutations in E. coli. We have shown that Dcm, the only cytosine methyltransferase in E. coli, when bound to its target site CCWGG and in the presence of mutagens, 2 -aminopurine and 5 -azacytidine, affects DNA repair and replication, respectively. Our results indicate that the 2 -aminopurine effect is due to increased mispairing of 5 -methycytosines with 2 -aminopurine compared to normal cytosine. 5 -azacytidine stimulates C-to-G mutations which are independent of the methylase. We have evidence which suggests that the lesions leading to the C-to-G mutations are C-C mismatches. We also have results which indicate that these 5 -azacytidine induced lesions are repaired by the nucleotide <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> as well as the MutS and MutL proteins of the mismatch <b>repair</b> <b>system.</b> Other lesions caused by the drug include a methylase dependent lesion.

40|$|In {{concrete}} <b>repair</b> <b>systems,</b> {{material properties}} of the repair material and the interface are greatly influenced by the moisture exchange between the repair material and the substrate. If the substrate is dry, it can absorb water from the repair material and reduce its effective water-to-cement ratio (w/c). This further affects the hydration rate of cement based material. In addition to the change in hydration rate, void content at the interface between the two materials is also affected. In this research, the influence of moisture exchange on the void content in the <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> {{as a function of}} initial saturation level of the substrate is investigated. <b>Repair</b> <b>systems</b> with varying level of substrate saturation are made. Moisture exchange in these <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> as a function of time is monitored by the X-ray absorption technique. After a specified curing age (3 d), the internal microstructure of the <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> was captured by micro-computed X-ray tomography (CT-scanning). From reconstructed images, different phases in the <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> (<b>repair</b> material, substrate, voids) can be distinguished.

It was found that significantly more voids form when the substrate is dry prior to application of the repair material. Air, initially filling voids and pores of the dry substrate, is being released due to the moisture exchange. As a result, air voids remain entrapped in the repair material close to the interface. These voids are found to form as a continuation of pre-existing surface voids in the substrate. Knowledge about moisture exchange and its effects provides engineers with the basis for recommendations about substrate preconditioning in practice.
