The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under {{the shelter of the}} shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island.

He participated in the selection of sites for research and production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Hanford, Washington. He directed the enormous construction effort, made critical decisions on the various methods of isotope separation, acquired raw materials, directed the collection of military intelligence on the German nuclear energy project and helped select the cities in Japan that were chosen as targets. Groves wrapped the Manhattan Project in security but failed to prevent the Soviet Union from conducting a successful espionage program that stole <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> important secrets.|$|E
5|$|In {{development}} since 1999, {{the project}} was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics and regarded by some {{as one of the}} best horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but both were never completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.|$|E

In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26of their passengers. With localized estimates {{of up to}} 8in (200mm), the state of New York experienced <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> historic rainfall; an official total 4.24in (108mm) shattered the 24-hour record for any calendar day in Binghamtom. Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage. Considerable flooding also occurred in Vermont and Pennsylvania, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of 10.5in (265mm) in Moscow. Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a pressure gradient over southern New England, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in Litchfield County. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding. In Quebec, torrents following 3.5in (90mm) of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings. Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions.|$|E

There are stretches, especially in Act I, when Broadway Bound isn't funny or moving but just reportorial and expository, with plot twists and thematic invocations piling up undigested, like the heavier courses at an attenuated Passover seder." ...|$|R

Urechia, Minister of Education in the Ion Brătianu National Liberal cabinet, assigned him the office of inspector general for the Moldavian counties of Suceava and Neamţ.

25|$|During the 5000km journey across Africa through <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> {{difficult}} country {{consisting of}} almost impenetrable rainforest and swamps, Stairs and colleagues suffered frequently from malaria and dysentery. Stairs had endurance, toughness and perseverance.

He was seriously wounded in the chest by a poisonous arrow during an attack by natives, many of whom assumed they were a slave-raiding party, and the expedition killed hundreds in return. Stairs recovered from his wound to continue the journey. In Dublin, Ireland there is a bronze plaque depicting this 13 August 1887 event on the statue of expedition Surgeon Major Thomas Heazle Parke who removed the arrow and sucked the poison from the wound.|$|E
25|$|The {{subject-matter}} of Cham inscriptions {{is mostly}} political and religious.

Many of the inscriptions document a gift to a god, such as a gift of land, of people, or of treasure, or a foundation dedicated to a god, such as the foundation of a temple, an altar, or a pedestal. The inscriptions also provide us with important information such as the name of the country (typically Campadesa in the Sanskrit inscriptions, nagara Campa in the Cham inscriptions), and the names of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> important cities: Simhapura ("Lion City"), Virapura ("Knight City"), Rajapura ("King City"), Vijaya ("District").
