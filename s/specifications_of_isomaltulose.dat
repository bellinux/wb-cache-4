Methods and Results: After an enrichment procedure for bacteria likely to metabolize isomaltulose in sucrose-rich environments, 578 isolates were screened for efficient isomaltulose biosynthesis using an aniline/diphenylamine assay and capillary electrophoresis. An isolate designated UQ 68 J was exceptionally efficient in sucrose isomerase activity. Conversion <b>of</b> sucrose into <b>isomaltulose</b> by UQ 68 J (enzyme activity of 90 - 100 U mg(- 1) DW) was much faster than the current industrial strain Protaminobacter rubrum CBS 574. 77 (41 - 66 U mg(- 1) DW) or a reference strain of Erwinia rhapontici (0. 3 - 0. 9 U mg(- 1) DW). Maximum yield <b>of</b> <b>isomaltulose</b> at 78 - 80 % of supplied sucrose was achieved in {{less than half the}} reaction time needed by CBS 574. 77, and the amount of contaminating trehalulose (4 %) was the lowest recorded from an isomaltulose-producing microbe. UQ 68 J is a Gram negative, facultatively anaerobic, motile, noncapsulate, straight rod-shaped bacterium producing acid but no gas from glucose.

40|$|Isomaltulose is {{a natural}} {{occurring}} disaccharide composed of α- 1, 6 -linked glucose and fructose. Commercial isomaltulose is produced from sucrose by enzymatic rearrangement and {{has been used as}} a sugar in Japan since 1985. It is particularly suitable as a non-cariogenic sucrose replacement and is favorable in products for diabetics and prediabetic dispositions. In vivo studies with rats and pigs indicate that isomaltulose is completely hydrolyzed and absorbed in the small intestine. This is supported by in vitro studies showing that intestinal disaccharidases from various species (including man) can hydrolyze <b>isomaltulose.</b> The rate <b>of</b> hydrolysis, however, is very slow compared with sucrose and maltose. Thus, blood glucose and insulin levels in humans after oral administration rise slower and reach lower maxima than after sucrose administration. After absorption, fructose and glucose are metabolized as typical for these monosaccharides. From intravenous studies it can be assumed that any systemic isomaltulose would be hydrolyzed as well, or excreted in urine. In several subchronic toxicity studies, the administration of large doses (up to 7. 0 and 8. 1 g/kg body weight/day in male and female rats, respectively) <b>of</b> <b>isomaltulose,</b> did not result in adverse effects. Isomaltulose induced neither embryotoxic or teratogenic effects in rat foetuses, nor maternal toxicity at levels up to 7 g/kg body weight/day. Isomaltulose was non-mutagenic in the Ames test. As hydrolysis in the small intestine is complete, even high levels <b>of</b> <b>isomaltulose</b> are well tolerated in animals and humans. In studies with healthy as well as diabetic subjects high doses up to 50 g were tolerated without signs of intestinal discomfort. On the basis of the data reviewed it is concluded that the use <b>of</b> <b>isomaltulose</b> as an alternative sugar is as safe as the use of other digestible sugars consisting of glucose and fructose. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{efficient}} enzymatic synthesis of a homologous series of isomaltulose-derived oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to 9 through the transglucosylation reaction using a dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B- 512 F. The total oligosaccharide yield obtained under optimal conditions was 41 – 42 % (in weight {{with respect to}} the initial amount <b>of</b> <b>isomaltulose)</b> after 24 – 48 h of reaction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural characterization indicated that dextransucrase specifically transferred glucose moieties of sucrose to the C- 6 of the nonreducing glucose residue <b>of</b> <b>isomaltulose.</b> Likewise, monitoring the progression of the content of each individual oligosaccharide indicated that oligosaccharide acceptor products of low molecular weight acted in turn as acceptors for further transglucosylation to yield oligosaccharides of a higher degree of polymerization.

This paper {{points out that}} the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> such models for econometric analysis can be achieved from the basic concept of fixed price equilibrium and without the use of the concepts of effective demand. The <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> Ito and Gourieroux, Laffont and Monfort are justified within this framework...|$|R
