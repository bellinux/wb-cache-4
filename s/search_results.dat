In addition to ranked and player matches, the online mode adds eight-player lobbies, spectator mode, and replay saving.

The <b>search</b> <b>result</b> records from a given search engine are usually formatted based on a template. Precisely identifying this template can greatly help extract and annotate the data units within each record correctly. In this paper, we propose a graph model to represent record template and develop a domain independent statistical method to automatically mine the record template for any search engine using sample <b>search</b> <b>result</b> records. Our approach can identify both template tags (HTML tags) and template texts (non-tag texts), and it also explicitly addresses the mismatches between the tag structures and the data structures of <b>search</b> <b>result</b> records.

West Coast Ent'mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the <b>search</b> <b>results</b> when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of <b>search</b> <b>results</b> alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the <b>search</b> <b>results</b> to find the Playboy sites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conventional ranking {{methods for}} {{document}} search have considered content of documents to rank a <b>search</b> <b>result.</b> They have at-tained some positive {{results in the}} research area of document search; how-ever, {{it has been said}} that content of not only documents but also queries should be utilized if users want to get a <b>search</b> <b>result</b> accurately. This fact applies to XML search engines. In this paper, therefore, we propose a ranking method for XML search considering content-and-structure con-ditions of both XML documents and queries. We also propose a method for presenting a <b>search</b> <b>result</b> for XML <b>search,</b> because it is very impor-tant for users to grasp and understand the entire <b>search</b> <b>result,</b> too. We implemented our ranking method on top of XRel, a relational database system for XML documents, and found that our proposal allows users to search XML fragments more accurately than previously proposed ap-proaches for XML search. ...|$|R
