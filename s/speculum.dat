5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white <b>speculum</b> that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the <b>speculum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Euler {{devised a}} {{specific}} graph, the <b>Speculum</b> musicum, {{to illustrate the}} diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, reminding his interest for the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (see above). The device knew a renewed interest as the Tonnetz in neo-Riemannian theory (see also Lattice (music)).|$|E
5|$|In flight, {{the white}} {{lining of the}} underwings {{can be seen in}} {{contrast}} to the blackish underbody and upperside. The purple <b>speculum</b> lacks white bands at the front and rear, and rarely has a white trailing edge. A dark crescent is visible on the median underwing primary coverts.|$|E
5|$|Local tradition, first {{written down}} by John Leland in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was King Arthur's Camelot. The {{site and the}} Great Hall are extensive, and the writer Geoffrey Ashe argued {{in an article in}} the journal <b>Speculum</b> that it was the base for the Arthur of history. His opinion has not been widely {{accepted}} by students of the period.|$|E
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown <b>speculum</b> with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue <b>speculum</b> feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple <b>speculum</b> feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a <b>speculum,</b> which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal <b>speculum,</b> causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective <b>speculum</b> metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other pintails, {{the males}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the females, though larger. The ducks are 45 to 65cm in length, the males weighing 610 to 660 g, the females 460 to 610 g. Minor differences are that the male has uniformly brownish-grey upperwing coverts and a glossy greenish-black <b>speculum,</b> while the female has mottled upperwing coverts and a dull brown <b>speculum.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>speculum</b> is a {{circular}} or oval hand-mirror used predominantly by Etruscan women. <b>Speculum</b> is Latin; the Etruscan word is malena or malstria. Specula were cast in bronze as one piece {{or with a}} tang into which a wooden, bone, or ivory handle fitted. The reflecting surface was created by polishing the flat side. A higher percentage of tin in the mirror improved its ability to reflect. The other side was convex and featured intaglio or cameo scenes from mythology. The piece was generally ornate.|$|E

25|$|Colposcopy is {{performed}} with the woman lying back, legs in stirrups, and buttocks at the lower {{edge of the table}} (a position known as the dorsal lithotomy position). A <b>speculum</b> is placed in the vagina after the vulva is examined for any suspicious lesions.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{hospital}} were operating rooms, kitchens, baths, a dispensary, latrines, a mortuary and herb gardens, as doctors {{relied heavily on}} herbs for drugs. The medici could treat any wound received in battle, {{as long as the}} patient was alive. They operated or otherwise treated with scalpels, hooks, levers, drills, probes, forceps, catheters and arrow-extractors on patients anesthetized with morphine (opium poppy extract) and scopolamine (henbane extract). Instruments were boiled before use. Wounds were washed in vinegar and stitched. Broken bones were placed in traction. There is, however, evidence of wider concerns. A vaginal <b>speculum</b> suggests gynecology was practiced, and an anal <b>speculum</b> implies knowledge that the size and condition of internal organs accessible through the orifices was an indication of health. They could extract eye cataracts with a special needle. Operating room amphitheaters indicate that medical education was ongoing. Many have proposed that the knowledge and practices of the medici were not exceeded until the 20th century CE.|$|E
25|$|Handwriting {{experts at}} the 1966 Conference tended to {{disagree}} with Witten's assessment that the map captions had been written by the same person as the <b>Speculum</b> and Relation texts. This had also been a major reason why the British Museum had rejected the map in 1957, the Keeper of Manuscripts having detected elements of handwriting style not developed until the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Many {{health care}} {{providers}} are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at all, {{should be used to}} lubricate the <b>speculum.</b> This may result in unnecessary discomfort. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the PAP smear. Further, cytology is not affected, nor are some STD testing.|$|E
25|$|De Vere openly quarrelled {{with the}} Earl of Leicester about this time; he was {{confined}} to his chamber at Greenwich for some time 'about the libelling between him and my Lord of Leicester'.

25|$|Other texts {{originating}} {{from the same}} era represent a land {{to the south of}} New Guinea, with a variety of flora and fauna. Part of a map in Cornelis de Jode's 1593 atlas <b>Speculum</b> Orbis Terrae depicts New Guinea and a hypothetical land to the south inhabited by dragons. Kenneth McIntyre suggested that although Cornelis de Jode was Dutch, the title page of <b>Speculum</b> Orbis Terrae may provide evidence of early Portuguese knowledge of Australia. The page depicts four animals: a horse, representing Europe, a camel, to represent Asia, a lion, for Africa, and another animal that resembles a kangaroo, to represent a fourth continent. The latter creature features a marsupial pouch containing two offspring, and the characteristically bent hind legs of a kangaroo or another member of the macropod family. However, as macropods are found in New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago (these include the Dusky pademelon, Agile wallaby, and Black Dorcopsis wallaby), this may have no relevance to a possible Portuguese discovery of Australia. Another explanation is that the animal is based on a North American opossum.|$|E
25|$|The only species it {{is likely}} to be {{confused}} with is the yellow-billed teal, a relatively recent self-introduction first recorded breeding on South Georgia in 1971. The speckled teal also has a yellow bill but differs in being smaller and more compact, with less spotting on the flanks, and having a buff bar in front of the <b>speculum,</b> a central white stripe on the underwing, and a shorter and less pointed tail.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Commentary was to offer {{demonstrated}} illustrations and fuller explanation of the astrological principles described by Ptolemy. Following Wolf's edition, large passages were incorporated into Latin astrological works which featured extensive collections of example horoscopes. Two notable examples are Jerome Cardan's Ptolemaei De Astrorvm Ivdiciis (Basel, 1578) and Francisco Junctinus's <b>Speculum</b> Astrologiae (Lugduni, 1583). Modern translators continue to make reference to the Hieronymous Wolf Commentary in their explanatory annotations.|$|E
25|$|In 1856–57, Karl August von Steinheil and Léon Foucault {{introduced}} {{a process of}} depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on <b>speculum</b> mirrors, it {{had the advantage of}} being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.|$|E
25|$|The {{health care}} worker begins by {{inserting}} a <b>speculum</b> into the woman's vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows {{access to the}} cervix. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or os of the cervix by scraping it with an Aylesbury spatula. An endocervical brush is rotated in the central opening of the cervix. The cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the laboratory to be checked for abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|The British mathematician, {{optician}} James Short began {{experimenting with}} building telescopes based on Gregory's designs in the 1730s. He first tried making his mirrors out of glass {{as suggested by}} Gregory, but he later switched to <b>speculum</b> metal mirrors creating Gregorian telescopes with original designers parabolic and elliptic figures. Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession which he practised first in Edinburgh, and afterward in London. All Short's telescopes were of the Gregorian form. Short died in London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune selling telescopes.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} of the Roman Empire, the area around Genzano was used by wealthy Roman {{citizens}} for its clean air, uncontaminated water and cooler temperatures during the hot summer months. The lake has its own microclimate and is protected from wind by the crater walls. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Lord Byron and Charles Gounod all lived in Nemi and saw the magical reflection of the Moon seen {{in the center of the}} lake during summer. This phenomenon is the source of the Roman name for the lake, <b>Speculum</b> Dianae (Diana's Mirror).|$|E
25|$|Birds may bite or stab {{with their}} beaks to defend themselves. Some species use their beaks in {{displays}} of various sorts. As {{part of his}} courtship, for example, the male garganey touches his beak to the blue <b>speculum</b> feathers on his wings in a fake preening display, and the male Mandarin duck does the same with his orange sail feathers. A number of species use a gaping, open beak in their fear and/or threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beaks.|$|E
25|$|From a distance, the drakes in nuptial plumage appear grey, {{with a dark}} head, a {{yellowish}} behind, and a white stripe {{running along}} the flanks. Their head and upper neck is chestnut, with a wide and iridescent dark green patch of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowish-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch's forward end, curving along {{the base of the}} bill. The breast is buff with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, {{and the rest of the}} body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish vermiculations, appearing medium grey even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary remiges are dark greyish brown; the <b>speculum</b> feathers are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the <b>speculum</b> together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge. The tail and tail coverts are black, with a bright yellowish-buff triangular patch in the center of the coverts at each side.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>speculum</b> metal mirror {{secondaries}} or diagonal mirrors {{greatly reduced}} {{the light that}} reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried {{to do away with}} them. In 1762 Mikhail Lomonosov presented a reflecting telescope before the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted {{at the front of the}} telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by William Herschel.|$|E
