Analysis of air-gap flux probe data can pinpoint the number and location (pole and coil) of <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> without having to take the generator offline. This paper will discuss the theory, methodology and benefits of detecting <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> in generator rotors. A number of case studies will be presented. EFFECTS OF SHORTED TURNS IN ROTOR WINDINGS The impact of operating a round rotor generator with rotor winding <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> depends upon many factors 1. If the percentage of total <b>turns</b> <b>shorted</b> out is small, the generator may be able to run at rated load for years without further problems. However, larger <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> percentages can cause operating conditions that may limit unit loads. If the problems become severe, forced outages may occur. Conditions that may result in running a rotor with shorted-turns include: 1. Rotor unbalance that varies with field current changes (thermal sensitivity). Coils with shorted-turns operate at lower temperatures than coils without shorted-turns. This i...|$|R

2500|$|Communication in niches such as {{role-playing}} games (RPG) of Multi-User domains (MUDs) {{and virtual}} worlds is highly interactive, {{with emphasis on}} speed, brevity and spontaneity. [...] As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and <b>short</b> <b>turns.</b> Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as EMPHASIS, usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in *stress* and the creative use of punctuation like ???!?!?!?. Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a conversational repair marker and arrows and carats as deixis and referent markers. Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages.

2500|$|Buses and streetcars use the Communications and Information System (CIS). This system employs {{transmit}} facilities {{throughout the}} city. Each bus and streetcar has a Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP) set on board. This {{is attached to}} a transponder receiver, which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using an older computational system known as dead reckoning. The TRUMP also allows the operators and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as <b>short</b> <b>turns</b> and route adjustments. There is also the option of voice communications between the operator and the CIS operator. The CIS was conceived in the late 1970s and was fully implemented in 1991. With the introduction of the NextBus GPS technology, the CIS positioning system is now using a combination of GPS data and the old dead reckoning sign-post system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on Bell Mobility's CDMA network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control. Recently, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer computer aided dispatch (CAD/AVL) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). There is no current estimate of when this technology is to be implemented. Each TRUMP unit on every streetcar and bus is equipped with a silent [...] "yellow alarm" [...] key which can be activated by the operator {{in the event of an}} emergency on board. When activated, CIS supervisors and transit control dispatchers are able to hear what is going on via a high-quality boom microphone located in front of the steering wheel and dispatch emergency responders. There is also a [...] "red alarm" [...] key, which enables one way communication with CIS once pressed. This can be used in events such as fires when immediate assistance is required and two-way voice communication would prove detrimental to safety.|$|E

40|$|Online {{condition}} monitoring is preferred specifically in critical induction machines for timely {{analysis of their}} health and to predict any incipient failures. Negative sequence current monitoring {{is one of the}} well-known {{condition monitoring}} applications that capable of identifying stator faults in induction motor as well as producing fast and reliable results using a simple measurement technique. However, the technique is sensitive to asymmetrical sources of negative sequence, not only due to motor faults but also due to the disturbances such as sensor calibration, inherent non-idealities (such as inherent machine asymmetries), external effects (such as load change and supply voltage unbalances). This thesis addresses the limitations in <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> fault detection while considering real system disturbances and non-linearities using a dynamic motor model which is also verified by the experimental studies. The thesis provides a comprehensive investigation of various negative sequence contributors such as measurement asymmetry, inherent asymmetry, voltage unbalance, <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> faults, eccentricity and broken rotor bar faults under load variations, and presents practical results. To allow accurate <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> fault detection, this thesis also provides an effective phasor compensation technique for these disturbances. A new detailed compensation by demonstrating step-by-step disturbance extraction to obtain the real negative sequence current due to <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> faults are also presented. It is demonstrated that this technique allows even a single stator <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> faults to be detected as well as successfully eliminating the effect of inherent asymmetry and voltage unbalances under motor load variations.
