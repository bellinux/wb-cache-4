5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive <b>sites,</b> <b>and</b> many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
