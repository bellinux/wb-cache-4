25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist <b>seal</b> <b>system.</b> The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.|$|E

500|$|The Magic <b>Seal</b> <b>system</b> is a {{new feature}} {{introduced}} in Dawn of Sorrow, and makes use of the DS touchscreen. Once the player reduces the hit points of a [...] "boss" [...] enemy to zero, a circle will appear, and the game will automatically draw a pattern connecting any number of smaller circles on the circumference of the larger circle. After this, the player is prompted to draw the same pattern on the touchscreen in a set amount of time. If the player fails to draw the pattern accurately within the time limit, the boss will regain health and the battle will resume. If successful, the boss will be defeated. More powerful boss enemies require higher level Magic Seals, which have more intricate and complex patterns as the level increases and are found {{over the course of}} the game.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{wear and}} no {{friction}} with non-contacting <b>sealing</b> <b>systems.</b> Because of this, {{there is in}} principle no lifetime-limit. However, this does not apply for grease-filled labyrinth seals. To seal against particles, the grease inside the gaps of the seal has to bind pollution particles and the grease-filled gap must be opened. If the surfaces of the grease layers in the gaps are saturated with particles, further particles penetrating the <b>sealing</b> <b>system</b> {{can no longer be}} bound. The seal must then be relubricated. Based on the actual state of the art, this work shows the latest results of experiments to enable designers to unerringly develop non-contacting <b>sealing</b> <b>systems</b> with grease-filled gaps to seal dry particles with reliable function.

50|$|An {{external}} {{floating roof}} tank is a storage tank {{commonly used to}} store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate. It comprises an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats {{on the surface of}} the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a fixed roof tank there is no vapor space (ullage) in the floating roof tank (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates breathing losses and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid. There is a rim <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation.|$|E
