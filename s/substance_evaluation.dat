To this end, the CRED evaluation method and the CRED reporting recommendations were developed. The CRED evaluation method provides reliability and relevance evaluation criteria and detailed guidance material [19, 20].

By September, 1 st, 84 SVHC are included in the candidate list, and 14 substances are included in Annex XIV and therefore will be subject for authorisation in future. To elaborate the proposals and to agree the measures in the Member State Committee was not an easy task – and therefore we congratulate also the Member States authorities, and especially ECHA.|$|E

30|$|Elements of the {{screening}} tool {{are used for}} a computerized mass screening performed by ECHA [20]. The mass screening {{is part of a}} common screening approach developed by ECHA and Member States aiming at identifying those substances which might be subject to further evaluation or risk management measures. The mass screening includes hazard-based indicators such as structural alerts but also considers potential emissions to man and the environment. In a second step, substances identified during mass screening are manually screened by member states, taking into account additional information, with the aim {{to decide whether or not}} further information is needed to conclude on the hazard potential. If information is missing to conclude on the endocrine-disrupting properties, the chemical may become subject to <b>substance</b> <b>evaluation</b> under REACH, a process permitting to request non-standard information on endocrine-disrupting properties.

30|$|On 1 June 2007, the {{legislation}} on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) came into force. REACH shall ensure the safe manufacturing, placing {{on the market}} and use of chemicals in the European Union. Registration aims to deliver data on hazards as well as descriptions of appropriate risk management measures (RMM). Evaluation comprises dossier and <b>substance</b> <b>evaluation</b> to ensure high quality of the registrations, and to remove data gaps and identify risks which need further regulation. Where risks are not being properly controlled, REACH provides two risk management measures: authorisation and restriction. To date (status May 2013), approximately 28, 000 registration dossiers for substances were submitted and processed. The dossier evaluation is ongoing and 427 dossiers have been checked for compliance by the end of 2012 [1]. The <b>substance</b> <b>evaluation</b> has only started in 2012 and the first draft decisions on information requirements have been submitted to the registrants. Subsequent conclusions on the necessity of further risk management measures are still pending for most substances. The inclusion of substances in the candidate list for authorisation by identification as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) has made good progress. Twenty-two substances are included into Annex XIV, and for 11 substances (status December 2013), the latest application date has already expired. The first restrictions proposed by Member States have been adopted and Annex XVII has been amended [2 – 4]. Deeper insight into the aforementioned instruments of REACH and their legal background can be found elsewhere [5] and will therefore not be discussed herein.|$|E

According to chemical composition they can be classified into methacrylic and silicon conditioners. The objective of this research was to examine the potential toxicity of one, seven and thirty day extracts of different concentrations. Different effective concentrations (5, 12. 5, 25 and 50 %) of two silicone and four methacrylic conditioners extracts were used after extraction period of one, seven and thirty days. Amount of toxic substances and dynamics of their release were monitored by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).

With increasing of extraction period, the amount of released potential toxic substances increased. The cytotoxicity of tested materials significantly increased with extract concentration increase and duration of extraction period.

40|$|Agreement {{has been}} linked to both epistemic and {{interpersonal}} benefits. As such, people like to be in agreement with others and strive to stay in agreement. Yet, little is known about whether and how the way in which agreement is reached affects epistemic outcomes. In a lab experiment with a 3 x 2 design, undergraduate participants stated their opinion about a target person to a partner who ostensibly (a) either agreed before and after the communication (fortuitous agreement), shifted from disagreement to agreement (persuaded agreement), or consistently disagreed (no agreement); and (b) either praised their argument quality (<b>substance</b> <b>evaluation)</b> or presentational style (style evaluation). I hypothesized that the fortuitous and persuaded agreement conditions would yield a greater experience of shared reality (H 1) and thus, greater epistemic outcomes than the no agreement condition (H 2 A), and that the relationship between agreement and epistemic outcomes would be mediated by the experience of shared reality (H 2 B). I also hypothesized that a <b>substance</b> <b>evaluation</b> would lead to greater shared reality and epistemic outcomes than a style evaluation, but only in the persuaded agreement condition (H 3). Results supported H 1 and H 2 A, partially supported H 2 B, but did not support H 3. The fortuitous and persuaded agreement conditions yielded greater shared reality, higher belief certainty, and greater epistemic trust than the no agreement condition. Agreement type’s effect on epistemic trust was mediated by the experience of shared reality but shared reality did not mediate the relationship between agreement type and belief certainty. A substance (vs. style) evaluation did not lead to greater shared reality or epistemic benefits. These findings fill an important gap in the literature and highlight the utility of considering both how agreement is reached and the resulting experience of shared reality when examining epistemic outcomes of agreement...|$|E
30|$|Currently, under REACH such a {{quantitative}} WoE scheme is missing. Certainly, there are arguments like for example improved objectivity that {{speaks for the}} development of such a scheme once enough experience is available with handling WoE assessments. However, one major drawback of this development would be the loss of flexibility that comes with it. Under REACH, regulators have to use the data available within the system. The generation of additional data is only possible within certain boundaries in the process of <b>substance</b> <b>evaluation</b> (Title VI, Chapter 2 of REACH). This is a resource- and time-consuming procedure for all involved actors. The open definition of what constitutes a WoE cited above represents a legally intended way of dealing with this situation in a flexible manner. The setting of certain criteria, scores or ranges and enforcing quantification would lead to a loss of this flexibility.|$|E
30|$|The <b>substance</b> <b>evaluation</b> (SEv) process {{involves}} an in depth {{analysis of a}} carefully selected set of substances (e.g. missing information about substance properties reflecting risks or exposure-related information) and highlight {{where there is a}} need for further risk management or regulation. These data gaps can be addressed by ECHA's decision on additional requirements on the registrant. In those cases where the SEv process identifies a need for further regulation, authorisation requirements or restrictions might be initiated. Only a few substances have been taken through the SEv process to date, and so the value of this new instrument will only become clear in future. The first results of the evaluation processes show that some exposure scenarios and RMM from the first registrations may be very schematic, incomplete, inadequate, and/or overprotective and may not respect the hierarchy of RMM. The SEv is a promising instrument to identify work-related risks and to decide if further regulation is needed.|$|E

The model posits that all person judgments reflect <b>substance</b> and <b>evaluation</b> to different extents. The evaluation component reflects an interaction between the item’s evaluative tone and the perceiver’s evaluative attitude regarding the target person. The model may function as an integrative framework that helps improve conceptual clarity and cumulative progress in person perception research...|$|R
