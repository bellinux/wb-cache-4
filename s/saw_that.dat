5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed his opinion when he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the director Vadim Jean and producer Rod Brown were very enthusiastic and cooperative.|$|E

5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go.

5|$|Lee's audio cables met {{resistance}} at first, {{because most}} audio cabling {{at the time}} was zip cord provided by audio vendors for free.

5|$|The Athenian {{commanders in}} Corinth, Iphicrates, who {{commanded}} the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry, {{and decided to}} take advantage of this fact. Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth, while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit, flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites.|$|E
5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either {{responded to the}} call for boarders or had taken refuge below.

5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|After Philip's {{withdrawal}} from his campaign against Rhodes, the Rhodians {{were free to}} attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other Cretan allies. Rhodes' search for allies in Crete bore fruit when the Cretan city of Knossos <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the war was going in Rhodes' favour and decided to join Rhodes {{in an attempt to}} gain supremacy over the island. Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.|$|E

5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency.

After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E

At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first time}} brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time.
