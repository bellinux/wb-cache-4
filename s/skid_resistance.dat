25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. They also can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset through the long life cycle of the pavement. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, dowel bar retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> in older concrete pavement.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} a statistical relation was sought between the <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> of road surfaces {{and the relative}} road risks. In the concept of accident quotient the number of accidents that occurs on a certain section of road within {{a certain period of}} time is related to the total number of kilometres travelled on that section in the period concerned. The involvement quotient is the number of vehicles which, per million vehicle-kilometers travelled, subdivided into the categories passenger cars and goods vehicles, has been involved in an accident on a certain road surface. In order to eliminate influences other than <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance,</b> a distinction has been drawn between two types of road. Type I comprises roads with dual carriageways. Type II, which is a more discontinuous type, comprises all the other roads. The accident data (60, 000 accidents) were based on records kept by the police. Vehicle-kilometers have been calculated only in so far as they were travelled during rainfall or, alternatively, when non rain was falling. The accidents which occurred on a wet road surface, but not during rainfall, constitute a situation concerning which little can be said with certainty and have been assigned to the <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> class of the wet road and to the class of dry road surfaces too. It appears from the research that each lower <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> class is associated with a higher accident quotient.

40|$|This is {{the first}} report of SWOV Working Group "Tyres, road {{surfaces}} and skidding accidents". Skidding {{is considered to be}} an important contributory factor in traffic accidents. Skidding can in principle be prevented in two ways, viz: (1) reduction of the minimum necessary friction, and (2) increasing the available friction. The minimum necessary friction depends on the desired driving behavior which is affected mainly by factors associated with the road, the vehicle, other traffic and the weather. The available friction depends {{on the nature of the}} contact between the tire and the road surface. Various investigations have shown that, among other factors, the <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> of the raod surface influences the likelihood of skidding and hence of an accident. However, it has not yet been possible, on the basis of these investigations, to determine a definite 'minimum necessary' value for the <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> of a road surface. Nevertheless, the working group on tires, road surfaces and skidding accidents considers it very important for a fixed minimum <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> for the surfaces of all roads in the netherlands to be recommended immediately, even if this value is provisional. Its conclusion is that [...] partly for the sake of uniformity [...] the guide value already employed by the state road laboratory for many years for state roads and recently also for secondary roads, should be recommended as a provisional guide value for the <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> of all roads in the netherlands. This minimum <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> for a wet road surface, expressed as the coefficient of friction, measured with a standardized patterned measuring tire at 86 % longitudinal slip and a road speed of 50 km/h, is 0. 51. However, the working group considers that more research is necessary before a definitive value can be recommended. It will also be necessary to seek other concrete measures which might reduce the incidence of skidding. A research program for this purpose is suggested. /Author/...|$|R

40|$|This study forms {{part of an}} {{extended}} research programme of the Working Group on Tyres, Road-surfaces and Skidding accidents. According {{to the terms of}} reference a statistical relationship had to be established between the <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> of a road-surface and the number of accidents per million vehicle kilometres, based on available data. The research procedure for studying <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> had to be developed taking into consideration its possible use in future by the authorities in establishing a traffic safety programme. Wherever possible, the research results should be directly applicable for establishing the necessary counter measures. The research has been carried out on the basic data referring to the years 1965 and 1966. It covers nearly all important road sectors of the Dutch motorway system in which two road types have been distinguished. Road type I, comprises mainly roads with (separate) dual carriageways, while Road type 11 comprise all other types of roads, such as dual carriageways, and single lane roads. The data on road-surface <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance,</b> used in this study, refer to wet road-surfaces. The high degree of <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> of dry road-surfaces cannot normally be matched by any kind of wet road-surface. Thus also the available volume data had to be related to wet road-surfaces, and this was only possible by analysing material collected during times of precipitation. The manner in which road-surfaces dry up is not yet sufficiently understood. The accident data contain a direct indication of the weather conditions. Thus, the terms of reference also included, and mainly concentrated on, the atmospheric conditions of rain. Accidents on road-surfaces made extremely slippery by snow, sleet, frost, were excluded from the investigation. The relative road risk referred to in the terms of reference, is expressed in the study in two ways. The term "accident quotient" indicates the relationship between the number of accidents, occurring on a given road-sector in a given period of time, and the total number of vehicle kilometres for the same road-sector and the same period of time. When the number of cars of a given category, involved in accidents, is compared with the total number of vehicle kilometres covered by the given category, the quotient of involvement is established. The quotient of involvement in the present study is not only established for the total of all cars per road type, but also separately for passenger cars and goods vehicles. The above-mentioned quotients have been calculated for all classes of road-surface <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> from fairly well detailed basic material.

40|$|Skidder {{mobility}} during timber extraction {{is defined}} by: 1) basic dimensional {{features of the}} vehicle, 2) ability to overcome obstacles during movement, 3) traction performance and 4) environmental soundness. Traction performance depends on the ground conditions (soil bearing capacity) and the total effect of all forces on the vehicle. In downhill skidding, the skidder is under great influence of parallel component of forces, adhesion weight and longitudinal terrain slope, which combined result in negative traction force, torque and thrust force. When the horizontal component of rope force is equal to zero i. e. {{the moment when the}} weight of the load and resistance to traction are in equilibrium, the slope angle α is a function of load mass distribution factor and <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> factor. This is a »turning point« that can be defined as a critical slope because the load starts to push the vehicle downhill, which results in negative horizontal component of rope force. Depending on skidder Ecotrac 120 V dimensional features, centre of gravity, load mass distribution factor, <b>skidding</b> <b>resistance</b> factor of previous research, five different loads were analyzed (1 to 5 tonnes) in order to define the critical slope angle for each of them. Critical slope for downhill skidding of 1 tonne timber is on longitudinal slope of – 26 %, for 2 tonne timber on – 30 %, 3 tonne timber on – 34 %, 4 timber on – 38 % and for 5 tonne timber on – 43 % of terrain longitudinal slope. Even though skidding bigger load increases vehicle mobility to even greater slope angles, the most important in downhill skidding, is to avoid blocking of the wheels, which will lead to a complete vehicle slippage and the driver must be constantly aware of that fact. The general recommendation should be that skidding small loads (1 to 3 tonnes) downhill is suitable for smaller longitudinal terrain slopes (up to maximum – 34 %), while the heavier the load, the further down the slope the skidder can go. The load of 5 tonnes »anchors« the skidder better and therefore it can go on terrain slopes up to – 43 %, during which less traction force is used (torque is used for braking) and skidder pulls the load by its own weight. It can be concluded that extending the operating range of skidder onto steeper slopes with heavier loads has the potential to decrease harvesting costs and increase productivity...|$|R

A total of 424 batches of asphalt concrete mixtures and 3, 960 Marshall and Hveem specimens were examined.

50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} is a pavement preservation {{technique that}} corrects {{a variety of}} surface imperfections on both concrete and asphalt pavements.

Diamond grinding restores rideability by removing surface irregularities caused during construction or through repeated traffic loading over time.

50|$|Another type of {{profilograph}} {{system is}} {{for measuring the}} surface texture of a road and how {{it relates to the}} coefficient of friction and thus to <b>skid</b> <b>resistance.</b> Pavement texture is divided into three categories; megatexture, macrotexture, and microtexture. Microtexture cannot currently be measured directly, except in a laboratory. Megatexture is measured using a similar profiling method as when obtaining IRI values, while macrotexture is the measurement of the individual variations of the road within a small interval of a few centimeters. For example, a road which has gravel spread on top followed by an asphalt seal coat will have a high macrotexture, and a road built with concrete slabs will have low macrotexture. For this reason, concrete is often grooved or roughed up immediately after it is laid on the road bed to increase the friction between the tire and road.|$|E

5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder.

Road safety studies indicate that approximately 20 % of all road accidents occurred during wet weather, and that the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> of wet pavements have a major influence on the occurrences of wet-weather accidents. Monitoring of wet pavement <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> has been an integral part of a typical pavement management system. However, because of the lack of prediction capability of pavement <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> under various rainfall intensities, the minimum <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> threshold for safe wet-weather driving has been specified by highway agencies based on either engineering judgement or past experience. It is shown in this paper that the single-point minimum <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> threshold is inadequate to offer a complete description of the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> performance of the pavement sections in question for effective management of a road network. It is unable to assess the risk involved in an actual wet-weather condition where the pavement surface water-film thickness and vehicle speed are different from standard test conditions. This limitation of the current system of specifying a minimum <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> threshold can be overcome by adopting a theoretically sound approach to represent pavement <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> under different conditions of water-film thickness and vehicle speed. This paper describes the theoretical basis of the approach and the development of a mechanistically derived three-dimensional finite-element <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> simulation model to predict <b>skid</b> <b>resistance.</b> The application of the proposed approach and the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> prediction procedure in pavement management system and wet-weather driving safety assessment is presented...|$|E
