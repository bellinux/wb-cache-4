40|$|Laser {{beam welding}} bears evident {{advantages}} regarding precision, quality, productivity, low heat input, and feasibility of automation. At {{the same time}} the process calls for high precision of the beam positioning on the workpiece, which therefore imposes high requirements of welding trajectory and feed rate accuracy; e. g., for butt welding {{the focal point of the}} laser beam with respect to the joint must be maintained within a typical accuracy better than 20 - 150 mu m, depending on the focused beam radius. To meet these requirements, seam-tracking devices are used. A sensor measures the joint position and computes a correction vector to compensate the joint trajectory offset. The deviation is compensated either by a robot trajectory adjustment or by an additional tracking axis. This paper describes the basic concepts of seam tracking in detail and points out problems in the different control principles, which are evoked by the forerun of the sensor. State-of-the-art sensors and error compensating techniques are presented and analyzed. Further, a new approach for seam tracking is introduced.

25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch.

30|$|Figure  11 {{shows the}} result of the {{ultrasonic}} examination for determining the degree of filling of seam loop C. Influences due to a deviation of the <b>seam</b> loop <b>position</b> in the sensor can be excluded because of the good coupling. The red marked areas in coupling evaluation in the upper seam bond area b arises due to the larger active sensor area (6.5  mm) in contrast to the flange length of seam area b (6  mm). Consequently, the inner sheet is sounded in this area, whereby the echo resulting from the material transition is generated outside the gate for an OK coupling. A change in the orientation of the seam bond loop of the sample within the sensor can be excluded as a further factor influencing the result. For this purpose, the straight edge of the laboratory sample has been investigated in this series of tests. Consequently, it can be ensured that the ultrasound results are solely related to the adhesive distribution and not to the geometrical shape of the seam bond or the orientation of the seam loop. Further investigations must show the extent to which this can be ensured later in the series process.|$|R
40|$|Precise {{positioning}} of the laser beam on the work piece is crucial for high quality laser welds; e. g. for butt welding {{the focal point of}} the laser beam with respect to the joint must be maintained within an accuracy better than 20 m - 150 m, depending on the focused beam radius. These stringent accuracy requirements call for high precision robots, a repeatable work piece profile and precise clamping. To compensate for insufficient repeatability of work piece or clamping, seam-tracking devices are used. A sensor measures the joint position and computes a correction vector to follow the actual joint trajectory. The deviation is compensated either by robot trajectory adjustment or by an additional tracking axis. Disadvantages of this approach are complex installation of the devices due to interfacing with the robot control, the need of teaching and calibrating the sensor and principle based accuracy restriction that limit the usability in more complex 2 d contours and with l ow accuracy robots. We recently introduced a more flexible and precise approach that utilizes an advanced camera-based sensor that is capable of measuring <b>seam</b> <b>position,</b> relative displacement between work piece and sensor and melt pool of the process with one single device.

Although the deltaic {{nature of these}} sediments has long been established, mining and exploration activities in the district require {{a thorough understanding of}} small areas within the delta environment. Coal quantity and quality trends in the Hazard # 7 seam, the major producer in the area, have been examined in detail. The # 7 coal accumulated in a peat swamp restricted laterally by a major fluvial channel. Three types of non-coal parting are recognized. Thin, tabular, fine-grained partings resulted from periods of increased terrigenous influx into the swamp. Lenticular crevasse-splay deposits locally split the coal. Wedge-shaped, fine- to coarse-grained partings, of probable levee origin, are found along the channel margin. Post-swamp deposits consist of thick bay-fill shales, thin shales, silt- and sandstones deposited on floodplains, and channel-fill sandstones and gravels. The modeling technique discussed provides guidance for mine development and regional exploration by prediction of coal seam quantity and quality trends from local geologic features. The thickest # 7 coal is split by thin tabular partings and is overlain by thick shale sequences. Coal overlain by silt and sandstone is thinner and unsplit, and typically of higher heat value.

The implementation of robotic technology into welding processes is made difficult by the inherent process variables of part location, fit up, orientation and repeatability. Considering these aspects, to ensure weld reproducibility consistency and quality, advanced adaptive control techniques are essential. These involve not only the development of adequate sensors for seam tracking and joint recognition but also developments of overall machines {{with a level of}} artificial intelligence sufficient for automated welding. The development of such a prototype system which utilizes a manipulator arm, ultrasonic sensors and a transistorised welding power source is outlined. This system incorporates three essential aspects. It locates and tracks the welding <b>seam</b> ensuring correct <b>positioning</b> of the welding head relatively to the joint preparation. Additionally, it monitors the joint profile of the molten weld pool and modifies the relevant heat input parameters ensuring consistent penetration, joint filling and acceptable weld bead shape. Finally, it makes use of both the above information to reconstruct three-dimensional images of the weld pool silhouettes providing in-process inspection capabilities of the welded joints.

40|$|The coal-bearing sediments of the Antelope coal {{field in}} the southcentral Powder River Basin, Wyoming were {{deposited}} in paludal and tributary subsystems of the fluvial system {{that existed in the}} basin during the early Tertiary. A depositional model for the Antelope coal field was constructed from data collected from approximately 500 drill holes that penetrated the upper 90 meters (300 feet) of the Fort Union Formation. The depositional environments were interpreted from lithologic descriptions and guidelines established in the literature. The two main coal seams at the Antelope coal field are the Anderson and stratigraphically lower Canyon coal seams. They represent poorly-drained swamp depositional environments. Each of the coal seams exhibit splits into multiple and thinner coal seams to the southwest. The parting rocks that lie between these splits, sedimentary structures, and isopach maps of the partings indicate that crevasse splaying with lacustrine and small channel development caused the observed splits in the coal seams. Distal overbank deposits occur {{at the top of the}} Canyon seam and at the base of the Anderson seam; well-drained swamp deposits and crevasse splay, lacustrine, lacustrine delta, and small channel-fill deposits occur in between the coal seams. The rocks underlying the Canyon coal seam suggest that the area of the Antelope coal field was a poorly-drained swamp that developed into a well-drained swamp with minor small channel development. The area once again digressed to a poorly-drained swamp which was the beginning of the Canyon coal swamp. The rocks overlying the Anderson seam represent a combination of the environments mentioned above with deposits from lacustrine and well-drained swamp environments dominating. The observed splits in the Anderson and Canyon coal seams to the southwest at the Antelope coal field suggest that a change in the fluvial system and/or tectonic stability of the Powder River Basin occurred and affected deposition in the southcentral portion of the basin. A combination of 1) relative basin subsidence, 2) a prograding and aggrading trunk stream with a thick levee deposit, and 3) peat accumulation that kept pace with relative basin subsidence are proposed mechanisms for the formation of the thick, continuous coal seams present in the basin and a disturbance or change in any of these processes could produce the splits observed in the Anderson and Canyon coal 2 ̆ 2 Seams at the Antelope coal field. Syn- and post-depositional processes that have affected the coal quality and reserves at the Antelope coal field include compaction, erosion and deposition from modern stream action, and burning and oxidation of the coal <b>seams.</b> The <b>position</b> of the paleowater table during stream downcutting and erosion of the coal seams controlled the occurrence and extent of oxidation and burning. Exploration and development of the Antelope coal deposit can be executed in a more efficient manner by using the depositional model. Future exploration drilling programs, design of the mine site, mining and marketing the coal, and later reclamation of the mined area are all affected by the depositional model...|$|R
