50|$|<b>Sandpapers</b> {{can also}} be open coat, where the {{particles}} are separated {{from each other and}} the <b>sandpaper</b> is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the <b>sandpaper.</b> Wet and dry <b>sandpaper</b> is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface. Arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sanding block}} is a block {{used to hold}} <b>sandpaper.</b> In its {{simplest}} form, it is a block of wood or cork with one smooth flat side. The user wraps the <b>sandpaper</b> around the block, and holds it in place (by inserting a fitted piece of cardboard under the <b>sandpaper,</b> one can soften {{the impact on the}} wood and protect against tears or uneven wear on the <b>sandpaper).</b> Sanding blocks are helpful because they prevent the [...] "waves" [...] created by plain <b>sandpaper.</b>|$|R
50|$|In boat {{building}} lots of sanding requires {{using either}} dry <b>sandpaper,</b> or {{wet and dry}} paper, to achieve a reasonable paint or varnish finish. <b>Sandpaper</b> is graded from 40 (very coarse) to 400 (ultrafine). Wet and dry <b>sandpaper</b> lasts longer than dry <b>sandpaper.</b> Wet and dry is best used on paint finishes, while dry paper is best used on dry wood. About 2 sheets of <b>sandpaper</b> for every foot of hull length is a good guide. Less sheet <b>sandpaper</b> is needed if power sanders are used. Spatula applicators, with a flexible stainless steel blade, are used to apply filler. A knife type and a flat 3"(75mm) type will cover most needs.|$|R
50|$|Attrition {{occurs when}} waves cause loose pieces of rock debris (scree) {{to collide with}} each other, {{grinding}} and chipping each other, progressively becoming smaller, smoother and rounder.

5000|$|Melody Maker likened {{listening}} to the record to <b>sandpapering</b> your ears. End of year readers polls, however, showed the opening track and lead single of the album, [...] "Dalliance", amongst {{the top of the}} favourites list. Almost directly after recording the album, the band announced that they had sacked Solowka. His replacement was Paul Dorrington of local band, Tse Tse Fly (also formerly of A.C. Temple). Solowka teamed up again with Liggins and Remeynes to form The Ukrainians, and continued to blend post-punk with traditional Ukrainian music.|$|E

5000|$|A primary {{example of}} {{hydraulic}} {{action is a}} wave striking a cliff face which compresses the air in cracks of the rocks. This exerts pressure on the surrounding rock which can progressively crack, break, splinter and detach rock particles. This {{is followed by the}} decompression of the air as the wave retreats which can occur suddenly with explosive force which additionally weakens the rock. Cracks are gradually widened so each wave compresses more air, increasing the explosive force of its release. Thus, the effect intensifies in a 'positive feedback' system. Over time, as the cracks may grow they sometimes form a sea cave. The broken pieces that fall off produce two additional types of erosion, abrasion (<b>sandpapering)</b> and attrition. In corrasion, the newly formed chunks are thrown against the rock face. Attrition is a similar effect caused by eroded particles after they fall to the sea bed where they are subjected to further wave action. In coastal areas wave hydraulic action is often the most important form of erosion.Similarly, where hydraulic action is strong enough to loosen sediment along a stream bed and its banks; this will take rocks and particles from the banks and bed of the stream and add this to the stream's load. This process is the result of friction between the moving water and the static stream bed and banks. This friction increases with the speed of the water and the roughness of the bed. Once loosened the smaller particles are actually held in suspension by the force of the flowing water, these suspended particles can scour the sides and bottom of the stream. The scouring action produces distinctive markings on streams beds such as ripple marks, fluting, and crescent marks. The larger particles and even large rocks are scooted (dragged) along the bottom in a process known as traction which causes attrition, and are often [...] "bounced" [...] along in a process known as saltation where the force of the water temporarily lifts the rock particle which then crashes back into the bed dislodging other particles.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out the {{dormancy}} breaking and the seed germination of Asam kuranji (Dialium indum L.) mechanically by <b>sandpapering</b> the seeds and chemically by immersing them in sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4). The experiment was conducted at the Plant Physiology Laboratory of Agricultural Faculty of Lambung Mangkurat University from June - August 2013 using Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 2 x 4 factorial. The first factor was the mechanical treatment  (s 0 = without sandpaper and s 1 = with sandpaper), the second factor was the chemical treatment (a 0 = without immersion, a 1 = 70 % of H 2 SO 4, a 2 = 80 % of H 2 SO 4, and a 3 = 90 % of H 2 SO 4. The data were analyzed by ANOVA at the level of 95 % followed by Tukey's test at the level test of 95 %. The results showed that the treatments of <b>sandpapering</b> and immersing the seeds significantly affected the % of germination, the length of radicle and the length of hypocotyl. The interaction between treatments of <b>sandpapering</b> and immersion indicated that the higher the concentration of H 2 SO 4 immersion the higher the % of germination, the length of radicle and the length of hypocotyl.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the effect}} of mechanical surface treatments of adhesive bonded joints. The behaviour of an adhesively bonded joint can be considered good if cohesive failure is achieved, while when interfacial failure occurs the performances are normally much worse. A key parameter which drives the failure type is the surface treatment applied to the adherends. This work analyzes, by means of a structured experimental campaign, which surface mechanical treatment gives the best performance. The design of the experimental approach used involves different materials, joint geometries, and surface treatments. The results are investigated in terms of force, energy, and stresses in the joints and the performance of the several mechanical treatments tested is assessed, showing that a simple correlation with the surface roughness is not sufficient to predict the best joint performances. The reliable results obtained prove that <b>sandpapering</b> or sandblasting the adherends gives a strong improvement in terms of performance and leads to a higher probability of cohesive failure...|$|E

40|$|A {{well known}} phenomenon, the "built-up edge - BUE", {{occurs at the}} chip/tool {{interface}} when multiphase materials are machined at low cutting speeds. Under high compressive stresses, seizure prevents the material from sliding over the tool’s rake face. Although many reports have been published on the subject, studies of the BUE phenomenon have been marked {{by a lack of}} precision in determining its dimensions. This paper reports on a study of the BUE geometry of a SAE 12 L 14 steel machined at low speeds with and without a cutting fluid. Three quick-stop samples were prepared for each test condition (9 cutting speeds, with and without cutting fluid). The quick-stop samples were mounted perpendicularly in transparent acrylic resin to facilitate observation and the hardened resin sandpapered. The opposite face of the mounted sample was then ground to make the front and back faces parallel. After <b>sandpapering</b> and polishing, the samples were digitally photographed and their BUE geometries determined using an image analyzer. The measurements were done along the cutting width at five different points. It was found that the BUE dimensions varied considerably along the cutting width, and that the fluid reduced the BUE at the lowest cutting speed tested...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{capacity}} of Candida albicans adherence is one ofits main factors of virulence. Surfaces of different materials canpropitiate conditions for {{higher or lower}} adherence and greater virulence of the microorganisms. Objective: Evaluate the adherence of Candida albicans in cobalto-chromium and titanium alloys, with different <b>sandpapering.</b> Material and methods: Twenty-four cylindrical samples have been constructed, 12 of titanium and 12 of cobalt-chromium, divided in 4 groups of six. All have been polished in the habitual form by the same technician. Samples have been sandpapered at about high rotation for 15 seconds each sandpaper, on all its surface. A group of each metal was sandpapered only with sandpaper for metal number 80. The two other groups have been sandpapered {{in agreement with the}} sequence (decreasing granulation) : 80, 150 and 220. Samples have been sterilized and located in plates of cells culture. In each well of the plate was added standardized amount of Sabouraud broth and suspension containing 106 cells per milliliter of C. albicans (ATCC 18804). After incubation, the number of adhered cells per mm 2 was obtained by the method of sowing in plate of Petri. The obtained values have been tabulated and submitted to the tests of ANOVA and Tukey,with level of significance of 5 %.

40|$|International audienceMost of the {{measurement}} {{strategies that are}} suggested {{at the international level}} to assess workplace exposure to nanomaterials rely on devices measuring, in real time, airborne particles concentrations (according different metrics). Since none of the instruments to measure aerosols can distinguish a particle of interest to the background aerosol, the statistical analysis of time resolved data requires special attention. So far, very few approaches have been used for statistical analysis in the literature. This ranges from simple qualitative analysis of graphs to the implementation of more complex statistical models. To date, there is still no consensus on a particular approach and the current period is always looking for an appropriate and robust method. In this context, this exploratory study investigates a statistical method to analyse time resolved data based on a Bayesian probabilistic approach. To investigate and illustrate the use of the this statistical method, particle number concentration data from a workplace study that investigated the potential for exposure via inhalation from cleanout operations by <b>sandpapering</b> of a reactor producing nanocomposite thin films have been used. In this workplace study, the background issue has been addressed through the near-field and far-field approaches and several size integrated and time resolved devices have been used. The analysis of the results presented here focuses only on data obtained with two handheld condensation particle counters. While one was measuring at the source of the released particles, the other one was measuring in parallel far-field [...] The Bayesian probabilistic approach allows a probabilistic modelling of data series, and the observed task is modelled in the form of probability distributions. The probability distributions issuing from time resolved data obtained at the source can be compared with the probability distributions issuing from the time resolved data obtained far-field, leading in a quantitative estimation of the airborne particles released at the source when the task is performed. Beyond obtained results, this exploratory study indicates that the analysis of the results requires specific experience in statistics...|$|E
