The <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symbols are split into categories of mandatory action <b>signs,</b> prohibition <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> warning symbols. Thirty <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symbols printed in <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> in Chinese were distributed to 560 construction personnel working in eight different construction sites in Hong Kong. The results drawn from 388 respondents indicate that substantial problems exist in comprehending the <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symbols that are posted in construction sites.

40|$|Abstract—System {{usability}} scale (SUS) {{was initially}} {{developed as a}} tool for measuring the subjective usability of industrial systems evaluation. The SUS has now been used for various evaluations such as voicemail system, virtual keyboard, paper ballots, mobile phone, and website. Usability is a critical parameter for considering the effectiveness of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> However, the application of SUS for usability assessment of <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> or other graphical symbols had never been seen. This study was undertaken to investigate how the SUS could be used for determining the usability of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Three hundred <b>and</b> ninety-eight participants (17 – 58 years old) were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire on <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehension first <b>and</b> then SUS which was modified in accordance to the unique contexts <b>and</b> functions of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> The results showed that the SUS offers a valid and robust measurement for practitioners to measure the usability of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Besides, the SUS provides valuable benchmark information about the comprehension performance of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Moreover, the SUS is a point estimate measure of usability which can be used to positively supplement a usability testing <b>and</b> evaluation for <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> quickly <b>and</b> easily. Overall, this study would serve as a valuable reference on assessing the usability of <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> other graphical symbols with the SUS instrument.

Color conveys messages and is {{an important element in}} <b>safety</b> <b>signs,</b> as it provides extra information to users. However, very limited recent research has focused on children and their color association in the context of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> This study thus examined how children use colors in drawing different <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> how they associate colors with different concepts and objects that appear in <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Drawing was used to extract children's use of color and the associations they made between <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> colors. The child participants were given 12 referents of different <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> were asked to design <b>and</b> draw the <b>signs</b> using different colored felt-tip pens. They were also asked to give reasons for their choices of colors. Significant associations were found between red and ‘don't’, orange and ‘hands’, and blue and ‘water’. The child participants were only able to attribute the reasons for the use of yellow, green, blue and black through concrete identification and concrete association, and red through abstract association. The children's use of color quite differs from that shown in the ISO registered signs. There is a need to consider the use of colors carefully when designing signs specifically for children. Sign designers should take children's color associations in consideration and be aware if there are any misunderstandings. School of Desig...|$|R

Therefore, the present pilot study sought to assess the quality of a VE prototype that was specifically designed to conduct <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> research with middle-aged working adults (50 - 65 yrs). Using a work-related context, and a sample of twelve workers, the study consisted of two key moments: 1) to examine the workers’ interaction, by evaluating their behavioral compliance; and 2) to analyze their overall user experience, by assessing their subjective perceptions. In order to undergo such an evaluation, the following VE interaction issues were addressed: simulator sickness, sense of presence, level of engagement and hazard perception. Both behavioral and subjective data were gathered from three sources: observation, post-hoc questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that: 1) the VE's workplace <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> were ineffective in promoting behavioral compliance; and 2) despite the occurrence of some simulator sickness, overall, participants had high levels of presence and engagement, as well as correctly perceived the VE's hazard.

Faulty <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> design could lead to increased potential risks in public places. This thesis was aimed to propose a comprehensive approach in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation by integrating physiological measures and nontraditional subjective measures that have not been used in previous <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation studies, in addition to the existing subjective evaluation methods such as guessability score <b>and</b> cognitive <b>sign</b> features. The secondary objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of cultural differences in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehension. In addition, this study also investigated the utilization of users’ feedback and ergonomic design principles in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> redesign attempt. In total, 100 participants (forty Westerners and sixty Koreans) participated in the first major experiment which was focused on investigating cultural difference effects during <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehension. A set of newly introduced water-sport <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> was used in this study. In addition, a redesign attempt was done on the poorly comprehended signs by utilizing participants’ feedback from both groups, while taking into account ergonomic principles of good design. The second major experiment was aimed to fill the existing gaps in traditional <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluating methods, by investigating physiological measures (heart rate, eye tracking measures, EEG signal) and nontraditional subjective measurements (perceived cognitive load and compliance to ergonomic design principles) which were hypothesized to reflect cognitive load elicited by a <b>safety</b> <b>sign.</b> A total of forty two Koreans participated in this study, and two sets of frequently used <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> (traffic <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> healthcare symbols) were used as stimuli. The first experiment results suggested that people who come from different cultural origins may have different perception and understanding regarding a set of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Therefore, findings from our first study justified the importance of designing multi-culturally compatible <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Considering ergonomic design principles as well as participants’ feedback was also proven to be noteworthy in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> redesign attempt. The second experiment provided evidences that several physiological measures such as eye tracking measures and EEG spectral power in several brain regions were able to reflect a <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehensibility level in the form of cognitive load. Some nontraditional subjective measures investigated in the second experiment such as perceived cognitive load and compliance to ergonomic design principles were also able to reflect sign comprehensibility. Among the physiological measures and the nontraditional subjective measures investigated in the second major experiment, several measures such as: blinking rates, maximum and average pupil diameter, time to first fixation, EEG spectral power in prefrontal and visual cortex, perceived cognitive load, as well as compliance to ergonomic design principles were found to be consistent when applied to different types of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Consequently, we assumed that these measures could be applied across different types of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> As a follow on to our study’s findings, we proposed a framework of a comprehensive <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation utilizing the consistent measures investigated in the second major experiment, in addition to using the traditional subjective evaluation methods. We also included other factors (e. g., cultural difference, cognitive features, and ergonomic design principles) which were proven to play an important role in a <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> redesign attempt, in our proposed framework. By this, we hope to provide adequate amount of evidences concerning a particular sign’s comprehensibility level and fill the existing gaps in the traditional <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation <b>and</b> redesign approach. clos...|$|R
