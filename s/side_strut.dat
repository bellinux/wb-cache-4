40|$|Into {{the nacelle}} The problem becomes easiest {{when there are}} {{outboard}} engine nacelles, for the nacelle usually provides ample space for housing the gear and gives the proper tread with the wheels located under the concenetrated loads. On a high wing monoplane design with engines in the leading edge, the landing gear must be very high. Because of the great height {{it is almost impossible}} to take the side loads as a cantilever, and therefore the design must be complicated by <b>side</b> <b>struts</b> to the fuselage as on the General YO- 27 (see illustration) where they remain out in the air-stream when the wheel is retracted. In the new Dutch built Fokker F-XX a compromise apparently has been reached by retaining the high wing and lowering the engine nacelles below the wing so that a completely retractable gear can be obtained with no <b>side</b> <b>struts</b> to the fuselage, the nacelles carrying all the load. Fokker seems to have decided that the slightly increased drag of the lowered nacelles did not offset the advantages of the high wing, with its inherently less drag and greater lift as well as its absence of buffeting and better passenger vision. (see page 59 and references 3, 4 and 5). However...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of wind tunnel tests made to determine the interference drag arising from various arrangements of streamline struts and round struts, or cylinders. Determinations were made of the interference drag of <b>struts</b> spaced <b>side</b> by <b>side,</b> <b>struts</b> in tandem, tandem struts encased in a single fairing, a strut intersecting a plane, and struts intersecting to form a v. Three sizes of struts were used for most of the tests. These tests show that the interference drag arising from struts in close proximity may be of considerable magnitude, in some instances amounting to more than the drag of the struts themselves...|$|R

50|$|The much revised Rs.II {{had four}} more {{reliable}} Maybach Mb.IVa engines fitted in push pull nacelles mounted on struts above the hull at approx. mid gap. Initially the biplane tail cellule was retained with large fins and rudders {{attached to the}} tail boom side members; the tail unit was later made more conventional with a large tailplane and twin fins with rudders. Take-off performance was improved by moving the step further aft but the take-off run was still excessive. The upper wing was also lowered by shortening the centre section struts and moving the mounts for the <b>side</b> <b>struts</b> to halfway {{down the sides of}} the fuselage. Other changes included aerodynamic balance surfaces for the ailerons, lower wings with reduced chord and rounded tips.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{underside}} sloped upward aft to the tail, where a low fin served {{also as a}} step {{on which}} to mount a rectangular tailplane braced on each <b>side</b> with <b>struts</b> to the lower side of the hull. It carried angle-tipped, balanced elevators. The roughly rhomboidal, generous rudder was also balanced.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the combustion of hydrogen perpendicularly injected from step fuel injectors into a Mach 2. 72, 2100 K vitiated test gas was conducted. The model simulated the flow between the center and <b>side</b> <b>struts</b> of an integrated scramjet module at Mach 7 flight and an altitude of 29 km. Parametric variation included equivalence ratio, fuel dynamic pressure ratio, and area distribution of the model. The overall area ratio of the model was held constant at 2. 87. The data analysis indicated that no measurable improvement in mixing or combustion efficiency was obtained by varying the fuel dynamic pressure ratio from 0. 79 to 2. 45. Computations indicated approximately 80 percent of the fuel was mixed {{so that it could}} react; however, only approximately 50 percent of the mixed fuel actually reacted in two test configurations, and 74 percent in later tests where less area expansion of the flow occurred...|$|R
40|$|The study aims at {{illustrating}} {{the effects of}} strut and injector interactions and strut wakes not totally simulated in previous, less complex, direct-connect hardware. In addition, {{the influence of the}} relative location of the injectors on opposite <b>sides</b> of each <b>strut</b> and the effect of injector spacing are evaluated. It is shown that better mixing efficiency is attained by locating the fuel injectors on opposite <b>sides</b> of a <b>strut</b> so that the jets come together, rather than being staggered, in the strut wake. It is not possible to determine the combustion efficiency by means of a one-dimensional analysis of the wall pressure...|$|R
50|$|Intraocular lens (IOL) is a lens {{implanted}} in the eye {{as part of a}} treatment for cataracts or myopia. The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy eye's natural lens (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural crystalline lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens, and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia, or nearsightedness. IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic <b>side</b> <b>struts,</b> called haptics, to hold the lens in place within the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs which provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs which provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.|$|R

Static pressure distributions were obtained on the <b>side</b> nacelle <b>strut</b> and on the fuselage (above and below the strut). Oil flow photographs of selected configurations are also presented.

25|$|The engine {{installations}} differed {{with each}} aircraft type but generally followed {{the layout of}} a single nose engine, usually driving a two-bladed propeller and with the interwing engine nacelles on either <b>side</b> suspended by <b>struts</b> between the mainplanes each housing two engines in tandem, geared to drive single pusher propellers.|$|R
50|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional, with {{a triangular}} plan tailplane mounted {{near the top}} of the fuselage and braced on each <b>side</b> with a <b>strut</b> to the lower fuselage. Its angle of incidence could be adjusted in flight by the pilot. The elevators were narrow and rectangular apart from central cut-outs to allow operation of the trapezoidal rudder, which extended down to the keel and was mounted on a triangular fin.|$|R
50|$|Its wooden framed, two spar, {{rectangular}} plan wings had {{the same}} airfoil section along the span; {{the upper and lower}} planes {{had the same}} span and chord. They formed an unstaggered, 3.5 m interplane gap, two bay structure braced with two parallel pairs of vertical interplane <b>struts</b> on each <b>side.</b> These <b>struts</b> had wooden box cores and were enclosed in duralumin sheet, airfoil section fairings. The E-5 had a 6.4 m span centre section without dihedral and outer sections with about 2° of dihedral. Inverted V-struts braced the centre of the upper wing to the upper fuselage and the engine mounting frames joined the upper and lower wings at the ends of the centre sections. Ailerons were fitted only on the upper wing and occupied about one third of the span.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of mixed}} construction, including bolted-together aluminum tubing, 4130 steel tubing, wood and dope and aircraft fabric. Its 30 ft span wing {{is supported by}} a single lift <b>strut</b> per <b>side,</b> with jury <b>struts,</b> and incorporates a unique folding mechanism. The wing folds by first hinging the outer panels onto the inner panels and then the whole wing pivots on a central steel post to allow positioning fore-and-aft for towing on its landing gear or for storage.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull propeller and a push propeller. The vortex street of the front pull propeller passes between the blades of the rear push propeller without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull propeller means that more water reaches the push propeller from the <b>sides.</b> The <b>strut</b> is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{on top of}} {{the hull}} and were braced with four sets per <b>side</b> of Warren <b>strut</b> style interplane {{structures}} comprising 'V' struts, which obviated the need for drag inducing wire bracing. The wing structure was formed with built-up steel spars, four in the top wing and three in the lower wing, and duralumin ribs riveted to the spars and braced internally. The fuselage was also made up from formed steel members built up into a framework which was then covered with fabric or dural sheeting.|$|R

The acceptable power range is [...] and the standard engine used is the [...] Continental O-470 powerplant, with a constant speed propeller. With that engine installed the take-off distance is 200 ft and the landing distance is 250 ft.|$|R
50|$|Cuauhtinchan Archeological Zone or Malinalco Archeological Zone, {{located just}} west of the town center on a hill called Cerro de los Idolos, which rises 215 meters above the town. On its sides are a number of pre-Hispanic {{structures}} built on terraces built into the hill. The main structures are at the top. This {{is one of the most}} important Aztec sites and was discovered in 1933, and explored by José Garía Payón in 1935. The visible complex dates from the Aztec Empire but the site’s use as a ceremonial center appears to be much older. The sanctuary complex was built from the mid 15th century to the beginnings of the 16th. To get to the Cerro de los Idolos one must climb 426 stairs up 125 meters. Along the stairway leading to the site, there are signs with area’s history written in Spanish, English and Nahuatl. The site contains six buildings. The Cuauhcalli or House of the Eagles, which dates from 1501, is the main building, which is significant in that it is carved out of the hill itself. The building is in the shape of a truncated pyramid, built this way due to the lack of space on the hill. The monolithic Cuauhcalli has been compared to the Ellora in India, Petra on the shores of the Dead Sea and Abu Simbel in Egypt. This was a sanctuary for the Eagle Warriors for rites such as initiation. A thirteen-step staircase leading into this temple is flanked by <b>side</b> <b>struts.</b> and two feline sculptures that face the plaza in front. The Cuauhcalli consists of two rooms, one rectangular and the other circular, with an opening in the wall between the two. After being carved out of the rock, the walls and ceiling were covered in stucco and painted with murals, most of which are almost completely gone. In the upper part, the entrance is symbolized by the open jaws of a serpent, complete with fangs, eyes and a forked tongue, which was painted red. This upper portion is covered by a thatched roof of the grass the area is named for.|$|R
50|$|The PWS-52 was {{single-engine}} {{mixed construction}} braced high-wing monoplane. A fuselage {{was built on}} a steel frame, covered with canvas and aluminium in engine part. Rectangular three-section wings with rounded tips, two-spar, were covered with plywood in forward part and canvas in a rear part. A central part of wings was some distance above the canopy, supported with <b>struts.</b> <b>Side</b> sections of wings were supported with V struts and folds rearwards. The aircraft can seat two, sitting {{side by side in}} a covered cockpit. A luggage compartment was behind a cockpit, that could fitted with a 3rd seat. The PWS-52 had a fixed conventional landing gear, with a rear skid.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} span the LeO H-23-2 {{was a true}} sesquiplane, with a lower wing span close to half that of the upper wing. The lower wing was also {{narrower}} and the ratio of wing areas was about 3:1. The upper wing had a centre-section filling 63% of the span and two outer panels; all sections were essentially rectangular, though the wingtips were slightly blunted. Narrow ailerons filled the trailing edges of the outer panels. The lower wing was mounted {{from the top of}} the hull. Both upper and lower wings combined wood and metal construction, had two spars and were fabric covered with plywood leading edges. They were braced together on each <b>side</b> with <b>struts</b> from the lower wingtips with two parallel pairs of streamlined struts, one pair leaning outwards and the other inwards; wire cross bracing strengthened the structure. A pair of N-form struts supported both the inner upper wing and the centrally positioned, pusher configuration, [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr liquid-cooled V12 engine. The engine sat on the wing in a flat-sided cowling, with its honeycomb radiator at the front and a three-bladed propeller working in a rectangular cut-out in the trailing edge.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an experimental}} study in a cavitation tunnel on the wake/strut interaction of a podded propeller model (Dp= 0. 27 m). The study includes surface pressure measurements on the strut around the leading edge, and visual investigations of cavitation tip vortices. The region of pressure measurements on the strut ranges from 0. 6 to 1. 2 of the propeller radius, Rp, {{and from the}} leading edge downstream to 0. 4 of the chord length on both <b>sides</b> of the <b>strut.</b> Within this region, the pressure measurements at 56 different locations were realized by eight repeated tests with seven pressure transducers. The transducers were relocated before each repeated test. Each test consisted of five flow speeds which varied the advance coefficient, J, from 0. 55 to 0. 87. The pressure measured on the strut surface was decomposed into, represented by, and analyzed as three components: time average, phase average, and fluctuation components. In the visual investigation, the propeller tip vortex is bent by {{the leading edge of}} the strut when the vortex approaches the strut; the vortex then keeps a minimum distance from {{the leading edge of the}} strut while it moves along the leading edge of the strut away from the shaft centerline. After the tip vortex bends, stretches, and gradually fades out around the leading edge, it appears to be separated around the two <b>sides</b> of the <b>strut</b> and propagates downstream. The vortex turns from a continuously helical line into segments. The segmented vortex is compressed on one <b>side</b> of the <b>strut</b> and stretched on the other side. The vertical distance from the end of the segmented vortex to the shaft centerline on the stretched side remains a constant. However, this vertical distance increases on the compressed side. The lower the value of the advance coefficient, the faster this distance increases. The pressure measured at points located within 0. 9 to 1. 1 of the propeller radius shows that they were dominated by the Blade Passing Frequency (BPF). The measurements outside of this range rarely showed significant variation. The largest amplitude of pressure variation was found at the leading edge of the strut near 0. 1 = p R for all tested advance coefficients. The location of the lowest pressure was found on the stretched side near the leading edge of the strut near the intersection of the pod and the strut. In cases of low advance coefficient, the pressure at some measurement points on or close to the leading edge on the compressed side demonstrated a double trough shape within a single period of filament impact.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is made predominately from wood, {{with some}} steel and aluminum also used. The fuselage is {{formed as a}} wooden geodetic lattice structure. Its 36 ft span wing is supported by a single lift <b>strut</b> per <b>side,</b> with jury <b>struts</b> and cabane struts. The aircraft is covered in doped aircraft fabric. The pilot is accommodated in the open cockpit, with an optional windshield. The powerplant, specified as a [...] single cylinder, two stroke, carburetted Zenoah G-25 aircraft engine, is mounted behind the pilot and behind the wing, above the fuselage. The main landing gear legs are built from wood laminations. The wings and tailplane can be removed in 20 minutes by two people to permit ground transportation by trailer or for storage.|$|R
5000|$|The Utva-65 was {{designed}} specifically as an agricultural aircraft. It was a single-seat, low-wing braced monoplane {{with a single}} engine. [...] The wings were essentially identical {{to those of the}} high-wing UTVA-60 apart from the wing roots, which were extended and strengthened so that the chord was greater and the wingspan increased by 0.82 m These wings were of single-spar, all-metal construction, carrying ailerons that linked to the flaps, drooping 15 degrees when the flaps were set to 40 degrees. A single streamlined strut ran from the upper fuselage to mid-wing on either <b>side,</b> with minor <b>struts</b> from them to the wing at about one-quarter span. The conventional all-metal tail surfaces were also from the UTVA-60, but had increased elevator area.|$|R
50|$|It had a {{cantilever}} wing with a section which was centrally thick but thinned towards the wing tips. The wing was straight tapered in plan, with an unswept leading edge and forward sweep on the trailing edge, and blunt tips. This {{was constructed in}} a novel and patented way, the wing ribs protruding and the gap between them covered with strips of veneer attached by L-shaped strips. The result {{was a very strong}} structure; Kondor claimed that the slight though clearly visible rib protrusion improved the aerodynamics. Wing and fuselage were connected on each <b>side</b> by two <b>struts,</b> one above the other, running from the mid- and upper forward fuselage to a common junction at the wing leading edge together with three forward-leaning struts from the fuselage close to the cockpit to the wing underside.|$|R
40|$|Aerojet is {{currently}} executing two Strutjet propulsion contracts: one a Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine for a NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Reusable Transportation Technology (ARTT) program, the second a Dual Mode Ram/Scramjet engine for a USAF Wright Laboratories Storable Fuel Scramjet Flow Path Concepts program. The engines employed in both programs operate at supersonic and low hypersonic speeds and use inlets employing forebody external and sidewall compression. Aerojet has developed and validated a successful design methodology applicable to these inlet types. Design features include an integrated vehicle forebody, external <b>side</b> compression <b>struts,</b> strut sidewall and throat bleed, a throat shock trap, and variable geometry internal contraction. Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) predictions and test data show these inlets allow substantially increased flow turning angles over other designs. These increased flow turning angles allow shorter and lighter engines than current designs, {{which in turn}} enables higher performing vehicles with broad operating characteristics. This paper describes the designs of two different inlets evaluated by the NASA-MSFC and USAF programs, discusses the results of wind tunnel tests performed by NASA-Lewis Research Center, and provides correlations of test data with CFD predictions. Parameters of interest include low Mach number starting capability, start sensitivity {{as a function of}} back pressure at various contraction ratios, flow turning angles, strut and throat bleed effects, and pressure recovery at various Mach numbers...|$|R
