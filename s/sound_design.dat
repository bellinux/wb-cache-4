5|$|Dan Dugan (born March 20, 1943) is an American audio engineer, inventor, {{and nature}} sounds recordist. He {{was the first}} person in {{regional}} theatre to be called a sound designer, and he developed the first effective automatic microphone mixer: the automixer. Dugan's <b>sound</b> <b>design</b> work was acknowledged in 2003 with a Distinguished Career Award by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology.|$|E
40|$|The {{testing of}} <b>sound</b> <b>designs</b> often {{involves}} only expert evaluations; training is commonly required when non-experts participate, which {{can alter the}} listening experience. This paper presents a method of evaluating <b>sound</b> <b>designs</b> for radio and audio logos that avoids listener training. <b>Sound</b> <b>designs</b> incorporating <b>sound</b> effects, music or dialogue {{can be broken down}} into discrete sound events that can then be rated using attributes of sound meaningful to both designers and listeners. Two examples are discussed, a radio drama, and a set of audio logos. Both of which were tested using a repertory grid approach. The paper shows that the method can highlight similarities and differences between designer and participant listening experiences. Comparing listening experiences could allow designers to be more confident about the reception of their <b>sound</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, in-game {{dialogue}} was recorded in Los Angeles by local Asian actors, but much of the audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company. Audio design was complicated; scripting was handled in Vancouver and the recording was in Hong Kong. There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the <b>sound</b> <b>design</b> team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong <b>sound</b> <b>design.</b> Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} filming crew, the {{post-production}} {{crew of the}} film included both Indian and overseas personnel. Prime Focus carried out the film's 3-D conversion, with London-based colorist Richard Fearon performing the color grading. Red Chillies VFX partnered {{with a number of}} visual effects studios around the world, and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of Jeffrey Kleiser.

5|$|Development lasted {{five months}} {{on a small}} budget {{with a team of}} only three core members and two support staff. The team leads had {{previously}} worked together on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for the Super NES, and so chose to develop for that system. Wild Guns was heavily influenced in its gameplay and artistic design by arcade games such as Blood Bros. and Dynamite Duke. The game's scenery, characters, and <b>sound</b> <b>design</b> drew ideas from the Western film genre and the science fiction manga Cobra, creating a space western setting.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its <b>sound</b> <b>design,</b> unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} understand what was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Far Side Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos in Tanks. First {{conceived as a}} series of ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and outdated computer <b>sound</b> <b>design.</b> The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, disposable consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated. Upon release, it received universal acclaim, with praise directed at its narrative, gameplay, visual and <b>sound</b> <b>design,</b> characterization, and depiction of female characters. The Last of Us {{became one of}} the best-selling games on the PlayStation 3, selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and over eight million units within fourteen months.

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} <b>sound</b> <b>design.</b> Goldstein of IGN praised the actors' {{performances}} {{and the use}} of licensed music. GameSpot's Calvert and GamesRadar's Walter also commended the licensed music, the latter admiring the humour of the radio's talk stations. Michael Pinson of The Pro Audio Files praised the separate features of the game's sound design—including the city's ambiance, licensed music, character dialogue, and vehicle and weapon sound effects—applauding the developer's use of uniting the features together. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar also retroactively praised the game's soundtrack, commending its suitability to the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the <b>sound</b> <b>design</b> works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us {{features}} an original score, composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla. Known for his minimalist approach to composing, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. Naughty Dog took a similar minimalist approach to {{other elements of}} the game, including the action, <b>sound</b> <b>design</b> and art design. The sound department began working early on the sound of the Infected, in order to achieve the best work possible. A similar direction was taken by the art department, whose designs influenced other elements of development. Naughty Dog overhauled their game engine for some elements, particularly lighting and animations.|$|E
