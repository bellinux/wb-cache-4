50|$|Early thinning, {{say after}} 20 years rather than late thinning, say after 50 years has {{different}} {{effects on the}} trees thinned. An early thinning would encourage trees to get wider crowns, increase diameter and be more stable against threats like <b>snow</b> <b>breakage</b> or windthrow. Too much too early {{would lead to a}} site overgrowing with shrubs and prevent an understory regenerating effectively. Doing it too late would mean that trees would grow tall and slender and though some increment would come to the trees, they may be less marketable as thinness reduces value. Too early and epicormic shooting is a risk, and this can lead to tree branchiness and knots in the resultant timber harvest, again reducing value.|$|E
40|$|In 1976, {{we began}} a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of 2 ̆ 2 Vexar 2 ̆ 2 seedling protectors {{as a means}} of reducing damage to conifer seedlings by pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.). The protectors are cylinders of plastic netting that gradually decompose in sunlight. The evaluation is being conducted on four national forests in three western states. Three conifer species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis), are under study. After two growing seasons, gophers have caused only 5 percent mortality among 2 ̆ 2 Vexar 2 ̆ 2 -enclosed seedlings compared to 20 percent mortality among unprotected seedlings. In addition, stocking and heights of protected seedlings are better than those of unprotected seedlings. Problems {{associated with the use of}} 2 ̆ 2 Vexar 2 ̆ 2 included compression of the protectors by <b>snow,</b> <b>breakage</b> of the plastic during subfreezing temperatures, and protrusion of seedling terminals through mesh openings; however, these problems have been minor thus far. Information on long-term effectiveness and cost efficiency is still needed before we can recommend operational use of 2 ̆ 2 Vexar 2 ̆ 2 protectors for pocket gopher damage control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{initial data}} of a {{long-term}} research programme aimed at determining the silvi-cultural choices for management of ageing holm oak coppices are reported. The various treatments being tested are the following: treatments A and B, respectively, with 50 and 250 reserve trees per hectare, all of the same age; treatment C with 140 reserve trees per hectare, with three different ages; treatment D, conversion into high forest; and treatment E, natural evolution (the control). A total of 15 permanent plots were established (five treatments x three replicates) and the exper-imental design used is that of randomized blocks. The results presented regard the structural development of the coppice during the first 2 years after coppicing. Regeneration from seed showed a significant correlation with treatment. Data relative to {{the characteristics of the}} stands existing before the various interventions also are given. Such preliminary results need further peri-odical observations.

40|$|In {{mountain}} {{forests of}} Central Europe, storm and <b>snow</b> <b>breakage</b> {{as well as}} bark beetles are the prevailing major disturbances. The complex interrelatedness between climate, disturbance agents, and forest management increases {{the need for an}} integrative approach explicitly addressing the multiple interactions between environmental changes, forest management, and disturbance agents to support forest resource managers in adaptive management. Empirical data with a comprehensive coverage for modelling the susceptibility of forests and the impact of disturbance agents are rare, thus making probabilistic models, based on expert knowledge, one of the few modelling approaches that are able to handle uncertainties due to the available information. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are a kind of probabilistic graphical model that has become very popular to practitioners and scientists mainly due to considerations of risk and uncertainties. In this contribution, we present a development methodology to define and parameterize BBNs based on expert elicitation and approximation. We modelled storm and bark beetle disturbances agents, analyzed effects of the development methodology on model structure, and evaluated behavior with stand data from Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests in southern Austria. The high vulnerability of the case study area according to different disturbance agents makes it particularly suitable for testing the BBN model...|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopk., 40 - 4 began in 1969 in the North Fork Clearwater River drainage in northern Idaho. This infestation probably resulted from trees felled during clearing for the Dworshak Reservoir, from ice and <b>snow</b> <b>breakage</b> which {{occurred during the}} winter of 1968 - 69 in stands adjacent to the proposed reservoir, and an abundance of mature and overmature Douglas-fir within the drainage. The outbreak reached epidemic proportions in 1970, 40 but was not detected until 1971. To determine impact of this insect on Douglas-fir stands within the area of infestation and establish a base from which to conduct salvage logging, a two-stage survey using aerial photography followed by a ground cruise was conducted in 1971, 1972, and 1973. Area surveyed varied from 288, 000 acres in 1971 to 494, 000 in 1972, and was reduced 410 to 287, 000 acres in 1973. The 1971 survey estimated that 174, 164 trees were killed during the 2 -year period 1970 - 71, resulting in a volume loss of 85. 8 MMBF of Douglas-fir sawtimber on 288, 000 acres. In 1972, an estimated 46, 844 trees were killed with a volume loss of about 17. 8 MMBF on 494, 000 acres. In 1973, the survey estimated that 8, 141 trees were killed with a volume loss of 4. 2 MMIIF of merchantable timber on 287, 000 acres. The infestation has been declining since 1971...|$|E
