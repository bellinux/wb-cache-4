500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2–1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1–0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a <b>sad</b> <b>day,</b> but obviously a happy day for me because I'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league," [...] said the former striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine.

Two days later, he wrote again: [...] "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: [...] "I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good". Consequently, he was baptised [...] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" [...] at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later. Within the family, he was known informally as [...] "Bertie". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name [...] "may supplant the less favoured one". Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.|$|E

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

A year later he signed Rangers' first black player Mark Walters. In 1989, Souness signed Mo Johnston, a former Celtic player and openly Catholic. This was Rangers' first signing of an openly Catholic player since the unwritten policy was introduced, though there had been claims in the media that it was done to counter a FIFA inquiry into Old Firm sectarianism. According to Johnston's agent Bill McMurdo, Souness had been eager to sign a Catholic player, and had negotiated in secret with [...] "four or five" [...] before signing Johnston. At a press conference following his signing, the English Rangers players attended however the Scottish players boycotted it. The chairman of the Rangers Supporters Association stated [...] "It's a <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> for Rangers, {{there will be a lot}} of people handing back their season tickets. I don't want to see a Roman Catholic at Ibrox. Rangers have always stood for one thing and the majority of the support have been brought up with the idea of a true blue Rangers team." [...] As he predicted, Rangers fans responded by burning their season tickets; Celtic supporters claimed Johnston had betrayed Catholicism, calling him [...] "Judas". The Rangers kitman refused to lay out Johnston's kit before each match as a protest against a Catholic playing for Rangers.|$|E

After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison.

500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution.

According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a <b>sad</b> <b>day,</b> I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E
