500|$|According to Coldplay's {{lead singer}} Chris Martin, the song's writing was {{inspired}} by his own behaviour. Martin recalls, [...] "There were some bad things going in our band... the song is about behaving badly towards <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> really love and I was certainly doing that to {{some members of the}} band." [...] He added that he supposed it was about time to stop acting like a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay are credited as co-writers of [...] "Trouble".|$|E

'He's cheated so he's bad, she's cheated so she's bad', as opposed to a recognition that our species is not monogamous...Sexual fidelity can't be the whole thing you hang your relationship on. If you really love <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> want them to grow, but you don't get to define how that happens. They do." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano [...] "was {{not content}} merely to feel something, [...] {{he had to}} explore ideas, to {{experience}} them, to think them through carefully, thoroughly, logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them." [...] Tristano criticized the free jazz {{that began in the}} 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. [...] "If you feel angry with <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> hit him on the nose – not try to play angry music", he commented; [...] "Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing." [...] He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling, and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose <b>somebody,</b> <b>you</b> learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Leslie {{successfully}} relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, {{she struggles}} {{to find any}} new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode [...] "Camping," [...] locks her {{in a room and}} refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

According to Dupri, lyrically, [...] "It's really just a record about when you need a friend, <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> need to talk to, just call on a person. It's a friend record. It ain't really a boyfriend/girlfriend record. The way Nelly and Janet are talking is more girlfriend/boyfriend, but it really goes out to friends." ...|$|E

You're in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing. I've tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought {{to get rid of the}} unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school.

IDF Spokeswoman, Miri Eisen, said {{the decision not to}} allow reporters into the camp was a difficult one: [...] "The press people said 'Listen, the journalists aren't going to like it' and the operational people said 'We don't care about the journalists right now and about our image, we don't want them inside.' It {{had to do with the}} way we were working operationally inside the camp. We had infantry coming in from 360 degrees which means that you're firing in all different directions.

2500|$|One Friday {{evening in}} March, 1980, Bonin offered a 17-year-old named William Ray Pugh {{a ride home}} as the pair left the house of Everett Fraser. Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill <b>somebody,</b> <b>you</b> should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic John Bush {{wrote the}} {{compilation}} [...] "could {{well be the}} most influential document of the '50s folk revival. Many of the recordings that appeared on it had languished in obscurity for 20 years, and it proved a revelation to {{a new group of}} folkies, from Pete Seeger to John Fahey to Bob Dylan... Many of the most interesting selections on the Anthology, however, are taken from [...] artists... such as Clarence Ashley, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and Buell Kazee." [...] In his review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau wrote [...] "Harry Smith's act of history... aces two very '90s concepts: the canon that accrues as rock gathers commentary, and the compilations that multiply as labels recycle catalogue. In its time, it wrested the idea of the folk from ideologues and ethnomusicologists by imagining a commercial music of everyday pleasure and alienation--which {{might as well have been}} conceived to merge with a rock and roll that didn't yet exist... <b>Somebody</b> <b>you</b> know is worth the 60 bucks it'll run you. So are you." [...] Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, said that the songs [...] "still sound marvelous and uncanny." ...|$|E
2500|$|The story {{received}} {{major changes}} {{over the course}} of development, with two of the most important relating to the player's character and the Big Sister. Initially there was only going to be one Big Sister who would continually hunt the player down throughout the course of the game and then retreat once she was defeated. This Big Sister was written as a Little Sister who, as she grew up on the surface, could not leave the memory of Rapture behind and eventually returned. The reason for the change, as explained by Zak McClendon, lead designer for 2K Marin, is [...] "If you have a single character that the player knows they can't kill because they're so important to the story you're completely removing the triumph of overcoming that encounter with them." [...] Jordan Thomas, the game's director, explains however, [...] "The soul of the original Big Sister character still exists, but in the form of <b>somebody</b> <b>you</b> get to know {{over the course of}} the game." [...] The other major change was that the player's character, Subject Delta, is no longer the first Big Daddy, but rather the fourth prototype. He is, however, the first to be successfully 'pair-bonded' to a single Little Sister.|$|E
