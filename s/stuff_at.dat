500|$|Asked in November 2008 {{what the}} current status of the new album was, bassist Rex Brown told Billboard.com that Down had been [...] "writing {{constantly}} on the road.

You've got to let him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What the hell do you have a record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm so sick of that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E

500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this <b>stuff.</b> <b>At</b> the playbacks, I decided I was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{said that}} the {{recording}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{was one of his}} most enjoyable moments in the studio. He stated, [...] "One of my favourite songs to record, of all my recordings as a solo artist, is probably [...] "The Girl Is Mine", because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and we do have footage of it, but it's never been shown." [...] He concluded, [...] "Maybe one day we'll give you a sneak preview of it." [...] The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Writers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa have {{admitted}} they were [...] "not computer literate", and felt {{this was a}} detriment to their writing. Gordon was disappointed in the episode, stating that it [...] "still qualifies {{as one of my}} biggest disappointments", ranking it as the worst episode of the first season. Glen Morgan felt that [...] "parts of the episode worked. What maybe fell a little flat is that we were a little too afraid of doing HAL and, in a sense, I think that's what the building needed; to have a scary personality." [...] James Wong had mixed feelings, saying that the episode [...] "had some neat <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the end...although I think the ending was a little unsatisfying to me visually, as well as in terms of how Mulder comes to dismember the machine. Overall a fun episode." [...] Chris Carter was more supportive of the episode, stating that the script addressed the question of what made up an X-File, and that it doesn't always have to be paranormal. He also felt positive about the episode's action scenes.|$|E

500|$|... "It Came {{from the}} Nightosphere" [...] was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar, from {{a story by}} Merriwether Williams, Steve Little, Patrick McHale, Pendleton Ward, and Thurop Van Orman. The episode was the first episode storyboarded by Sugar; {{according}} to her, she [...] "did all the monster <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the end", whereas Muto [...] "did all the meat in the middle". She later joked that [...] "anything that is actually witty was done by Adam. I’m usually responsible for sex jokes and violence." [...] During the storyboarding process, Sugar and Muto were running low on time, As such, Muto asked fellow series artist Jesse Moynihan if he could help storyboard the initial fight between Marceline and her father. The final scene with Abadeer, which featured Finn cutting open his [...] "soul sack" [...] was added by Sugar based on a drawing by Ward that featured Finn {{flying through the air}} with two swords. However, she was not sure if the scene would make it into the final product due to its graphic nature. A scene that features Marceline's dad confronting Gunter the penguin inspired the writers to pen the fourth season episode [...] "Reign of Gunters".|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E
500|$|Paid to Love {{is notable}} in Hawks's filmography {{as being the}} only time that he made a highly stylized, {{experimental}} film. He attempted to imitate the style of German film director F. W. Murnau, who had recently made The Last Laugh and Sunrise and was the most critically acclaimed director in Hollywood. Hawks's film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by German Expressionist cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented [...] "It isn't my type of <b>stuff,</b> <b>at</b> least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the camera's somebody's eyes." [...] Hawks worked on the script with Seton I. Miller, with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars George O'Brien as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, William Powell as his happy-go-lucky brother and Virginia Valli as Michael's flapper love interest Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O'Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the [...] "Hawksian woman", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Paid to Love was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927, when it was financially unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|The Secret River is Rawlings' only book {{intended}} for children. According to Murray Laurie, {{the idea for}} the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek: “some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child.” She discussed the idea with her Scribner's editor, Maxwell Perkins, who encouraged her to follow it up. While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she [...] "deliberately avoided Negro dialect. 'No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo sort of <b>stuff.</b> <b>At</b> one point she thought about making the story into a full-length novel. Helen Masten, writing for The Saturday Review, commented [...] "Had this happened this little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children, to whom it rightly belongs." [...] Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp, an illustrator and friend. From that conversation, Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea. In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret Rivers manuscript to Perkins, and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings. When Perkins responded with suggestions, Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp's illustrations. By June of that year, Perkins' death from pneumonia and Rawlings' own personal problems had derailed the project. After Rawlings' death in 1953, the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers.|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said the}} writing process began {{in the middle of}} 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus [...] "noodling on in hopes {{that there would be a}} second one and we did a lot of just {{throwing}} <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the wall and seeing what stuck". The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after [...] "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as [...] "it became unwieldy." [...] The film would be [...] "Cap versus the world we all live in today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain [...] "the most adaptive man on the planet." [...] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers. Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how [...] "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" [...] that introduces more science fiction elements.|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less {{than the sum of its}} parts. The early <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the mixed}} reaction, many critics were {{fond of the}} album. Rolling Stones music critic Jenny Eliscu wrote that the album [...] "has made what ends up {{being one of the}} best straight-up pop-rock albums of 2006". Elicsu also complimented the band, writing: [...] "Like the Goo Goo Dolls... Yellowcard have {{rightfully}} recognized the transcendent value of a big, fist-pumping anthem coated with a light dose of romantic schmaltz." [...] Alternative Press gave the album a perfect rating, saying, [...] "It {{may be one of the}} least 'punk' albums a pop-punk band will make this year--but it's probably one of the best, too." [...] Sputnikmusic gave the album 3.5 out of five stars, writing: [...] "It's pop-punk, and fairly unambitious <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> that ... What keeps this record on its feet is the lyricism, the production and the simplicity of it all." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote: [...] "On Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard sounds light years away from its One for the Kids/Where We Stand days. Granted, the band still trades in the immediate melodies and heart-on-sleeve lyrics that they've used since the beginning, but major-label success suits them well." [...] Though, Phares went on to add that the band [...] "ends up sounding self-assured instead of compromised in its big-budget surroundings." [...] Billboard magazine gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, and claimed that Yellowcard made a [...] "strong effort that trades sunny-sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family, 'Lights' conveys that maturity without seeming strained." [...] Dan McClanahan of Iowa State Daily wrote: [...] "...This disc will likely change people's opinion of Yellowcard. Much more angst and a drastically matured sound make for a pleasant surprise." [...] McClanahan revealed that he was not looking forward to listen to the album, but admitted once he heard he knew it embraced the band's [...] "strengths" [...] and that they [...] "greatly expanded the subject matter of its songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|From a musician’s {{perspective}} or piano player’s perspective, he matters {{because he}} {{figured out how}} to do things no one had ever done before, at least in a rhythm-and-blues context.... Basically he figured out ways {{to do a lot of}} <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the same time and make the piano sound like an entire band. It’s Ray Charles on the level of Chopin. It’s all the soul, all the groove, and all the technique in the universe packed into one unbelievable player ... I can now say with certainty that it’s a pianistic experience unlike any other. He invented an entirely new way of playing blues and roots-based music on the piano, and it was mind-blowingly brilliant and beautiful.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I {{was getting ready to}} do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway stuff that was awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them my best <b>stuff</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E
