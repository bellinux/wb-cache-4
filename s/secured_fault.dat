40|$|Abstract � In {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs), {{security and}} economy of energy are two important and necessary aspects to consider. Particularly, security helps to ensure that such a network {{is not subject to}} attacks that involve reading, modification or destruction of information. This paper presents a protocol for permutation routing, which is <b>secure,</b> <b>fault</b> tolerant and energy-efficient. The proposed protocol is based on two main principles. First, the use of a heterogeneous hierarchical clustered structure to assign the most important roles to the sensors having the most energy, in order to ensure the protection and routing of data items. Second, the use of multiple processes based on this structure to ensure, regardless of network and sensors status, no data is lost and that a data item from a point A to a point B always arrives safety. This is the first protocol that provides such a QoS per permutation routing. 1...|$|R

A principal conclusion is that the use of protective redundancy techniques (as implemented in hardware) is the preferred approach for the design of <b>secure</b> <b>fault</b> tolerant systems. The feasibility of graceful degradation of security is also examined and it is concluded that graceful degradation is attainable under a particular interpretation.

Concerning the design issues for guaranteeing security and safety, it is particularly important to take into account that a PV plant is a "special" system of generation, in which the presence of a d. c. generator results in changings of the technical rules used for the design of electrical systems. Choices regarding the layout of the system, the grounding of the negative pole of the d. c. side and the means of protection are fundamental for the design of a PV system that takes into account the risk of fire.

40|$|Abstract: The {{multi-path}} routing scheme provides reliable guarantee for mobile ad hoc network. A {{new method}} is proposed that is using {{to analyze the}} security of multi-path routing protocol {{within the framework of}} Universally Composable (UC) security. Based on the topological model that there exist adversarial nodes, the concept of plausible route is extended and the definition of plausible-route set is presented. Plausible-route set is used in description of the multi-path routing for Ad hoc network, and a formal security definition based on UC-RP is given. A provably Security Multiple Node-Disjoint Paths source routing (SMNDP) is proposed and address <b>secure</b> <b>fault</b> issue of MNDP in the active adversary model. The new approach shows that the security of SMNDP can be reduced to the security of the message authentication code and the digital signature. SMNDP implements the correctness of route discovery process, the authentication of nodes identifier and the integrality of route information.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{reliability}} enhancement {{models for}} fault tolerant systems {{work is to}} propose automotive fault tolerant sys-tem models with static and dynamic redundancies based on the services required in the applications to enhance the overall system reliability without affecting system performance, correctness and safety. Embedded systems must meet increasingly high expectations of safety and high reliability Improvement by enhancing performance with system-level analysis. Model-ling is needed not only for predictability and comparability when partitioning end-to-end functions at design time levels of reliability. CAN Controllers are used in automotive for fault tolerant embedded system. The existing reliability enhancement models are emphasizing various redundancy techniques both in hardware and software without focusing a formal way of recovery time minimization from the affected or degraded states in the automotive systems.
