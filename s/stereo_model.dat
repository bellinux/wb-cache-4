5000|$|The <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> is {{then made}} from a {{multitude}} of complex cell models that have differing disparities covering a testable range of disparities. [...] Any individual stimulus is then distinguishable through finding the complex cell in the population with the strongest response to the stimuli. [...] The <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> accounts for most non-temporal physiological observations of binocular neurons {{as well as the}} correspondence problem. [...] An important aspect of the <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> is it accounts for disparity attraction and repulsion. [...] An example of disparity attraction and repulsion is that at a close distance two objects appear closer in depth than in actuality, and at further distances from each other they appear further in depth than in actuality. Disparity attraction and repulsion is believed to be directly related to the physiological properties of binocular neurons in the visual cortex. [...] Use of the <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> has allowed for interpretation of the source of differing peak locations found in disparity tuning curves of some cells in visual cortex. These differing peak locations of the disparity tuning curves are called characteristic disparity. Due to the lack of defined disparity tuning curves for simple cells, they cannot have characteristic disparities., but the characteristic disparities can be attributed to complex cells instead. Two limitations of the <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> {{is that it does not}} account for the response of binocular neurons in time, and that it does not give much insight into connectivity of binocular neurons.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> is {{an energy}} model that {{integrates}} both the position-shift {{model and the}} phase-difference model. [...] The position-shift model suggests that the receptive fields of left and right simple cells are identical in shape but are shifted horizontally relative to each other. This model was proposed by Bishop and Pettigrew in 1986. [...] According to the phase-difference model the excitatory and inhibitory sub-regions of {{the left and right}} receptive fields of simple cells are shifted in phase such that their boundaries overlap. This model was developed by Ohzawa in 1990. [...] The <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> uses Fourier phase dependence of simple cell responses, and it suggests that the use of the response of only simple cells is not enough to accurately depict the physiological observations found in cat, monkey, and human visual pathways. [...] In order to make the model more representative of physiological observations, the <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> combines the responses of both simple and complex cells into a single signal. How this combination is done depends on the incoming stimulus. As one example, the model uses independent Fourier phases for some types of stimuli, and finds the preferred disparity of the complex cells equal to the left-right receptive field shift. [...] For other stimuli, the complex cell becomes less phase sensitive than the simple cells alone, and when the complex cells larger receptive field is included in the model, the phase sensitivity is returns to results similar to normal physiological observations. [...] In order to include the larger receptive fields of complex cells, the model averages several pairs of simple cells nearby and overlaps their receptive fields to construct the complex cell model. This allows the complex cell to be phase independent for all stimuli presented while still maintaining an equal receptive field shift to the simple cells it is composed of in the model.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} the two mechanisms of the human visual system: pop-out effect and comfort zone, we have chosen to develop our proposed model {{on a combination of}} the stereo contrast and <b>stereo</b> focus <b>models</b> of the stereo-vision <b>model.</b> The <b>stereo</b> saliency of an object can be determined by the values calculated from the stereo contrast and <b>stereo</b> focus <b>models.</b> However, in some cases, the values obtained by these two models can be substantially different. For example, if an object has negative parallax and is far from the comfort zone, or if the object has zero parallax, the two values are quite different. To obtain the benefits from two models and detect the saliency for different stereoscopic content, our stereo visual saliency prediction model considers both the <b>stereo</b> contrast <b>model</b> and the <b>stereo</b> focus <b>model.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we exploit two {{characteristics}} of stereoscopic vision: the pop-out effect and the comfort zone.

The <b>stereo</b> focus <b>model</b> describes the degree of focus based on monocular focus and the comfort zone.

Experimental results on two eye-tracking databases show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{orthoimage}} (or orthophoto) {{is a type}} of information-rich digital {{products and}} has found applications in many fields. However, digital orthoimage itself is a 2 -dimensional product and therefore it is insufficient for many applications. On the other hand, the traditional <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> of photogrammetry formed from a pair of overlapping aerial photographs offer the possibility of both 3 D measurement of terrain surface and terrain objects. However, it cannot be used a plan like the case of digital orthoimage and the model size is usually limited to the stereo pair. To take the advantage of both, the concept of stereomate was introduced by Collins in 1968. It is a new image with additional relief displacement. The total amount of relief displacement at each point of the stereomate is exactly the same as the sum of two relief displacements at the same position on both images of the stereo pair. That is, if this stereomate is used together with the orthoimage, one is still able to reconstruct a 3 D surface of the area precisely. The main limitation with the current practice is that if more than one stereo pairs are used to generate the stereo orthophoto pair, the solution is not rigorous and thus leads to low accuracy of 3 D measurement in highly mountainous areas although reasonable accuracy of 3 D measurement can be achieved in areas with low relief. This paper introduces the concept of “measurable seamless stereo model”, which is formed by a mosaic orthoimage and a mosaic stereomate (i. e. mosaics of a whole block of aerial photographs), with the lineage (image coordinates on original photograph and the orientation parameters of the original photograph) of each pixel on both mosaic orthoimage and a mosaic stereomate recorded.

40|$|In Ireland, {{as in much}} of Europe, church {{architecture}} of the late medieval era is considered by architectural historians to have been designed according to specific geometric principles and methods. Research into such structures and their design methods has traditionally involved visually-based stylistic comparison of features, primarily by visual techniques. In recent years, however, more analytical approaches to these studies have developed and these procedures require accurate documentation of buildings and features. 3 D models generated {{by a number of}} close range measurement techniques (terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and photogrammetry) are appropriate for use in such studies. However, since historical research frequently requires the comparison for large numbers of objects and/or buildings, it is essential that the methods used are easily available and are of low or medium cost, while still being appropriate in terms of accuracy, speed and usability. For the typical multi-site architectural historical study TLS is too expensive and too complex in terms of data collection, software processing and data management.

40|$|Digital stereo-photogrammetry {{allows users}} an {{automatic}} {{evaluation of the}} spatial dimension and the surface texture of objects. The integration of image analysis techniques simplifies the automation of evaluation of large image sets and offers a high accuracy [1]. Due to the substantial similarities of stereoscopic image pairs, correlation techniques provide measurements of subpixel precision for corresponding image points. With {{the help of an}} automated point search algorithm in image sets identical points are used to associate pairs of images to stereo models and group them. The found identical points in all images are basis for calculation of the relative orientation of each <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> as well as defining the relation of neighboured stereo models. By using proper filter strategies incorrect points are removed and the relative orientation of the <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> can be made automatically. With the help of 3 D-reference points or distances at the object or a defined distance of camera basis the <b>stereo</b> <b>model</b> is orientated absolute. An adapted expansion- and matching algorithm offers the possibility to scan the object surface automatically. The result is a three dimensional point cloud; the scan resolution depends on image quality. With the integration of the iterative closest point- algorithm (ICP) these partial point clouds are fitted to a total point cloud. In this way, 3 D-reference points are not necessary. With the help of the implemented triangulation algorithm a digital surface models (DSM) can be created. The texturing can be made automatically by the usage of the images that were used for scanning the object surface. It is possible to texture the surface model directly or to generate orthophotos automatically. By using of calibrated digital SLR cameras with full frame sensor a high accuracy can be reached. A big advantage is the possibility to control the accuracy and quality of the 3 d-objectdocumentation with the resolution of the images.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{treatise}} {{the discussion}} of a methodology and results of semi-automatic city DSM extraction from an Ikonos triplet, is introduced. Built-up areas are known as being complex for photogrammetric purposes, {{partly because of the}} steep changes in elevation caused by build-ings and urban features. To make DSM extraction more robust and to cope with the specific problems of height displacement, concealed areas and shadow, a multi-image based approach is followed. For the VHR tri-stereoscopic study an area extending from the centre of Istanbul to the urban fringe is chosen. Research will concentrate, in first phase on the development of methods to optimize the extraction of photogrammetric products from the bundled Ikonos triplet. Optimal methods need to be found to improve the radiometry and geometry of the imagery, to improve the semi-automatically derivation of DSM’s and to improve the postprocessing of the products. Secondly we will also investigate the possibilities of creating <b>stereo</b> <b>models</b> out of images from the same sensor taken on a different date, e. g. one image of the stereo pair combined with the third image. Finally the photogrammetric products derived from the Ikonos stereo pair as well as the products created out of the triplet and the constructed <b>stereo</b> <b>models</b> will be investigated by comparison with a 3 D reference. This evaluation should show the increase of accuracy when multi-imagery is used instead of stereo pairs...|$|R
