With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Take a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and fold {{it in half}} to the right. Fold it in half again to the right. If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E

25|$|A twist tie is a {{metal wire}} that is {{encased in a}} thin <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or plastic and is used to tie the {{openings}} of bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with a twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents {{an element of the}} K-group of a circle.|$|E
25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams of where to go next.|$|E

500|$|The {{panorama}} {{books are}} not Potter's best efforts, but do demonstrate {{her ability to}} pare text and illustrations to essentials. [...] She worked best, though, with more complicated plots and characters, and with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. [...] Her inexperience with babies and very young children {{is evident in the}} original panorama format itself, for a long <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and a wallet are likely to be mutilated by the very young.

Lear explains that the format [...] "although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful, because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded". Potter referred to this fact late in life when she said, [...] "Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long strips—The shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to fold up again". MacDonald {{points out that the}} fragile panorama format was inappropriate for very young children.|$|E
500|$|Not {{only did}} the Department of Information art advisors {{consider}} these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the direction of traffic in the painting The Road from Arras to Bapaume but {{was not prepared to}} compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to A Group of Soldiers on the grounds that [...] "the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army". Amid the sarcasm and vitirol of Nevinson's response, he did make the point that the soldiers in the painting were sketched from a group home on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so Paths of Glory, Nevinson's painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> across it, with the word 'Censored' scrawled on it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word 'Censored' without authorisation.|$|E

2500|$|Wheatstone further {{invented the}} {{automatic}} transmitter, {{in which the}} signals of the message are first punched out on a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> which is then passed through the sending-key, and controls the signal currents. By substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message, {{he was able to}} telegraph about 100 words a minute, or five times the ordinary rate. In the Postal Telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending Press telegrams, and it has recently been so much improved, that messages are now sent from London to Bristol at a speed of 600 words a minute, and even of 400 words a minute between London and Aberdeen. On the night of 8 April 1886, when Mr. Gladstone introduced his Bill for Home Rule in Ireland, no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at St. Martin's-le-Grand by 100 Wheatstone transmitters. The plan of sending messages by a running <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> which actuates the key was originally patented by Bain in 1846; but Wheatstone, aided by Mr. Augustus Stroh, an accomplished mechanician, and an able experimenter, was the first to bring the idea into successful operation. This system {{is often referred to as}} the Wheatstone Perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market Ticker tape ...|$|E
2500|$|The Maynard tape primer is {{a system}} {{designed}} to allow for more rapid reloading of muskets which previously relied on small copped caps that were filled with mercury fulminate. Dr. Edward Maynard, a dentist {{with an interest in}} firearms, embedded tiny pellets of priming material in thin strips of paper, then glued a second <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> on top of the first, creating a [...] "tape" [...] of primer. The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much less expensive than copper. In 1845, Edward Maynard patented his new firearm invention which in later years, would be widely used in the American Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|Magnetic tape {{revolutionized}} {{broadcast and}} recording. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, {{based on the}} invention of magnetic wire recording by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Pfleumer's invention used an iron oxide (Fe2O3) powder coating on a long <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> This invention was further developed by the German electronics company AEG, which manufactured the recording machines and BASF, which manufactured the tape. In 1933, working for AEG, [...] developed the ring shaped tape head. Eduard Schüller, was a German engineer {{and he had a}} decisive {{role in the development of}} the rape recorder and the videorecorders. Previous head designs were needle shaped and tended to shred the tape.|$|E
2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|E
2500|$|Two key {{developments}} in the modeling of the modern α-helix were: the correct bond geometry, thanks to the crystal structure determinations of amino acids and peptides and Pauling's prediction of planar peptide bonds; and his relinquishing of the assumption of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix. The pivotal moment came {{in the early spring}} of 1948, when Pauling caught a cold and went to bed. Being bored, he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and folded it into a helix, being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds. After a few attempts, he produced a model with physically plausible hydrogen bonds. Pauling then worked with Corey and Branson to confirm his model before publication. In 1954, Pauling was awarded his first Nobel Prize [...] "for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances" [...] (such as proteins), prominently including the structure of the α-helix.|$|E
