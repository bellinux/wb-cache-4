The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—supply {{networks}} modeling {{has gained}} tremendous {{attention in the}} field of supply chain during last decades. However, most existent literatures in <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> do not pay much attention to the topological characteristics, which, as revealed by Complex Networks, have close relations with their behaviors in various complex systems. This paper introduces a novel topological structure evolving model of complex <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> from the perspective of Complex <b>Networks.</b> After investigating <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> typical structural characteristics and formation mechanisms, Complex <b>Supply</b> <b>Networks</b> Evolving Model (CSNEM) are proposed to mimic these structural characteristics. Then, three statistical properties are investigated. To validate CSNEM, three real <b>supply</b> chain <b>networks</b> are introduced. The results indicate that CSNEM is consistent with the real-world <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> Further the relations between these properties and <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> macro behaviors i. e. rapid response capability and robustness are discussed. This work will provide managers and researches a beneficial insight on macroscopic structures characteristics as well as a helpful understanding on the relations between macroscopic structures and global behaviors in <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> Keywords- <b>Supply</b> networks; Global topological structures; Complex networks; Evolving model I...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of infrastructure availability changes leads to problems in <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> Consequently, <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> {{need to become}} resilient to complex systems. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for assessing the resilience of <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> to changes in infrastructure availability. A socio-technical system approach was integrated with an enterprise-engineering framework to design a resilience assessment framework. The framework aims to aid decision makers in assessing <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> by considering the six perspectives of socio-technical systems. A case study from the fertilizer industry in Indonesia {{was used to evaluate}} the framework. The case study analysis identified port availability as the most important infrastructure facility that influences <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> resilience in Indonesia. A simulation model was used to explore the effect of port availability on <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> risk and resilience. By using the simulation model, decision makers can predict the level of risk and key performance indicators in order to assess resilience dimensions...|$|R
5|$|North Korean {{troops had}} the {{advantage}} of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre-set logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for {{the way in which they}} were able to maintain a <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> in the face of a massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. North Korean forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive, and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their ability to fight effectively. North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind North Korean lines, had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
