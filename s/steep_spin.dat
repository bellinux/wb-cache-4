25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures {{of one sort or}} another, the Menasco engines being the primary source of those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the <b>steep</b> <b>spin,</b> preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using static wind tunnel tests {{to obtain information}} about spin damping characteristics of an isolated general aviation aircraft tail was investigated. A representative tail section was oriented to the tunnel free streamline at angles simulating an equilibrium spin. A full range of normally encountered spin conditions was employed. Results of parametric studies performed {{to determine the effect}} of spin damping on several tail design parameters show satisfactory agreement with NASA rotary balance tests. Wing and body interference effects are present in the NASA studies at <b>steep</b> <b>spin</b> attitudes, but agreement improves with increasing pitch angle and spin rate, suggesting that rotational flow effects are minimal. Vertical position of the horizontal stabilizer is found to be a primary parameter affecting yaw damping, and horizontal tail chordwise position induces a substantial effect on pitching moment...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of btzmp (1, 2 -bis(tetrazol- 1 -yl) - 2 -methylpropane) with Fe(ClO 4) (2) generates a 1 D polymeric species, [Fe(mu-btzmp) (2) (btzmp) (2) ](ClO 4) (2), showing a <b>steep</b> <b>spin</b> transition (T- 1 / 2 up arrow = 136 K and T- 1 / 2 down arrow = 133 K) with a 3 K thermal hysteresis. The crystal structure at 100 and 200 K reveals that, {{in contrast to}} other bistetrazole based spin-transition systems such as [Fe(endi) (3) ](BF 4) (2) and [Fe(btzp) (3) ](ClO 4) (2), the present compound has only two ligands bridging the metallic centres, while the other two coordination positions are occupied by two mono-coordinated (non-bridging) btzmp ligands. This peculiarity confers an unprecedented crystal packing in the series of 1 D bistetrazole based polymers. The change in spin state is accompanied by an order/disorder transition of the ClO 4 - counterion. A careful examination of the structural changes occurring upon the spin transition indicates that this order/disorder is most likely affected by the modification of the [tetrazole-centroid]-N-D-Fe angle (which is typical of bistetrazole spin-transition materials). Apart from X-ray analysis, also magnetic susceptibility, Mossbauer and UV-vis spectroscopies {{have been used to}} characterise the HS and the LS states of [Fe(mu-btzmp) (2) (btzmp) (2) ](ClO 4) (2) ...|$|E

Nine tail configurations were tested, resulting {{in a wide range}} of developed <b>spin</b> conditions, including <b>steep</b> <b>spins</b> and flat spins. The results indicate that the full-scale parachute diameter required for satisfactory recovery from the most critical conditions investigated is about 3. 2 m and that the canopy distance, which was found to be critical for flat spins, should be between 4. 6 and 6. 1 m...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{full-scale}} {{and model}} spin tests {{were made with}} a low-lying monoplane in order to extend the available information as to {{the utility of the}} free-spinning wind tunnel as an aid in predicting full-scale spin characteristics. For a given control disposition the model indicated <b>steeper</b> <b>spins</b> than were actually obtained with the airplane, the difference being most pronounced for spins with elevators up. Recovery characteristics for the model, on the whole, agreed with those for the airplane, but a disagreement was noted for the case of recovery with elevators held full up. Free-spinning wind-tunnel tests are a useful aid in estimating spin characteristics of airplanes, but it must be appreciated that model results can give only general indications of full-scale behavior...|$|R

Compounds 1 and 2 are monocationic, and were prepared using the singly deprotonated form of pyridoxalthiosemicarbazone. Both compounds crystallise in the monoclinic system, C 2 /c and P 2 (1) /c space group for 1 and 2, respectively. Complex 3 is tricationic, it is formed with neutral bis(ligand) complex and possesses an interesting 3 D channel architecture, the unit cell is triclinic, P (1) over bar space group. For complex 4, the pH value {{plays an important role}} during its synthesis; 4 is neutral and crystallises with two inequivalent forms of the ligand: the singly and the doubly deprotonated chelate of H(2) ethpy, the unit cell is monoclinic, C 2 /c space group. Notably, in 1 and 4, there is an attractive infinite three dimensional hydrogen bonding network in the crystal lattice. Magnetic measurements of 1 and 4 revealed that a rather <b>steep</b> <b>spin</b> transition from the low spin to high spin Fe(III) states occurs above 300 K in the first heating step. This transition is accompanied by the elimination of solvate molecules and thus, stabilizes the high spin form due to the breaking of hydrogen bonding networks; compared to 2 and 3, which keep their low spin state up to 400 K...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the NASA Langley 20 -ft Vertical Spin Tunnel to determine the spin and spin-recovery characteristics of a 1 / 11 -scale model of a low-wing general aviation airplane with a horizontal tail modified with variable-size gaps to allow ventilation of the vertical stabilizer and rudder. Erect spins at symmetric loadings were tested with varying gap sizes on either or {{both sides of the}} horizontal tail. The model results indicate that the basic airplane (with no gaps) exhibits a fast, flat spin from which no recoveries can be obtained. The airplane with the modified tail has either a fast, flat spin from which no recoveries or poor recoveries may be made, or a slower, <b>steeper</b> <b>spin</b> from which fair to excellent recoveries may be obtained, depending on the size and orientation of the tail gaps. The major contribution to spin recovery was from the gap on the leeward side of the tail. Gap widths of 15 - 25 percent of the tail semispan were needed to produce satisfactory recovery from the flat spin...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 15 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a research model, representative of a present-day trainer or a four-place cabin monoplane, with varied moments of inertia. The tests were made for ei&t different wing arrangements and four different tail arrangements, including a twin tail. The momsnts of inertia about the three airpLane axes were increased or decreased by a constant percentage {{and the results were}} compared. Comparison is also made between these results and those previously presented for conditions with the airplane relative density varied. The results of variation of moments of inertia indicated that, within the range of the present tests, uniformly decreasing the moments of inertia led to <b>steeper</b> <b>spins,</b> higher angular and vertical velocities, and faster recoveries. Comparison of these results with results of previous tests indicated that adding weight at the center of savity up to 50 percent of the basic weight led to higher rates of descent and rotation, had little effect upon recoveries when the eievators were up, and generally had a somewhat adverse effect upon recoveries when the elevators were neutral or down. The results also indicated that the twin-tail configuration was a very effective arrangement as regards spin recovery...|$|R

40|$|Quantum spin liquids are exotic Mott {{insulators}} {{that carry}} extraordinary spin excitations and thus, when doped, expected to afford novel metallic states coupled to the unconventional magnetic excitations. The organic triangular-lattice system k-(ET) 4 Hg 2. 89 Br 8 is a promising {{candidate for the}} doped spin-liquid and hosts a non-Fermi liquid at low pressures. We show that, in the non-Fermi liquid regime, the charge transport confined in the layer gets deconfined sharply at low temperatures, coinciding with the entrance of spins into a quantum regime as signified by a <b>steep</b> decrease in <b>spin</b> susceptibility behaving like the triangular-lattice Heisenberg model indicative of spin-charge separation at high temperatures.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a l/ 19 -scale model of the North American T- 28 C airplane to determine the spin and recovery characteristics. The T- 28 C airplane {{is similar to the}} T- 28 B airplane except for slight modifications for the arresting hook. The lower rear section of the fuselage was cut out and, consequently, {{the lower part of the}} rudder was removed to make a smooth fairing with the fuselage. The T- 28 B airplane had good recovery characteristics; but these modifications, along with the addition of gun packages on the wings, led to poor and unsatisfactory spin-recovery characteristics during demonstration spins of the T- 28 C airplane. Model test results indicated that without the gun packages installed, satisfactory recoveries could be obtained if the elevators were held full back while the rudder was fully reversed and the ailerons were held neutral. However, with the addition of gun packages to the wings and the corresponding change in loading, recoveries were considered unsatisfactory. Recoveries attempted by using a larger chord or larger span rudder were improved very slightly, but were still considered marginal or unsatisfactory. Strakes placed on the nose of the model were effective in slowing the spin rotation slightly and, in most instances, decreased the turns for recovery slightly. Recovery characteristics were slightly marginal for the full fuel loading when strakes and the extended-chord rudder were installed; but with the wing fuel partly used, recovery characteristics were again considered unsatisfactory or, at least, definitely on the marginal side. The optimum control technique for recovery is movement of the rudder to full against the spin with the stick held full back (elevators full up) and the ailerons held neutral, followed by forward movement of the stick only after the spin rotation ceases. Inverted-spin test results indicate that the airplane will <b>spin</b> <b>steep</b> and fast and that recovery by full rudder reversal will be satisfactory if the ailerons are held neutral...|$|R
50|$|The 19th Bombardment Group {{returned}} to the United States in late 1942. Carmichael served {{on the staff of}} United States Army Air Forces in Washington, D.C., as executive assistant to General Henry H. Arnold from 6 January to 26 July 1943, for which he was award the Legion of Merit.On 26 August 1943, he became commander of the 462d Bombardment Group, flying the Boeing B-29 Superfortress from Walker Army Airfield in Kansas. The 462d Bombardment Group flew to the China Burma India Theater via Africa between March and June 1944, where it became part of the Twentieth Air Force. On 20 August he was shot down over Japan. He was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Cross: for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a B-29 Very Heavy Bomber of the 58th Bombardment Wing, Twentieth Air Force, while participating in a bombing mission on 20 August 1944, against enemy ground targets in Japan. Colonel Carmichael was Formation Commander of three B-29 aircraft on a precision daylight attack from a forward base in China against the coke ovens of the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, Japan. Twenty minutes {{before the start of the}} bomb run, the formation was attacked by 35 to 50 enemy interceptors utilizing phosphorous aerial bombs and ramming tactics, and continuing throughout the bomb run. Disregarding fighters and the increasingly heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire, Colonel Carmichael kept his formation together and continued on the strike. In turning away, Colonel Carmichael's plane was hit by an aerial bomb in the middle wing section, putting the two starboard engines out of commission, setting several fires along the wings, and injuring two crew members. The plane went into a <b>steep,</b> slow diving <b>spin</b> with Colonel Carmichael fighting to regain control. He checked the descent long enough for seven crew members to parachute to safety. Colonel Carmichael was determined to attempt to land the plane because of the two injured men who were unable to bail out, but at about 500 feet the entire right wing burned through and dropped off. He saw that he had done all that was humanly possible to save the lives of the two remaining men and, realizing the futility of remaining with his crippled bomber, parachuted to the ground. This mission, the first daylight strike against the home islands of Japan since the Tokyo raid of 1942, completely destroyed the vital enemy iron and steel works. It proved the real effectiveness of daylight precision bombing by B-29s. Colonel Carmichael's actions, in the face of fighter and flak opposition and the hazards of mechanical failure on this mission of more than 3,000 miles, reflect great credit on himself and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the Army Air Forces. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Legion of Merit for his command of the 462d Bombardment Group.|$|R
