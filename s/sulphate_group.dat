They are widely used in the food industry, for their gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties. Their main application is in dairy and meat products, due to their strong binding to food proteins. There are three main varieties of carrageenan, which differ in their degree of sulphation.

Deactivation of SCR catalysts applied in bio-fuel plants {{is a major problem}} due to the high potassium content of bio-fuels and therefore, great potential lies in finding regeneration processes that can be used commercially. Exposing the catalyst surface to <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> generated by SO 2 or H 2 SO 4 is a promising way to rejuvenate the initial activity of the catalyst. The chemical stability of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> was investigated by the interaction of the SCR reactant gases with the sulphate-promoted catalysts. Sulphate ions deposited {{on the surface of the}} TiO 2 /V 2 O 5 /WO 3 were thermally stable at 420 degreesC. The introduced <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> were chemically unstable when the catalyst was treated with the SCR reactants at 400 degreesC, but were chemically stable when the catalyst was exposed for the SCR reactants at 350 degreesC. Sulphation after water treatment provided more chemically stable surface <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> at 400 degreesC. The presence of <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> enhanced the number and the strength of the surface acid sites. The amount of ammonia bound to the Bronsted acid sites decreased with the potassium content of the catalyst while the amount of ammonia adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites was almost unaffected. Since potassium both retarded the redox potential of the surface vanadia species and decreased the amount of ammonia bound to the Bronsted acid sites, it is important to wash the strongly deactivated catalyst before sulphation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Titanium oxides, with {{moderately}} high surface areas exhibiting a mixed mesoporous/microporous texture, were prepared from titanium ethoxide. The porosity seemed {{to stem from}} the loss of volatile components from the inner coordination sphere of the titanium ions. After impregnation with <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups,</b> a general decrease in surface area was observed. This decrease was more drastic at higher temperatures when the sulphate ions are in a bidentate state of ligation. A high sulphate concentration led to a distinctive decrease in the total pore volume and to the loss of the microporous texture. Micropore blocking appeared to be due to the presence of the bidentate <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups.</b> The latter are responsible for the higher surface acidities displayed by the sulphated oxides...|$|R

Saturated fatty acids with varying chain lengths and <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> were coupled covalently at defined ratios to the polysaccharide Ficoll (MW 400, 000). Chemical analysis of 60 of the sulpholipopolysaccharides synthesized revealed {{that the number of}} <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> per monosaccharide unit varied from 0 to 1. 6, and the number of lipid groups from 0 to 0. 8. Adjuvanticity of these conjugates for the humoral immune response was determined using sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and dinitrophenyl-haptenated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) as antigens. Five days after intraperitoneal injection of adjuvant and antigen, the numbers of direct anti-SRBC plaque-forming cells (PFC) in the spleen were determined. Anti-DNP antibody titres were measured from 1 to 4 weeks after immunization. PFC responses to 2 X 10 (6) SRBC were augmented up to a 100 -fold by conjugates of Ficoll and sulphate (sulphopolysaccharides: SPs) or lipid groups (lipopolysaccharides: LPs). Introduction of low or moderate numbers of lipid groups in SPs reduced adjuvanticity. Adjuvant activity of sulpholipopolysaccharides (SLPs) with varying sulphate and high lipid content depended on the sulphate contents and the chain length of the lipids. Sulphate reduced adjuvanticity of the SLPs, and the number of <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> required for complete annihilation increased with the chain length of the lipid.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the two-step coupled 35 S-radiolabelling of the lipo-oligosaccharidic nodulation (Nod) factors of the bacterium Rhizobium meliloti to a specific radioactivity of 800 Ci/mmol. These radiolabelled Nod factors bind to a particulate fraction from roots of the bacterium's symbiotic host, Medicago truncatula, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 117 nM, similar to that observed with a synthetic tritiated ligand. The first step of the 35 S-labelling involves the synthesis of 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phospho[35 S]sulphate ([35 S]PAPS) from ATP and [35 S]sulphate using yeast enzymes. The second step exploits the sulphotransferase activity of the R. meliloti NodH protein, which has been expressed in Escherichia coli, to transfer the labelled <b>sulphate</b> <b>group</b> from PAPS to non-sulphated Nod factors. This enzyme {{was found to be}} active in E. coli cultured at 18 degrees C but not 37 degrees C. NodH could also transfer the <b>sulphate</b> <b>group</b> from PAPS to a model substrate, tetra-N-acetyl chitotetraose, with apparent Km values of 56 and 70 microM respectively, and exhibited an apparent Km value for non-sulphated Nod factors of 28 microM.

40|$|Background: The uptake of {{sulphur-containing}} compounds plays {{a pivotal}} role in the physiology of bacteria that live in aerobic soils where organosulfur compounds such as sulphonates and sulphate esters represent more than 95 % of the available sulphur. Until now, no information has been available on the uptake of sulphonates by bacterial plant pathogens, particularly those of the Xanthomonas genus, which encompasses several pathogenic species. In the present study, we characterised the alkanesulphonate uptake system (Ssu) of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri 306 strain (X. citri), the etiological agent of citrus canker. Methodology/Principal Findings: A single operon-like gene cluster (ssuEDACB) that encodes both the sulphur uptake system and enzymes involved in desulphurisation was detected in the genomes of X. citri and of the closely related species. We characterised X. citri SsuA protein, a periplasmic alkanesulphonate-binding protein that, together with SsuC and SsuB, defines the alkanesulphonate uptake system.

It has been demonstrated that the occurrence of the disorder implies the coexistence of K+ ions in both six- and seven-fold coordination. This is necessary for assigning to the “average” K+ ion a reasonable bond valence sum of 0. 81 valence units (v. u.) instead of 0. 66 v. u., which is obtained {{in the case of a}} six-fold coordination alone.

Bond valence analysis has shown that, on cooling, increase of the k disorder parameter and shortening of the K-O 2 bond distance together act to maintain constancy in the bond valence sum at the K site, stabilizing the structure. Therefore, the need for keeping at a reasonable bond valence sum the “average” K+ ion seems to apparently be the driving force for the ordering process involving the <b>sulphate</b> <b>group...</b>|$|E

The static distribution of the mobile cations is discussed in terms of the occupancy of interstitial sites and of anion-cation coordination. It is shown that the cations are almost invariably bonded to one and often to two oxygen atoms of neighbouring <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups.</b> The latter therefore play an essential role in the cation diffusion mechanism. The diffusion coefficients are partitioned {{in a way that makes}} it possible to identify separately the contributions from centre-of-mass displacements and rotations of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups.</b> It is concluded that the diffusion coefficient of Li+ is enhanced by up to approximately 50 % by anion reorientation and that of Na+ by approximately 30 %. The near equality of the diffusion coefficients of Li+ and Na+ in both doped Li 2 SO 4 and LiNaSO 4 is shown to arise as a balance between mass and size effects; the implications of this for related systems are noted...|$|R

It is characterised by an ABABABACBABABABC... stacking sequence of layers. The crystal structure of giuseppettite was solved and refined against data collected at the Elettra synchrotron facility, using a 0. 3 · 0. 2 · 0. 2 mm 3 single crystal, twinned on (0 0 1), k ¼ 0 : 9989 A, R ¼ 0 : 074 for 3769 reflections, R ¼ 0 : 073 for 3706 reflections with Fo > 4 rðFoÞ. The structure contains two big cages (‘‘giuseppettite’’ cages) along ½ 0; 0; z, and sequences CCSCCCS of ‘‘cancrinite’’ (C) and ‘‘sodalite’’ cages (S) both along ½ 1 = 3; 2 = 3; z and ½ 2 = 3; 1 = 3; z. Four <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> surrounded by sodium cations, and alternated with potassium cations, are located within the giuseppettite cages, whereas a partially ordered distribution of <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> and chlorine anions occurs within the sodalite cages. The cancrinite cages host sodium cations and water molecules...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of the {{purification}} of novel stereospecific secondary aklylsulphohydrolases present in certain detergent-degrading micro-organisms, it became apparent that substrates prepared by sulphating secondary alcohols with H 2 SO 4 are heterogeneous. Apart from the racemization that occurs if resolved alcohols are sulphated, evidence is provided to show that other isomers are produced in which the position of the ester <b>sulphate</b> <b>group</b> on the alkyl chain has been altered. These changes can be avoided if pyridine/SO 3 reagent (prepared with SO 3) is substituted as sulphating agent. Experiments in which secondary alkyl sulphates prepared by both methods were tested as potential substrates for the two secondary alkylsulphohydrolase enzymes of Comamonas terrigena have provided initial information about the specificity of the enzymes...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to study efficacy of single dose of intravenous magnesium sulphate to reduce post-operative pain in patients undergoing inguinal surgery. One hundred patients undergoing inguinal surgery were divided randomly in {{two groups of}} 50 each. The patients of magnesium <b>sulphate</b> <b>group</b> (Group-I) received magnesium sulphate 50 mg/kg in 250 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution IV whereas patients in control group (Group-II) received same volume of isotonic sodium chloride over 30 minutes preoperatively. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg) and pethidine (1 mg/kg). Atracurium besylate (0. 5 mg/kg) was given to facilitate insertion of LMA. Pain at emergence from anaesthesia and 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours after surgery was evaluated. The timing and dosage of rescue analgesic during first 24 hrs after operation was noted. Pain in postop period was significantly lower in magnesium <b>sulphate</b> <b>group</b> in comparison to control group at emergence from anaesthesia and 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hrs postop [1. 86 vs. 1. 96 (P = 0. 138), 1. 22 vs. 1. 82 (P = 0. 001), 1. 32 vs. 1. 88 (P = 0. 000), 2. 74 vs. 3. 84 (P = 0. 000), 1. 36 vs. 2. 00 (P = 0. 000) and 0. 78 vs 1. 30 (P = 0. 000), respectively]. Patients in group-I were more sedated as compared to group-II [sedation score 1. 86 vs. 1. 40 (P = 0. 000) ]. Rescue analgesia requirement postoperatively in first 4, 8 and 16 hrs was significantly lower in patients of group- 1 than in group- II [1. 9 vs. 3. 8 (P < 0. 05), 25. 50 vs. 52. 50 (P < 0. 05) and 0. 000 vs. 7. 5 (P < 0. 05) ].

40|$|Three {{groups of}} casein {{components}} were isolated from horse milk. Group I is almost insoluble at acid and neutral pH, and is rather heterogeneous on alkaline gels {{with or without}} sodium dodecyl <b>sulphate.</b> <b>Group</b> II shows strong similarity to beta-casein from other species, as concluded from its amino acid composition and its N- and C-terminal sequences. This group consists of five electrophoretically distinguishable forms, all containing ester phosphate groups but no carbohydrate. Group III is composed of C-terminal fragments of the beta-like (group II) fraction and probably arises from the action of a plasmin-like enzyme present in horse milk. It does not contain phosphate or carbohydrate. Homology of this group with bovine gamma-caseins is demonstrated. Both beta- and gamma-like caseins are more soluble at 4 degrees C than at room temperature...|$|E

40|$|Rat liver cells {{grown in}} primary {{cultures}} {{in the presence of}} [35 S]sulphate synthesize a labelled heparan sulphate-like glycosaminoglycan. The characterization of the polysaccharide as heparan sulphate is based on its resistance to digestion with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase and its susceptibility to HNO 2 treatment. The <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> (including sulphamino and ester <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups)</b> are distributed along the polymer in the characteristic block fashion. In 3 H-labelled heparan sulphate, isolated after incubation of the cells with [3 H]galactose, 40 % of the radioactive uronic acid units are l-iduronic acid, the remainder being d-glucuronic acid. The location of heparan sulphate at the rat liver cell surface is demonstrated; part of the labelled polysaccharide can be removed from the cells by mild treatment with trypsin or heparitinase. Further, a purified plasma-membrane fraction isolated from rats previously injected with [35 S]sulphate contains radioactively labelled heparan sulphate. A proteoglycan macromolecule composed of heparan sulphate chains attached to a protein core can be solubilized from the membrane fraction by extraction with 6 m-guanidinium chloride. The proteoglycan structure is degraded by treatment with papain, Pronase or alkali. The production of heparan [35 S]sulphate by rat liver cells incubated in the presence of [35 S]sulphate was followed. Initially the amount of labelled polysaccharide increased with increasing incubation time. However, after 10 h of incubation a steady state was reached where biosynthetic and degradative processes were in balance...|$|R
40|$|A highly sulphated, {{methylated}} polysaccharide, aeodan, {{isolated from}} the red seaweed Aeodes orbitosa was shown to contain galactose, 2 -̲̲O-methyl-D-galactose, 4 -O̲-methyl-Lgalactose, 6 -O̲-methyl-D-galactose, xylose, and glycerol. The polysaccharide was desulphated with methanolic hydrogen chloride. Periodate oxidation of aeodan and desulphated aeodan, followed by reduction and hydrolysis, revealed the presence of 1, 4 - and 1, 3 -linked galactose residues and 1, 3 -linked 6 -O̲-methy l-D-galactose residues in aeodan. Treatment of aeodan with sodium hydroxide revealed {{that the majority of}} the ester <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> were alkali stable. Methylation of desulphated aeodan revealed that the polysaccharide was composed entirely of 1, 3 and 1, 4 links. Methylation of aeodan revealed the presence of 1, 3 - and 1, 4 - linked units, 1, 3 -linked galactose- 2 -sulphate, and 1, 3 -linked galactose- 2, 6 -disulphate units in the polysaccharide. Partial hydrolysis of aeodan resulted in the isolation and characterisation of 3 -O̲-D-galactopyranosyl-D-galactose and 4 -O̲-ß-D-galactopyranosyl- D-galactose. A sulphated, methylated polysaccharide, phyllymenan, {{isolated from the}} red seaweed Phyllymenia cornea was shown to contain galactose, 2 -O̲-methyl-D-galactose, 4 -O̲-methyl L- galactose, 6 -O̲-methyl -D-galactose, and xylose. The polysaccharide was completely desulphated with methanolic hydrogen chloride. Periodate oxidation of phyllymenan before and after desulphation revealed that removal of the <b>sulphate</b> ester <b>groups</b> had not produced any new adjacent hydroxyl groups. Alkali treatment of phyllymenan revealed that the ester <b>sulphate</b> <b>groups</b> were alkali stable.
