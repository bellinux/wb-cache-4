40|$|A {{multiple}} regression analysis of domestic and local airline indirect costs was carried out to formulate cost estimating equations for airline indirect costs. Data from CAB and FAA sources covering the years 1962 - 66 was used, and the costs were broken down into the classification of the uniform system of accounts Form 41, used by the airlines in reporting to the CAB. Thus regression equations were found for 1) annual system expenses in the categories such as Passenger Servicing, Traffic Servicing, Promotion and Sales, General and Administrative, etc. {{as well as an}} overall indirect operating cost; and 2) annual station expenses where the Aircraft and Traffic <b>Servicing</b> <b>expenses</b> for individual stations are examined. A stepwise regression technique is used to select the best combinations of independent variables for the equations. The independent variables were data such as revenue passenger miles, passengers enplaned, revenue aircraft miles, total revenue aircraft departures, etc. The results generally showed that a high degree of correlation could be found between the costs and some combination of these variables.

30|$|More {{detailed}} purpose codes {{would significantly}} improve tracking all external financing sources in global health. Additionally, better classification of expenditures would help elucidate exactly how charitable organizations are utilizing their funds, promoting transparency and accountability. It {{became clear that}} there is an overall lack of standardized measurement metrics, and in some cases, a complete lack of reporting on what defined a program <b>service</b> <b>expense.</b> Organizations adhering to the short-term mission model best illustrate this point. In this model, surgical teams from high resource settings come to a LMIC for short period of time, often with their own supplies and equipment, and perform a very specific surgery on a group of patients in a defined period of time. While their own time is often voluntary, the cost of their travel (airfare, accommodations, and meals) is often paid for by the organization. If these indirect costs are being counted as, for example, a <b>service</b> <b>expense</b> or administrative expense, it will not be clear from the financial data that these expenses were actually relating to a short-term mission, making it challenging to track funding flows to all elements of charitable surgical care. Consequently, this makes it difficult to fully analyze the allocation of resources and make corresponding recommendations for their most efficient use.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the U. S. economy has seen a marked shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy. An {{increasing}} number of firms today invest in intangible assets such as research and development, brand, and customer loyalty (attraction and retention), rather than real assets such as property, plant, and equipment. This investment shift is not reflected in corporate balance sheets. ^ The two largest forms of corporate spending on intangible capital are research and development (R 2 ̆ 6 D) spending and customer acquisition and service (A 2 ̆ 6 S) spending. The finance literature has considered the effect of R 2 ̆ 6 D on firm value, but has largely ignored the effects of A 2 ̆ 6 S.

The intangible asset includes advertising investments and brands whose signaling value is undoubted at ‘hard times’, when cultural entrepreneurs have to signal their ‘identity and reputation’ in order to increase grants and, as a consequence, revenues.
