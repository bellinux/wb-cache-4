5|$|The {{indigenous}} Boorong {{people of}} northwestern Victoria {{saw it as}} Won, a boomerang thrown by Totyarguil (Altair). The Aranda people of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a coolamon carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth {{by a group of}} sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created Gosses Bluff crater, 175km west of Alice Springs. The Torres Strait Islanders saw Corona Australis {{as part of a larger}} constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of Scorpius's tail; the Pleiades and Orion were also associated. This constellation was Tagai's canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the Usiam, and Orion, called the Seg. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a suckerfish, while Eta Sagittarii and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe. On the island of Futuna, the figure of Corona Australis was called Tanuma and in the Tuamotus, it was called Na Kaua-ki-Tonga.|$|E
25|$|In John 21, Peter goes {{fishing with}} six other disciples. They do not catch any fish all night, {{but in the}} morning Jesus meets them, and tells them to throw their net on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> When they do, there is a miraculous catch of 153 fish.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum is a {{circular}} device that is set to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and draws in the nets. The powered drum allowed the nets to be drawn in much faster and along with the faster gas powered boats, fisherman were able to fish in areas they had previously been unable to go into, thereby revolutionizing the fishing industry.|$|E
50|$|Fenders {{can be seen}} {{hanging from}} safety rails on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
60|$|The girl seized <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{in a firm}} grasp, and {{the next}} moment it plunged headlong into the Hole.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment after}} this, <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam {{suddenly}} ceased, {{and the great}} paddle wheels, on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> began slowly to revolve.|$|R
25|$|On Andrea Doria, the {{decision}} to abandon ship was made within 30minutes of impact. A sufficient number of lifeboats {{for all of the}} passengers and crew were positioned on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> Deck. Procedures called for lowering the lifeboats to be fastened alongside the glass-enclosed Promenade Deck (one deck below), where evacuees could step out windows directly into the boats, which would then be lowered down to the sea.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a {{circular}} device that was set to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated {{the era of the}} 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. The ship served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally a boat is {{organized}} so that alternate rowers row on {{port and starboard}} (or strokeside and bowside), with stroke on port side (having their blade to their own right) (strokeside). This is sometimes reversed, so that stroke {{is on the other}} side (having their blade to their own left); such a boat is usually described as 'bow rigged'. This is often on the basis of the abilities of the available personnel, to allow putting an experienced starboard side (bowside) rower in the stroke seat, for example but it is the norm for UK coastal rowers where racing is done clockwise around buoys. The eight in the illustration at the top of this article is rigged strokeside. If the eight were bow rigged, the oar for the stroke (number 8) rower would be on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> (bowside/starboard).|$|E
60|$|They slept as usual, {{wrapped up}} in their buffalo-robes by <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> as all agreed that this was {{preferable}} to a close room in a Mexican house.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a fishing}} boat this {{attitude}} allows the nets to be handled without <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> becoming [...] "broadsides" [...] to the waves allowing them to break over <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Fishnets can then be handled without putting <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> at risk.|$|R
60|$|The party now set to work. With the gimlet holes {{were made}} a couple <b>of</b> feet above <b>the</b> water. In them the hooks were inserted, and from these the petards were {{suspended}} by ropes, so as to lie against <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> an inch only above the water's level. The fuses were inserted; and all being now in readiness for blowing a hole in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>boats,</b> they regained <b>the</b> log, and awaited the signal.|$|R
25|$|The next rower ('seven' in an eight) sits {{directly}} behind stroke and is typically both fit and skilled: this rower {{acts as a}} buffer between the stroke {{and the rest of}} the crew. They closely follow the rhythm set by the stroke and help transmit this rhythm to the rest of the boat, and particularly to the rowers rowing on the same side as seven, since rowers tend to look at the blades on their <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to check their timing. If the strokeman increases or decreases the stroke rate it is essential that seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the men in}} {{the boat}} rowed back down the creek and then up the left fork. Without a {{supporting}} land force, the boat was vulnerable to attack from Confederate soldiers on the river banks, and the deeper waters of the left fork meant that they might encounter a larger craft than their own. Upon coming around a bend in the creek, they saw three seemingly abandoned schooners moored on shore. As Mullen prepared to fire the howitzer at the three ships, the boat came under fire from about 400 Confederate soldiers on shore. Summers ordered Anderson and the other oarsmen to row towards the schooners, and, when close enough, Mullen tossed an incendiary device onto each. With the schooners in flames, the boat began retreating downstream through heavy fire from the Confederates. Half of the boat's oars and Summers' musket were destroyed by gunfire, and there were several bullet holes in the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> As Anderson and the other men who still had oars continued to row downstream, the rest of the oarsmen bailed water while Mullen fired the howitzer at the soldiers on shore. They successfully escaped from the Confederate force, and although the boat was badly damaged, the only casualty was one landsman slightly wounded.|$|E
500|$|The Cambridge {{crew was}} [...] "slightly heavier" [...] than their opponents, {{weighing}} in {{at a ceremony}} at City Hall overseen by Boris Johnson at [...] more per rower than Oxford. Thirteen of the eighteen competitors were British, the highest proportion for a decade. Of the two crews, Cambridge featured three returning Blues to Oxford's one. Oxford University Boat Club's president Ben Myers suggested [...] "we're home-grown guys, {{we know about the}} Boat Race and we're keen". Oxford were coached once again by Sean Bowden, who set their boat up as [...] "tandem rigged" [...] (where two consecutive crew row on the same <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat),</b> the first time such a configuration had been used in the Boat Race since 1975. Steve Trapmore was making his debut as Cambridge's coach. Oxford's stroke, Simon Hislop, had recovered from testicular cancer in time to participate in the race.|$|E
5000|$|A shroud {{is similar}} to a stay, but is located in <b>the</b> athwartship plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel. Thus, shrouds come down to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and are {{attached}} to chainplates. Shrouds may be held away from the mast by spreaders.|$|R
50|$|The table planks consist {{entirely of}} {{parallel}} ribs that {{begin and end}} at the rail. The bottom (longest) plank runs from stem to stern and the top two (shortest) are located amidships at the railing on the port and starboard <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tot {{slipped off}} the seat at once and {{stretched}} himself out on the boards underneath. Dot quickly followed him, and then for a time they lay very still in the darkness, listening to the water as it rippled softly along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{meat and}} {{cartilage}} of the pelagic stingray are sometimes utilized, {{for example in}} Indonesia, {{but for the most}} part this species is considered worthless and discarded when caught. Susceptible to longlines, gillnets, purse seines, and bottom trawls, it is captured incidentally in large numbers throughout its range. Rays caught on longlines suffer high mortality, as fishers are wary of being stung and remove the rays from the hooks by smashing them against the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> causing severe damage to the mouth and jaws. The extent of this bycatch has yet to be quantified. Regardless, surveys in the Pacific suggest that pelagic stingray numbers have increased since the 1950s, possibly due to commercial fisheries depleting the dominant predators in the ecosystem, such as sharks and tuna. The lack of population declines, coupled with its wide distribution and high reproductive rate, has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list this species under Least Concern. Recent research has been conducted into reducing pelagic stingray bycatch on longlines by switching to larger and/or [...] "C"-shaped hooks.|$|E

2500|$|This {{photograph}} {{shows the}} passengers {{gathered on the}} forward passenger deck getting ready to disembark. [...] A net is hanging over the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> this is a safety net that will be rigged under the gangplank to prevent people who might fall off the plank from landing in the water.|$|E
50|$|On a narrowboat or canal <b>boat,</b> <b>the</b> gunwale {{is synonymous}} with the side deck - a narrow ledge running <b>the</b> full length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{allowing}} a person (cautiously) to walk along <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabin, generally with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> a handrail mounted on the roof.|$|R
5000|$|A touring canoe is {{sometimes}} {{covered with a}} greatly extended deck, forming a [...] "cockpit" [...] for the paddlers. A cockpit has the advantage that the gunwales can be made lower and narrower so the paddler can reach the water more easily, and <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> can be higher, keeping <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> dryer.|$|R
60|$|As {{his words}} were {{emphasized}} by <b>the</b> row <b>of</b> men, who with levelled muskets ranged themselves along at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> ceased rowing.|$|R
2500|$|The divers usually {{enter the}} water by {{stepping}} off a dive platform or the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and return on board using a ladder or a lift. In some cases a smaller [...] "tender" [...] {{is used to}} carry divers to and from less accessible sites, and to rescue divers who are in difficulty or who drift away from the boat.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} types of team boats. In one, four or five horses are placed in each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> in a {{circular}} treadwheel, and the paddle wheels, arranged like the side wheel steamboat of later days were turned by means of cogs and gearing connected with other cogs on the shaft of the paddle wheels. The horses were hitched to strong timbers and by a forward movement of the feet caused the treadwheel upon which they stood to revolve and thus operate the gear wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The Madison Street bridge tender {{opened the}} draw in time, but the pilot on Orient miscalculated the steamer's course, and the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> hit the draw pier. [...] This knocked the steamer off course, {{so when it}} came to the Morrison Bridge, it was not headed {{straight}} through the draw. [...] As a result, the steamer hit the stone abutment on the east side of the draw span of the Morrison Bridge. [...] This knocked a hole in the right side of the steamer about 25 feet back from the bow.|$|E
60|$|In {{another minute}} it came, {{dragging}} them downward till the water trickled over <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and backward towards the pit. But before ever they reached it the deep had digested its prey, and, {{save for the}} great air-bubbles which burst about them and a mixed, unnatural swell, was calm again. For the moment they were safe.|$|R
50|$|Corbeau died as <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a boating {{accident}} in Georgian Bay. During a party hosted by Corbeau aboard his <b>boat,</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> struck a sand bar. Portholes on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> were open and water entered <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> through them, sinking <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{within a matter}} <b>of</b> minutes. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 42 persons aboard, 25 died, including Corbeau.|$|R
25|$|Cuyahoga sank {{within two}} minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collision}} in 58feet <b>of</b> water. <b>The</b> cutter's 14-foot utility boat had popped free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sinking vessel and Boatswains Mate Roger Wild put the injured survivors in <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> <b>The</b> un-injured clung to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> until <b>the</b> freighter {{had returned to}} pick up survivors. 11 on board Cuyahoga were killed, but 18 survived.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an image}} {{broadcast}} {{on the night}} of his arrest, he was shown stepping out of the boat in which he had been hiding. Other sources described him [...] "lying on his stomach, straddling the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> (…) His left arm and left leg hung over the boat’s side. He appeared to struggle for consciousness". Then he was [...] "hauled down to the grassy ground" [...] by a SWAT officer. In a photograph he can be seen lying on the ground on his back with his hands cuffed behind him, being helped by medical staff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} dildo is unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) describes the word as being of [...] "origin unknown". One theory is that it originally referred to the phallus-shaped peg used to lock an oar in position on a dory (small boat). It would be inserted into a hole on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and is very similar in shape to the modern toy. It {{is possible that the}} sex toy takes its name from this sailing tool, which also lends its name to the town of Dildo and the nearby Dildo Island in Newfoundland, Canada. Others suggest the word is a corruption of Italian diletto [...] "delight".|$|E
2500|$|Skiffs have fixed {{rather than}} sliding seats, and the blades {{are held in}} thole pins at the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> rather than outriggers. The blades are made of wood with leather collars and {{traditional}} spoons. Pressure is applied by the feet against an adjustable wooden plate known as a [...] "stretcher board". Skiffs are usually [...] "Singles" [...] with one sculler, or [...] "Doubles" [...] with two scullers (one behind the other) and a cox. However skiffs with more scullers or incorporating a sail are also used. Skiffing {{takes place in the}} Netherlands and Argentina, using the design of traditional Thames skiff although Argentinian skiffs usually have outriggers instead of tholes.|$|E

25|$|Bumper boats: This {{ride was}} {{supposedly}} safer, but the engines often leaked gasoline, {{at least once}} requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much on his skin. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on <b>the</b> small-sized <b>boats,</b> consequently resulting in them hanging off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and being fractured during collisions.|$|R
