40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that binocular flash-induced nystagmus (B-FIN) can be evoked in humans. Design: The study evaluated the presence of B-FIN by stimulation with a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash.</b> Setting: The study was conducted with 12 healthy patients in the Otorhinolaryngology Department of the University of Genoa (Italy), between April 2008 and January 2009. Methods: Patients underwent binocular flashing light stimulation, in the dark, by <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> presented through a photostimulator at frequencies of 4. 7 and 7. 69 cycles/second for 120 seconds, with their eyes covered by a homogeneous field hollow opal hemisphere. The photostimulator was placed in three different positions with respect to the anterior-posterior axis: 0 u, 45 u to the right, and 45 u to the left. Main Outcome Measures: Eyemovementswere recorded by electronystagmography (ENG). ENGrecording started 30 seconds before the stimulation and stopped 60 seconds after the end of the luminance stimuli to test the presence of flash induced after nystagmus (FIAN). Results: B-FIN was clearly evoked from 10 of the 12 healthy adults, whereas FIAN was evoked from 4 of the 12 subjects. The best stimulation of B-FIN was obtained through an intermittent luminance stimulus presented at a frequency of 4. 7 cycles/second and the photostimulator placed at 0 u to the optic axis. Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrates that B-FIN can be evoked in humans and its possible value in the differential diagnosis between central and peripheral vertigo...|$|R

After the movement, they were asked to judge an apparent size of the afterimage based on a set of comparison stimuli. Experiment 1 showed that the apparent size was the smallest after stepping forward, the largest after stepping backword, and medium after keeping still or stepping of all the four conditions of body movement.

5000|$|The assist light (also {{known as}} AF illuminator) [...] "activates" [...] passive {{autofocus}} systems in low-light and low-contrast situations in some cameras. The lamp projects visible or IR light onto the subject, which the camera's autofocus system uses to achieve focus. Many cameras {{that do not}} have a dedicated autofocus assist lamp instead use their built-in flash, illuminating the subject with stroboscopic bursts of light. The strobe bursts aid the autofocus system in the same fashion as a dedicated assist light, but have the disadvantage of startling or annoying living subjects. Another disadvantage is that if the camera uses flash focus assist and is set to an operation mode that overrides the flash, it may also disable the focus assist and autofocus may fail to acquire the subject. Similar <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flashing</b> is sometime used to reduce the red-eye effect, but this method is only intended to constrict the subject's eye pupils prior to the actual shot being taken, and thus reduce retinal reflections.|$|R

Pressure sensitive foot-switches and video recordings of each jump-down from a sagittal view allowed the expression of EMG in temporal relation to limb trajectories and foot-ground contact. Results from EMG analysis demonstrated a stable, global pattern of activation regardless of visual condition and independent of knowledge of the jump height. A generalized strategy of EMG activation was adequate for successful landing on stable height trials, but subjects developed a different default strategy for jumping at random height when inadequate visual update was provided.

40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{designed}} to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the visual sensory system and oculomotor responses to different types of visual and vestibular stimulation. The instrument, called a Computerized Electro-Oculograph (CEOG), is an integrated computer-controlled system which performs a series of important diagnostic tests. It can generate and control the stimulus, as well as record patient responses, testing both the visual and oculomotor systems, and also provide a regular pattern applicable to both clinical and research purposes. Visual evoked response and eye movement data is processed by computer for quantitative analysis and “strip chart” data is then displayed on a scrolling T. V. screen. Hard copy of the output is also available. The system can analyze visual evoked responses to both <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flashing</b> lights and intermittent patterned stimulation. Other programs study the main features of the wave form and details of speed, frequency, and latency, as well as the symmetry of spontaneous, visual, and vestibular evoked eye movements. A major advantage of the system is its rapid, automatic, and quantitative operation with no risk to the current status of the visual and oculomotor pathways as it performs EOG (electro-oculograph), VER (visual evoked response), ERG (electronetinograph), and caloric tests.

5000|$|Helicopters also vibrate; an {{unadjusted}} helicopter {{can easily}} vibrate {{so much that}} it will shake itself apart. To reduce vibration, all helicopters have rotor adjustments for height and weight. Blade height is adjusted by changing the pitch of the blade. Weight is adjusted by adding or removing weights on the rotor head and/or at the blade end caps. Most also have vibration dampers for height and pitch. Some also use mechanical feedback systems to sense and counter vibration. Usually the feedback system uses a mass as a [...] "stable reference" [...] and a linkage from the mass operates a flap to adjust the rotor's angle of attack to counter the vibration. Adjustment is difficult in part because measurement of the vibration is hard, usually requiring sophisticated accelerometers mounted throughout the airframe and gearboxes. The most common blade vibration adjustment measurement system is to use a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> lamp, and observe painted markings or coloured reflectors {{on the underside of the}} rotor blades. The traditional low-tech system is to mount coloured chalk on the rotor tips, and see how they mark a linen sheet. Gearbox vibration most often requires a gearbox overhaul or replacement. Gearbox or drive train vibrations can be extremely harmful to a pilot. The most severe being pain, numbness, loss of tactile discrimination and dexterity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{filtering}} of images of objects in a CAD system, that simultaneously move in very fast and slow motion, so that their dynamics {{can be observed in}} truthfully time scaled VR. Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) are miniaturized mechanical or optical equipment less than a millimetre in size. While some have movable parts, such as membranes, valves, cantilevers, others may have only fixed parts. Those with movable parts, can flick, pump or pulsate at rates of up to 500 Hz, while other components in the same MEMS move at slower speeds. This poses a series of problems for truthfully time scaled visualizations. Due to the human being’s vision limitation, and the computer’s frame rate (which is normally 30 times per second), very fast movements can not be observed clearly, e. g. when a gear rotating in clockwise direction is in high frequency, it appears rotating counter-clockwise. In MEMS a simple truthful time scaling may result in one of the objects still at non-observable fast motion, while another practically reaches a standstill. To solve the dilemma we simulate to illuminate the moving objects with a simulated stroboscopic light. The stroboscopic simulation is demonstrated with an example of rotating gears created in a virtual interactive VRML environment. In this paper we present the results of a systematic combinatorial analysis for finding the stroboscopic illumination intervals and <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> duration that produce useful dynamic images...|$|R

Heuser (born August 29, 1942) is an American Professor of Biophysics in the {{department}} of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine as well as a Professor at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Matieral Sciences (iCeMS) at Kyoto University. Heuser created quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy, a pioneering technique that lets biologists take detailed pictures of fleeting events inside living cells. For decades, Heuser has used this technique to capture details of the molecular mechanisms that underlie many basic biological activities, including nerve cell signal transmission, muscle contraction, and most recently, the fusion of viruses with cells during the spread of infection. He compares quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to using a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> to freeze the action in a photograph. To make it possible to image the frozen sample with an electron microscope, Heuser adds an ultra-thin film of metallic platinum that molds snugly against the sample's frozen surface contours. He and others in his lab have worked to make the equipment and procedures necessary for this process available to researchers around the world. Currently Heuser has patents pending on Washington University's behalf for even more advanced versions of his quick-freezing machines. Heuser graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1969 and joined the Washington University faculty as a professor of biophysics in 1980. He is currently associate editor of the Journal of Neurocytology and previously served as associate editor of the Journal of Cell Biology. His curriculum vitae lists over 200 scientific publications.

Employing an exclusively counterclockwise rotating mutant ("gutted" RP 1091 strain) and using power spectral density, autocorrelation and residual mean square angle analysis, we found that a simple superposition of rotational diffusion on a steady rotary motion is insufficient to describe the observed rotation. We observed two additional rotational components, one fluctuating (0. 04 - 0. 6 s) and one oscillating (0. 8 - 7 s).
