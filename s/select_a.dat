5|$|Fulk {{returned}} to Antioch when Zengi dispatched Sawar, governor of Aleppo, {{to invade the}} principality in 1132 or 1133. After defeating the invaders, Fulk entered Antioch. Since the principality needed a firm government, the Antiochene noblemen approached Fulk to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> husband for Constance. He chose Raymond of Poitiers, the younger son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. He did not announce his decision in public {{because he wanted to}} prevent Alice and RogerII of Sicily from intervening.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{artillery}} during September 7 shelled batteries of the 9th and 99th Field Artillery Battalions, forcing {{displacement of}} two batteries during the day. US air strikes and artillery kept both Hills 902 and 570 under heavy attack. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere that day, Walker ordered {{it and the}} ROK II Corps to attack and seize Hill 902 and Ka-san. He directed the ROK 1st Division and the US 1st Cavalry Division to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> boundary between them and to maintain physical contact during the attack.|$|E
30|$|DALP-TS {{utilizes}} two counters (both initialized to zero) in {{the neighborhood}} selection process: non-improving move count and minor improving move count. DALP-TS increments the non-improving move count value after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> non-improving move and resets the value to zero after selecting either type of improving move. Likewise, DALP-TS increments the minor improving move count value after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> minor improving move and resets the value to zero after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> major improving move; however, after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> non-improving move, the minor improving move count does not change. This logic prevents DALP-TS from indefinitely cycling between non-improving and minor improving moves. DALP-TS halts when either of these counters reach a predetermined cessation value (maximum value).|$|R

When <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> column, the entire matrix had to be searched for 1s. When <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> row, an entire column had to be searched for 1s. After <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> row, that row and a number of columns had to be searched for 1s. To improve this search time from complexity O(n) to O(1), Knuth implemented a sparse matrix where only 1s are stored.|$|R

5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these bowls were picked in a {{hierarchical}} system {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order. The ACC's agreement with the bowls dictated that the bowls would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the bowls with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could <b>select</b> <b>a</b> 53 team over a 62 team, but could not <b>select</b> <b>a</b> 44 team over a 62 team.|$|E
