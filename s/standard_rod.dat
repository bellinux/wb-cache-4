40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to validate a variant in the loop ileostomy construction to reduce peristomal pressure ulcers and, subsequently, the need of stoma therapist assistance {{and the frequency of}} changing the stoma appliance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have enrolled 33 consecutive patients who underwent two stage restorative proctocolectomies. The first consecutive 13 patients operated on had their ileostomies constructed with a <b>standard</b> <b>rod.</b> In the following 20 patients, we placed a 5. 3 -mm suction catheter tube closed with a stitch to form a "ring" and without any stitches fixing it to the skin. RESULTS: In the "ring" rod group 40 % of patients did not report any complication compared to the 8 % of patients in the <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> group (p = 0. 046). Pressure ulcers were absent in this group, while it affected 61 % of the patients in the <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> group (p < 0. 001). Patients in the "ring" rod group needed significantly less assistance time by the stoma therapist (p < 0. 01) and required significantly fewer stoma appliance changes (p < 0. 01). In our institution, the overall cost for the complete management of a <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> ileostomy was 73. 16 (29. 83 - 130. 49) euro compared to 46. 65 (23. 15 - 93. 48) euro for a "ring" rod ileostomy (p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a "ring" rod configuration led to an elimination of pressure ulcers due to the rigid rod, a shorter time requirement for stoma care and a decreased number of appliances required and was subsequently associated with lower costs of assistance. A tighter fitting around the ileostomy that avoided stool infiltration improved the practical management of the stoma with a "ring" rod...|$|E
40|$|For early-type galaxies the Fundamental Plane is a {{scaling law}} {{equivalent}} {{to the existence of}} a <b>standard</b> <b>rod.</b> From a Fundamental Plane measurement of distant early-type galaxies, along the line of sight of a galaxy cluster closer to us, it is possible to detect the magniﬁcation effect on the <b>standard</b> <b>rod,</b> through which we can obtain an estimate of the projected mass density of the lens at the image positions of the distant galaxies considered. This property can have an important appication in weak lensing-based studies of the mass proﬁles of galaxy clusters, because it could solve the problem of the “mass-sheet degeneracy”, which is intrinsic to this kind of diagnostics. In this Thesis a method to break the mass-sheet degeneracy based on the joint use of weak lensing observations and Fundamental Plane measurements is developed. The statistical properties of this mass measurement method are studied and an analytical expression for the estimated error on the determination of the mass is derived.

However, the ileostomy itself may have complications and therefore affect quality of life (QOL). The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the predictors of complications of the ileostomy formation and closure and of the QOL of these patients. METHOD: Forty-four consecutive patients who underwent RPC were enrolled. Records of the ileostomy follow-up were retrieved from a prospectively collected database and QOL was assessed with the Stoma-QOL questionnaire. Ileostomy site coordinates were measured. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS: In this series, three patients experienced peristomal herniae, two ileostomy stenosis, seven ileostomy retraction and fourteen peristomal dermatitis. Emergency surgery was the only predictor of parastomal hernia (P = 0. 017). Stenosis correlated with the distance from the umbilicus (tau = 0. 24, P = 0. 021). Use of <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> and retraction were independent predictors of peristomal dermatitis (P = 0. 049 and P = 0. 001). Stoma-QOL was directly correlated to the age of the patients and to the occurrence of parastomal hernia (P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 021, respectively). After stoma closure, two patients reported wound sepsis and seven suffered obstructive episodes.

40|$|Context. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) are oscillatory {{features}} in the galaxy power spectrum which are used as a <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> to measure the cosmological expansion. These have been studied in Cartesian space (Fourier or real space) or in spherical harmonic space in thin shells. Aims. Future wide-field surveys will cover both wide and deep regions {{of the sky and}} thus require a simultaneous treatment of the spherical sky and of an extended radial coverage. The Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) decomposition is a natural basis for the analysis of fields in this geometry and facilitates the combination of BAO surveys with other cosmological probes readily described in this basis. In this paper, we present a new way to analyse BAOs by studying the BAO wiggles from the SFB power spectrum. Methods. In SFB space, the power spectrum generally has both a radial (k) and tangential (`) dependence and so do the BAOs. In the deep survey limit and ignoring evolution, the SFB power spectrum is purely radial and reduces to the Cartesian Fourier power spectrum. In the opposite limit of a thin shell, all the information is contained in the tangential modes described by the 2 D spherical harmonic power spectrum. Results. We find that the radialisation of the SFB power spectrum is still a good approximation even when considering an evolving and biased galaxy field with a finite selection function.

40|$|Poster presentation: Abstract No. : 40275 INTRODUCTION: Recently, {{the use of}} 'magnetically' {{controlled}} growing rods (MCGR) {{has advanced}} the surgical treatment of early onset scoliosis (EOS), providing non-invasive distractions. Occassionally the rod may fail to distract due to slippage of the internal mechanism. This study assessed the occurrence and potential determinants associated with slippage of the MCGR during distraction. METHODS: We prospectively assessed 4 EOS patients with implantation of dual MCGR. Each underwent monthly outpatient distractions. Rod slippage was noted if a 'clunking' noise occurred during distraction. Rradiographic parameters and demographics were analysed. RESULTS: The mean time period from operation to the first slippage was 11 months. Overall, in 168 distraction episodes, slippage was noted in 25 %. Offset rod (35 %) had more slippage compared to the <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> (17 %). Early slippage (within one year of surgery) occurred in 50 % of the patients. Based on the sample size, demographics, number of vertebral levels involved, distance between magnets, and curve alignment/flexibility parameters were not distinctively involved in rod slippage. Despite this slippage, there was overall gain in the implant and the spine. Throughout follow-up, all patients had no pain, had good functional outcome, and {{were satisfied with the}} procedure. CONCLUSION: In MCGR patients, rod slippage can occur within the first year since implantation and may continue thereafter. This is the first study to identify this observation. Larger studies are needed to further validate our findings and determine if such an event is a potential complication or a naturally occurring, physiological fail-safe mechanism that benefits the patient...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} scale free method to {{determine}} the cosmological parameters (Omega_m, Omega_Lambda). The method {{is based on the}} requirement of isotropy of the distribution of orientations of cosmological filaments. The current structure formation paradigm predicts that the first structures to form are voids and filaments, causing a web-like structure of the matter distribution at high redshifts. Recent observational evidence suggests that the threads, or filaments, of the cosmic web most easily are mapped in Ly-alpha emission. We describe how such a 3 D map can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters in a way which, contrary to most other cosmological tests, does not require the use of a <b>standard</b> <b>rod</b> or a standard candle. We perform detailed simulations in order to define the optimal survey parameters for the definition of an observing programme aimed to address this test, and to investigate how statistical and observational errors will influence the results. We conclude that observations should target filaments of comoving size 15 - 50 Mpc in the redshift range 2 - 4, and that each filament must be defined by at least four Ly-alpha emitters. Detection of 20 filaments will be sufficient to obtain a result, while 50 filaments will make it possible to place significant new constraints on the values of Omega_m and Omega_Lambda permitted by the current supernova observations. In a future paper we study how robust these conclusions are to systematic velocities in the survey box. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E

The device showed a mass range of 650 amu and a maximum resolution of ~ 80, metrics that are comparable to the state-of-the-art. We demonstrated that operating our device in the second stability region leads to higher performance despite the unconventional electrode geometry. The data also suggests ion behavior that deviates from the <b>standard</b> circular <b>rod</b> case, motivating new studies. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
