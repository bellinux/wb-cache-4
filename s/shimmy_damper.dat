40|$|Shimmy of {{aircraft}} nose-wheel landing gear is a coupled lateral and torsional dynamic instability {{that may occur}} during take off, taxi, and landing. The potential for shimmy is often discovered when the aircraft undergoes taxi (runway) tests. At this stage the options available to the designer are limited, often to introducing a damper in the steering degree of freedom. This paper presents modeling and analysis of shimmy of a 3 degrees-of-freedom linear nose-wheel landing gear model with a closed-loop <b>shimmy</b> <b>damper</b> mechanism attached to its hydraulic steering. A typical control law is considered for representing the closed-loop hydraulic control in the steering rack and pinion system. The stability {{of the system is}} studied using root locus plots. The results for critical velocity obtained for different values of gain in the closed-loop <b>shimmy</b> <b>damper</b> show that it can he simulated by an equivalent open-loop <b>shimmy</b> <b>damper</b> with appropriate value of damping. This suggests that an equivalent open-loop <b>shimmy</b> <b>damper</b> model can be used in place of the closed-loop <b>shimmy</b> <b>damper</b> to simplify the modeling of integrated airframe-landing gear dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The first {{landing of}} the X- 15 {{airplane}} {{was made at}} 8 : 43 a. m., June 8, 1959, on the hard surface of Rogers Dry Lake. One purpose of the first-glide flight was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the landing-gear system. Some results are presented of the landing-approach characteristics, the impact period, and the runout phase of the landing maneuver. The results indicate that the touchdown was accomplished at a vertical velocity of 2. 0 feet per second for the main gear and 13. 5 feet per second for the nose gear. These vertical velocities were within the values of sinking speeds established by structural design limitations. However, permanent structural deformation occurred in the main-landing-gear system as a result of the landing, and a reevaluation of the gear is being made by the manufacturer. The landing occurred at a true ground speed of 158 knots for main-gear touchdown at an angle of attack of 8. 50. The incremental acceleration at the main gear was 2. 7 g and 7. 39 at the nose gear as a result of the landing. The incremental acceleration at the center of gravity of the airplane was 0. 6 g for the main-gear impact and 2. 4 g for the nose-gear impact. The incremental acceleration at the main gear as a result of the nose-gear impact was 4. 8 g. The extreme rearward location of the main-gear skids appears to offer satisfactory directional stability characteristics during the run- out phase of the landing. No evidence of nosewheel shimmy was indicated during the impact and runout phase of the landing despite the absence of a <b>shimmy</b> <b>damper</b> on the nose gear. The maximum amount of skid wear as a result of the landing was on the order of 0. 005 inch. No appreciable amount of tire wear was indicated for the dual, corotating nosewheels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{theory of}} <b>shimmy</b> <b>damping</b> is {{investigated}} including tire friction, spindle bearing friction, and hydraulic damping. A new theoretical improvement in hydraulic damping is presented. Experimental {{results are presented}} along with a discussion concerning the limitations due to the approxima-tions used in the theory. The basic theory of wheelchair caster shimmy was published by the authors in 1984, and an exami-nation {{of the sources of}} <b>shimmy</b> <b>damping</b> is corrected and updated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} sub-zero {{temperatures}} on energy dissipation levels is very essential in Polish climatic conditions. Experimental research results (made on <b>shimmy</b> self-oscillation <b>damper</b> {{used in a}} landing gear of a small plane) show that energy dissipation level of an elastomeric friction damper (in opposition to hydraulic) is decreasing with dropping temperature. This situation {{is a result of}} significant differences in thermal expansion of materials, especially the specific elastomer feature – large thermal expansion (elastomer have thermal expansion about 50 times larger than steel). Simulation of damper work, using Finite Element Method, confirmed those dependencies. An estimation of the friction coefficient has been made between the elastomer and aluminium surface. It has been ascertained that those values are relatively small, from 0. 13 initial moment declining to 0. 085 then rising to 0. 256...|$|R
