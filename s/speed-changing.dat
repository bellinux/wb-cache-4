40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{interactions}} of the multi-lane freeway mainline, upstream, downstream, the diversity of environmental conditions, {{as well as the}} complexity of geometric configuration, <b>speed-change</b> lanes of the multi-lane freeway interchange present greatest safety and operational challenges for drivers. Most freeway crashes occur in the vicinity of interchange diverging and merging areas, especially in <b>speed-change</b> lanes. In this paper, the UC-win/Road 5 software was used as the technical tool, and a three-dimensional driving scene was built. Multi-lane freeway field data were used for the calibration of model parameters. The geometry configuration of the <b>speed-change</b> lanes as well as the driving behavior characteristics such as speed, acceleration rate, glancing in the diverging and merging areas were studied in this paper. Based on the driving simulation study in the areas, results supply a valuable technical reference for <b>speed-change</b> lane geometry configuration, the length design of <b>speed-change</b> lane, the operational safety evaluation of multi-lane freeway diverging and merging areas, also the operation and management of multi-lane freeways...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{that affect}} drivers at {{interchanges}} are various and include changing lanes, changes in speed limits, and lengths of <b>speed-change</b> lanes. State Departments of Transportation (DOTs), local authorities, and transportation researchers use reported crash locations for analysis, neglecting the functionality of <b>speed-change</b> lanes. This {{may lead to}} the inaccurate prediction of the number of crashes and non-optimum geometric designs. This study used a newly proposed method for locating crashes by the functionality of <b>speed-change</b> lanes instead of exact crash location for safety analysis. Missouri crash reports were reviewed to determine how police officers located crashes. In addition, the functional and physical classification methods were compared. Crash distributions were presented for different types of facilities, such as freeway segments, <b>speed-change</b> lane segments, and ramp segments, in order to better understand the safety of different interchange-related facilities. In addition, on the basis of crash data, the safety influence areas were estimated using empirical data. By using functional classification, more crashes were assigned to <b>speed-change</b> lanes than ramps or freeways that had been assigned through the use of physical classification. Mainline freeway segments still generated the most crashes in interchanges under functional classification (62. 09 %), with <b>speed-change</b> lanes second (21. 21 %). The interchange influence area determined in this research was 2000 ft., which is longer than the 1500 ft. discussed in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, <b>speed-change</b> lane of freeway {{interchange}} {{is a big}} safety risks area. The reasonable {{length of}} <b>speed-change</b> lane can effectively reduce the safety risk. From the point of driver‘s safety and comfort, this paper studies {{on the length of}} <b>speed-change</b> lane by doing experiment on drivers driving on behalf of cars and trucks. Through the theoretical and experimental analysis, we study on vehicle speed and variation of driver driving workload, establishing the relationship between length and driver’s safety and comfort. Under the conditions of the design speed of 120 km/h, the general values and limit values of length which meet the driver’s expectation are provided. They are compared with the current specification index in China. This paper puts forward a new idea and method to study on the length design index standard of <b>speed-change</b> lane in freeway trumpet interchange...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{innovative}} electromechanical device which integrates a brushless DC (BLDC) hub motor with a <b>speed-changing</b> wheel hub stored on the rear wheel of an electric bicycle. It combines a power source and a <b>speed-changing</b> mechanism to simultaneously provide functions of power generation and transmission for electric bicycles. As part of the proposed integrated device, the wheel hub consists of a basic planetary gear train providing three forward speeds including a low-speed gear, a direct drive, and a high-speed gear. Each gear is manually controlled by the shift control sleeve to selectively engage or disengage four pawl-and-ratchet clutches based on its clutching sequence table. The number of gear teeth of each gear element of the wheel hub is synthesized. The BLDC hub motor is an exterior-rotor-type permanent-magnet synchronous motor. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) software is employed to facilitate the motor design and performance analysis.

40|$|This {{cumulative}} dissertation {{consists of}} three studies. In the first study we showed that feature-based attention actively suppresses non-relevant features and therefore {{it can be seen}} as a selection process different from object-based attention. In the second study we investigated the influence of the neuronal response in visual area MT on the behavioral response of the animals. We observed an increase in the transient neuronal response to the behaviorally relevant <b>speed-change</b> and a reduction of the latency of this response in trials with fast reaction times. This modulation in the neuronal response corresponds to an improvement of the neuronal representation of the <b>speed-change.</b> Furthermore, a similar modulation of the neuronal representation of the <b>speed-change</b> was found for attended trials.

40|$|Motion {{repulsion}} involves {{interaction between}} two directions of motion. Since attention {{is known to}} bias interactions among different stimuli, we investigated the effect of attentional tasks on motion repulsion. We used two overlapping sets of random dots moving in different directions. When subjects had to detect a small <b>speed-change</b> or luminance change for dots along one direction, the repulsive influence {{from the other direction}} was significantly reduced compared with the control case without attentional tasks. However, when the <b>speed-change</b> could occur to either direction such that subjects had to attend both directions to detect the change, motion repulsion was not different from the control. A further experiment showed that decreasing the difficulty of the attentional task resulted in the disappearance of the attentional effect in the case of attention to one direction. Finally, over a wide range of contrasts for the unattended direction, attention reduced repulsion measured with the attended direction. These results are consistent with the physiological finding that strong attention to one direction of motion reduces inhibitory effects from the other direction...|$|R

40|$|Action {{observation}} {{studies have}} investigated whether changing {{the speed of}} the observed movement affects the action observation network. There are two types of <b>speed-changing</b> conditions; one involves “changes in actual movement velocity,” and the other is “manipulation of video speed. ” Previous studies have investigated the effects of these conditions separately, but to date, no study has directly investigated the differences between the effects of these conditions. In the “movement velocity condition,” increased velocity is associated with increased muscle activity; however, this change of muscle activities is not shown in the “video speed condition. ” Therefore, a difference in the results obtained under these conditions could be considered to reflect a difference in muscle activity of actor in the video. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of different <b>speed-changing</b> conditions and spontaneous movement tempo (SMT) on the excitability of primary motor cortex (M 1) during action observation, as assessed by motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitudes induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A total of 29 healthy subjects observed a video clip of a repetitive index or little finger abduction movement under seven different speed conditions. The video clip in the movement velocity condition showed repetitive finger abduction movements made in time with an auditory metronome, at frequencies of 0. 5, 1, 2, and 3 Hz. In the video speed condition, playback of the 1 -Hz movement velocity condition video clip was modified to show movement frequencies of 0. 5, 2, or 3 Hz (Hz-Fake). TMS was applied at the time of maximal abduction and MEPs were recorded from two right-hand muscles. There were no differences in M 1 excitability between the movement velocity and video speed conditions. Moreover, M 1 excitability did not vary across the speed conditions for either presentation condition. Our findings suggest that changing playback speed and actual differences in movement velocity do not differentially influence M 1 excitability during observation of a simple action task, such as repetitive finger movement, and that it is not affected by SMT. In simple and meaningless observational task, people might not be able to recognize the difference in muscle activity of actor in the video...|$|E

This algorithm {{is referred to as}} weighted ASF (WASF). The feature in our algorithm is extracted based on a MPEG- 7 descriptor-Audio Spectrum Flatness (ASF) and Human Auditory System (HAS). It also applies several effective filters to improve the feature robustness and uses another MPEG- 7 descriptor: Audio Signature (AS) to reduce the feature dimension and increase the feature compactness. The smooth filter bank can efficiently resist the noise distortion in addition to some other common distortions such as sampling rate change and amplitude normalization, while the first order inverse filter can effectively resist the <b>speed-change</b> distortion with 90. 1 % discrimination for the 5 % speed acceleration distortion. This algorithm is tested under several audio distortions: sampling rate change, noise addition, data compression and <b>speed-change</b> and so on.

This article estimates {{the effects of}} the neoclassical causal theory on the orbital motions of two objects revolving around the Sun, Mercury and Halley's Comet.

The period for Halley's Comet, 75. 3 years, is predicted to decrease by about 10 minutes.

40|$|International audienceWe {{show how}} to {{effectively}} introduce a proper description of the velocity-changing collisions into the model of isolated molecular transition for the case of self- and Ar-perturbed H 2. We demonstrate that the billiard-ball (BB) approximation of the H 2 -H 2 and H 2 -Ar potentials gives an accurate description of the velocity-changing collisions. The BB model results are compared with ab initio classical molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that the BB model correctly reproduces not only the principal properties such as frequencies of velocity-changing collisions or collision kernels, but also other characteristics of H 2 -H 2 and H 2 -Ar gas kinetics like rate of <b>speed-changing</b> collisions. Finally, we present line-shape measurement of the Q(1) line of the first overtone band of self-perturbed H 2. We quantify the systematic errors of line-shape analysis caused {{by the use of}} oversimplified description of velocity-changing collisions.

40|$|The lack of {{agreed and}} {{objective}} measures for cycle service quality and capacity {{is an increasing}} barrier {{to the development of}} high-quality infrastructure. High cycle mode share jurisdictions face issues relating to increased cycle congestion whilst simultaneously, low cycle mode share jurisdictions face increasing calls for investment in cycle infrastructure, yet the ability to economically evaluate proposals is lacking. In both circumstances, a lack of robust quantitative measures is an issue. The limited existing measures for cycle service quality are developed based on the “isolated cyclist” or on a general assumption of non-impedance. By contrast, the fundamental principles of highway traffic flow (and of pedestrian flow) are entirely predicated on the concept of the constituent interactions, with speed-flow/density-flow curves being a well-established and empirically verified result of this. Consequently, to assess the importance of interactions between cyclists in service quality and capacity measures for bicycles, an agent-based 2 D microsimulation and social-force model was developed to test the validity of the non-impedance assumptions for unidirectional flow. The ability of the bicycles to interact and change speed resulted in both qualitative and quantitatively different outcomes to non-interaction. The <b>speed-changing</b> interactions led to outcomes more in keeping with empirical data and experience; and with service quality degrading rapidly as capacity is approached in comparison to non-speed-changing behaviour where service quality changes relatively slowly. The results from the simulation model therefore bring into question the validity of analysis that relies on isolated cyclists or non-interaction for use in quantitative measures. In particular, the non-linear increasing sensitivity of the quality of service as flow rates increase demonstrates the need to properly consider the interaction of the constituent bicycles in any realistic quantitative measure...|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{previous}} literature on con ict resolution is based on instantaneousmaneuvermodels, inwhich speed and/or heading change dynamics are unmodeled. The effects of the actual maneuver dynamics on the resulting minimum separation are analyzed, and a simple numerical algorithm is presented to compensate for those effects. The focus is on level ight in the horizontal plane. Speed changes are modeled as periods of constant along-track acceleration or deceleration, and heading changes are modeled as steady turns of constant rate and radius. These simple kinematic (constrained point-mass) models improve on the resolution accuracy that results from modeling speed and heading changes as instantaneous, but they yield much simpler solutions than general point-mass dynamicmodels. The accuracy improvement is minor formost heading-changemaneuvers, but it is substantial for most <b>speed-change</b> maneuvers.

Conversely, diverging lanes allow the drivers to slow down their vehicle enabling them to enter the ramp terminal conveniently. The length of the <b>speed-change</b> lane should be in optimum design {{to ensure that the}} drivers are allowed to make appropriate lane changes.

The calibration process also requires certain decisions, such as the correct sampling approach, determination of the minimum segment length, the treatment of left-turn phasing, and the inclusion or exclusion of <b>speed-change</b> lane crashes. This report describes the challenges, practical solutions, and results from a statewide HSM calibration in Missouri, including lessons learned from other states such as Kansas, Illinois, and New Hampshire.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{measurements}} {{showing the}} effects of large incidence angle variations on an HPT turbine blade set are presented. Measurements were made in NASA's Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility which {{has been used in}} previous studies to acquire detailed aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements for CFD code validation. The current study supports the development of variable-speed power turbine (VSPT) <b>speed-change</b> technology for the NASA Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) vehicle. In order to maintain acceptable main rotor propulsive efficiency, the VSPT operates over a nearly 50 % speed range from takeoff to altitude cruise. This results in 50 degrees or more variations in VSPT blade incidence angles. The cascade facility has the ability to operate over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers, but had to be modified in order to accommodate the negative incidence angle variation required by the LCTR VSPT operation. Using existing blade geometry with previously acquired aerodynamic data, the tunnel was re-baselined and the new incidence angle range was exercised.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the recent facility modifications to NASA s Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility and aerodynamic measurements on the VSPT incidence-tolerant blade are presented. This work supports the development of variable-speed power turbine (VSPT) <b>speed-change</b> technology for the NASA Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) vehicle. In order to maintain acceptable main rotor propulsive efficiency, the VSPT operates over a nearly 50 % speed range from takeoff to altitude cruise. This results in 50 or more variations in VSPT blade incidence angles. The Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility {{has the ability to}} operate over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers, but had to be modified in order to accommodate the negative incidence angle variation required by the LCTR VSPT operation. Details of the modifications are described. An incidence-tolerant blade was developed under an RTPAS study contract and tested in the cascade to look at the effects of large incidence angle and Reynolds number variations. Recent test results are presented which include midspan exit total pressure and flow angle measurements obtained at three inlet angles representing the cruise, take-off, and maximum incidence flight mission points. For each inlet angle, data were obtained at five flow conditions with exit Reynolds numbers varying from 2. 12 106 to 2. 12 105 and two isentropic exit Mach numbers of 0. 72 and 0. 35. Three-dimensional flowfield measurements were also acquired at the cruise and take-off points. The flowfield measurements were acquired using a five-hole and three-hole pneumatic probe located in a survey plane 8. 6 % axial chord downstream of the blade trailing edge plane and covering three blade passages. Blade and endwall static pressure distributions were also acquired for each flow condition...|$|R
40|$|Under a NASA-ESA {{collaborative}} research project, three Al- 7 -weight-percentage Si samples (MICAST- 6, MICAST- 7 and MICAST 2 - 12) were directionally solidified aboard the International Space Station {{to determine the}} effect of mitigating convection on the primary dendrite array. The samples were approximately 25 centimeters in length with a diameter of 7. 8 millimeter-diameter cylinders that were machined from [100] oriented terrestrially grown dendritic Al- 7 Si samples and inserted into alumina ampoules within the Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA) inserts of the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF). The feed rods were partially remelted in space and directionally solidified to effect the [100] dendrite-orientation. MICAST- 6 was grown at 5 microns per second for 3. 75 centimeters and then at 50 microns per second for its remaining 11. 2 centimeters of its length. MICAST- 7 was grown at 20 microns per second for 8. 5 centimeters and then at 10 microns per second for 9 centimeters of its remaining length. MICAST 2 - 12 was grown at 40 microns per second for 11 centimeters. The thermal gradient at the liquidus temperature varied from 22 to 14 degrees Kelvin per centimeter during growth of MICAST- 6, from 26 to 24 degrees Kelvin per centimeter for MICAST- 7 and from 33 to 31 degrees Kelvin per centimeter for MICAST 2 - 12. Microstructures on the transverse sections along the sample length were analyzed to determine nearest-neighbor spacing of the primary dendrite arms and trunk diameters of the primary dendrite-arrays. This was done along the lengths where steady-state growth prevailed and also during the transients associated with the <b>speed-changes.</b> The observed nearest-neighbor spacings during steady-state growth of the MICAST samples show a very good agreement with predictions from the Hunt-Lu primary spacing model for diffusion controlled growth. The observed primary dendrite trunk diameters during steady-state growth of these samples also agree with predictions from a coarsening-based model. The radial macrosegregation and "steepling" caused by thermosolutal convection during terrestrial growth of the Al- 7 Si was not observed in the space-grown MICAST samples...|$|R
40|$|As the nation's {{population}} {{continues to}} grow, the users of highway network face increased safety risks, delays and congestion. Budget constraints at many public agencies frequently make infeasible {{the construction of}} new facilities to improve the safety and capacity of the highway network. This thesis addresses two issues pertaining to roadway safety and capacity: maintenance of traffic for innovative geometric design work zones and calibrating highway safety manual for Missouri interchanges. In an effort to improve the safety and capacity of existing roads, many transportation practitioners are implementing innovative designs at intersections and interchanges. The development of construction phasing plans for these projects is a critical component to maintaining safety and mobility on the facility during construction. The goal of this research is to present the state of the practice and providing guidance for transportation practitioners in developing construction phasing and maintenance of traffic (MOT) plans for projects with innovative geometric designs. Several types of innovative geometric designs were studied including the roundabout, single point urban interchange (SPUI), diverging diamond interchange (DDI), restricted-crossing left turn (RCUT), median U-turn (MUT), and displaced left turn (DLT). Example MOT phasing diagrams showing phasing sequencing and construction work areas were developed based on a review of literature, survey of practitioners, interviews with industry experts, and review of actual project plans. The example MOT phasing diagrams are intended to serve {{as a starting point for}} transportation practitioners, but project-specific factors such as driver experience, availability of detours, traffic counts, adjacent land use, elevation differences, barrier offsets, number of lanes, and anticipated impacts of a possible closure should be considered when deciding on the best MOT methods for a given project. The second issue relates to the safety analysis of Missouri interchanges using AASHTO's Highway Safety Manual (HSM), a nationally accepted manual. In a 2014 supplement, freeway facilities were added to the original manual to allow for the modeling of highway interchanges. This research documents the calibration of the most vital freeway interchange facility types in Missouri. These facility types include nine freeway interchange terminals, including diamond, partial cloverleaf, and full cloverleaf interchanges. The nonterminal facilities included entrance and exit <b>speed-change</b> lanes, and entrance and exit ramps. The calibrated facilities applied to both rural and urban locations. For each facility type, sample sites were randomly selected from an exhaustive master list. Four types of data were collected for each site: geometric, AADT, traffic control, and crash. Crash data was especially noteworthy because of a crash georeferencing problem, i. e. crashes were not located on the proper interchange facility. A significant crash correction project was undertaken involving the review of 11, 768 crash reports, and the detailed review of 9, 168 crash reports. Using the corrected data, 44 calibration values were derived for freeway terminal and non-terminal facilities. These values are the first reported freeway interchange calibration values since the release of the 2014 HSM supplement...|$|R
40|$|Freeways are {{arterial}} highways {{characterized by}} {{high levels of}} safety and high speed vehicular traffic. Access {{to and from the}} freeways is provided through ramps. Geometric elements making up freeway facilities include the roadway, median shoulders, grades, and ramps to and from the traveled way at selected locations, shoulders, radius of curvature, lane width, and <b>speed-change</b> lanes. With the increase of traffic using the freeway systems, there arises more traffic weaving movements within the elements making up the freeway systems. This causes traffic flow to compete at the limited spaces available and reduces safety performance of freeway system. In studies on safety issues of freeway systems, geometric elements of freeways have been evaluated for their safety effects on crashes occurring on the freeways. These studies have included interchange spacing, number of through lanes, median shoulder width and type, ramp spacing, length of segment, speed change lanes, and lengths for limited and extended lanes. Their findings revealed that freeway safety issues are associated with freeway geometric characteristics. However, the previous studies did not consider the safety impact of all segment types on the crash frequency on freeways. This study observed four types of segments when a freeway is divided into segments with Exit and Entry terminals. These segments were defined as EN-EN, EX-EX, EN-EX, EX-EN segments where 2 ̆ 2 EX 2 ̆ 2 stands for Exit from the freeway and 2 ̆ 2 EN 2 ̆ 2 stands for Entrance to the freeway. The study also extends types of weaving movements taking place in weaving segments. Crash rate and severity models were developed in this study based on the data collected for every freeway segment type. A complete set of geometric data was included in the data for each freeway segment type. Models for individual freeway segment type (EN-EN, EX-EX, EN-EX, and EX-EN) were developed. The results indicated that for EN-EN segment type; only two freeway characteristics had an impact: median width and segment length. Wider median and long segments both reduced crash while they were insignificant for severity model. For EX-EX segment type, the number of through lanes, median width, and AADT had an impact on average crash rate while for a severity model, only the number of through lanes had an impact. Specifically, it was found that, the number of through lanes reduced both average crash rate and high severity crashes when all through lanes were combined together. However, on individual segment type in a specific freeway, it was found that, the number of through lanes on I- 15 increased average crash rate while they reduced average crash rate on I- 215. Wider median reduced average crash rate while it increased high severity crashes. Traffic volume increased average crash rate while it was found insignificant on severity model. At a freeway level, EX-EX segment type reduced average crash rate compared to both I- 215 and US 95 while it reduced average crash rate for I- 215 compared to I- 15 and US 95. For EN-EX segment type, shoulder width {{had a significant impact on}} average crash rates while the number of through lanes, median width, length of segment, and curve radius indicated significant impact on severity crashes. Wider shoulders on I- 15 reduced average crash rate. The number of through lanes increased high severity crashes when all number of lanes were combined together. However, on individual freeways, the number of through lanes on reduced high severity crashes while they were insignificant on I- 215 and US 95. Wider median increased high severity crashes when all freeways were combined together while they reduced high severity crashes on I- 15. Long segment increased high severity crashes when all EN-EX segment type from all freeways was combined together. Segments with large radius of curvature reduced high severity crashes when all for combined freeways while they increased high severity crashes for I- 15. At a freeway level, I- 15 increased both average crash rate and high severity crashes compared to I- 215 and US 95. For EX-EN segments, shoulder and AADT had a significant impact on average crash rate while the number of through lanes, median width, radius curvature and lane changes from ramp-to-freeway had a significant impact on severity crashes. Wider shoulder reduced average crash rate for combined data from all freeways but increased crash rate on I- 215. Wider median increased high severity crashes for combined data from all freeways while they were insignificant on average crash rate models. Segments with large radius of curvature increased high severity crashes while it was insignificant on average crash rate model. Lane changes from ramp-to-freeway increased high severity crashes. AADT increased average crash rate while it was found insignificant on severity crashes...|$|R
