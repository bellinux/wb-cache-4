Yet like virtually all comebacks from rap's elder statesmen, Riches, Royalty, Respect reveals certain shortcomings {{that may or may not}} have been present before but become apparent as rap history advances. Advocates of the arform will argue that Kool G Rap and most of today's successful rap acts are worlds apart artistically. They are absolutely right, but for a Kool G Rap the bar is placed higher than chart positions and numbers of social media followers".|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} small scale of {{geometric}} objects {{embedded in a}} Euclidean space {{by means of the}} flow defined by zooming toward a point of the space. For a smooth embedded manifold one sees just the tangent space asymptotically, but for fractal sets and related objects (space-filling curves, nested tilings) the flow can be quite interesting, as the “scenery ” one sees keeps changing. For a Kleinian limit <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenery</b> flow and geodesic flows are isomorphic. This fact suggests that for a Julia <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenery</b> flow could provide the analogue of the hyperbolic three manifold, with its associated geodesic and horocycle actions. A test is to see whether Sullivan’s formula for dimension (Hausdor ↵ dimension of limit set equals geodesic flow entropy) goes through for Julia sets. This is in fact true, and the resulting formula “dimension equals scenery flow entropy ” unifies the formulas of Sullivan and of Bowen-Ruelle. For changing combinatorics, considering the model case of interval exchanges, renormalization is given on parameter space by the Teichmüller flow of a surface; <b>the</b> <b>scenery</b> flow, now acting on a space of nested tilings, extends this flow to a surface fiber bundle. Thus renormalization is realized as flowing on a unification of the dynamical and the parameter space. For fractal <b>sets,</b> <b>the</b> translation “horocycle ” scenery flow has a natural conservative ergodic infinite measure. This observation builds a bridge between fractal geometry and the probability theory of recurrent events, suggesting on the one hand new theorems for the Fuchsian case and on the other a new interpretation of some results on countable state Markov chains due to Feller and Chung-Erdös. Interesting examples are seen in the intermittent return-time behavior of maps of the interval with an indi↵erent fixed point. Content...|$|R
