50|$|Flow control, or metering, of the {{refrigerant}} {{is accomplished}} by use of a temperature <b>sensing</b> <b>bulb,</b> filled with a similar gas as in the system, that causes the valve to open against the spring pressure in the valve body as the temperature on the bulb increases. As the suction line temperature decreases, so does the pressure in the bulb and therefore on the spring causing the valve to close. An air conditioning system with a TX valve is often more efficient than other designs that do not use one.|$|E
50|$|The dry-bulb {{temperature}} is the temperature indicated by a thermometer {{exposed to the}} air in a place sheltered from direct solar radiation. The term dry-bulb is customarily added to temperature to distinguish it from wet-bulb and dewpoint temperature. In meteorology and psychrometrics the word temperature by itself without a prefix usually means dry-bulb temperature. Technically, the temperature registered by the dry-bulb thermometer of a psychrometer. The name implies that the <b>sensing</b> <b>bulb</b> or element is in fact dry. WMO provides a 23-page chapter on the measurement of temperature.|$|E
50|$|Wet-bulb {{temperature}} (WBT) {{is that of}} an {{air sample}} after it has passed through a constant-pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation process, that is, after the air has passed over a large surface of liquid water in an insulated channel. In practice this is the reading of a thermometer whose <b>sensing</b> <b>bulb</b> {{is covered with a}} wet sock evaporating into a rapid stream of the sample air (see Hygrometer). When the air sample is saturated with water, the WBT will read the same as the DBT. The slope of the line of constant WBT reflects the heat of vaporization of the water required to saturate the air of a given relative humidity.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{pressure}} liquid then enters the expansion valve where the TX valve allows {{a portion of}} the refrigerant to enter the evaporator. In order for the higher temperature fluid to cool, the flow must be limited into the evaporator to keep the pressure low and allow expansion back into the gas phase. The TXV has <b>sensing</b> <b>bulbs</b> connected to the suction line of the refrigerant piping. The gas pressure in the <b>sensing</b> <b>bulbs</b> provides the force to open the TXV, therefore adjusting the flow of refrigerant and the superheat.|$|R
50|$|Helmet {{jellyfish}} reach a {{body size}} {{of up to}} 30 cm. They consist 90% of water, the rest being tissue and gelatinous mass, which give the animals their form. They light themselves from within by means of bioluminescence, the red flashes serving as a signal amongst themselves. Between their marginal lobes sit small <b>sense</b> <b>bulbs,</b> by which the helmet jelly can distinguish between light and dark; they have been observed to avoid light.|$|R
40|$|An This paper {{discusses}} {{the performance of}} a radiant ceiling panel system on an indoor air quality (IAQ) of a conditioned space. In this study, ceiling radiant cooling panel, mechanical ventilation with fan coil unit (FCU) and 100 % fresh air are used. Temperature sensors are located at different locations inside the conditioned space in order to <b>sense</b> dry <b>bulb</b> temperatures, relative humidity to compare it with standard ASHRAE comfort values. The present investigation indicates that the radiant cooling system not only improves the indoor air quality but also reduces the building energy consumption in the conditioned space...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} change in power {{consumption}} for a mobile air conditioning (MAC) system from the introduction of an internal heat exchanger (IHX). The internal heat exchanger is so named since {{it is a simple}} heat exchanger that is placed internally into the AC system. It serves to transfer heat from the high to low pressure refrigerant to maximize the system cooling capacity. The work investigates how other performance parameters such as the pressure drops, IHX capacity, evaporator capacity, coefficient of performance and the absolute efficiency ratio change from the introduction of the IHX. The steady-state simulation results are compared to data available in the literature and transient experimental tests including the cabin cool-down, and the simulation results from the New European Driving Cycle. The results from the simulations show a reduction in power consumption of up to 2 % in high ambient temperatures but an increase in power consumption of up to 1. 5 % for low ambient temperatures. The power consumed by the MAC system is largely by the compressor. Placing the thermal <b>sensing</b> <b>bulb</b> (TSB) of the thermal expansion valve downstream of the internal heat exchanger yielded higher MAC coefficient of performance, lower suction line pressure drops and compressor power consumption compared to placing the TSB upstream of the internal heat exchanger...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} how we design a lighting control sys- tem including hardware and software. Hardware includes Dimmer with relays <b>Bulb</b> light <b>sensing</b> circuit, control circuit, and 8255 expanding I/O circuit, PC, and <b>bulb.</b> <b>Sensing</b> circuit uses photo-resistance component {{to sense the}} environmental light and then transmit the signal of the lightness to the computer through an 8 -bit A/D converter 0804. The control circuit applies reed relay in digital control way to adjust the variable resistor value of the traditional dimmer. Software incorporates LABVIEW graph- ical programming language and MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox to design the light fuzzy controller. The rule-base of the fuzzy logic controller either for the single input single output (SISO) system or the double inputs single output (DISO) system is developed and compared based on {{the operation of the}} bulb and the light sensor. The control system can dim the bulb automatically according to the environmental light. It can be applied to many fields such as control of streetlights and lighting control of carâ€™s headlights and it is possible to save energy by dimming the bulb. Experimental results show that the fuzzy controller with the DISO system can make bulb response faster than with the SISO system under sudden change of environmental light...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined a}} heat transfer model {{to predict the}} activation time of a concealed sprinkler. Concealed sprinklers consist of two stages of activation. They include the release of cover plates from a recess housing and the breakage of the glass bulbs or melting of the solder links. The research analysis {{is divided into two}} sections. The first section includes the prediction of cover plate activation time (stage one) and the second section includes the prediction of glass bulb activation time (stage two). Each prediction result is compared with the experimental data conducted by Annable (2006) and Yu (2007). A lumped heat capacity method is introduced to predict the activation time of the cover plate. This method has been used for predicting the activation time of a standard pendent exposed sprinkler. It is reasonable to apply this method by assuming they are flush with the ceiling. The analysis results are compared based on the percentage of predicted and measured uncertainties. A recommendation is provided for which method is appropriate to apply to predicting the cover plate activation time. The proposed of using FDS 5 simulations is to simulate the heat transfer to the <b>sensing</b> element (glass <b>bulb</b> only) within the recessed housing. The constructed simulation models comprises of ceiling within a compartment. The simulations of various sprinkler heads are performed to investigate any parameters that can potentially affect the activation time of the sprinklers. To simulate the glass bulb, combined thermal properties including glass and glycerine are modified to account for the differences in mass. Prior to stage two analysis, the FDS 5 simulation was tested to predict the activation time of a standard pendent exposed sprinkler. The results showed positive progress to carry onto the next analysis. In stage two analysis, the simulations are constructed with and without the presence of vent holes within the recess housing. The combined activation time for concealed sprinklers show lack of solid predictions compared to the experimental data especially Yu experimental data...|$|R
