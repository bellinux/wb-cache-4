5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field.

The <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E

25|$|Sereno took thin {{sections}} from trunk osteoderms of {{an estimated}} subadult individual (~80% of estimated maximum adult size). Approximately 40 lines of arrested growth (LAG) were counted in these thin sections, suggesting that S. imperator took 50 to 60 years to reach adult size. Given that extant wild crocodylians rarely reach these advanced ages, Sereno suggested that S. imperator achieved its large size by extending its period of rapid, juvenile, growth. A similar growth <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested for the equally titanic crocodylian Deinosuchus, based on similar criteria.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the tit-for-tat <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> of {{beneficial}} use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research {{has indicated that}} when individuals {{who have been in}} competition {{for a period of time}} no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.|$|E

Two protected areas are located in close proximity to Oyu Tolgoi and are included in the mine’s area of impact. In order to compensate for the loss of habitat, a biodiversity offset <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> released, however the NGOs are not convinced. They are stressing that company did not consider avoiding, minimizing or mitigating the damage and went directly to offsetting. They urge the company to develop a strong, detailed, long-term species conservation and habitat protection plan, including a rigorous monitoring strategy. They are of the opinion that the current mitigation strategies described in the ESIA are too general and are not based on empirical data. Consequently, the offset strategy presented by the company can be called into question.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its history}} of use in {{patients}} with aHUS, kidney transplantation {{does not address the}} continued and uncontrolled complement activation that leads to progressive, systemic TMA. As many as 90% of patients with aHUS experience TMA in the transplanted organ, leading to transplant failure. Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation are still at continued risk of neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular complications and, importantly, premature mortality. Following kidney transplantation, the ongoing, uncontrolled, chronic complement activation associated with aHUS causes graft loss in 66% of children and 55% of adults, as well as continued inflammatory and TMA insult to other organs. Combined liver-kidney transplantation is only available to very few patients, due to the limited supply of solid organs. In addition, there is a substantial near-term risk of mortality, which many physicians and patients consider excessive. In recent years, some transplant centers have begun to administer eculizumab to patients with TMA who receive a kidney transplant. This <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> effective in preventing TMA recurrences in these patients.|$|E

25|$|Studies in {{controlled}} environments on {{the giant}} trevally's feeding strategies have found hunting in schools increases their capture efficiency, {{but is not}} necessary for an individual's survival. When a school is formed during feeding, one individual will take a leading position, with others trailing behind it. Several individuals will attack the prey school, striking and stunning the prey, with the leading individual generally being more successful. Some individuals act individually and opportunistically within the school {{if one of the}} prey fish becomes isolated, with the main advantage of schooling appearing to be the ability to further break up and isolate prey schools. The only time hunting in schools is a disadvantage is when only isolated prey are present, such as close to a reef; here, an individual hunter has a greater probability of capturing it than if a group is present. Another hunting strategy of the giant trevally is to 'escort' monk seals, a behavior which has been observed near the Hawaiian Islands. The trevally swim close by the seal, and when the seal stops to forage, the trevally positions its mouth inches away from the seal. If a prey item is disturbed, the trevally will attempt to steal the prey from the seal, which routinely does occur. The seal does not appear to gain any benefit from this relationship, and it is thought juvenile seals being followed in this way may be outcompeted by the larger fish. A similar <b>strategy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> employed by fish in the presence of large reef sharks, as they use the larger animal as a tool to ambush prey. The opportunistic nature of giant trevally has also been made evident by studies on the mortality rate of undersized or egg-bearing lobsters released from traps at the water's surface of the Hawaiian Islands. The fish are efficient predators of these crustaceans, with individuals often seizing a lobster before it could sink to the seafloor after being released, or attacking before the lobster moves into a defensive position. Some bolder, large individuals are even known to eat the lobster head first when its in a defensive stance.|$|E
