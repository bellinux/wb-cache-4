25|$|Monitoring {{is carried}} out through the domestic, {{terrestrial}} AIS chain, which is supplemented with the AISSat constellation which allows for monitoring of Arctic high sea areas. NOR VTS also receives AIS data from Russia. Monitoring is also carried out via the coast radio station network operated by Telenor Maritim Radio and the radar chain operated by the Norwegian Armed Forces. Information is also gathered from the <b>SafeSeaNet</b> reporting system and long-range identification and tracking.|$|E
25|$|The {{center has}} three main duties. Firstly, it {{provides}} information services to vessels, {{such as the}} traffic situation, meteorological information and regulations. Secondly, it provides navigational assistant services to ships either on request or when deemed necessary by the staff. This often happens in severe weather conditions or in cases with technical difficulties with the ship. Thirdly, the VTS provides traffic organization to ensure a safe and orderly operation of the traffic. The center can draw on data from the Automatic Identification System, local radar, meteorology, <b>SafeSeaNet</b> and video cameras.|$|E

40|$|Processing of Maritime {{information}} was always difficult. Several global, regional and sub-regional information processing networks are being established currently, such as <b>SafeSeaNet,</b> AIS, LRIT and others. Yet, every single Maritime information project/network has operational advantages and operational trades off, meaning, {{that there is}} a lot of space for improvement in matters of quality and speed of Maritime information, as well as target addressees and legal procurements. Recent advent of new Latvian Naval Sea Surveillance System (LNSSS) is able to provide good contribution in local and regional Maritime informational networks in sake of common, not only military benefits. This paper is an effort to stipulate about aspects of civilian use for the LNSSS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper will}} {{focuses on the}} {{implementation}} of National Single Window (NSW) telematic applications allowing the integration of inland and maritime waterway transport with other modes of transport and also with Port Community Management applications. The NSW concept refers {{to the implementation of}} a national system that will act as a single point of contact for the electronic submission and exchange (especially) of freight related information between public and private stakeholders from different transport modes. The main objective of the paper is to propose a solution and an implementation roadmap for the correlation and harmonization of the currently isolated and partly un-coordinated initiatives related to SW. NSW should build on existing telematic applications and systems like <b>SafeSeaNet,</b> River Information Services or Intelligent Transport Systems for Road Transport. In this way, the authors propose a possible approach in developing integrated NSW...|$|E
40|$|Automatic ship {{reporting}} systems (mainly AIS and LRIT) today provide rather complete coverage {{of all the}} larger (> 300 GT) vessels. Coastal receivers linked in networks (MSSIS, <b>SafeSeaNet,</b> …) {{and a growing number}} of space-based receivers provide a global reach. At JRC (the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre) the so-called “Blue Hub” has been set up to continuously ingest data from such systems (via internet), store them in a database, compile ship tracks, predict ship positions to the current time and display the result – the real-time Maritime Situational Picture (MSP) – on a web browser. Historic data, including the collection of stored MSPs (at 15 min interval), are used to derive statistical distributions of ship density, as a function of ship type or ship behaviour (e. g. fishing). Finally, the continuously available MSP based on the ship reporting data is complemented with incidental samplings of non-cooperative ships using satellite SAR images (Cosmo-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, Radarsat- 2). This shows that only about 50 % of the ships detected in satellite SAR images are reporting in AIS or LRIT. The system has been used during 6 months periods over ocean-basin wide areas in the Western Indian Ocean (2011 - 2012) and off West Africa including the Gulf of Guinea (2012 - 2013), producing maritime awareness of hitherto unavailable levels.
