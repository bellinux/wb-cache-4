In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with {{each other with a}} light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.|$|E

She and Olga, who was also given her own regiment, {{would go out and}} inspect the soldiers regularly, an occasion they greatly enjoyed. When she was nearly fourteen, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her {{to get out of bed}} in time to go to a review so she could watch a soldier she was infatuated with.

500|$|The gradual {{alteration}} of Rick was frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques. Dan Hopper of Best Week Ever theorized that such a drastic transition was attributed {{by the death of}} his friend Shane. Halden proclaimed that the progression established a strong sense of direction for the character. [...] "This is a definite direction. I’m not sure if the show’s going to make Rick an out-and-out monster, or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it’s a strong choice. The Walking Dead has tried to make us value this group of people, as if together, they mean more than they do alone. That hasn’t worked, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> appears we’re going to try trial by fire."

500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of Iron Man, and takes place {{simultaneously}} with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Thor. The filmmakers continued to reference other Marvel films by again including Captain America's shield. Favreau explained, [...] "We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> really was in his room, so we had {{to figure out how to}} deal with the reality that the shield was in his workshop." [...] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one pointing toward a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther. A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask who Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and [...] director Jon Watts. The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.|$|E
500|$|During September 2008, Ferraro gained {{attention}} {{yet again}} after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, [...] "It's great to be the first, but I don't {{want to be the}} only. And <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket." [...] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that [...] "little girls [...] see someone there who can stand toe to toe with [...]" [...] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that [...] "Every time a woman runs, women win." [...] Ferraro made a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News during the network's election-night coverage of the 2010 midterms.|$|E
