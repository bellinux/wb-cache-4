5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new <b>system</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{concept of}} {{responsive}} computer <b>systems</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> introduced.

Novel techniques of introducing redundancy for improved performance and dependability <b>will</b> <b>be</b> illustrated. The methods of <b>system</b> responsiveness evaluation <b>will</b> <b>be</b> proposed.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, {{software}} <b>systems</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more reconfigurable than hardware. This <b>will</b> <b>be</b> possible through {{the advent of}} software component technologies, which have been prototyped in universities and research labs. In this paper, we outline the foundations for these technologies and suggest how they might impact software for space applications. 1 Introduction Software component technologies will fundamentally change the way complex and customized software <b>systems</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> designed, developed, and maintained. Well-understood domains of software (e. g., avionics software, communication networks, operating <b>systems,</b> etc.) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> standardized as libraries of plug-compatible and interoperable components. A software system in these domains (e. g., a particular avionics system, a particular operating <b>system,</b> etc.) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> specified as a composition of components. High-performance source code that implements these <b>systems</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> generated automatically. Application developers will purchase [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The <b>system</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit <b>system</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar <b>System</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
