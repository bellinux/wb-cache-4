40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we mainly pay {{attention}} to the weighted sampling and reconstruction algorithm in lattice-invariant <b>signal</b> <b>spaces.</b> We give the reconstruction formula in lattice-invariant <b>signal</b> <b>spaces,</b> which is a generalization of former results in shift-invariant <b>signal</b> <b>spaces.</b> That is, we generalize and improve Aldroubi, Gröchenig and Chen’s results, respectively. So we obtain a general reconstruction algorithm in lattice-invariant <b>signal</b> <b>spaces,</b> which the <b>signal</b> <b>spaces</b> is sufficiently large to ac-commodate a large number of possible models. They are maybe useful for signal processing and communication theory...|$|R
5000|$|On the send section {{the channel}} circuit {{includes}} a delay line feeding a repetition storage. The common send section circuit includes a code translator {{that changes the}} five bit code to the seven bit code. Next the seven bit character goes to an output shift register, {{and then to a}} polarity inverter. For a four channel system the bits would then be interleaved between AB and CD channels. The final send step is a tone modulator and output circuit. The tone is modulated using frequency shift keying. The 0 (or <b>space)</b> <b>signal</b> picks out a lower frequency, and the 1 ( [...] or mark signal) picks out a higher frequency. This signal to frequency conversion may be inverted, and this is common below 10 MHz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parity bit}} in each {{character}} {{can be set}} to none (N), odd (O), even (E), mark (M), or space (S). None means that no parity bit is sent at all. Mark parity means that the parity bit is always set to the mark signal condition (logical 1) and likewise space parity always sends the parity bit in the <b>space</b> <b>signal</b> condition. Aside from uncommon applications that use the 9th (parity) bit for some form of addressing or special signaling, mark or space parity is uncommon, as it adds no error detection information. Odd parity is more useful than even, since it ensures {{that at least one}} state transition occurs in each character, which makes it more reliable. The most common parity setting, however, is [...] "none", with error detection handled by a communication protocol.|$|E
5000|$|... "Speed", {{intended}} to be roughly comparable to words per minute, is the standard term introduced by Western Union for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize {{in the event that}} a garbled signal is received. This is true especially on High frequency radio circuits where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the <b>space</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude. Selective fading, or Rayleigh fading can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths. [...] Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.|$|E

50|$|Use of RSSI {{to locate}} a {{transmitter}} from a single receiver requires that both the transmitted (or backscattered) power from the object to be located are known, and that the propagation characteristics of the intervening region are known. In empty <b>space,</b> <b>signal</b> strength decreases as the inverse square of the distance for distances large compared to a wavelength and compared to the object to be located, but in most real environments, a number of impairments can occur: absorption, refraction, shadowing, and reflection. Absorption is negligible for radio propagation in air at frequencies less than about 10 GHz, but becomes important at multi-GHz frequencies where rotational molecular states can be excited. Refraction is important at long ranges (tens to hundreds of kilometers) due to gradients in moisture content and temperature in the atmosphere. In urban, mountainous, or indoor environments, obstruction by intervening obstacles and reflection from nearby surfaces are very common, and contribute to multipath distortion: that is, reflected and delayed replicates of the transmitted signal are combined at the receiver. Signals from different paths can add constructively or destructively: such variations in amplitude are known as fading. The dependence of signal strength on position of transmitter and receiver becomes complex and often non-monotonic, making single-receiver estimates of position inaccurate and unreliable. Multilateration using many receivers is often combined with calibration measurements ("fingerprinting") to improve accuracy.|$|E

40|$|In our paper titled “Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Foundation and 1 -D Time ” {{appearing}} {{in this issue}} of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, we presented the algebraic signal processing theory, an axiomatic and general framework for linear signal processing. The basic concept in this theory is the signal model defined as the triple (8), where is a chosen algebra of filters, an associated-module of signals, and 8 is a generalization of the-transform. Each signal model has its own associated set of basic SP concepts, including filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. Examples include infinite and finite discrete time where these notions take their well-known forms. In this paper, we use the algebraic theory to develop infinite and finite <b>space</b> <b>signal</b> models. These models are based on a symmetric space shift operator, which is distinct from the standard time shift.
