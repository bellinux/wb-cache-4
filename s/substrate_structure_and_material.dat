40|$|A {{number of}} ambient sound {{recordings}} {{took place in}} three clear-water wetlands in Perth, Western Australia for one month in summer, 2003. The wetlands differed {{in terms of their}} degree of enrichment, habitat <b>structure,</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> water depth. Temporal and spatial variations were evident in the macroinvertebrate distributions and the biologic calling activity, with seven distinct calls recognised in this study. Noise levels were greatest at dusk {{and to a lesser extent}} at midnight with chorusing only evident at the most enriched wetland. Biologics used frequencies ranging from 3 kHz up to around 14 kHz with the exception of the 'bird-like song' which extended from 500 Hz up to around 10 kHz. There was negligible sound contribution to ambient noise at low wind speeds of Beaufort Wind Scale 0, 1 & 2...|$|R

40|$|Conventional HVAC {{control systems}} are usually incognizant of the {{physical}} <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> of buildings. These systems merely follow pre-set HVAC control logic based on abstract building thermal response models, which are rough approximations to true physical models, ignoring dynamic spatial variations in built environments. To enable more accurate and responsive HVAC control, this paper introduces the notion of self-aware smart buildings, such that buildings are able to explicitly construct physical models of themselves (e. g., incorporating building <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>and</b> thermal flow dynamics). The {{question is how to}} enable self-aware buildings that automatically acquire dynamic knowledge of themselves. This paper presents a novel approach using augmented reality. The extensive user-environment interactions in augmented reality not only can provide intuitive user interfaces for building systems, but also can capture the physical <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> possibly <b>materials</b> of buildings accurately to enable real-time building simulation and control. This paper presents a building system prototype incorporating augmented reality, and discusses its applications...|$|R
