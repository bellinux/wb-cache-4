50|$|The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry approves {{of partial}} or {{complete}} stabilization {{of the patient}} in cases when {{it is necessary to}} protect the patient, practitioner, staff, or parent from injury while providing dental care. As of 2004, 85 percent of dental programs across the U.S. teach protective stabilization as an acceptable behavioral management practice. By 2004 The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that the dental chain <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles</b> Dental Centers used papoose boards almost 7,000 times in one period of 18 months, according to Colorado state records. Michael and Edward DeRose, two of the owners of <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles,</b> said that they used papoose boards so that they could do dental work on larger numbers of children in a more rapid manner. <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles</b> dentists from other states learned the papoose board method in Colorado and began practicing the method in other states. As a result, a Colorado Board of Dental Examiners-appointed committee established a new Colorado state law forbidding the usage of papoose boards for children unless a dentist has exhausted other possibilities for controlling a child's behavior, and if the dentist uses a papoose board, he or she must document why the papoose board was used in the patient's record.|$|R
