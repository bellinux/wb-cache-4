5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and <b>sportswear</b> were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with <b>sportswear,</b> underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|As {{an amateur}} rugby union player John was not paid to play rugby at club or {{international}} level. To receive money for playing {{would have been}} recognised {{as an act of}} professionalism and would have resulted in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given 'boot money' by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players' boots. In his 2011 book Addy, Meirion Appleton claimed that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. Appleton claims that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from <b>sportswear</b> manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged with taking illegal payments during his career.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé and {{her mother}} {{introduced}} House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.

According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.

Rover began a two-year deal early in time for the 1994 Scottish Cup final, sponsoring the club {{until the end of the}} 1995–96 season. Telewest took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson's Morning, Noon and Night started sponsoring the club in 2002. This association continued until 2006 when Anglian Home Improvements began a two-year deal with an optional third year. At the same time, Ole International became the first shorts sponsors.

5|$|According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer {{for five}} years out of six between 2009 and 2014; {{he was the first}} player to exceed the €40million benchmark, with {{earnings}} of €41million in 2013, and the €50–€60million points, with income of €65million in 2014. In 2016, Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. Since 2008, he has been Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8million to €13million over the next five years. His current salary of €20million net (€36million before taxes), established in 2014, is the highest ever in the sport. In addition to his salary and multimillion-euro bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is the <b>sportswear</b> company Adidas. As Barça's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of boots, the Adidas Messi.|$|E
5|$|Because higher league {{placement}} {{results in}} {{a greater share of}} television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51million, compared to £42.5million at Chelsea, £39.3million at Liverpool, £34million at Arsenal and £27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with <b>sportswear</b> company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral <b>Sportswear.</b> For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white shirt with a horizontal red and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white shirt with a red trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E
