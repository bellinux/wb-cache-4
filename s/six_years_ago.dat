5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E

The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell required surgery, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." ...|$|E

500|$|The level design {{received}} mixed comments. Mueller called {{some of them}} [...] "extremely frustrating". Helgeson {{stated that}} the fast-paced [...] "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for Game Informer, called the level design [...] "disastrous". Official Xbox Magazine was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D Sonic gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed Sonic Heroes. GameTrailers found that [...] "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the Sonic universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops {{and an assortment of}} other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." [...] Bettenhausen included [...] "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" [...] of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina deplored the [...] "stupid level design", adding that [...] "Just because they dazzled players <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." [...] GameSpy observed that [...] "the areas are much less open than in previous Sonic games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." [...] Nintendo Power singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.|$|E

In May 2012, Cantrell revealed that, prior to the recording sessions of The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, he had another surgery in 2011, this time in his right shoulder. He explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in my shoulders.
