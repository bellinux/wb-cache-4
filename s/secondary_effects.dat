5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Safety and {{security}} required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> of the blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, {{and north of}} Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.|$|E

50|$|Intrauterine devices (IUDs) {{have been}} proven to have strong {{spermicidal}} and ovicidal effects; the current medical consensus {{is that this is}} the only way in which they work. Still, a few physicians have suggested they may have a <b>secondary</b> <b>effect</b> of interfering with the development of pre-implanted embryos; this <b>secondary</b> <b>effect</b> is considered more plausible when the IUD is used as emergency contraception.|$|R

5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} <b>secondary</b> <b>effects,</b> {{including}} gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
5|$|It targets {{the poorest}} of the poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable <b>secondary</b> <b>effects,</b> including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{spectrum}} on PV output is often underestimated {{in the case}} of amorphous silicon photovoltaic devices. This paper gives an indication of the order of magnitude of the seasonal variation of the useful irradiance in a maritime climate and also shows that this will involve a direct change in efficiency. This can be expected to be in the range of 15 percent around the annual average, thus explaining the seasonal performance. The spectral effects are investigated by distinguishing between a primary and a <b>secondary</b> <b>effect.</b> The primary effect is dependent on the availability of useful spectral irradiance while the <b>secondary</b> <b>effect</b> depends also on the spectral composition of the light in the useful range. It is shown that the <b>secondary</b> <b>effect</b> is especially significant for double junction devices...|$|R

5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|While {{navigating}} environments, {{enemies are}} visible within the environment, with engagement being optional. If the player chooses to engage, some environmental {{elements such as}} combustible objects {{can be used to}} alter an enemy's statistics and grand the player an advantage in battle. When battle begins, the three-character player party and the enemy party fight in a dedicated combat arena. The combat is governed by a turn-based battle system. Each character has access to melee and ranged standard attacks, can use items to affect the party or enemies, and guard against attacks. The player party's attacks are determined through button combinations, with different combinations triggering different attack sequences that can have <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> on the party and neighboring enemies. Attack combinations can be customized by the player between battles.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E

25|$|Reduction {{of blood}} volume by ANP {{can result in}} <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> such as {{reduction}} of extracellular fluid (ECF) volume (edema), improved cardiac ejection fraction with resultant improved organ perfusion, decreased blood pressure, and increased serum potassium. These effects may be blunted or negated by various counter-regulatory mechanisms operating concurrently {{on each of these}} <b>secondary</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
25|$|Helminthiasis {{has been}} found to result in poor birth outcome, poor {{cognitive}} development, poor school and work performance, poor socioeconomic development, and poverty. Chronic illness, malnutrition, and anemia are further examples of <b>secondary</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> {{stemming}} not from the original pollutant, but a derivative condition.

25|$|Homo sapiens have {{interacted with}} the {{environment}} throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through <b>secondary</b> <b>effects.</b> These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.|$|E
25|$|If folate {{is present}} in quantity, then of the two {{absolutely}} vitamin B12-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the MUT-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic <b>secondary</b> <b>effects,</b> focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.|$|E
25|$|According to a 1990 {{review article}} by Billman, cocaine has two primary circulatory effects – {{increased}} sympathetic stimulation and cardiac ion channel inhibition – {{that lead to}} a variety of heart problems. The drug also causes increased heart rate and blood pressure. In a 1995 review article, he said resulting <b>secondary</b> <b>effects</b> include arrhythmia, coronary vasospasm, myocardial infarction, and ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
