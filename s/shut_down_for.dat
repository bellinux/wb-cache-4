5|$|The Denver protest, {{which was}} {{organized}} by Hanna Khavafipour, included several hundred demonstrators and {{took place in the}} evening at the Colorado State Capitol. The 16th Street Mall and nearby streets were <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> about two hours, but no arrests were made and businesses experienced few disturbances. A small group of protesters in Pueblo were organized by the Pueblo Congressional Accountability Committee (PCAC).|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to withstand earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some of the pipeline sliders designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused the pipeline to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> more than 66 hours as a precaution. In 2004, wildfires overran portions of the pipeline, {{but it was not}} damaged and did not shut down.|$|E

5|$|When {{parts of}} lines are {{temporarily}} <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> construction purposes, the transit authority can substitute free shuttle buses (using MTA Regional Bus Operations bus fleet) {{to replace the}} routes that would normally run on these lines. The Transit Authority announces planned service changes through its website, via placards that are posted on station and interior subway-car walls, and through its Twitter page.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{station is}} served by the Bloor-Danforth line which {{operates}} between Kennedy and Kipling stations. The station {{was designed to be}} serviced with side platforms as it mainly serves the surrounding neighbourhood. As it is the only station in the system that is not connected to a regular bus or streetcar route {{it is one of the}} least used subway stations in Toronto. The 300 Bloor-Danforth Night Bus operates on Danforth from 1:30-5:30 a.m. after the line is <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> nightly maintenance.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
50|$|In April that year, Haddad Maia wins {{her first}} WTA title in doubles at WTA Bogotá, {{alongside}} compatriot Paula Gonçalves.

40|$|Inexpensive inert-atmosphere {{shielding}} protects vacuum brazing-furnace {{components that}} are likely to spring leak. Pipefittings, gages, and valves are encased in transparent plastic shroud inflated with argon. If leak develops, harmless argon will enter vacuum chamber, making it possible to finish ongoing brazing or heat treatment before <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> repair...|$|R
5|$|The Chalk River reactor was <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month {{scheduled maintenance}} shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply {{has left a}} gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E
5|$|This was the Mustangs' second Hawaii Bowl, {{following}} the 2009 game where they defeated the Nevada Wolf Pack by {{a score of}} 45-10 (SMU's first bowl bid since playing in Hawaii in the 1984 Aloha Bowl, and their first since the program was relaunched in 1989 after being <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> two years due to massive NCAA rules violations).

In addition, FileTrekker {{announced that}} he would archive the forums as they were on April 29, 2016, and announced FilesNation as an alternative place for the GameFront community to go to.|$|R
50|$|After <b>shutting</b> <b>down,</b> <b>for</b> {{some time}} the reactor still needs {{external}} energy to power its cooling systems. Normally this energy {{is provided by}} the power grid to which that plant is connected, or by emergency diesel generators. Failure to provide power for the cooling systems, as happened in Fukushima I, can cause serious accidents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mobile phone}} must be {{carried by the}} user, charged, and kept in range of a {{cellular}} network whenever authentication might be necessary.

5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons, however, Hamels {{suffered}} through several injuries, and pitched only sparingly. He missed most of the 2004 season with elbow tendinitis, making only four starts. In 2005, he broke his pitching hand in a bar fight before the season began; after rehabilitation, {{he was assigned to}} Clearwater. In July, the Phillies promoted him to the Class AA Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, where he surrendered the first home run of his professional career in his first start. Subsequently, he was <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the season with back spasms.|$|E
5|$|L.F. Wade International Airport {{sustained}} some {{roof and}} runway lighting damage, and the Bermuda Weather Service building lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant {{at the site}} of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels tipped over in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1 million (2014 BMD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Port Hedland was <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> 86hours as the cyclone slowly moved by, causing {{significant}} disruptions to shipping. Twenty-six {{ships were}} evacuated {{from the port}} prior to the storm's arrival. Onshore mining was suspended for similar durations nearby. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto Group, and Fortescue Metals Group temporarily shut down or scaled back all operations in the area. The prolonged closure of the port resulted in a 2.4% drop in iron ore prices. Losses from lack of productivity and revenue associated with the port closures were estimated to {{be as high as}} A$500million (US$480million).|$|E
50|$|In most {{stationary}} pebble-bed reactor designs, fuel replacement is continuous. Instead of <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> {{weeks to}} replace fuel rods, pebbles {{are placed in}} a bin-shaped reactor. A pebble is recycled from the bottom to the top about ten times over a few years, and tested each time it is removed. When it is expended, it is removed to the nuclear waste area, and a new pebble inserted.|$|R

A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana's business practices, including a court judgment {{on the eve of}} the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes, but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted in a criminal conviction.|$|E
5|$|Before Imbudo struck, {{officials}} evacuated over 14,000people to {{at least}} 60shelters. Government offices were closed along the typhoon's path, and schools were closed in the capital, Manila. PAGASA issued a number 4 warning signal, the highest level, for three northern provinces, indicating the imminent threat of a powerful storm. Despite the warning, a post-storm survey in Isabela province indicated that 34% were unaware of the storm's arrival, while others believed the typhoon {{would not be as}} strong. In Manila, four flights were canceled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, and the Manila Light Rail Transit System was <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> two hours. Travel by ship and bus were halted in some areas. On July22 before the storm struck, the Philippine military was put on red alert, increasing security at the presidential palace. The military stated it was due to the typhoon, although newspapers suggested it was to prevent a coup attempt; a failed coup ultimately did occur on July27 in what would become known as the Oakwood mutiny.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of the injuries were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> an extended period of time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E
