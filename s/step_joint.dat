40|$|A {{request of}} {{material}} change when performing repairs on composite parts of SAABs JAS 39 Gripen has {{lead to the}} initiation of this project. The aim {{is to create a}} quicker and more robust repair method. The requested method of repair is to use a direct-cured repair patch made of CFRP fabric instead of CFRP tape and to mount the patch with a scarf joint, see Figure 1. 1. The fabric patch should then provide a robust quasi-isotropic repair, where the operator not is dependent of complete design data such as ply-directions etc. Today tape repairs are made on tape laminate and fabric repairs made on fabric laminate. The new method is to repair tape laminate with a fabric patch. This project will evaluate the possibility of implementing this method. The work started with a literature study to find out how repairs in composite parts of the airframe are being performed today. SAABs in-house analytical tools were then used to try to predict the results and examine some of the details in the questions at issue. Finite element models were then constructed to simulate a previous physical test program conducted to validate a repair method using a <b>step</b> <b>joint</b> and a direct-cured repair patch. If the FE models could show similar results as the physical tests the results from the FE models then can be assumed to be credible. The results of this project indicate that the change from fabric to tape in the repair patch can be done without disturbing the load path of a quasi isotropic composite laminate. Fabric repairs in orthotropic composite plates results in a knock-down of about 40 %. The use of a scarf joint instead of a <b>step</b> <b>joint</b> should also work well as the repair patches show similar strains in the centre of the patches. The difference between <b>step</b> <b>joint</b> and scarf joint is the strain {{near the edge of the}} patch. It increases with scarf joint and it may lead to an earlier fibre failure in the repair patch. Results from the analysis of the bonded joint indicate that a scarf joint yields in a lower and more evenly distributed shear stress than the <b>step</b> <b>joint.</b> This indicates that the bonded joint in the <b>step</b> <b>joint</b> will reach failure earlier then the scarf joint...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of the built {{heritage}} restoration, engineers {{have to work with}} old structures made of badly preserved timber elements. The assessment of timber elements and connections is a major issue for engineers involved in a restoration project. Before thinking about any intervention technics, engineers have to properly understand how the carpentry connections fail, which parameters influence the failure modes (geometry of the joint, mechanical properties of the wood,…) and how the internal forces are distributed into the joint to finally figure out how to design the traditional carpentry connections. The present paper aims to raise those questions focusing on the Single <b>Step</b> <b>Joint</b> design. Even if this common joint between the rafter and the tie beam is geometrically simple, one may pick up three geometrical configurations of Simple Notched Joints from the past till today: the geometrical configuration ideal (GCID), the geometrical configuration perpendicular to the tie beam (GCPTB) and the geometrical configuration perpendicular to the rafter (GCPR). The first one is more recent because it requires a highest accuracy production, and so the use of the new technologies (e. g., CNC). For each one, some general design rules about the geometrical parameters of the Single <b>Step</b> <b>Joint</b> are defined by some European standards (Siem and Jorissen, 2015), but no one details how to design this connection to prevent shear cracks at the heel depth or the compressive crushing at the joint contact surfaces. Hence the design rules and the emergence of failure modes according to the geometrical parameters of the Simple Notched Joint must be defined. In order to check the design equations and the failure modes, lab tests about the three geometrical configurations of the Single <b>Step</b> <b>Joint</b> have been carried out, varying the heel depth, the shear length and the inclination of the rafter...|$|E

40|$|Three general {{objectives}} for a desirable transfer pricing system have been identified. They are goal congruence, divisional autonomy, and divisional performance evaluation. Six steps {{have been proposed}} for a better transfer pricing system with respect to these three objectives which are not found in other systems in the current literature. In the first step, each divisional manager identifies independent opportunities other than the opportunity of trading internally with other divisions. In the second step, each division estimates the performance measures (revenues or profits) of each opportunity and selects the best opportunity. In the third step, top management in the central office estimates joint performance measures to be earned from the grand coalition of all divisions, and it determines the optimal output levels of the intermediate products. In the fourth <b>step,</b> <b>joint</b> performance measures are compared with the total of each division 2 ̆ 7 s independent performance measures. If the former amount is {{less than or equal}} to the latter amount, there will be no transfer pricing problems since no transfers take place. Otherwise, the intermediate products should be transferred among divisions for the corporation as a whole, and for each division as well. In the fifth <b>step,</b> <b>joint</b> performance measures are allocated to each participating division. Four game theoretic allocation schemes have been suggested, such as Shapley 2 ̆ 7 s value, Moriarity 2 ̆ 7 s allocation scheme, the Equal share scheme, and the Marginal contribution scheme. Top management in the central office, through consultation with each divisional manager, will select one of these allocation schemes, depending on the situation. In the last step, transfer prices are determined by using the information of optimal output levels and the allocated performance measures obtained from the selected allocation scheme. ...|$|E

Estimates for the transition probabilities for different rating classes are well known and documented.

We have found a generating function for the one <b>step</b> <b>joint</b> distribution of all assets having non-default credit ratings and a generating function of the loss distri-bution. The numerical simulations presented here verify that the average number of defaults is not affected by the correlation coefficients, but the percentiles of the number of defaults are heavily dependent upon them. In particular, for strongly cor-related assets, the distribution of the number of defaults follows a ”cascade ” pattern nesting in non-overlapping intervals. As a result, the probability {{of a large number of}} defaults is higher for correlated assets than for non-correlated ones.

We therefore asked whether known iron-related genes are candidates for association with RLS and, vice versa, whether known RLS-associated loci influence iron parameters in serum. RLS/control samples (n = 954 / 1814 in the discovery step, 735 / 736 in replication 1, and 736 / 735 in replication 2) were tested for association with SNPs located within 4 Mb intervals surrounding each gene {{from a list of}} 111 iron-related genes using a discovery threshold of P = 5 × 10 (- 4). Two population cohorts (KORA F 3 and F 4 with together n = 3447) were tested for association of six known RLS loci with iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin-saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. Results were negative. None of the candidate SNPs at the iron-related gene loci was confirmed significantly. An intronic SNP, rs 2576036, of KATNAL 2 at 18 q 21. 1 was significant in the first (P = 0. 00085) but not in the second replication <b>step</b> (<b>joint</b> nominal P-value = 0. 044). Especially, rs 1800652 (C 282 Y) in the HFE gene did not associate with RLS. Moreover, SNPs at the known RLS loci did not significantly affect serum iron parameters in the KORA cohorts. In conclusion, the correlation between RLS and iron parameters in serum may be weaker than assumed. Moreover, in a general power analysis, we show that genetic effects are diluted if they are transmitted via an intermediate trait to an end-phenotype.

40|$|The drive towards {{greater use}} of fiber-reinforced {{composites}} in primary structures, such as aircraft structures and wind turbines that are increasingly unitized, calls for advanced repair techniques that can restore the structural integrity and geometry. Two such repair techniques are stepped repairs and scarf repairs.

This paper presents an investigation of the effect of step corners on the fracture behavior of <b>stepped</b> <b>joints</b> under compressive loading, particularly after subjecting it impact damage. Joints featuring different corner radii were tested under compressive loading, and results showed that the impact damage reduced the compressive strength, to marginally below the compression-after-impact strength of composite laminates.

40|$|Diffusion bonding and brazing of high purity copper were {{investigated}} to develop procedures for joining precision machined copper components for the Next Linear Collider (NLC). Diffusion bonds were made over {{a range of}} temperatures from 400 °C to 1000 °C, under two different loading conditions [3. 45 kPa (0. 5 psi) and 3. 45 MPa (500 psi) ], and on two different diamond machined surface finishes. Brazes were made using pure silver, pure gold, and gold-nickel alloys, and different heating rates produced by both radiation and induction heating. Braze materials were applied by both physical vapor deposition (PVD) and conventional braze alloy shims. Results of the diffusion bonding experiments showed that bond strengths very near that of the copper base metal could be made at bonding temperatures of 700 °C or higher at 3. 45 MPa bonding pressure. At lower temperatures, only partial strength diffusion bonds could be made. At low bonding pressures (3. 45 kPa), full strength bonds were made at temperatures of 800 °C and higher, while no bonding (zero strength) was observed at temperatures of 700 °C and lower. Observations of the fracture surfaces of the diffusion bonded samples showed the effects of surface finish on the bonding mechanism. These observations clearly indicate that bonding began by point asperity contact, and flatter surfaces resulted in {{a higher percentage of}} bonded area under similar bonding conditions. Results of the brazing experiments indicated that pure silver worked very well for brazing under both conventional and high heating rate scenarios. Similarly, pure silver brazed well for both the PVD layers and the braze alloy shims. The gold and gold-containing brazes had problems, mainly due to the high diffusivity of gold in copper. These problems led to the necessity of overdriving the temperature to ensure melting, the presence of porosity in the joint, and very wide braze joints. Based on the overall findings of this study, a two-step joining method is proposed for fabricating the NLC structures. The structure would be assembled with pure silver braze inserts using a self-aligning <b>step</b> <b>joint</b> design, then the assembly would be vacuum diffusion bonded at 700 °C and 3. 45 MPa pressure to seal the critical inner portion of the assembly. Finally, during the same furnace cycle, the temperature would be increased to 800 °C in order to react the silver with the copper to form a liquid braze alloy that would join and seal the outer portion of the cells together...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{performance}} of mobile radio systems can be significantly enhanced by the application of adaptive antennas which consist of multi-element antenna arrays plus signal processing circuitry. In the thesis the utilization of such antennas as receive antennas in the uplink of mobile radio air interfaces of the type TD-CDMA is studied. Especially, the incorporation of covariance matrices of the received interference signals into the signal processing algorithms is investigated with a view to improve the system performance as compared to state of the art adaptive antenna technology. These covariance matrices implicitly contain information on the directions of incidence of the interference signals, and this information may be exploited to reduce the effective interference power when processing the signals received by the array elements. As a basis for the investigations, first directional models of the mobile radio channels and of the interference impinging at the receiver are developed, which can be implemented on the computer at low cost. These channel models cover both outdoor and indoor environments. They are partly based on measured channel impulse responses and, therefore, allow a description of the mobile radio channels which comes sufficiently close to reality. Concerning the interference models, two cases are considered. In the one case, the interference signals arriving from different directions are correlated, and in the other case these signals are uncorrelated. After a visualization of the potential of adaptive receive antennas, data detection and channel estimation schemes for the TD-CDMA uplink are presented, which rely on such antennas under the consideration of interference covariance matrices. Of special interest is the detection scheme MSJD (Multi <b>Step</b> <b>Joint</b> Detection), which is a novel iterative approach to multi-user detection. Concerning channel estimation, the incorporation of the knowledge of the interference covariance matrix and of the correlation matrix of the channel impulse responses is enabled by an MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) based channel estimator. The presented signal processing concepts using covariance matrices for channel estimation and data detection are merged in order to form entire receiver structures. Important tasks to be fulfilled in such receivers are the estimation of the interference covariance matrices and the reconstruction of the received desired signals. These reconstructions are required when applying MSJD in data detection. The considered receiver structures are implemented on the computer in order to enable system simulations. The obtained simulation results show that the developed schemes are very promising in cases, where the impinging interference is highly directional, whereas in cases with the interference directions being more homogeneously distributed over the azimuth the consideration of the interference covariance matrices is of only limited benefit. The thesis can serve as a basis for practical system implementations. Utilization of Correlation Matrices in Adaptive Array Processors for Time-Slotted CDMA Uplink...|$|E
