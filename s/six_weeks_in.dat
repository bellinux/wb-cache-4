5|$|In September 1958, Tintin {{magazine}} {{moved its}} headquarters to a newly constructed building near the Gare du Midi. Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over {{the direction of}} the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to Sardinia for <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>In</b> October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist Greg to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day. By this point, Tintin magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his interest in it.|$|E

Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events.

His Victoria Cross was presented by King George V at Buckingham Palace in April 1915. Promoted acting Captain, he retired in 1917 having been deemed unfit for further service as a legacy of the wounds he had received.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>in</b> close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Stargate Command (SGC) base was {{supposed}} to match the real Cheyenne Mountain complex as much as possible.

The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes. Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniel's lab, the cafeteria or the gym. The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>in</b> January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film.|$|E
