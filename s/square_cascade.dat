As a result, spectacular events {{with as many as}} six charged leptons, or one photon plus four charged leptons are expected to be observed at the LHC. Unusual events with relatively large branching fractions include three leptons of same charge plus one lepton of opposite charge, or one photon plus two leptons of same charge. We estimate the current limit from the Tevatron on the compactification scale, set by searches for trilepton events, to be around 270 GeV. Comment: 33 + 1 pages, 14 figure...|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Dyson {{created a}} {{realisation}} of the optical illusions {{depicted in the}} lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task {{after a year of}} work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a <b>square,</b> before <b>cascading</b> {{to the bottom of the}} next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden, was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003. The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.|$|R
40|$|For a {{two-dimensional}} transverse configuration in a compressible plasma a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability has been performed for a subfast shear flow. The simulation shows {{that after the}} linear growth and the subsequent nonlinear saturation {{of the fastest growing}} vortices these vortices are susceptible to vortex pairings, which occur because of the growth of subharmonics. The total kinetic energy remains almost constant {{in the evolution of the}} instability, but the enstrophy decreases rapidly owing to the selective dissipation by an artificial viscosity, which is added to prevent mesh oscillations. Therefore the nonlinear evolution of the two-dimensional transverse K-H instability, in particular, the successive pairings of vortices, are well described as a self-organization process resulting from the interplay of the nonlinearity and the dissipation. After the early stage of the instability development the kinetic energy and the <b>squared</b> vorticity <b>cascade</b> toward the long wavelength (inverse cascade) to form power law spectra in the wavenumber space. The inverse cascade in the wavenumber space corresponds, in the configuration space, to an emergence of a large isolated flow vortex and an associated eddy of inertia current out of trains of small-scale vortices and current eddies in the early stage. At the end of the simulation run the power law exponents in the wavenumber space of the kinetic energy, the squared vorticity, and the magnetic energy, which are all integrated across the initial flow direction, become − 3. 89, − 2. 08, and − 4. 58, respectively, in the intermediate wavenumber subrange...|$|R
40|$|A {{particularly}} effective method for analyzing document images, that consist {{of large numbers}} of bi-nary pixels, is to generate reduced images whose pixels represent enhancements of textural densities in the full-resolution image. These reduced images are generated using an integrated combination of filter-ing and subsampling. Previously reported methods used thresholding over a <b>square</b> grid, and <b>cascaded</b> these threshold reduction operations. Here, the approach is generalized to a sequence of arbitrary filter-ing/subsample operations, with emphasis on several particular filtering operations that respond to salient textural qualities of document images, such as halftones, lines or blocks of text, and horizontal or vertical rules. As with threshold reductions, these generalized “textured reductions ” are performed with no regard for connected components. Consequently, the results are typically robust to noise processes that can vitiate analysis based on connected components. Examples of image analysis and segmentation operations using textured reductions are given. Some properties can be determined very quickly; for example, the existence or absence of halftone regions in a full page image can be established in about 10 milliseconds...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{described}} tunable digital bandpass filters {{whereby the}} centre frequency and bandwidth can be independently {{related to the}} mu ltiplier coefficients, which permit simple frequency response adjustment by varying the coefficients values. The bandpass filters proposed here have a cascade form and are composed of several secondorder recursive bandpass sections with identical characteristics. The methods for the direct computation {{of the number of}} second-order filters in the cascade form, adjustable parameters and designing filter bank are shown in this paper. The design equations strate the true parametric tuning ability of the circuit. By cascading a few such circuits, a complete parametrically adjustable digital frequency responsed equalizer may be realized. It does not require precomputing the multiplier coefficient values for all designed equalizer settings. 1 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS Design procedures for variable cutoff frequency digital filters are well known [1 - 6]. This paper presents the method of designing high order digital bandpass filters whereby simply changing the multiplier number values. Let us calculate the coefficients of a tunable bandpass digital filter in the cascade form with the following specifications: centre frequency ω 0, 3 dB bandwidth ∆ω and m dB bandwidth ∆ωm for cutoff frequency. The cascade structure of bandpass digital filter is composed of several second-order recursive bandpass sections (filters) with identical characteristics. Let K be the coefficient which characterizes the steep of the transfer function of a cascade bandpass filter and defined as K = ∆ωm ∆ω. Obviously, K> 1, and an ideal bandpass filter has K = 1 for m ≠ 0. 5.

40|$|Example learning-based image super-resolution {{techniques}} estimate a high-resolution {{image from}} a low-resolution input image {{by relying on}} high-and low-resolution image pairs. An important issue for these techniques is how to model the relationship between high-and low-resolution image patches: most existing complex models either generalize hard to diverse natural images or {{require a lot of}} time for model training, while simple models have limited representation capability. In this paper, we propose a simple, effective, robust, and fast (SERF) image superresolver for image super-resolution. The proposed super-resolver is based on a series of linear least <b>squares</b> functions, namely, <b>cascaded</b> linear regression. It has few parameters to control the model and is thus able to robustly adapt to different image data sets and experimental settings. The linear least square functions lead to closed form solutions and therefore achieve computationally efficient implementations. To effectively decrease these gaps, we group image patches into clusters via k-means algorithm and learn a linear regressor for each cluster at each iteration. The cascaded learning process gradually decreases the gap of highfrequency detail between the estimated high-resolution image patch and the ground truth image patch and simultaneously obtains the linear regression parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance with lower time consumption than the state-of-the-art methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} years a strong {{research}} effort was produced {{in order to develop}} and design new forming technologies able to overcome the typical drawbacks of traditional forming operations. Among such new technologies, hydroforming proved {{to be one of the}} most promising. The design of tube hydroforming operations is mainly aimed to prevent bursting or buckling occurrence and such issues can be pursued only if a proper control of both material feeding history and internal pressure path during the process is performed. In this paper, a proper optimisation strategy was developed on Y-shaped tube hydroforming process which is characterized by a quite complex process mechanics with respect to axi-symmetric tube hydroforming operations. The design procedure was aimed to properly calibrate the internal pressure histories. The basic idea, in this paper, is to integrate a steepest descent method with a moving least squares approach in order to reach the optimal internal pressure curve in the hydroforming of an Y-shaped steel tube. Thus, a cascade optimisation procedure was implemented which consisted of two optimisation steps: the former is focused on the application of a steepest descent method, the latter is based on a response surface approach utilising a moving least <b>squares</b> approximation. The <b>cascade</b> procedure was driven by the will to reduce the total number of numerical simulations necessary to reach the optimum with respect to other optimisation methods...|$|R
5000|$|Lewis and Clark Pass (Salish: Smítu Sx̣͏ʷcuʔsí ("Indian Fort Pass") [...] ), el. 6424 ft is a {{mountain}} {{pass on the}} continental divide in Montana. It lies {{at the head of}} the drainages of the west flowing Blackfoot River and the east flowing Dearborn River. The pass is in the Helena National Forest in Lewis and Clark County. The Continental Divide Trail traverses north and south through the pass. At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition the pass was a much used prehistoric pathway where the native tribes and bands living in eastern and western Montana crossed over the continental divide. The pass was crossed by Meriwether Lewis on July 7, 1806, on the return leg of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a party of nine men and his dog Seaman. The pass was named for the expedition's two leaders - Lewis and William Clark. Lewis and Clark Pass is the only roadless pass on the entire Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. It has gone from being one of the most used continental divide passes in aboriginal times to one of the least visited passes today. It can be accessed by a 1.5 mi trail. Visitors will encounter the pass much as Lewis did in 1806. The furrows left by the countless dog and horse travois that crossed the pass are still visible (though fading) and this is one of the few places along the expedition's route that visitors may still encounter a grizzly bear. On a clear day, like Meriwether Lewis in 1806 one can see <b>Square</b> Butte in <b>Cascade</b> County 40 mi to the northeast.|$|R
40|$|Geostrophic {{turbulence}} predicts zonal jets in our {{oceans and}} atmospheres. Under this theory, energy cascades from small to large scales, while enstrophy - i. e., <b>squared</b> vorticity - <b>cascades</b> to increasingly smaller scales. The combined {{effects of the}} latitudinal variation in the Coriolis parameter and the inverse (forward) and cascade of energy (enstrophy) are expected to result in zonal jets [Rhines, 1975]. Other frameworks {{for the existence of}} zonal jet-like structures in the ocean include secondary instability theory [Pedlosky 1975; Berloff et al. 2009, 2011] and instabilities and/or β-plumes radiating from an eastern boundary current [Hristova et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2012; Centurioni et al. 2008; Melnichenko et al. 2010; Afanasyev et al. 2012; DiLorenzo et al. 2012]. Recent studies suggest such features exist in the ocean [Maximenko et al. 2005, 2008; Huang et al. 2007; Scott et al. 2008; Centurioni et al. 2008; Ivanov et al. 2009; van Sebille et al. 2011; Cravatte et al. 2012]. These studies make use of various combinations of altimeter measurements of sea surface height (SSH), wind reanalysis, upper ocean profiles and drift trajectories from floats to estimate ocean circulation patterns. These data are temporally averaged and generally spatially filtered to reveal jet-like structures in the world 2 ̆ 7 s oceans. Given an uncertainty regarding the physics of the jet-like features, they were referred to as striations [Maximenko et al. 2008]. Striations are zonally-elongated mesoscale (100 - 400 km) features observed in time-averaged zonal geostrophic velocity, u. Characterized by zonal scales 3 ̆e 1000 km, meridional scales 100 km and speeds O(1 cm s- 1), they alternate in direction in meridional cross-sections of u and are nominally separated by 200 km. Zonal patterns with similar appearance have also been observed in front probability derived from microwave sea surface temperature (SST) [Buckingham and Cornillon 2010] and measurements of surface winds [Maximenko et al. 2010; Divakaran and Brassington 2011]. In this study, we investigate the existence of stationary jet-like structures in subtropical oceans observed from space. Motivated by a kinematic explanation for the structures [Schlax and Chelton 2008], we explore the relationship between (1) mesoscale eddies and striations in SSH and (2) mesoscale eddies and zonal bands in microwave SST. Some of the more salient results of our study of striations include (i) propagating eddies explain a large fraction of the variance in striations, (ii) eddies having a broad range of amplitudes and scales are most correlated with and contribute most to the observed striations and (iii) the standard deviation of u does not decay inversely with averaging period. In our study of zonal bands, we find that large equatorward gradients explain a considerable fraction of the variance in mean equatorward SST gradient. High gradient events (HGEs) propagate westward with speed comparable to mesoscale eddies and appear to arise due to the combined effects of (i) contrasting temperatures of neighboring eddies and (ii) advection of surface waters by eddies embedded in a background temperature gradient. Results of both studies indicate mesoscale eddies are intimately related to the existence of multiple zonal jet-like structures, as postulated by Schlax and Chelton (2008). Furthermore, the persistence of patterns with averaging period suggest the existence of a secondary, latent signal and/or preferred eddy paths...|$|R
