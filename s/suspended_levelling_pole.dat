40|$|Our laboratory, {{along with}} several others, has been engaged in a project to {{determine}} the suitability of diisodecylphthalate (DIDP) as a standard reference material of viscosity for industrial purposes. As {{a part of that}} project, we have undertaken a study of the effects of surface tension and of impurities, of that liquid on viscosity measurements with routine, <b>suspended</b> <b>level</b> capillary instruments. For the former purpose, a set of surface tension measurements is reported here for DIDP and two reference standard mineral oils. In particular, surface tension data for DIDP, obtained using a pendant-drop shape-analysis method, at temperatures from 288 K to 308 K are presented. The present study suggests that surface tension effects upon viscosity measurements with routine capillary viscometers can be important enough to demand that the surface tension of the reference fluid(s) used for their calibration be specified. It is also evident that the surface tension of materials used for calibration may be relevant to their selection if errors arising from surface tension are to be avoided. In order to fulfil these requirements, the surface tension of the reference material {{should be included in the}} definition of the standard. The effect of the water content on the viscosity of a sample of DIDP is assessed as a part of the process of determining its suitability as a standard reference material...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Two small {{adjacent}} watersheds on the west-central {{edge of the}} Willamette Valley {{of western}} Oregon were studied. Information was gathered on existing conditions to determine the suitability of the two watersheds for a paired-watershed study design. A soil survey was conducted using slightly modified soil series previously established for the area. Distributions of the major soil series in the two watersheds were compared. Four transects were sampled using extracted soil cores and hand augering. Results of the transects closely paralleled pre-existing geomorphic schemes. Land-use patterns of the two watersheds were identified and compared. Streamflow and <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>levels</b> of the two watersheds were monitored {{and the effects of}} eight storms were compared. The soil survey revealed more diversity in the number of major soil series and greater percentages of heavier textured soils in watershed D 3. Most of its forestland occurred on heavy textured soils, whereas most of the forestland in watershed 04 occurred on moderate textured soils. Watershed D 3 had almost twice the percentage of cultivated wheatland as watershed D 4, whereas D 4 had greater percentages of area in grassland. These differences suggest that the soils of D 3 might have lower infiltration and permeability than the soils of D 4, conditions which are more conducive to lower baseflows and greater runoff and erosion. D 3 has a fairly extensive tile drain network and D 4 has three settling basins. The impact of these management structures is not apparent. Streamflow, <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>levels,</b> and precipitation for eight storms were compared. Comparisons of hydrographs indicated different response times in storm hydrograph rise for D 3 and D 4. Determination of these delay factors and adjusting streamflow values accordingly revealed a highly significant relationship between the streamflow levels, indicating a consistent hydrologic relationship between D 3 and D 4. D 3 had consistently lower baseflow levels than D 4. Comparisons of <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>levels</b> revealed consistently higher sediment levels in D 3 which resulted in greater total yields in all eight storms. These results indicate an unequal but consistent hydrologic relationship between the two watersheds and that they are suitable for a paired-watershed study design...|$|R
