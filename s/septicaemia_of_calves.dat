Twenty-one calves (10 males, 11 females) were offered replacers reconstituted to 12 % of dry matter over 5 weeks. In the group fed AMR, daily body weight gains <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> at the different stages of growth were comparable to those for calves fed SMR. In the preweaning period, calves offered AMR had similar dry matter intakes from starter, milk replacer and dry hay as well as total intake as those fed SMR. In the postweaning phase, total dry matter intakes <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> offered AMR and SMR were not statistically different. The overall feed efficiency ratios <b>of</b> AMR-fed <b>calves</b> were better (P < 0. 05) than those <b>of</b> SMR-fed <b>calves.</b> Calf faecal consistency score (P < 0. 05) and percent days with scours (P < 0. 01) <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> offered AMR were significantly lower than those fed SMR for days 4 to 17. AMR-fed calves needed a longer time (P < 0. 01) to consume the daily amount of replacer than SMR-fed calves.

In conclusion, it is suggested that the growth performance and feed efficiency characteristics <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> reared under the new feeding system with AMR were not adversely affected, but the incidence of scours <b>of</b> the young <b>calves</b> was dramatically reduced...|$|R

The overall average <b>of</b> stillborn <b>calves</b> was 1. 6 percent. Calving without assistance was the norm for 68. 4 percent of dams giving birth for the first time. This percentage increased through the third birth to 88. 6 percent. <b>Of</b> hand-fed <b>calves</b> (62. 7 percent), 49. 1 percent received 2 or fewer quarts of colostrum at first feeding. Over half <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> (51. 5 percent) were separated from dams less than 12 hours after birth. <b>Of</b> <b>calves</b> that died during the study, 26. 9 percent of deaths occurred {{during the first week of}} life. By the eighth week of life, 27. 2 percent <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> had exhibited symptoms of scours at some point, while 8. 9 percent had shown signs of respiratory problems. By the fifth week of life, 37. 9 percent <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> had received treatment for symptoms of illness, the most common of which were feeding of antibiotics, injection of antibiotics, and feeding of gut soothers (29. 8, 24. 5, and 24. 1 percent <b>of</b> <b>calves,</b> respectively). Cumulatively, 15. 1 percent <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> received vaccinations.
