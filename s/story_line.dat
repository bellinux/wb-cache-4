5|$|After {{learning}} that Nate no longer loves her, Blair sleeps with Chuck, eventually falling for him. This {{leads to a}} heated affair and an eventual love triangle. Her inability to choose creates much of the first season's <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> There are brief mentions of Blair's past struggle with anorexia-bulimia that are never mentioned again past the first season.|$|E
5|$|As of May 2008, a {{film version}} of the comic is in the {{scripting}} stage, with Brian K. Vaughan writing and Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios President of Production, producing. Feige has said that while {{it may not be}} a precise <b>story</b> <b>line</b> of any of his comics, it will be similar to the tone or origins of its initial run.|$|E

50|$|The film {{contains}} two distinct <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> each <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> revolves around Ganesh and Kumaresh. This film depicts difficulties women face(d) {{in a predominantly}} male dominated society. How these women when pushed to edge fight their ostracised husbands and set a tone and lead a meaningful life.|$|R
30|$|<b>Story</b> <b>lines,</b> ideas, {{concepts}} and other linguistic elements in discourses structure debates, establish connections between actors {{and form a}} pattern in these discourses. Following Hajer, “Discourse analysis is the method of finding and illuminating that pattern, its mechanisms and its political effects” [9]. To identify key elements of the discourse, two theoretical concepts developed by Hajer are applied: <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> and discourse coalitions. According to Hajer, <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> are “a condensed sort of narrative that links an event {{to one or more}} discourses and thus provides the basis of ‘discourse coalitions” [9].|$|R
5|$|The <b>story</b> <b>line</b> took on {{many forms}} during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.|$|E
5|$|Books and scripts {{that use}} the general <b>story</b> <b>line</b> of Austen's novels but change or {{otherwise}} modernise the story also became popular {{at the end of}} the 20th century. Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both Pride and Prejudice and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production Bride and Prejudice, which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but that many of the other characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the <b>story</b> <b>line</b> by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} <b>story</b> <b>line</b> and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The <b>story</b> <b>line</b> was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with a gatefold {{jacket and a}} booklet containing lyrics, a text version of the story, and photographs taken by Ethan Russell illustrating it. MCA Records re-released the album as a two-CD set in 1985 with the lyrics and text <b>story</b> <b>line</b> on a thin fold-up sheet {{but none of the}} photographs. The album was reissued as a remastered CD in 1996, featuring a reproduction of the original album artwork. The original mix had been criticised in particular for Daltrey's vocals being buried, so the 1996 CD was completely remixed by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson.|$|E
5|$|This {{rendition}} {{is fraught}} with many errors but the basic <b>story</b> <b>line</b> seems to fit the modern consensus. Father Queroz’s time line is also anachronistic. The Aryacakravarti dynasty came to power long before the ascendancy of the Madurai Nayaks {{as well as the}} Brahmins of Rameswaram had established a temple even longer before. Also the Gujarati origin of the Kings paternal line also in not in conformance with native claims of origin from the city of Varanasi which is in today's Uttar Pradesh not in the historical Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternate}} <b>story</b> <b>line,</b> Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the <b>story</b> <b>line</b> takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this <b>story</b> <b>line</b> comes to a close.|$|E
5|$|The season {{continued}} {{to focus on}} the surgical residency of five young interns as they try to balance the challenges of their competitive careers with the difficulties that determine their personal lives. It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington. Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second season provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions have on their careers. Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was the <b>story</b> <b>line</b> involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.|$|E

5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on the <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a visual cue to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{yet another}} {{alternate}} timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house, and learns {{that she is}} {{still in love with}} her boyfriend, Stefano. Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the <b>story</b> <b>line,</b> Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her ashes, having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before they can say much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression. She has attacks of hysteria and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.|$|E
