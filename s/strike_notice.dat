50|$|In November 2011, {{both the}} union and school board {{rejected}} the state Labor Relations Board fact-finding report, which outlined contract recommendations. Items in the report included salary issues, and called for teachers to receive a 1.25 percent raise, plus step movement based on years of service and advanced degrees, in 2011-12 and 2012-13, and a 1.5 percent increase plus step in 2013-14.

The mayor made a special request with Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty to ask him to seek back-to-work legislation, a special law that would block the TTC strike from continuing on further. By 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 26, the provincial government had signed an Order in Council allowing for a rare Sunday sitting of the Ontario legislature to consider a bill (Bill 66) to order the union and its members back to work.|$|E

[...] Out of the 200 UM janitors, SEIU reported that approximately half participated in the strike from the beginning. UNICCO, however, disputed these claims, asserting that SEIU was exaggerating the numbers, and that 148 out of the 206 workers had reported for work the previous day. At the same time the SEIU announced that a ten-day <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> had been issued to the UM medical school, with the potential of adding 200 janitors to the work action.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, AIRF {{had begun to}} be {{dominated}} by socialists and communists. The union's President between 1947 and 1953 was the socialist Jayaprakash Narayan, while the future Communist Chief Minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu was Vice-President. Worried by this, the ruling Congress party formed its own railway wing, Indian National Railway Workers' Federation (INRWF) in 1948. In March 1949, AIRF was set to launch a strike but withdrew the <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> after the government attempted conciliation. The communist wing of the union attempted to continue staging strikes. The government launched a crackdown. Troops were deployed, 7,000 workers were arrested and 2,000 were dismissed. Communist-linked unions and members were expelled from the union. In 1953, AIRF merged with INRWF to form the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen. This unity was short-lived and AIRF became independent again in 1955. Despite favouritism towards the Congress-aligned unions by the Indian Railways management, AIRF continued to maintain strong influence among Railway workers.|$|E
5000|$|March 1934 {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} month. On March 4, the four automotive FLUs voted to strike unless management recognized their union, instituted a 20 percent wage increase and reinstated all workers fired for union activity. Green, committed to labor peace and fearful that the FLUs were too weak to withstand a strike, attempted to persuade them to rescind the <b>strike</b> <b>notice.</b> [...] But President Franklin D. Roosevelt, worried that an auto strike would harm the chances for economic recovery during the Great Depression, offered to negotiate a settlement. Roosevelt ordered the National Labor Board to hear the workers' grievances, and the FLUs postponed the strike. [...] Roosevelt himself stepped into the negotiations. On March 25, Roosevelt announced the creation of an Automobile Labor Board composed of one representative from management, one representative from labor, and a [...] "neutral third party" [...] to review allegations of anti-union activity. Roosevelt endorsed management's proposal to permit the recognition of company unions and the principle of proportional representation.|$|E
50|$|Strikes Old Forge School {{teachers}} {{declared a}} strike again in August 2013. They {{have gone out}} on strike several times including December 2012. The teachers have been working without a new contract since 2010. Sharing of health insurance costs has been a sticking point. Teachers currently pay nothing for their platinum level health insurance plans. The district {{has been plagued by}} teacher strikes. There were four strikes regarding the 2006-2010 contract. Teachers set a <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> for March 2011. Under Act 1 of 2006, the school board can no longer obtain an exemption to raise property taxes due to health insurance costs. Of nearly 140 teacher strikes that occurred nationally between 2000 and 2007, 60 percent took place in Pennsylvania, according to a report released by the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy. Pennsylvania is one of 13 states in which teacher strikes are legal. Pennsylvania has the highest rate of teacher strikes in the United States. State law gives the Pennsylvania Department of Education the power to order the teachers to return so that students will complete 180 days of school by June 15.|$|E

5000|$|Machine {{translation}} in China is {{the history}} of machine translation systems developed in China. China became the fourth country that began machine translation (MT) research following USA, UK, and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Language Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences took the initiative in Russian-Chinese MT research program and set up an MT research group. From then on the research activities were directed and applied for academic purposes in Universities. The turning point of MT systems launching initiatives in market began from 1990s. MT systems went into blossom into the market. Among these systems, there were commercialized MT systems. To be more specific, Transtar was the first commercialized MT system and has been constantly upgraded. What’s more, IMC/EC MT system which was developed by Computer Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences has further made great advancement. Meanwhile, the practical MT system MT-IT-EC specific to communication domain was also <b>striking</b> to <b>notice,</b> for it has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity in the issue of publications.|$|R
50|$|A major {{turning point}} {{in the history of the}} NLRB came in 1947 with passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. Disruptions caused by strikes during World War II as well as the huge wave of strikes that {{followed}} the end of the war fueled a growing movement in 1946 and 1947 to amend the NLRA to correct what critics saw as a pro-labor tilt in federal law. Drafted by the powerful Republican Senator Robert A. Taft and the strongly anti-union Representative Fred A. Hartley, Jr., the Taft-Hartley Act banned jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary picketing, mass picketing, union campaign donations made from dues money, the closed shop, and unions of supervisors. The act also enumerated new employer rights, defined union-committed ULPs, gave states the right to opt out of federal labor law through right-to-work laws, required unions to give an 80-days' <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> in all cases, established procedures for the President to end a strike in a national emergency, and required all union officials to sign an anti-Communist oath. Organizationally, the act made the General Counsel a presidential appointee, independent of the board itself, and gave the General Counsel limited powers to seek injunctions without referring to the Justice Department. It also banned the NLRB from engaging in any mediation or conciliation, and formally enshrined in law the ban on hiring personnel to do economic data collection or analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Sims {{emigrated to}} England from Punjab, India {{at the age}} of nine. She earned a Bachelor of Education degree at the Victoria University of Manchester (now the University of Manchester). Sims and her husband moved to Canada in 1975, {{spending}} two years in Quebec before moving to Nanaimo where she was a high school teacher until the early-2000s. She was elected president of the BC Teachers' Federation in 2004 and served in that role until 2007. In her role as president of the BCTF, she was involved in the May 2005 provincial election when the BC Liberal Party, a week before the election, accused the BCTF of having a [...] "secret plan" [...] to strike two days after the election; the organization subsequently filed a defamation lawsuit. When the teachers, who had been working for over a year without a contract, did provide <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> in September 2005, the provincial government immediately extended, by legislation, the last contract to June 2006 and made a potential strike illegal. Regardless, Sims led the teachers in job action, culminating in a two-week strike. The Labour Relations Board determined the strike illegal and the BC Supreme Court found the BCTF in civil contempt of court, fined the BCTF $500,000 and ordered the BCTF not pay the teachers a strike pay. The strike ended when the membership voted to accept a $150 million mediated settlement which both the government and the BCTF executive had endorsed. Sims's BCTF successfully negotiated a five-year contract in June 2006.|$|E

40|$|This Comment {{will cover}} three main topics. First, this Comment {{will tell the}} story of the Charleston strike and the {{individual}} women involved. Second, this Comment will examine, through the eyes of those individuals, the unique ways in which race and gender come together to create unique circumstances that deserve legal consideration. For both of these sections, I use the women 2 ̆ 7 s own voices to illustrate and reinforce substantive points. Third, this comment will describe the 10 -day <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> provision, examining how it would have affected the Charleston workers had it been enacted in 1969 during the time of the strike. Finally, in light of those observations concerning race and gender, I will propose an exception to the 10 -day <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> provision. This proposed exception to the l 0 -day <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> provision is particularly important to women because they are more likely to work as a health care providers and therefore are more likely to be affected by health care legislation...|$|E
40|$|This {{treatise}} {{discusses the}} increasing of the procedural and substantive {{limitations on the}} employees’ right to strike. The Constitution permits the right to strike to be limited {{in terms of the}} laws of general application. The Labour Relations Act (LRA) is a good example. Such limitation must be reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society, based on human dignity, equality and freedom. The study sought to investigate whether further increasing the existing limitations on the right to strike unduly breaches employees’ Constitutional right to strike and the purpose of the LRA. Further, the study sought to find out whether the additional content requirements in the <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> amount to importing into the LRA additional limitations on the fundamental right to strike that enjoys no textual support. Through an extensive literature review, the findings arguably show that indeed further increasing the limitations on the employees’ right to strike may unduly infringe their right to strike. Moreover, the increase of the content requirements in a <b>strike</b> <b>notice</b> creates an unnecessary hurdle to employees wishing to strike. One of the most important finding made is that instead further increasing the limitations on the right to strike, going back to the basics of negotiation to alleviate strikes, particularly wage-related strikes is vital. To achieve this, it is important for employers to re-establish social and individual relationships with their employees, whereby they become aware of the issues that employees face on a daily basis. Also, establishing proper workplace dialogue and forums would assist employers in becoming aware of employees concerns. This would thereby prevent strikes, as problems can be dealt with beforehand. The findings above informed in the recommendations {{at the end of the}} study...|$|E

50|$|Colombia's Pacific coastline, where muddy rivers loop {{into the}} ocean, {{has long been}} a smugglers' paradise. Behind the jagged cliffs that jut into the ocean is a vast jungle, laced with mangrove-fringed coves and {{virtually}} thousands of kilometres of waterways, apt for clandestine shipyards. A Colombian Navy Commander stated that it is most <b>striking</b> to <b>notice</b> the logistical capacity required of these criminals in order to take all the material {{into the heart of the}} jungle, including heavy equipment such as propulsion gear and generators. Sometimes they are put together in pieces and then reassembled in other locations under the jungle canopy, in camps outfitted with sleeping quarters for workers. The narco-submarines can cost about $2 million USD and take upward of a year to build. Despite the costs, some of the craft are intended for one-time use, being abandoned at sea after a successful delivery. After all, their cargoes carry a street value of up to $400 million. On other seized craft however, officials found zinc bars used as sacrificial anodes, reducing corrosion on metal parts exposed to seawater. As corrosion would not be a concern on a single trip but is a factor influencing long-term durability, this is a clear indication that multiple use was intended. This, in turn, opens up the question of any illicit return cargo, like weapons, that they might carry back to Colombia.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} <b>striking</b> things to <b>notice</b> when 2 ̆ 2 looking back 2 ̆ 2 on the {{regulation}} of the legal profession is the relative absence of enforceable legal sanctions for unethical behavior by lawyers. Before the promulgation in 1970 of the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s Model Code of Professional Responsibility, regulation of the legal profession was largely {{a matter of a}} fraternal body taking care of its own, and occasionally expelling miscreants. Now, of course, there is a complex body of law, enforced by courts and regulatory authorities with overlapping jurisdiction, that governs a substantial amount of the day-to-day activities of lawyers. The hypothesis I explore in this essay is that there are nonlegal, generally informal mechanisms available by which lawyers control one another, from within the profession, rather than relying on formal, legal, externally imposed systems of rules. Moreover, these nonlegal methods do a pretty fair job of maintaining stability and order under some circumstances...|$|R
40|$|In a {{first part}} of this paper I expound briefly the {{essential}} characteristics of free will. The second part deals with the objections of Benjamin Libet, allegedly based on brain-scientific foundations, against «positive free will». The third and main part shows that Libet’s anti-positive-free-will-position is due to an almost complete failure of a phenomenology of the conscious acts that precede, accompany and follow voluntary movement. The fourth part defends the thesis that Libet’s experimental results, far from supporting his philosophical stance, contain strong empirical confirmations of human free will, which, apart from a phenomenology of human acts, becomes further clear upon <b>noticing</b> <b>striking</b> philosophical deficiencies and contradictions in his distinction between ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ free will. The conclusions summarize the results, according to which positive free will and causality through freedom exist and are confirmed by Libet’s and other test results.
