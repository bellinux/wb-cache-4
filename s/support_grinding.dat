40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{orthodontic}} treatment effects on unilateral posterior crossbite in the primary and early mixed dentition by systematically reviewing the literature. A literature search was performed by applying the Medline database (Entrez PubMed) and covering the period from January 1966 to October 2002. The inclusion criteria were primary and early mixed dentition with unilateral posterior crossbite, randomized controlled trials (RCT), prospective and retrospective studies with concurrent untreated as well as normal controls, and clinical trials comparing at least two treatment strategies without any untreated or normal group involved. Two reviewers extracted the data independently and also assessed the quality of the studies. The search strategy resulted in 1001 articles, and 12 met the inclusion criteria. Two RCTs of early treatment of crossbite have been performed, and these two studies <b>support</b> <b>grinding</b> as treatment in the primary dentition. There is no scientific evidence available to show which of the treatment modalities, grinding, Quad-helix, expansion plates, or rapid maxillary expansion, is the most effective. Most of the studies have serious problems of lack of power because of small sample size, bias and confounding variables, lack of method error analysis, blinding in measurements, and deficient or lack of statistical methods. To obtain reliable scientific evidence, better-controlled RCTs with sufficient ample sizes are needed to determine which treatment is the most effective for early correction of unilateral posterior crossbite. Future studies should also include assessments of long-term stability as well as analysis of costs and side effects of the interventions...|$|E

50|$|Modern CNC {{tool and}} cutter {{grinders}} enhance productivity by typically offering {{features such as}} automatic tool loading {{as well as the}} ability to <b>support</b> multiple <b>grinding</b> wheels. High levels of automation, as well as automatic in-machine tool measurement and compensation, allow extended periods of unmanned production. With careful process configuration and appropriate tool support, tolerances less than 5 micrometres (0.0002") can be consistently achieved even on the most complex parts.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{friction}} in the contact zone between the tool and {{a work piece}} during the robot <b>supported</b> belt <b>grinding</b> process of metallic work pieces, high temperatures can be generated, causing modifications of material microstructure and change of material properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Stenvert {{hardness}} {{test was used}} to determine the energy‐to‐grind (ETG) and time‐to‐grind (TTG) of 107 food‐grade corn hybrids at different moisture content (MC) levels. ETG and TTG were significantly affected by moisture content. Across hybrids, ETG displayed the most consistent response between 10 % and 13 % MC wet basis. An equation was developed to adjust ETG and TTG to a common MC level in order to minimize moisture effects on corn‐hardness determination. ETG was considered to be the preferable method to measure corn hardness, considering ETG adjustments, based on MC, were more accurate using the developed equation. Results also <b>supported</b> <b>grinding</b> at MC levels between 10 % and 13 % MC to obtain the most accurate results, as opposed to higher MC levels. Grinder speed effects were also found to be significant but controllable, and the repeatability of ETG and TTG were about the same. Near‐infrared reflectance spectroscopy was concurrently evaluated as a method to measure corn hardness in terms of ETG and TTG on whole‐kernel and ground material from the grinder. Predictive models were poor using spectra (500 to 1700 nm) of whole‐kernel and ground samples. Moisture‐correction methods developed in this work allowed samples of corn to be tested over a broader range of MC. This provided more convenience and greater confidence in grinding parameters as a measurement of corn hardness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{hydro turbine}} {{manufacturing}} and repair, grinding of certain high-curvature surfaces like fillet welds presently cannot {{be carried out}} by robots so hand grinding is necessary. During this process, the grinding wheel is moved {{back and forth over the}} workpiece and thus the wheel maintains its profile and better control of the material removal rate is achieved. To automate such a process, material removal and wheel wear models must be developed and experimentally validated under specific operating conditions. This paper presents the study of predictive models to <b>support</b> automation of <b>grinding</b> wheel profiling...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} summarizes all existing sources {{dealing with}} Antonín Karč, {{and it is}} followed by the first chapter (Epoch and Education) explaining historical background and styles that influenced Antonín Karč' s works from the period 1900 - 1940. As Antonín Karč's jewellery works from the period after 1908 are closely connected with the Secondary Art School in Turnov, the second chapter (Turnov and the Secondary Art School for Grinding, Precious Stones Engraving and Goldsmithry) describes the establishing of the school and its history until 1940. The school was established in order to <b>support</b> the <b>grinding</b> industry in Turnov. Soon after, goldsmithry was added to processing and engraving of gems. Bohemian gamet belonged to traditiona 1 raw materials of the region around Turnov, and development of Bohemian gamet jewellery is closely related to the Art School in Turnov; Antonín Karč also designed jewels with Bohemian garnets. In 1911 his design drafts were incorporated into the pattern templates collection of the Secondary Art School in Turnov. After 1930 he participated in development of contemporary gamet grindings and jewels containing Bohemian garnets distinctive through a combination of a plain strip ornament and a gold area. Therefore, one of this chapter' s sections summarizes the aims of the school after [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Rail {{grinding}} {{has become}} an important maintenance activity {{over the past three}} decades and the importance of rail grinding is likely to augment owing to future demands in rail transport sector particularly for heavy haul lines. The preventive grinding strategy is preferred over the corrective grinding strategy by most rail infrastructure owners, as it can maintain the rails economically by targeting the magic wear rate. Grinding decisions on when to grind (Grinding intervals), how much to grind (Material removal) and where to grind do not have a strong economic insight in the current practice. Impact of these grinding decisions on the total rail maintenance cost is not researched extensively. This paper will discuss the various factors that influence the grinding decision. An economical model is proposed which can be used as a <b>support</b> to rail <b>grinding</b> teams for an informed grinding decision...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an easily implemented computer simulation method for grinding to high accuracy {{a class of}} long slender rollers {{with a wide variety}} of multidiameter structures used in the plastic film industry, the cost of which compares favourably with normal trial-and-error in situ grinding. Mathematical models have been developed to describe the deformation of the roller when grinding conditions such as the rigidity of the <b>supporting</b> centres, the <b>grinding</b> force and also the oscillation of the workpiece in high speed rotation are taken into account. The proposed method has been verified by comparing it with the analytical results of a simple beam and also by verification from an in situ experiment. Based on the results of simulation, a modified control method, which is used to compensate the deflections in order to achieve the required accuracy of parallelism, is also proposed in order to cope with different types of rollers and different grinding conditions. © 1990...|$|R
40|$|The Mill at Anselma, {{built in}} 1747, has an {{internal}} timber-frame structure, the Hurst Frame, that <b>supports</b> critical grain <b>grinding</b> equipment. The mill is undergoing renovation {{and will be}} converted into a museum. This paper describes {{the design of a}} structural model of the Hurst Frame in an effort to compare a 250 year-old design to modem design standards. The model was executed in the ANSYS finite element analysis software package and took into account dead, live, and equivalent dynamic loading patterns. The Hurst Frame is held together with a variety of wooden joints and they each have been modeled. Estimating of the modulus of elasticity of the frame members and the rotational spring constants of double-pegged mortise and tenon joints were important accomplishments. Comparison with ASD and LRFD codes has highlighted the weakest parts of the mill, but also confirms that the Mill at Anselma is up to LRFD code and safe for visitors and, of course, grinding grain.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a novel industrial process, embodied in a new robotic polishing machine, for automatically grinding and polishing aspheric optics. The machine is targeted at meeting the growing demand for inexpensive axially symmetric but aspherical lenses and mirrors for industry and science, non-axisymmetric and conformal optics of many kinds, the planarization of silicon wafers and associated devices, and for controlling form and texture in other artifacts including prosthetic joints. We describe both the physics and the implementation of the process. It is based on an innovative pressurised tool of variable effective size, spun to give high removal rate. The tool traverse and orientation are orchestrated in a unique (and patented) way to avoid completely the characteristic fast peripheral-velocity and centre-zero left by conventional spinning tools. The pressurised tooling <b>supports</b> loose abrasive <b>grinding</b> and polishing, plus a new bound-abrasive grinding process, providing {{for a wide range of}} work from coarse profiling to fine polishing and figuring. Finally we discuss the critical control, data handling and software challenges in the implementation of the process, contrast the approach with alternative technologies, and present preliminary results of polishing trials...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new method {{to evaluate the}} geometry of dull cutting tools in order to verify the necessity of tool re-sharpening and to decrease the tool grinding machine setup time, based on a laser scanning approach. The developed method consists {{of the definition of}} a system architecture and the programming of all the algorithms needed to analyze the data and provide, as output, the cutting angles of the worn tool. These angles are usually difficult to be measured and are needed to set up the grinding machine. The main challenges that have been dealt with in this application are related to the treatment of data acquired by the system’s cameras, which must be specific for the milling tools, usually characterized by the presence of undercuts and sharp edges. Starting from the architecture of the system, an industrial product has been designed, with the <b>support</b> of a <b>grinding</b> machine manufacturer. The basic idea has been to develop a low-cost system that could be integrated on a tool sharpening machine and interfaced with its numeric control.
