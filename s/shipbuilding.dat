5|$|On 16 June 2014, the EBU {{confirmed}} that the 2014 contest would be held at three large former <b>shipbuilding</b> sheds of Malta <b>Shipbuilding.</b> The middle shed would be the main audience area and stage, while the two side sheds would be used as audience entrances and exits, restrooms, and refreshment stalls. In total, there was capacity for 4,000–4,500 people inside the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for <b>shipbuilding.</b> In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for <b>shipbuilding</b> using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for <b>shipbuilding.</b> For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|His {{next project}} was to develop Newport News <b>Shipbuilding</b> and Drydock Company, which became the world's largest shipyard. Opened as Chesapeake Dry Dock & Construction Company, the <b>shipbuilding</b> was {{intended}} to build boats to transition goods from the rails to the seas. With president Theodore Roosevelt's declaration to create a Great White Fleet, the company entered the warship business by building seven of the first sixteen warships. Today, the shipyard holds a dominant position in the American warship construction business.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of the Interior on 31 August for disposal. She was scrapped in Osaka from 2 September 1946 to 1 May 1947 by the Kyôwa <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company.|$|E
5|$|In July 1989 the United States Navy {{commissioned}} the third naval vessel {{named after the}} city with the entry of the Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine USS NEWPORT NEWS (SSN-750), built at Newport News <b>Shipbuilding,</b> into active service.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{was one of}} {{eighteen}} United States cities producing Liberty ships. Its Alabama Drydock and <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department. Gulf <b>Shipbuilding</b> Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, s, and minesweepers. The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs.|$|E
5|$|New Zealands keel {{was laid}} at Fairfield <b>Shipbuilding</b> and Engineering's yard on the Clyde on 20 June 1910. Launched on 1 July 1911, the battlecruiser was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Navy {{four days before}} she was completed on 23 November 1912.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1930 Palmer's {{launched}} its thousandth ship, the tanker Peter Hurll, but {{by this time}} the brief <b>shipbuilding</b> boom had been ended by the Great Depression, and there were no new orders on the firm's books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any <b>shipbuilding</b> activity for at least 40 years.|$|E
5|$|SS John Burke (MC hull number 609) was an American Liberty Ship built during World War II, {{one of the}} 2,710 type 'EC2-S-C1' {{ships that}} carried all kinds and types of dry cargo during the war. The ship was named for John Burke (February 25, 1859 – May 14, 1937), the 10th Governor of North Dakota. Burke was built at Kaiser <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company's Oregon <b>Shipbuilding</b> yard in Portland, Oregon. Burke's keel was laid November 20, 1942 and the hull was {{launched}} on December 13. After fitting-out, Burke was delivered to the US Maritime Commission on December 23, just 33 days after construction began. The War Shipping Administration then placed Burke under management of the Northland Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|The Columbus {{was taken}} out of service in 1933, and changed hands twice during the Great Depression, in 1933 and again in 1934. She was {{scrapped}} in 1936 at the Manitowoc <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom company Vickers <b>Shipbuilding</b> & Engineering {{offered a}} design {{referred}} to as the Type 2400, that later became the Upholder class.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Kongō {{was awarded to}} Earle's <b>Shipbuilding</b> and Engineering Co. in Hull, England on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £120,750, exclusive of armament. The vessel was named for Mount Kongō.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for the vessels was announced on 25 July 2007, by the then Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, ending several years of delay over cost issues and British naval <b>shipbuilding</b> restructuring. The contracts were signed one year later on 3 July 2008, after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group's VT <b>Shipbuilding,</b> which was a requirement of the UK Government.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} owned by Stewart J. Dailey, a former mule driver on the Erie Canal who later became {{a partner in a}} Tonawanda <b>shipbuilding</b> company and {{afterwards}} opened his own business, S. J. Dailey Company.|$|E
5|$|Trade {{laid the}} {{foundations}} of prosperity, aided by neutrality between England and France. The Jersey way of life involved agriculture, milling, fishing, <b>shipbuilding</b> and production of woollen goods. 19th century improvements in transport links brought tourism to the island.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has a {{sizeable}} automotive industry, which produced over 1.3 million motor vehicles in 2015, ranking as the 14th largest producer in the world. Turkish <b>shipbuilding</b> exports were worth US$1.2 billion in 2011. The major export markets are Malta, Marshall Islands, Panama and the United Kingdom. Turkish shipyards have 15 floating docks {{of different sizes}} and one dry dock. Tuzla, Yalova, and İzmit have developed into dynamic <b>shipbuilding</b> centres. In 2011, there were 70 active shipyards in Turkey, with another 56 being built. Turkish shipyards are highly regarded both {{for the production of}} chemical and oil tankers up to 10,000 dwt and also for their mega yachts.|$|E
5|$|USS Jacob Jones (DD-61) {{was laid}} down by the New York <b>Shipbuilding</b> of Camden, New Jersey, in August 1914 and {{launched}} in May of the following year. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel {{named in honor of}} Jacob Jones.|$|E
5|$|USS Tucker (DD-57), {{the lead}} ship of the class, was {{laid down by}} the Fore River <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, in November 1914 and {{launched}} in May 1915. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Samuel Tucker.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the <b>Shipbuilding</b> Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the <b>Shipbuilding</b> Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
5|$|ARA Moreno was a {{dreadnought}} battleship {{designed by}} the American Fore River <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company for the Argentine Navy (Armada de la República Argentina). Named after Mariano Moreno, a key member of the first independent government of Argentina, the First Assembly (Primera Junta), Moreno was the second dreadnought of the , and the fourth built during the South American dreadnought race.|$|E
5|$|All ten {{carriers}} {{were constructed}} by Newport News <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company in Virginia. , the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on 3 May 1975, and , the tenth and {{last of the}} class, was commissioned on 10 January 2009. Since the 1970s, Nimitz-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world, including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran, the Gulf War, and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, <b>shipbuilding,</b> {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site contributed to a rapid increase in regional demand for electricity. By 1943, fully 96 percent of Columbia River electricity was being used for war manufacturing. The volume of water at Celilo Falls made The Dalles an attractive site for a new dam {{in the eyes of}} the Corps of Engineers.|$|E
5|$|Among the city's major {{industries}} are <b>shipbuilding,</b> military, and aerospace. Newport News <b>Shipbuilding,</b> owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries, {{and the large}} coal piers supplied by railroad giant CSX Transportation, the modern Fortune 500 successor to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C). Miles of the waterfront {{can be seen by}} automobiles crossing the James River Bridge and Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, which is a portion of the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway, linking the city with each of the other major cities of Hampton Roads via Interstate 664 and Interstate 64. Many U.S. defensive industry suppliers are based in Newport News, and these and nearby military bases employ many residents, in addition to those working at the shipyard and in other harbor-related vocations.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{was laid}} down on 7 November 1913 by the Blyth <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company in Blyth, Northumberland, as a freighter, {{probably}} {{intended for the}} coal-for-grain trade in the Black Sea. She was purchased in May 1914 and was launched on 5 September 1914. The ship was commissioned on 10 December 1914.|$|E
5|$|At , {{the ship}} was the longest {{whaleback}} ever built, and reportedly also the largest vessel on the Great Lakes when she was launched. Columbus {{is said to have}} carried more passengers during her career than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. After a career lasting four decades, she was retired during the Great Depression and scrapped in 1936 by the Manitowoc <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic Marine {{operated}} a major shipyard {{at the former}} Alabama Drydock and <b>Shipbuilding</b> Company site on Pinto Island. It was acquired by British defense conglomerate BAE Systems in May 2010 for $352million.

5|$|Bulkhead partition: The 5th century book Garden of Strange Things by Liu Jingshu {{mentioned}} that a ship could allow water {{to enter the}} bottom without sinking, while the Song Dynasty author Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) wrote in his book of 1119 that the hulls of Chinese ships had a bulkhead build; these pieces of literary evidence for bulkhead partitions are confirmed by archaeological evidence of a 24m (78ft) long Song Dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled compartmental sections built watertight, dated to about 1277. Western writers from Marco Polo (1254–1324), to Niccolò Da Conti (1395–1469), to Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) commented on bulkhead partitions, which they viewed as an original aspect of Chinese <b>shipbuilding,</b> as Western <b>shipbuilding</b> did not incorporate this hull arrangement until the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Ships in October 2010 {{announced}} {{a bid to}} take over Northrop Grumman's <b>shipbuilding</b> operations, and later that month Canada-based Great Lakes Feeder Lines announced the Port of Cleveland was a target for its U.S. international container service headquarters, the first on the Great Lakes.|$|E
