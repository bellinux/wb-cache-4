When Eden protests his actions, Bennet shows her a series of photographs depicting Sylar's dead victims—all with their brains removed from their heads—and says {{he is determined to}} save his daughter from such a fate. He orders Eden to go to the homecoming game and look for Sylar and grounds Claire to prevent her from being killed. Bennet discovers later, however, that Claire snuck out and worriedly runs to the school to find her. When he arrives, he is too late to stop Sylar from attacking the cheerleader in the pictures. Bennet soon discovers that the victim was not Claire; rather, it was Jackie Wilcox, one of Claire's fellow cheerleaders. A relatively relieved Bennet soon reunites with his daughter and insists they go home while the police handle things. Claire says that she has something to tell her father regarding her uncanny survival.|$|E

500|$|Like the manga, the anime {{has been}} well {{received}} but does not avoid criticism; in particular {{the quality of the}} animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews. Some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised. Most reviewers took the position that, even if they dislike certain elements, the series as a whole contains <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> them want to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who writes: ...|$|E
500|$|Warning {{coloration}} (aposematism) {{is effectively}} the [...] "opposite" [...] of camouflage, {{and a special}} case of advertising. Its function {{is to make the}} animal, for example a wasp or a coral snake, highly conspicuous to potential predators, so that it is noticed, remembered, and then avoided. As Peter Forbes observes, [...] "Human warning signs employ the same colours – red, yellow, black, and white – that nature uses to advertise dangerous creatures."

Talking about his collaboration with Shakira, El Cata revealed that she told him [...] "You have <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> me move".

The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy; as Davis states, [...] "Later, Big Bird forgets <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> him sad". After several inserts, Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, he answers, [...] "Just because". Later, Big Bird listens to the adults conversing about a new baby who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother.|$|E
500|$|As 1990 wound down, Roxette {{completed}} its tour {{and returned to}} Sweden to record its follow-up to Look Sharp! The 14-track collection titled Joyride, which was released in March 1991, became a critical and commercial success. It topped the charts {{in a number of}} countries and became Roxette's best selling album. Their record company EMI invested almost 2 million dollars on promotion for the album, which stayed at No.1 in Germany for 13 weeks, while staying on the US album chart for over a year. J.D. Considine of Rolling Stone magazine reviewed Joyride: [...] "By emphasizing its sense of personality, Roxette delivers more than just well-constructed hooks; this music has heart, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> even the catchiest melody more appealing." [...] The album's success brought the duo two Rockbjörnen awards for Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Group, the second time they had achieved that feat.|$|E

[...] VanDerWerff complimented Morrison on his portrayal of Will: [...] "every time the show hands him anything to play that's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> vague sense, he does a good job with it." [...] Other kudos for the actors were provided by Respers France, who highlighted the [...] "further great acting" [...] seen during [...] "Finn and Quinn's moment in his truck", and E! Online Jenna Mullins, who called the scene where Finn and Kurt help Sue with her sister's room [...] "positively heartbreaking", and the trio of characters [...] "magnificent".

The separation of the two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, is [...] "the heart of the book". Both subsequently become [...] "victims of the passage of time": Abdullah, who is older and remembers Pari, agonizes over her loss for most of his life, while Pari is younger and able to forget her brother after losing him. However, {{towards the end of the}} book, Pari is informed that she was adopted and that she has a brother, Abdullah; she locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, [...] "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory is a blessing — something that safeguards in all the things that are dear to you — or is memory a curse — <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> you relive the most painful parts of your life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows." [...] Thus, the combination of these events make And the Mountains Echoed [...] "kind of like a fairytale turned on its head".|$|E

Mason commented that the storyline has [...] "a serious side" [...] because everyone believes Scotty is straight, especially his girlfriend. However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty lets his attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's no mistaking this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it out there now, but Chris doesn't go for it. So he kicks Scotty out of the house, but even then Scotty doesn't realise what the kiss means." [...] A shocked Chris then confides in his housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), about the kiss and they decide that they need to tell Georgia about it. However, they soon learn that Scotty has proposed to Georgia and decide to remain silent to stop her from having her heart broken.|$|E

Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked.

Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> her fun—it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E
