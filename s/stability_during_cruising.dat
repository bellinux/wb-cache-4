40|$|A {{rotorcraft}} {{analysis is}} conducted to assess tilt-rotor stability and conversion loads for the XV- 15 rotor with metal blades within its specified test envelope. A 38 -DOF flutter analysis {{based on the}} code by Johnson (1988) is developed to simulate a wind-tunnel test in which the rotor torque is constant and thereby study stability. The same analytical model provides the simulated loads including hub loads, blade loads, and oscillatory pitch-link loads with attention given to the nonuniform inflow through the proprotor {{in the presence of}} the wing. Tilt-rotor <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> the <b>cruise</b> mode is found to be sensitive to coupling effects in the control system stiffness, and a stability problem is identified in the XV- 15 Advanced Technology Blades. The present analysis demonstrates that the tilt-rotor is stable within the specified test envelope of the NASA 40 x 80 -ft wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|The German future space {{launcher}} technology {{research program}} ASTRA considers for near term application a reusable first stage design {{which is called}} a winged liquid fly-back booster (LFBB). The regarded partially reusable space transportation system consists of two booster stages, which {{are attached to the}} expendable Ariane 5 core stage at an upgraded future technology level. The main area of interest of the present study is the return flight after the staging procedure which dominates the aerodynamic design of the LFBB. The goal considered in the present paper is the refinement of an existing LFBB design. With view to the trim of the vehicle former results show that there is an essential need to consider a configuration with canards. The canard deflections then may be limited to hcan= 8 for subsonic flow and they are always smaller than hcan= 5 for super- and hypersonic flight conditions. Main problem of the current configuration is the lack of longitudinal <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> the sub-/transonic <b>cruise</b> flight at M< 0. 7. Detailed aerodynamic parameter studies concerning the longitudinal motion point out {{that it is possible to}} adapt the current LFBB in a way that it allows a stable flight along the complete return trajectory and that it additionally enables a very robust trim behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The present work takes origin {{from studies}} {{carried out at}} the Department of Aerospace Engineering of University of Pisa on {{innovative}} aircraft configurations. In 1924 the German scientist and father of modern aerodynamics Prof. Ludwing Prandtl demonstrated {{the existence of a}} wing system producing the minimum induced drag, and he called it Best Wing System (BWS). This wing system is made of four wings connected together at their tips so that it looks like a box in a frontal view. The condition of minimum induced drag found by Prandtl states that the two horizontal wings must have the same lift distribution whereas the vertical wings, or bulkheads, must carry a butterfly shaped lift distribution. The induced drag of this system is the lowest among all possible wings carrying the same total lift with a given wingspan, and the efficiency increases as the vertical gap to wingspan ratio (h b) does. The Prandtl’s calculations were based on an approximated method predicting an induced drag of the BWS as the non-dimensional gap h b! " that is 0. 16 times the reference monoplane induced drag. This is in contradiction with the fact that when the two equally loaded horizontal wings are at infinite distance, they can be treated as isolated, therefore they have half of the induced drag of the equivalent monoplane. In 1999 Prof. Aldo Frediani at University of Pisa gave a new demonstration based on more accurate calculations. He obtained the same results as Prandtl in the range of low values of h b, but now the asymptote is, according with theory, at 0. 5. At the same time, he started the translation into an engineering product of the mathematical intuition of Prandtl and he called this aircraft PrandtlPlane in his honor. The PrandtlPlane is, hence, a new aircraft concept, based on the general aim to reduce induced drag. Besides, this configuration has showed potential benefits in different aircraft categories: from Very Large Aircraft (VLA) to small ULM airplanes. The unconventional nature of this aircraft gives rise to new design challenges mainly {{due to a lack of}} experience and of statistical data; the space of solutions is, therefore, unexplored. For this reason a solution satisfying different conflicting requirements such as wings with the same lift, static stability of flight and trim condition in every point of the flight envelope may be hard to find. The problem of finding the PrandtlPlane wing planform can be formulated in terms of optimization, which is to find the geometric parameters defining the wings such that the drag is minimized and the constraints are satisfied. Constraints involve the equilibrium and the static <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>cruise</b> and landing, maximum speed stall, geometrical constraints, and so on. Boundaries on the variables are defined as well: minimum/maximum swept angles, minimum/maximum dihedral angles, minimum/maximum elevator and flaps deflections, and so on. An overview of the main methods and algorithms for the search of minima of unconstrained and constrained optimization problems is presented. Moreover, an algorithm based on a derivative free method (MADS) for the search of minima of unconstrained problems and its extension to constrained problems are presented. An algorithm for the search of global minima is presented and it is tested on benchmarking problems. Finally, these methods are extensively applied to find solutions of a ULM version of the PrandtlPlane aircraft and a flying model coming from the optimizer is manufactured and tested...|$|R

40|$|Albatrosses {{are known}} to expend {{only a small amount}} of energy during flight. The low energy cost of {{albatross}} flight has been attributed to energy-efficient gliding (soaring) with sporadic flapping, although little is known about how much time and energy albatrosses expend in flapping versus gliding <b>during</b> <b>cruising</b> flight. Here, we examined the heart rates (used as an instantaneous index of energy expenditure) and flapping activities of free-ranging black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys) to estimate the energy cost of flapping as well as time spent in flapping activities. The heart rate of albatrosses during flight (144 beats min- 1) was similar to that while sitting on the water (150 beats min- 1). In contrast, heart rate was much higher during takeoff and landing (ca. 200 beats min- 1). Heart rate <b>during</b> <b>cruising</b> flight was linearly correlated with the number of wing flaps per minute, suggesting an extra energy burden of flapping. Albatrosses expend only 4. 6 % ± 1. 4 % of their time in flapping <b>during</b> <b>cruising</b> flight, which was significantly lower than those during and shortly after takeoff (9. 8 % ± 3. 5 %). Flapping activity, which amounted to just 4. 6 % of the time in flight, accounted for 13. 3 % of the total energy expenditure <b>during</b> <b>cruising</b> flight. These results support the idea that albatrosses achieve energy-efficient flight by reducing the time spent in flapping activity, which is associated with high energy expenditure...|$|R

40|$|The Balearic {{region is}} a highly dynamic area located in the Western Mediterranean, {{straddling}} the transition between the Algerian and Provencal basins and constitutes {{one of the main}} spawning grounds for the large, migratory Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) and other medium and small tuna species (Thunnus alalunga, Auxis rochei, Euthynnus alleteratus and Katsuwonus pelamis). In summer, despite been considered an oligotrophic region as the whole Mediterranean Sea, it harbors a relatively abundant and diverse larval fish community (LFC). In this study, we analyze the composition, abundance and the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the horizontal structure of the LFC in the Balearic region, in early summer 2005, during the spawning season of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Hydrographically, 2005 was an unusual year with a summer situation of relatively lack of mesoscale features, weak surface currents and a general situation of high stability. A total of 128 taxa of fish larvae, belonging to 52 families, were identified. The average abundance was 1770 larvae 1000 m- 3. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed LFC to have a strong horizontal structure. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination identified two larval fish assemblages. These assemblages were mainly delineated by depth and, therefore, by the spawning location of adult fish. Our results also suggest that anticyclonic eddy boundaries constitute favourable habitats for fish larvae. Also, the scenario of higher than unusual hydrographic <b>stability</b> found <b>during</b> the <b>cruise</b> would be responsible for the relatively lack of mesoscale features and, consequently, for the lack of influence of these features on the horizontal distribution of fish larvae and on the horizontal structure of the LFC. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were analyzed and interpreted {{with the aid of}} back trajectory, principal component, and multiple linear regression analyses. Compared with the results over the South Pacific from 2 decades ago, the non-sea-salt sulfate (NSS-SO 4 2 -) concentrations over the South Pacific have increased by a factor of ∼ 1. 5, while the NO 3 - concentration has remained constant. On average, NSS-SO 4 2 - accounted for 30 - 52 % of the total SO 4 2 - <b>during</b> the two <b>cruises.</b> Chloride deficit was observed in all samples, with NSS-SO 4 2 - being the preferred species for acid displacement over the South Pacific and the Mediterranean Sea.
