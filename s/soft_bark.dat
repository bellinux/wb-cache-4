5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the <b>soft</b> <b>bark</b> of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its <b>soft</b> <b>bark.</b> Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|Widespread across western, {{northern}} and eastern Australia, the brown honeyeater occupies {{a range of}} habitats from mangroves to eucalypt woodlands. It is seasonally nomadic within its local area, following flowering food plants. While it usually forages alone, it also feeds in small groups, or flocks of mixed honeyeater species. Nectar and insects form its diet. It occupies the same breeding territory each year, and lays two or three eggs in a cup-shaped nest woven from grass and <b>soft</b> <b>bark.</b> Both sexes contribute to nest building and feeding the young. It has a loud, clear, musical song, described as {{the best of all}} the honeyeaters.|$|E

50|$|With dire timing, the Vision 1's course {{proceeds}} {{to travel to}} the moon, leaving the puppies in awe. The ship touches down, and they explore the area of landing. Operators at Mission Control find the helmets of spacesuits sending back <b>soft</b> <b>barking,</b> giving awareness that these puppies are roaming around. The revelation is announced on news networks, which concerns the buddies' owners as they notice their absence. Meanwhile, a ferret named Gravity (Amy Sedaris) contacts the buddies on the moon through audio at Mission Control (with no indication of her species), and instructs their return to the spacecraft.|$|R
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky <b>soft</b> <b>bark</b> is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
25|$|Vocalizations are variable, {{and some}} are listed as follows: (1) ua - a <b>soft</b> <b>bark</b> given {{repeatedly}} and used by {{all members of the}} group when danger is perceived; (2) ya - excited animals around the alpha, towards alpha and towards perceived danger; (3) eh-eh - threat towards potential danger, but especially adult females; accompanied with open mouth showing teeth (OMT); (4) squeaky hinge - threat given especially by young animals; (5) squeal - conflict within the group during a fight; (6) whistle - conflict in the group of a young animal; (7) ahr - a lost animal; others answer this call, apparently to direct it back to the group; (8) uh!uh!uh! - a common vocalization during feeding which may allow contact to be maintained and show general contentment; (9) uch!uch! - an animal {{trying to keep up with}} the group; (10) warble - young animals establishing contact or coming close to an adult; (11) purr - close and pacific contact; (12) chirriar - pacific interaction of young ones during play.|$|E

50|$|The {{habitat of}} Caldcluvia paniculosa {{includes}} riverine, littoral, tropical, subtropical and warm temperate rainforests. It {{is also found}} in the ecotone of eucalyptus and rainforests. The tree may be identified in the rainforest by the unusually <b>soft</b> corky <b>bark.</b>|$|R
50|$|Related to {{browsing}} is bark peeling. Particularly in forestry this is {{a problem}} as the trees may then get diseased and also die. Even if they do not die the trees may suffer fungal infections that affect the wood value. With the rise in deer population in some places, such as Austria, the search for food means that the bark peeling reaches economically serious levels in some forest concerns. There is a difference in mode over the seasons, with winter bark peeling being more gnawing of the trees due to the trees being frozen to some extent. Summer <b>bark</b> peeling, with <b>softer</b> <b>barks</b> manifests more often as long strips pulled off the trees.|$|R
50|$|A {{medium to}} large sized tree with a buttressed base. Sometimes over 40 metres tall and {{in excess of}} 90 cm wide at the butt. The trunk is {{cylindrical}} with <b>soft</b> corky <b>bark,</b> greyish fawn in colour. The base of the tree is usually buttressed.|$|R
500|$|The {{breeding}} season varies markedly across the brown honeyeater’s range, with breeding recorded in one location {{or another in}} every month of the year. Breeding can occur two or more times a year if conditions are favourable. The nest is built {{in a variety of}} vegetation types, usually in dense foliage in the fork of a horizontal branch, often near water, and rarely more than [...] above ground. The nest is a small, deep, round cup, woven from small pieces of grass and <b>soft</b> <b>bark,</b> especially Melaleuca bark, bound with spider web and lined with plant down, such as from Banksias, or cow hair or wool. Both sexes contribute to the nest building, though the male also stands guard while the female is building the nest.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} I {{was awakened by}} the sonorous voice of my {{companion}} ringing in my ears and bidding me rise. I crawled out from our heap of leaves, and was astonished at the change which a good night’s rest had wrought in his appearance. He was as blithe and joyous as a young bird, and was staying the keenness of his morning’s appetite by chewing the <b>soft</b> <b>bark</b> of a delicate branch he held in his hand, and he recommended the like to me, as an admirable antidote against the gnawings of hunger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you worry}} about that," [...] replied Mrs. Whitefoot. [...] "You can get the material, and I'll attend to the rest. Let us waste no time about it. I am anxious to get our home {{finished}} and {{to feel a little}} bit settled. I have already planned just what has got to be done and how we will do it. Now you go look for some nice soft, dry weed stalks and strips of <b>soft</b> <b>bark,</b> and moss and any other soft, tough material that you can find. Just get busy and don't stop to talk." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mud!" [...] cried Chebec scornfully. [...] "Mud! I {{should say}} not! I {{would have you}} understand, Peter, that we are very {{particular}} about what we use in our nest. We use only the finest of rootlets, strips of <b>soft</b> <b>bark,</b> fibers of plants, the brown cotton that grows on ferns, and perhaps a little hair when we can find it. We make a dainty nest, if I do say it, and we fasten it securely in the fork made by two or three upright little branches. Now I must go because Mrs. Chebec is getting impatient. Come see me when I'm not so busy Peter." ...|$|E
60|$|The Raven had {{no sooner}} made his {{unsuccessful}} and puerile effort, {{than he was}} succeeded by le Daim-Mose, or the Moose; a middle aged warrior who was particularly skilful {{in the use of}} the tomahawk, and from whose attempt the spectators confidently looked for gratification. This man had none of the good nature of the Raven, but he would gladly have sacrificed the captive to his hatred of the pale-faces generally, were it not for the greater interest he felt in his own success as one particularly skilled in the use of this weapon. He took his stand quietly, but with an air of confidence, poised his little axe but a single instant, advanced a foot with a quick motion, and threw. Deerslayer saw the keen instrument whirling towards him, and believed all was over; still, he was not touched. The tomahawk had actually bound the head of the captive to the tree, by carrying before it some of his hair, having buried itself deep beneath the <b>soft</b> <b>bark.</b> A general yell expressed the delight of the spectators, and the Moose felt his heart soften a little towards the prisoner, whose steadiness of nerve alone enabled him to give this evidence of his consummate skill.|$|E
50|$|The larva {{feeds on}} {{the leaves and}} <b>soft</b> <b>bark</b> {{of a wide range}} of trees and other plants (see list below). The species overwinters as a small larva.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people hear}} the barking owl rather than {{see it as}} it has a loud and {{explosive}} voice. The main territorial vocalisation {{is in the form}} of a double 'hoot', similar in pattern to the other Australian hawk owls. It sounds like a double dog bark that so closely resembles a small dog that it is difficult to tell the difference. The barking owl name is derived from these calls. Males 'bark' at a lower pitch than females, particularly when a pair perform the barking calls together. Barking calls can be varied in pitch and intensity depending on the purpose of the call. Loud barks are given as territorial calls and can be used in confrontations between pairs in adjacent territories. Lower pitched <b>softer</b> <b>barks</b> are often used around the nest or roost areas by the male to call the female for a meal.|$|R

50|$|This {{animal is}} {{essentially}} an herbivore, eating leaves, stems, <b>soft</b> <b>bark,</b> fruit, vegetables, fungi and algae. Its behavior is like any other land snail's: it thrives in damp and wet weather: Land Snails. This {{is especially true of}} the ogasawarana yoshiwarana because it lives in a subtropical/tropical environment. Predators of the species include predatory snails, ground beetles, leeches, and parasites.|$|E
5000|$|One or two broods are {{produced}} {{each year and}} adults {{can be seen at}} any time between July and September [...] The larva feeds on a variety of deciduous trees, including apple, beech, birch, elm, hawthorn, hazel and oak as well as several species of Prunus.

50|$|In the wild, snails eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. Terrestrial snails are usually herbivorous, however some species are predatory carnivores or omnivores, including the genus Powelliphanta, which includes the largest carnivorous snails in the world, native to New Zealand. The diet of most land snails can include leaves, stems, <b>soft</b> <b>bark,</b> fruit, vegetables, fungi and algae. Some species can cause damage to agricultural crops and garden plants, and are therefore often regarded as pests.|$|E
50|$|Melaleuca pearsonii, {{commonly}} known as Blackdown bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to Queensland in Australia.

It is a small, spreading but compact shrub with hard <b>bark,</b> <b>soft</b> foliage and profuse spikes of bottlebrush flowers in spring and summer.|$|R
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} garnished with prawns, fish cake, pork ribs, squid, spring onions or chives. Traditionally, small cubes of fried lard are added, {{but this is}} now less common and have been substituted with chicken lard due to health concerns.s it is deemed unhealthy. Certified Halal Hokkien mee uses chicken and consists of no pork or pork lard, allowing it to be enjoyed by the Muslim community. Sambal chilli and lime are also standard toppings for this dish, giving it an extra zing and tanginess. Some stalls also serve the dish on an Opei leaf (<b>soft</b> palm <b>bark),</b> which enhances the fragrance of the dish.|$|R
5000|$|The Salish had an {{abundant}} supply of cedar bark, or SLAH {{and used it}} for many things including clothing. The <b>softer</b> inner <b>bark</b> was used for weaving. It was made softer and pliable by boiling for periods of up to two days. They would then work the strips by bending, twisting and rubbing between their hands which were covered with protective buckskin gloves. Once it was prepared, strips were taken off to use for plaiting or open-work basket weaving. When used for clothing, the bark was first pounded into shreds then combed into small separate fibers. Then it was spun into a fine twine, or cord as required[...]|$|R
