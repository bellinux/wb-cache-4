5|$|Although she {{receives}} a hero's welcome, Katniss is warned by Haymitch {{that she has}} now become a target after defying the Capitol so publicly. Afterward, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that her actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to gain <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her own feelings.|$|E
5|$|Back in La Pointe, Buffalo {{took several}} actions to {{forestall}} and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US government {{for the next two}} years to no avail. They did win considerable <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> whites who learned of the debacle in Sandy Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in the First World War. Serbia's triumph on the {{battlefield}} drew worldwide attention {{to the country and}} won the Serbs <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> both neutral and Allied countries. A number of foreigners flocked to Serbia in late 1914, offering financial, political, humanitarian and military aid. Articles in defence of Serbia became more frequent in the British press. Certain cultural circles in Italy advocated entering the war on the Allied side, citing Serbian and Montenegrin battlefield successes.|$|E

25|$|Villeda Morales had instituted {{progressive}} {{labor laws}} and an agrarian reform policy, which prompted accusations of Communist <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> {{the right wing}} in Honduras and the United States. His intention to expropriate land from United Fruit Company, though never carried out, was a particular source of friction.|$|R
50|$|In July 2005, Jovanović {{published}} a book, Moj sukob sa prošlošću ("My Confrontation with the Past"). He {{came out in}} favor of Kosovo's independence, thus becoming the only notable Serbian political party leader to do so and because of that he gained <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> many Albanians.|$|R
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E

60|$|As {{soon as the}} doctor's {{back was}} turned, Allan left his place at the table, and appealed to his friend, with that irresistible heartiness of manner which had always {{found its way to}} Midwinter's <b>sympathies,</b> <b>from</b> the first day when they met at the Somersetshire inn.|$|R
50|$|Maynwaring {{supported}} the losing Jacobite {{side at the}} Glorious Revolution, and his non-juring uncle, Sir Francis Cholmley, encouraged his Stuart <b>sympathies.</b> <b>From</b> Cheshire he {{came to live with}} his father in Essex Street, Strand, London, to study law. Lord Cholmondeley and the Earl of Burlington introduced him to Lord Somers and other prominent Whigs, and Maynwaring altered his politics.|$|R
5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E
5|$|The verdict, {{which was}} reached in a {{district}} court and {{would need to be}} upheld by a superior court, has received worldwide attention. Various petitions, including one that received 400,000 signatures, were organized to protest Noreen's imprisonment, and Pope Benedict XVI publicly called for the charges against her to be dismissed. She received less <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed. Christian minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti and Muslim politician Salmaan Taseer were both assassinated for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws. Noreen's family went into hiding after receiving death threats, some of which threatened to kill Asia if released from prison.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was {{a growing number of people}} joining the Bábí movement. He also gained <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|The Hollywood {{blacklist}} {{was instituted}} by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 to block screenwriters and other Hollywood professionals who were purported to have Communist <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> obtaining employment. It started by listing 151 entertainment industry professionals and lasted until 1960 {{when it was}} effectively broken by the acknowledgement that blacklisted professionals had been working under assumed names for many years.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Paisley {{by-election}} of January 1920 Haldane {{was in the process of}} shifting his <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from Margot Asquith, whom Haldane thought [...] "tiresome because she is ignorant", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.|$|R

5|$|Sanger {{returned}} to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77. Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.Sanger, Autobiography, pp. 183–189.Engelman, p. 61–62: Sanger also gained <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> the public when her five-year-old daughter died immediately before the trial. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned their attention to other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin, in an {{assassination}} attempt, and {{falls into a}} coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose of}} creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind the scenes to undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
50|$|Just {{like his}} father Thijssen harboured socialistic <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> an early age, {{although}} he only became member of the Sociaal Democratische Arbeiders Partij (SDAP), a social party in the Netherlands, in 1912. From 1933 until 1940 he also was member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands for this party and from 1935 until 1941 member of the Amsterdam city council, also for the SDAP.|$|R
50|$|The SPD {{worried that}} the {{revolution}} would end in a Council (Soviet) Republic, following the Russian example. However, the secret Ebert-Groener pact did not win over the Imperial Officer Corps for the republic. As Ebert's behaviour became increasingly puzzling to the revolutionary workers, the soldiers and their stewards, the SPD leadership lost {{more and more of}} their supporters' confidence, without gaining any <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> the opponents of the revolution on the right.|$|R

25|$|Before {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, some {{southern}} states began to make petitioning for freedom more difficult. Maryland, for example, in 1796 required that county courts serve as the court of original jurisdiction, rather than the General Court of the Western Shore, an appellate court. The county courts clearly would be more favorable to the interests and views of the local planters against whom these suits were often filed. The legislature also banned those with antislavery <b>sympathies</b> <b>from</b> serving on juries in freedom suits. Virginia passed a similar law on jury composition in 1798.|$|R
25|$|Also {{hurting the}} NHLPA {{was the fact}} that its players had very visibly high salaries, which removed much <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> lower-to-middle class fans. It did not help that Jeremy Roenick and several NHLPA {{executives}} had made controversial statements which showed their apparent disdain for owners and fans alike.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{received}} {{the first of}} its foreign loans on 25 August 1854 during the Crimean War. This major foreign loan was followed by those of 1855, 1858 and 1860, which culminated in default and led to the alienation of European <b>sympathy</b> <b>from</b> the Ottoman Empire and indirectly to the later dethronement and death of Abdulmejid's brother Abdülâziz.|$|E
