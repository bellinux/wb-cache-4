In these problems, several researchers have derived the first-order and the second-order achievability rates for general sources using the information spectrum methods. Although these formulas are general, their computation are quite hard. Hence, an attempt to address explicit computation problems of achievable rates is meaningful. In particular, for i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>sources,</b> the second-order achievable rates have earlier been determined simply by using the asymptotic normality.

Similarly, this study is aimed at determining whether the Okposi Brine Lake {{in the study area}} is structurally controlled. The aeromagnetic and Landsat data were subjected to various image and data enhancement and transformation routines. Results of the study revealed lineaments with trend directions in the N-S, NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W directions, with the NE-SW trends been dominant. The presence of a lineament zone around Okposi is believed to be responsible for the formation of the Okposi brine lake.

The burst was detected by the ART-P telescope onboard the Granat observatory on October 20, 1991. The burst time profile exhibits features that clearly point {{to an increase in}} the photospheric radius of the neutron star at the burst onset. This increase is attributable to an expansion of its outer hydrogen-rich atmospheric envelope under radiation pressure. After hydrogen-envelope outflow and photospheric contraction, the radiation flux emerging from deep within the star continued to rise, which several seconds later led to a recurrent, weaker photospheric expansion attributable to the outflow of the outer helium-envelope layers.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Investigations in the Prudhoe Bay {{vicinity}} {{suggest that}} prevailing winds {{from the east}} combined with {{the shape of the}} coastline and a source of calcareous materials in the Sagavanirktok River delta cause distinct patterns of soil reaction and temperature. Areas downwind from the river have basic soil pH values ranging from 7. 1 to 8. 4, whereas wet tundra sites outside the path of loess-laden winds have acidic values ranging from 5. 3 to 7. 0. The winds also affect the local climate by blowing moist cold air and fog further inland {{in the western part of}} the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Air temperatures are correlated with distance to the Ocean measured in the direction of the prevailing wind vector. The temperature differences also influence the depth of the active layer. The differences in pH and temperatures affect the vegetation of the region. The areas with basic soils show relative abundance of calciphiles, whereas areas with lower pH values have acidiphilous plants. Lower temperatures near the coast affect the distribution of many taxa as well as the phenology and stature of the vegetation. R&UMk.
