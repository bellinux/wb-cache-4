Garret Engine {{is a type of}} air {{breathing}} engine. It comes under the category of Turboprop engines of Gas turbine engine. As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A torsion shaft is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. Torsion shaft is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine. This torsion shaft is internally connected with the main power transmission shaft and its other end is coupled to a <b>coupler</b> <b>shaft</b> with engagement of its internal splines to the external splines of <b>coupler</b> <b>shaft.</b> Further this <b>coupler</b> connects to the gearing system and transmits power to the propeller shaft. Due to Continues variable load over internal splines, it is subjected to high rate of wear and tear. This problem can be rectified by Failure Mode Analysis Method, in which heat treatment process of torsion shaft is being carried out. Two test pieces are heat treated separately at different temperatures of 5800 C and 5400 C at variable time durations. Tuffriding which is a Liquid nitriding process is done with this two test pieces and results are analyzed. The hardness of the material is increased to desired values and its life time is also increased which overcomes the problem...|$|R
40|$|Introduction We have {{developed}} a low-cost stopcock valve actuator for radiochemistry automation built using a stepper motor and an Arduino, an open-source single-board microcontroller. The con-troller hardware can be programmed to run by serial communication or via two 5 – 24 V digital lines for simple integration into any automation control system. This valve actuator allows for automated use of a single, disposable stopcock, providing a number of advantages over stopcock manifold systems available on many commercial radiochemistry rigs or over using solenoid valves. This actuator allows for the use {{a wide variety of}} stopcocks, ranging in size, shape and material, giving flexibility to be used in a large variety of applications. Material and Methods The actuated valve consists of two main parts, the actuator and the control electronics. The actuator consists of a stepper motor, an infrared ‘home position’ sensor, a stopcock backplate, and a coupler from the driveshaft to stopcock handle. The stepper motor is a NEMA- 17 size that runs 200 steps/rotation with a 5 mm drive <b>shaft.</b> The <b>coupler</b> is an interchangeable part, custom to each stopcock model, with each part drilled out to fit the motor drive shaft and milled out for a tight fit to the stopcock handle. The backplane consists of a plate offset from the motor body with 5 screws positioned to keep the stopcock body from rotating relative to the motor. A reflective optical sensor (Vishay TCRT 1000) is used as a limit switch to determine a ‘home’ position for the stopcock. With a slight modification to most any stopcock in cutting off a tab that limits rotation, the handle can rotate 360 °. This allows for opening all three ports to each other, which has been done to all stopcocks used with this actuator. The control electronics consist of an Arduino Uno board and a motor shield (add-on board), connecting to the actuator by an Ethernet cable. The motor shield functions to interface the low-power Arduino circuitry with a high power H-bridge motor driver circuit. The Arduino runs two sets of code, initialization and its loop. The initialization routine runs when power is first powered up, and then continues to run the loop. The initialization routine rotates the valve until the IR limit switch is activated, and rotates an-other 45 ° from position home, sealing off all ports on the stopcock. Following initialization, the Arduino enters its loop, which repeatedly compares its current position to its target posi-tion. When the target position and current posi-tion do not match, the stepper motor turns in the shortest direction towards its target position. The hardware can be interfaced by either serial communication or by two 5 – 24 V digital signals defining positions 1 – 4. The wide range of allowed input signal voltages is realized by using an optocoupler that accepts 5 – 24 V inputs but outputs TTL signals compatible with the Arduino’s hardware. Results and Conclusion A photo of the implementation of the actuator is shown in FIGURE 1. It has overall dimensions of 3. 5 × 1. 75 × 2. 5 ”, excluding a mounting bracket. Control electronics are housed in a compact box built for an Arduino, giving the control electron-ics a clean, professional look. Challenges in de-sign included determining a maximum motor speed where the motor would provide enough torque but yet move fast enough to be useful, finding that rotational speed of 6 seconds/full rotation is best...|$|R
