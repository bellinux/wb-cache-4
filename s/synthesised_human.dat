40|$|A human eIF- 2 -alpha cDNA (encoding alpha-subunit of the {{eukaryotic}} initiation factor- 2) {{was expressed}} {{under the control}} of the galactose-regulated GAL 1, 10 promoter, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in order to study the possible interactions of human eIF- 2 -alpha with the yeast protein synthesis apparatus. Isoelectric focusing coupled with Western-blot analysis demonstrated that the human eIF- 2 -alpha subunit synthesized in yeast under a variety of growth conditions was detected as two bands which co-migrated with the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of rabbit eIF- 2 -alpha, suggesting covalent modification in vivo. Cell fractionation studies further demonstrated that the <b>synthesised</b> <b>human</b> eIF- 2 -alpha protein, though present in the cytoplasm, was largely associated with the yeast ribosomes, but could be removed from these by washing with 0. 3 M KCl. This possible association of the <b>synthesised</b> <b>human</b> subunit into a three-subunit (alpha, beta and gamma) eIF- 2 complex was further examined by partial purification of the yeast eIF- 2 complex and estimation of the molecular mass of this complex. Immunoreactive eIF- 2 -alpha was found in fractions with eIF- 2 activity and the estimated molecular mass (130 kDa) corresponded to that predicted for the eIF- 2 trimer. These analyses suggest that human eIF- 2 -alpha subunit synthesised in yeast can become involved with the yeast protein synthetic apparatus, though whether this is a functional incorporation requires further genetic studies...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionArthritis {{induced by}} {{immunisation}} with glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase (GPI) in DBA/ 1 mice was {{proven to be}} T helper (Th) 17 dependent. We undertook this study to identify GPI-specific T cell epitopes in DBA/ 1 mice (H- 2 q) and investigate the mechanisms of arthritis generation. MethodsFor epitope mapping, the binding motif of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (I-Aq) from DBA/ 1 mice was identified from the amino acid sequence of T cell epitopes and candidate peptides of T cell epitopes in GPI-induced arthritis were <b>synthesised.</b> <b>Human</b> GPI-primed CD 4 + T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were co-cultured with each synthetic peptide and the cytokine production was measured by ELISA to identify the major epitopes. Synthetic peptides were immunised in DBA/ 1 mice to investigate whether arthritis could be induced by peptides. After immunisation with the major epitope, anti-interleukin (IL) 17 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was injected to monitor arthritis score. To investigate the mechanisms of arthritis induced by a major epitope, cross-reactivity to mouse GPI peptide was analysed by flow cytometry and anti-GPI antibodies were measured by ELISA. Deposition of anti-GPI antibodies on the cartilage surface was detected by immunohistology. ResultsWe selected 32 types of peptides as core sequences from the human GPI 558 amino acid sequence, which binds the binding motif, and synthesised 25 kinds of 20 -mer peptides for screening, each containing the core sequence at its centre. By epitope mapping, human GPI 325 – 339 was found to induce interferon (IFN) γ and IL- 17 production most prominently. Immunisation with human GPI 325 – 339 could induce polyarthritis similar to arthritis induced by human GPI protein, and administration of anti-IL- 17 mAb significantly ameliorated arthritis (p < 0. 01). Th 17 cells primed with human GPI 325 – 339 cross-reacted with mouse GPI 325 – 339, and led B cells to produce anti-mouse GPI antibodies, which were deposited on cartilage surface. ConclusionsHuman GPI 325 – 339 {{was identified as a}} major epitope in GPI-induced arthritis, and proved to have the potential to induce polyarthritis. Understanding the pathological mechanism of arthritis induced by an immune reaction to a single short peptide could help elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) {{isolated}} from aborted first trimester fetal bone marrow (BM) hold promise {{for use in}} tissue engineering applications and cell-based therapies due to their advantageous characteristics compared to their adult BM-MSC counterparts; faster growth kinetics, active telomerase, smaller size and higher differentiation potency. However, their isolation is restricted ethically and technically and therefore {{there is a need}} to identify a cell source with high therapeutic potential that is easily accessible in the clinic without ethical restrictions. The placenta is a potential source of readily-obtainable chorionic stem cells (CSC) throughout pregnancy. The aim of my thesis was to study the evolution of the CSC phenotype (i. e. change of stem cell characteristics) during gestation and to assess their capacity for bone repair in a mouse model of osteogenesis imperfecta (oim). I hypothesised that early fetal placental chorionic stem cells (e-CSC) were physiologically superior to their term counterparts, late chorionic stem cells (l-CSC), with advantages for use in fetal stem cell therapy of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). In the first chapter I showed that e-CSC and l-CSC shared a common phenotype, which was intermediate between adult BM-MSC and human embryonic stem cells, with characteristics of both. I also showed the phenotype of CSC evolves during gestation with e-CSC displaying characteristics of an earlier state of stemness compared to l-CSC, such as smaller size, faster kinetics, unique expression of OCT 4 A variant 1 and higher levels of Nanog, Sox 2, c-Myc and Klf 4 expression, as well as the capacity to differentiate into lineages of the three germ layers through embryoid body formation. In the second chapter I showed the more primitive in vitro characteristics of e-CSC translated to higher tissue repair in vivo compared to l-CSC; accelerating healing when applied to a skin wound and increasing bone quality and plasticity following neonatal transplantation into the oim model. I subsequently used the oim model to assess the therapeutic potential of e-CSC for use in fetal cell therapy for OI. I showed compared to non-transplanted mice, oim transplanted with e-CSC had a two third reduction in fracture incidence, more ductile bones and increased trabecular bone volume. Prevention of fractures was attributed to the differentiation of exogenous cells to osteoblasts that expressed mature osteoblast genes and <b>synthesised</b> <b>human</b> type 1 collagen (COL 1 A 2). However, this beneficial effect may also have resulted from an indirect effect of the transplanted cells on the endogenous cells of the host mouse, since transplanted mice had upregulation of endogenous genes involved in endochondral ossification and osteoblast differentiation. Altogether, my thesis characterises early and late human fetal chorionic stem cells, providing insight into the ontogenesis of stemness phenotype during fetal development and shows the first trimester placenta is a practical source of stem cells that can be used to treat OI during bone development.

In this paper, {{we present a}} highly portable, non-intrusive approach for <b>synthesising</b> <b>human</b> athlete motion in competitive game-play with lightweight instru- mentation of both the athlete and field of play. Our data-driven puppetry technique relies on a pre-captured database of short segments of motion capture data to construct a motion graph augmented with interpolated mo- tions and speed variations. An athlete’s performed motion is synthesised by finding a related action sequence through the motion graph using a sparse set of measurements from the performance, acquired from both worn inertial and global location sensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a challenging application scenario, with a high-performance tennis athlete wearing one or more lightweight body-worn accelerometers and a single overhead camera providing the athlete’s global position and orientation data. However, the approach is flexible in both the number and variety of input sensor data used. The technique can also be adopted for searching a motion graph efficiently in linear time in alternative applications...|$|R

The introductory chapter of this thesis outlines the literature related to the nitro-Mannich reaction, describing the different existing methodologies for performing the reaction in diastereo- and enantioselective manner. The synthetic applications of the reaction are also described, especially its uses in the synthesis of biologically active natural products. Moreover, the syntheses and uses of two classes of compounds, pyrrolidin- 2 -ones and piperazin- 2 -ones are briefly discussed. The results and discussion chapter starts by presenting the use of a one-pot conjugate addition/nitro-Mannich/lactamisation reaction in the synthesis of densely functionalised pyrrolidin- 2 -ones. The development of an asymmetric protocol, as well as some functionalisations of the pyrrolidinone core are also described. Our efforts to <b>synthesise</b> <b>human</b> neutrophil elastase inhibitor GW 311616 A using the developed methodology are then detailed. The next part of the results and discussion chapter portrays the development of a conjugate addition/nitro-Mannich reaction of non-zinc nucleophiles to ethyl 3 -nitroacrylate and β-nitrostyrene. The scope and limitations of the reaction were investigated using a variety of different nucleophiles including amines, thiols, phosphines, alcohols, enolates and nitriles. Finally, our work towards synthesising the biologically active piperazin- 2 -one piperazirum, using the nitro-Mannich methodology is described. The diastereoselective synthesis and characterisation of a densely functionalised piperazin- 2 -one was accomplished. A detailed description of the experimental details and analytical data for all novel compounds is described in the experimental section.

The specificity and pharmacokinetics properties of monoclonal antibodies to coagulation factors allow novel anticoagulation approaches.

Such antibodies were developed against three coagulation factor: Tissue factor (TF), Factor IX (FIX) and Factor VIII (FVIII). A fully humanized antibody was successfully derived from a mouse monoclonal antibodies to TF. In vivo studies with monoclonal antibodies to TF demonstrated efficient antithrombotic activity. Anti-TF antibodies may also prove useful in cardiovascular disorders and cancer, given the role of TF in these diseases. Mouse and human monoclonal antibodies to FIX were also efficient to prevent thrombosis in animal models of venous and arterial thrombosis and in stroke. A humanized anti-FIX antibody was tested in phase I study in healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of the antibody were determined by the rapid formation of stable complexes with newly <b>synthesised</b> FIX. <b>Human</b> anti-FVIII antibodies inhibiting only partially FVIII activity were recently described. Investigations in mice have established that treatment with such anti-FVIII antibodies is efficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} strengths, weaknesses, {{opportunities and}} threats of the metabolic ability to split water {{brought about a}} proliferation of biological systems, produced a toxic oxygenic environment, and {{were responsible for the}} development of antioxidant defence mechanisms. Evolution is driven by heritable adaptations which improve environmental 'fit'. Hence aerobic respiration, using oxygen as a nutrient, came to predominate in biological systems, and antioxidant defence mechanisms which prevent and neutralise toxic oxygen intermediates have become widespread, varied, coordinated and effective. Antioxidant defences are not infallible however. In humans, reactive oxygen species-induced damage is associated with the ageing process, and with chronic diseases including cancer and coronary heart disease. Interestingly, some important antioxidants, including ascorbic acid and the tocopherols, cannot be <b>synthesised</b> by <b>humans</b> and must be taken in the diet. Another antioxidant, uric acid, is found in much higher concentrations in humans than in other mammals, and levels are also affected by diet. In humans, therefore, antioxidant defence against toxic oxygen intermediates is species specific and heavily influenced by nutrition. In this article, the atmospheric and metabolic changes which produced both the threat and opportunity offered by an oxygenic environment are outlined. An overview of oxygen toxicity, and adaptations to oxidative stress in terms of evolution of antioxidant defences, is presented. Finally, suggested benefits underlying our curious inability to manufacture ascorbic acid, and the possible role of uric acid in human antioxidant defence, are briefly discussed with particular reference to nutrition and toxicology.

The methods rely on applying robust object descriptions, dynamic learning models after appropriate motion segmentation, and {{machine learning}}-based frameworks. Image-based human image synthesis using machine learning is a research focus that has recently gained considerable attention in the field of computer graphics.

The image-based rendering method employed in this study enables contour synthesis for the prediction of small numbers of input source images. This procedure avoids the use of complex models and geometry information.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how serum factors, might modulate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin- 1 b on PAI- 2 production by human gingival fibroblasts. Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts were exposed to LPS derived from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli and a commercial source of interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b). The expression of PAI- 2 and its mRNA was monitored by Western blotting, RT-PCR, and Northern blotting. Results: The results showed that the distribution of PAI- 2 <b>synthesised</b> by <b>human</b> gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was mostly as an intracellular protein (47 kDa). The presence of serum in the culture media was absolutely necessary for both the secretion of PAI- 2 and for the effect of the inflammatory mediators (LPS and IL- 1 b). A pattern of PAI- 2 response in HGF after LPS stimulation was detected with a quick up-regulation of the PAI- 2 mRNA, which was down regulated when extracellular PAI- 2 (60 kDa mass) levels reached plateau levels. The synthesis of PAI- 2 by HGF, in terms of mRNA expression and protein synthesis, was more sensitive to stimulation with lower concentrations of LPS (10 ng/ml) than with higher LPS concentrations.

The mechanism by which AA sustains pre-osteoblast proliferation and commitment is mediated through the synthesis of collagen type I, interaction with alpha 2 - and beta 1 -integrin, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and phosphorylation of osteoblast-specific transcription factors. However, the multifunctional role of AA is not fully elucidated. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 mouse calvaria-derived cell line is a well-defined in vitro model of pre-osteoblast differentiation, and AA is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1. By using DNA micro-arrays containing 15, 000 genes, we identified several genes in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cultured with AA for 24 h whose expression was significantly up or downregulated. The differentially expressed genes covered a broad range of functional activities: (1) cell growth; (2) metabolism; (3) morphogenesis; (4) cell death; (5) cell communication. The data reported are, to our knowledge, the first genetic portrait of early stage stimulation of pre-osteoblasts by AA, and may be relevant to better understand the molecular mechanism of pre-osteoblast proliferation and commitment. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism has important clinical implications because it may facilitate the correct use of AA to accelerate bone regeneration...|$|R

The expression of PAI- 2 can be modulated by various inflammatory stimulants and mediators. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how serum factors, might modulate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin- 1 beta on PAI- 2 production by human gingival fibroblasts. METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts were exposed to LPS derived from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli and a commercial source of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta). The expression of PAI- 2 and its mRNA was monitored by Western blotting, RT-PCR, and Northern blotting. RESULTS: The results showed that the distribution of PAI- 2 <b>synthesised</b> by <b>human</b> gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was mostly as an intracellular protein (47 kDa). The presence of serum in the culture media was absolutely necessary for both the secretion of PAI- 2 and for the effect of the inflammatory mediators (LPS and IL- 1 beta). A pattern of PAI- 2 response in HGF after LPS stimulation was detected with a quick up-regulation of the PAI- 2 mRNA, which was down regulated when extracellular PAI- 2 (60 kDa mass) levels reached plateau levels. The synthesis of PAI- 2 by HGF, in terms of mRNA expression and protein synthesis, was more sensitive to stimulation with lower concentrations of LPS (10 ng/ml) than with higher LPS concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: PAI- 2 is a serum dependent molecule with major cytosolic localisation in HGF. Its cellular accumulation and secretion can be modulated by bacterial LPS and IL- 1 beta through serum factors. Y. Xiao and P. M. Bartol...|$|R

Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. [...] Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be <b>synthesised</b> by the <b>human</b> body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the potential association of proteoglycans with intact fibrillin-containing microfibrils from foetal bovine elastic tissues and with newly <b>synthesised</b> fibrillin in <b>human</b> and bovine cell cultures. Microfbril integrity was disrupted by chondroitinase ABC lyase and chondroitinase AC lyase, but not by keratanase or hyaluronidase. Following chondroitinase treatment, beads were disrupted but the underlying fibrillar scaffold appeared intact. Cuprolinic blue was prominently associated with beaded domains at a critical electrolyte concentration. Electron-dense rods were often associated with cuprolinic blue-treated microfbrils isolated from fixed tissues. Positive staining revealed charged foci at the beads. Newly synthesised fibrillin could be labelled with 35 S TransLabel, [3 H]glucosamine or 35 SO 4 but its electrophoretic mobility was not influenced by treatment with chondroitinase ABC or AC lyase. A diffuse 35 SO 4 -labelled chondroitinase-sensitive component with a resistant band (Mr 35000) co-immunoprecipitated with fibrillin. These experiments indicate that chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans associate with fibrillin and contribute to microfibril assembly. This association has major implications for microfibril function in health and disease...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial porin or VDAC (voltage-dependent anion-selective channel) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane. The structure of VDAC has been predicted to be a transmembrane b-barrel with an a-helix at the N terminus. It {{is a matter of}} debate as to whether this putative a-helix plays a structural role as a component of the pore walls or a function in the pore activity. We have <b>synthesised</b> the <b>human</b> VDAC 1 (HVDAC 1) N-terminal peptide Ac-AVPPTYADLGKSARDVFTK-NH 2 (Prn 2 – 20) and determined its structure by CD and NMR spectroscopy. CD studies show that the Prn 2 – 20 peptide exists in aqueous solvent as an unstructured peptide with no stable secondary structure. In membrane-mimetic SDS micelles or water/trifluoro-ACHTUNGTRENUNGethanol, however, it assumes an amphipathic a-helix conformation between Tyr 5 and Val 16, as deduced from NMR. No ordered structure was observed in dodecyl b-maltoside. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements were carried out in order to examine the membrane affinity of the peptide. Upon interaction with the negatively charged 1, 2 dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoserine membrane, Prn 2 – 20 exhibited distinctive behaviour, suggesting that electrostatics play an important role. Interaction between the peptide and artificial bilayers indicates that the peptide lies on the membrane surface. Recombinant HVDAC 1 deletion mutants, devoid of seven or 19 N-terminal amino acids, were used for transfection of eukaryotic cells. Over-expression of HVDAC 1 increases the number of Cos cells with depolarised mitochondria, and this effect is progressively reduced in cells transfected with HVDAC 1 lacking those seven or 19 amino acids. The mitochondrial targeting of the deletion mutants is unaffected. The overall picture emerging from our experiments is that the VDAC N-terminal peptide plays a role in the proper function of this protein during apoptotic events...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derived Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for niacin. Niacin is a generic term for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. Niacin can be <b>synthesised</b> in the <b>human</b> body from the {{indispensable}} amino acid tryptophan. Approximately 60 mg of tryptophan yields 1 mg of niacin defined as 1 mg niacin equivalent (NE). Long-term inadequate intake of tryptophan and niacin {{can lead to the}} development of pellagra. In the absence of new scientific data, the Panel endorses the Average Requirement (AR) for adults of 1. 3 mg NE/MJ (5. 5 mg NE/ 1 000 kcal) adopted by the Scientific Committee for Food (1993), based on data on urinary excretion of niacin metabolites as an endpoint. The Population Reference Intake (PRI) of 1. 6 mg NE/MJ (6. 6 mg NE/ 1 000 kcal) is derived from the AR assuming a coefficient of variation of 10 %. For infants aged 7 - 11 months, children and adolescents, as well as for pregnant and lactating women, the Panel considers that {{there is no evidence that}} the relationship between niacin requirement and energy requirement differs from that o...|$|R

A group of individuals aged over 65 years old was selected. It included 64 asthmatic patients (72 +/- 5 years) and 41 healthy individuals (79 +/- 7 years). Blood cell counts showed statistically different median values of eosinophils (5. 42 +/- 4. 7 vs 2. 8 +/- 2. 8;p<. 04), IgE (493. 2 +/- 549. 8 vs 85. 3 +/- 194.

40|$|BACKGROUND Kidney {{function}} is accurately assessed by Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). GFR is estimated with various biomarkers like inulin, creatinine and Cystatin C. Inulin is not <b>synthesised</b> in the <b>human</b> body. Creatinine is a variable parameter. But, Cystatin C is removed completely {{from the blood}} stream by glomerular filtration. Hence, Cystatin C level in the blood {{can be used to}} estimate GFR. MATERIALS AND METHODS One study group of 50 patients with renal failure and another control group of 50 normal persons were selected for Cystatin C estimation. Cystatin C was measured in a random sample of serum of both control group and study group by using Quantitative Cystatin C immunoturbidimetric assay. Mean values of Cystatin C were statistically analysed by using “t” test. GFR from Cystatin C value was measured by using a prediction equation. RESULTS Cystatin C levels in blood were significantly increased in patients of renal failure. GFR was estimated by Cystatin C levels. The elevated Cystatin C level was correlated with estimated GFR. CONCLUSION Cystatin C level in patients of kidneys dysfunction was statistically elevated. Similarly, the GFR estimated using serum Cystatin C was also statistically elevated. Hence, Cystatin C was a good biological marker to assess kidneys dysfunction...|$|R
