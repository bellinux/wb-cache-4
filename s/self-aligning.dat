2500|$|Slate's Jacob Weisberg found 114 {{motorcycles}} in {{the catalog}} to be too many, and too boring for the non-motorcycle aficionado. [...] In contrast to critics like Zakaria, Perl, and Hilton Kramer, who want museums to challenge and educate the public with difficult art like abstract expressionism, which might require a little homework to learn to like, Weisberg complained that the information accompanying the motorcycle exhibits was too technical and bewildering to the non-gearhead, with talk of <b>self-aligning</b> bearings, compression ratios and near-hemispherical combustion chambers. [...] That is, he wrote, [...] "the approach is design-technical rather than design-aesthetic or design-cultural," [...] and thus it {{failed to make the}} case that industrial design is more than just the [...] "stepchild of fine art" [...] and that [...] "the cross-fertilization of high and pop is an important part of the story of artistic modernism." ...|$|E

Ludwig, Sr., and his brother, Theobald Ludwig, {{founded the}} Ludwig & Ludwig Co. in 1909 and {{patented}} the first commercially successful bass drum pedal system, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. It was the golden age of drum building for many famous drum companies, with Ludwig introducing...

Wire brushes for use with drums and cymbals were introduced in 1912. The need for brushes arose due to the problem of the drum sound overshadowing the other instruments on stage. Drummers began using metal fly swatters to reduce the volume on stage next to the other acoustic instruments. Drummers could still play the rudimentary snare figures and grooves with brushes they would normally play with drumsticks. As brushes gained popularity, ...|$|E

2500|$|The Airacobra {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{production}} fighters to be conceived as a [...] "weapons system"; in this case the aircraft (known originally as the Bell Model 4) was designed to provide a platform for the 37mm T9 cannon. This weapon, which was designed in 1934 by the American Armament Corporation, a division of Oldsmobile, fired a 1.3lb (610g) projectile capable of piercing [...]8in (2cm) of armor at 500yd (450m) with armor-piercing rounds. The 200lb, 90-inch-long weapon had to be rigidly mounted and fire parallel to and close to the centerline of the new fighter. It would be impossible to mount the weapon in the fuselage, firing through the cylinder banks of the Vee-configured engine and the propeller hub as could be done with smaller 20mm cannon. Weight, balance and visibility problems meant that the cockpit could not be placed farther back in the fuselage, behind the engine and cannon. The solution adopted was to mount the cannon in the forward fuselage and the engine in the center fuselage, directly behind the pilot's seat. The tractor propeller was driven via a [...] drive shaft made in two sections, incorporating a <b>self-aligning</b> bearing to accommodate fuselage deflection during violent maneuvers. This shaft ran through a tunnel in the cockpit floor and was connected to a gearbox in the nose of the fuselage which, in turn, drove the three- or (later) four-bladed propeller via a short central shaft. The gearbox was provided with its own lubrication system, separate from the engine; in later versions of the Airacobra the gearbox was provided with some armor protection. The glycol-cooled radiator was fitted in the wing center section, immediately beneath the engine; this was flanked on either side by a single drum shaped oil cooler. Air for the radiator and oil coolers was drawn in through intakes in both wing-root leading edges and was directed via four ducts to the radiator faces. The air was then exhausted through three controllable hinged flaps near the trailing edge of the center section. Air for the carburetor was drawn in via a raised oval intake immediately aft of the rear canopy.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using <b>self-aligning</b> spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} {{the formation of}} unique rod-like microstructures by self-assembling of random mica platelets with a high aspect-ratio and counterion charged. The platelets are polydisperse with dimensions of 300 - 1000 nm in width and I nm in thickness and are prepared from the exfoliation of layered synthetic-fluorinated-mica. These platelets of polygon shape are characterized by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. When finely dispersed in water followed by controlled evaporation, the randomized silicate platelets <b>self-align</b> into a rod-like morphology. The restructuring force is attributed-to the intensive attraction of surface charges on high aspect-ratio platelets. The resulting thin platelets tend to <b>self-align</b> in a size-selective manner through face-to-face piling into rod-like microstructures of 3 - 20 mu m in length and 300 - 1000 nm in diameter (observed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy).

40|$|As the {{technology}} nodes scale down to 22 nm and beyond, Double Patterning Lithography (DPL) {{has been considered}} as a practical solution for manufacturing process. Compared with Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch (LELE), <b>Self-Aligned</b> Double Patterning (SADP) has better overlay tolerance. Two types of SADP pro-cess are popularly used for the state-of-the-art lithography pat-terning: Spacer-Is-Dielectric (SID) and Spacer-Is-Metal (SIM).
