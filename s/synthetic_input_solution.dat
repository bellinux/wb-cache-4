40|$|Reliable {{measurements}} {{are needed for}} the verification measures of States’ declarations of their nuclear activities in line with international agreements and the EURATOM Treaty. Laboratories carrying out measurements of nuclear material need to follow stringent quality control concepts and are required to demonstrate their measurement capabilities on a regular and timely basis to legal and Safeguards authorities. This includes participation in interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs). In {{the frame of the}} Regular European Interlaboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP) a new ILC (REIMEP- 17) was jointly organized by the EC-Joint Research Centre-Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM) and EC-Joint Research Centre-Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU) for EURATOM and IAEA safeguards laboratories, nuclear plant operators and nuclear material laboratories. The focus in REIMEP- 17 was on measurements of the uranium and plutonium amount contents, and isotope amount ratios in <b>synthetic</b> <b>input</b> <b>solutions.</b> Participants received two test samples, REIMEP- 17 A and REIMEP 17 B, with different uranium and plutonium amount contents. Laboratories were requested to report the results with associated uncertainties applying their standard measurement procedures, and had the possibility to benchmark those results against the independent assigned (reference) values and the International Target Values for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITV 2010). It can be concluded that the participants in REIMEP- 17 performed well for the measurements of uranium and plutonium amount content in compliance with the respective ITV 2010. In particular, the measurement performance for the isotope amount ratios was very satisfactory for both REIMEP- 17 test samples. This confirms the measurement capabilities of laboratories in the field of nuclear material analysis and demonstrates that the stringent ITV 2010 are achievable target values under state-of-practice conditions. On the other hand, the spread of results for the minor uranium isotope amount ratios was larger. Moreover, for some of the measurands, differences in the measurement uncertainty estimations provided by laboratories were observed even when using the same instrumental technique. A summary of the participant results is presented and discussed in this paper. JRC. D. 4 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|R

Two techniques based of space data acquisition and processing are considered in this article, namely, GPS and SAR interferometry. The principles of these techniques and their differences are presented. The possibility of combining different measurement techniques is discussed, in general and in the particular case of GPS and InSAR. The different multi-technique combination strategies are divided into low level approaches (in which two output measurement networks are merged) and high level approaches (in which the raw measurements are used to obtain a unique multi-technique estimation of the displacement). Among the high level combination possibilities, we address the correction of the InSAR phase from the atmospheric delay using GPS measurements. A feasibility study and a simulation-based experiment are proposed. This tool integrates both real and <b>synthetic</b> <b>input</b> data. The real input data are a pair of satellite radar images, a geometric registration model and a digital elevation model of the area.

To fully leverage in-silico models in future research, these models need to be adapted to reflect pathologies, genetic alterations, or pharmacological effects, however. A common approach is to leave the structure of established models unaltered and estimate the values {{of a set of}} parameters. Today's high-throughput patch clamp data acquisition methods require robust, unsupervised algorithms that estimate parameters both accurate and reliably. In this work, two classes of optimization approaches are evaluated: gradient-based trust-region reflective and derivative-free particle swarm algorithms. Using <b>synthetic</b> <b>input</b> data and different ion current formulations from the Courtemanche et al. electrophysiological model of human atrial myocytes, we show that none of the two schemes alone succeeds to meet all requirements. Sequential combination of the two algorithms did improve the performance to some extent but not satisfactorily. Thus, we propose a novel hybrid approach coupling the two algorithms in each iteration. This hybrid approach yielded very accurate estimates with minimal dependency on the initial guess using <b>synthetic</b> <b>input</b> data for which a ground truth parameter set exists. When applied to measured data, the hybrid approach yielded the best fit, again with minimal variation. Using the proposed algorithm, a single run is sufficient to estimate the parameters. The degree of superiority over the other investigated algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness depended on the type of current. In contrast to the non-hybrid approaches, the proposed method proved to be optimal for data of arbitrary signal to noise ratio. The hybrid algorithm proposed in this work provides an important tool to integrate experimental data into computational models both accurately and robustly allowing to assess the often non-intuitive consequences of ion channel-level changes on higher levels of integration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Designing a {{high-performance}} controller for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a challenging task. There are often numerous requirements, sometimes contradicting, such as speed, precision, robustness, and energy-efficiency.

The proposed learning approach is based on adaptive oscillators that are able to learn online the frequency, amplitude and phase of zero-mean periodic signals. Such signals occur naturally in open water due to waves, currents, and gravity, but can also be caused by the dynamics and hydrodynamics of the AUV itself.
