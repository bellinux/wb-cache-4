5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|After high school, Barbette {{began his}} circus career as {{one-half}} of the aerialist team The Alfaretta Sisters. One of the sisters had died unexpectedly and Barbette answered the surviving sister's ad for a replacement, auditioning in San Antonio. Together the pair {{decided that it was}} more dramatic for a woman to perform the acrobatic stunts. [...] "She told me that women's clothes always make a wire act more impressive...and <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I'd mind dressing as a girl. I didn't; and that's how it began." [...] Following his time as an Alfaretta, Barbette next joined an act called Erford's Whirling Sensation. This act included three people who hung from a spinning apparatus by their teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Harz, [...] "is in the future. I couldn't tell you." [...] And he thought: 'Will <b>she</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I get my tints in Paris, {{like the}} woman Tramper told me of?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't exactly my trouble, Uncle Barney. It's {{somebody}} else's," [...] went on {{the oldest}} Rover boy. [...] "A young lady I know is very much worried over something, and <b>she</b> has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I can't {{do something to help}} her get rid of that worry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>she</b> merely <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I {{thought you}} 'd be mortally offended, if she {{offered to take}} it off your hands, as you 'd never worn it. You don't like it, and in another season it will be all out of fashion," [...] said Polly from her verdant retreat.|$|R
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

I {{actually}} had arranged a meeting, just because I was so infatuated {{with her and}} I wanted to meet {{the person who had}} produced all this music. We got along, and we were kind of friendly, and actually, after I met her the first time, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I wanted to be her band leader. But the Nazz had just signed a record contract and I couldn't skip out on the band, even though it was incredibly tempting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{talked a}} great deal about him, {{especially}} Anne Cox. I do not know what she meant, but <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I thought I should go and stay there again next summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew what}} she wanted to say to me: that's why I was {{determined}} to get her off. I knew I shouldn't like it, but I was perfectly prepared," [...] said Owen. [...] "She brought it out as soon as we got round the corner; <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> point-blank <b>if</b> I was in love with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we doesn't want nothink," [...] {{repeated}} the domestic, stoutly. [...] "Missus said so, an' <b>she</b> bid <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>if</b> you'd like {{a cup of}} tea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. Probably {{she will}} be too proud at first. But I shall come, whether <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> or not. <b>If</b> they had {{relations}} or connections, as everybody else has, it would be different. But as it is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was {{disturbed}} and declared she must {{get off the}} train. I think she meant to jump off, although we were going fast. Then <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> the conductor could be bribed to stop." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. March did {{not join}} me in the humorous view of the affair which I took. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had heard {{anything}} from Glendenning lately; {{if that were the}} reason why I mentioned him.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{came and}} spoke to me when I was out a little while ago, and said you knew her, miss. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I wasn't the young lady's little maid--meaning you for the young lady, miss--and I said yes, miss." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR PETER, Where is Ogden? We {{have been}} expecting him every day. Mrs Ford is {{worrying}} herself to death. <b>She</b> keeps <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I have any news, {{and it is}} very tiresome to have to keep telling her that I have not heard from you. Surely, with the opportunities you must get every day, you can manage to kidnap him. Do be quick. We are relying on you.--In haste, [...] CYNTHIA.|$|R
3000|$|... for example, {{my roommate}} in my {{senior high school}} was not as poor as I was. His mother often came to visit him on weekdays, and she would give me some old clothes as they always bought new clothes. During festivals, she also invited {{me to go out}} to have dinner or lunch and gave me a lot of food. And <b>she</b> always <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had any {{difficulties}} or not and about my family situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{perhaps the}} butler does {{pronounce}} my name rightly, and perhaps my hostess actually does recognize me. She smiles, {{and says she}} was so afraid I was not coming. She implies that all the other guests are but as a feather in her scales of joy compared with myself. I smile in return, wondering to myself how I look when I do smile. I have never {{had the courage to}} face my own smile in the looking-glass. I notice the Society smile of other men, and it is not reassuring. I murmur something about my not having been likely to forget this evening; in my turn, seeking to imply that I have been looking forward to it for weeks. A few men shine at this sort of thing, but they are a small percentage, and without conceit I regard myself as no bigger a fool than the average male. Not knowing what else to say, I tell her also that it is a warm evening. She smiles archly as though there were some hidden witticism in the remark, and I drift away, feeling ashamed of myself. To talk as an idiot when you ARE an idiot brings no discomfort; to behave as an idiot when you have sufficient sense to know it, is painful. I hide myself in the crowd, and perhaps I'll meet a woman I was introduced to three weeks ago at a picture gallery. We don't know each other's names, but, both of us feeling lonesome, we converse, as it is called. If she be the ordinary type of woman, <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I am going on to the Johnsons'. I tell her no. We stand silent for a moment, both thinking what next to say. <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I was at the Thompsons' the day before yesterday. I again tell her no. I begin to feel dissatisfied with myself that I was not at the Thompsons'. Trying to get even with her, I <b>ask</b> her if <b>she</b> is going to the Browns' next Monday. (There are no Browns, she will have to say, No.) She is not, and her tone suggests that a social stigma rests upon the Browns. I <b>ask</b> her if <b>she</b> has been to Barnum's Circus; she hasn't, but is going. I give her my impressions of Barnum's Circus, which are precisely the impressions of everybody else who has seen the show.|$|R
6000|$|... "D'you {{remember}} Mrs. Pritchard-Wallace? She's in London. I saw {{her at a}} party, and <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I {{knew anything}} about you. She's staying in Half Moon Street, at 201. You'd better go and see her. Good-bye! I must simply bolt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of what Mrs. Saltonstall said this morning. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I {{would like to go}} to Paris with her for the winter. It has always been one of my dreams to go abroad, and I do hope I shall not be disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> this {{narrative}} of yours was a strongly accentuated love-story. Here {{she had me}} at a disadvantage, for I have not heard it; but I assured her that, knowing the scope and purpose of your work, I {{did not believe that}} you would accentuate any portion of it more than was absolutely necessary.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Campbell took us {{all over}} his barns and was very affable. He had {{beautiful}} horses, cows and sheep, and I enjoyed seeing them. I don't think Cecily did, however. She was very quiet and even Mr. Campbell's handsome new span of dappled grays failed to arouse any enthusiasm in her. She was already in bitter anticipation living over the martyrdom of the morrow. On the way home <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> seriously <b>if</b> I thought Mr. Campbell would go to heaven when he died.|$|R
6000|$|The little New Yorker’s {{sometimes}} very amusing; <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> {{every one}} in Boston talks like me—if every one’s as “intellectual” as your poor correspondent. She’s for ever throwing Boston up at me; I can’t {{get rid of}} poor dear little Boston. The other one rubs it into me too, but in a different way; she seems to feel about it as a good Mahommedan feels toward Mecca, and regards it as a focus of light for the whole human race. Yes, poor little Boston, what nonsense is talked in thy name! But this New England maiden is in her way a rare white flower; she’s travelling all over Europe alone—“to see it,” she says, “for herself.” For herself! What can that strangely serene self of hers do with such sights, such depths! She looks at everything, goes everywhere, passes her way with her clear quiet eyes wide open; skirting the edge of obscene abysses without suspecting them; pushing through brambles without tearing her robe; exciting, without knowing it, the most injurious suspicions; and always holding her course—without a stain, without a sense, without a fear, without a charm! ...|$|R
6000|$|Alban {{was unable}} to agree with her. [...] "If Mrs. Rook's {{interest}} in your father was the harmless interest that you have suggested," [...] he said, [...] "why should she have checked herself in that unaccountable manner, when <b>she</b> first <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> he was living? The more I think of it now, the less sure I feel that she knows anything at all of your family history. It may help <b>me</b> to decide, <b>if</b> you will tell me at what time the death of your mother took place." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{we talked}} a little on {{indifferent}} matters, while I pricked my fingers helping to pluck the roses. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I thought that Anscombe was getting on well, {{and how long it}} would be before he could travel. I replied that Dr. Rodd could tell her better than myself, but that I hoped in about a week.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Just so, Seth,' said he, laughing. So {{we agreed}} {{we would be}} the best friends; and <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> ever I went out to San Miguel, to go and see her. She said her father was {{generally}} out, but would be glad to see me if he were in. She lives in a small hacienda, a league this side of the town.|$|E
60|$|Agnes {{laughed again}} {{at her own}} penetration, {{and told me that}} if I were {{faithful}} to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments, with the date, duration, and termination of each, like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens, in the History of England. Then <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had seen Uriah.|$|E
60|$|She {{talked to}} me of the various things which they talk of to the {{stranger}} in Samoa, of the journey, and whether I had slid down the water rock at Papaseea, and if I meant {{to stay in a}} native village. She {{talked to me}} of Scotland, and perhaps I noticed in her a tendency to enlarge on the sumptuousness of her establishment there. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> naïvely <b>if</b> I knew Mrs This and Mrs That, with whom she had been acquainted when she lived in the north.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not want}} to go; I would have been glad to examine every {{building}} on the place, but I knew I must depart; and as I was beginning to express my sense of the kindness with which I had been treated, <b>she</b> interrupted by <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I expected to come back this way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the same}} as I do," [...] replied Florence, calmly. [...] "Have you not noticed that the little girl never comes here without looking wistfully at the opening buds? And don't you remember, the other morning, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> so prettily <b>if</b> I would let her mother come and see it, she was so fond of flowers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Just so, Seth," [...] said he, laughing.

6000|$|... "I {{was down}} to see Jonas' aunt at Newbridge last night," [...] said Mrs. Jonas, [...] "and she said she'd heard that Sara had {{made up her mind}} to take Lige Baxter at last, and that they were to be married in the fall. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> it was true. I said I didn't know, but I hoped to mercy it was. Now, is it, Louisa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{acts like}} a {{suffering}} martyr," [...] exclaimed Mr. Wilks. [...] "She comes over 'ere dropping hints that {{people are talking about}} us, and that they ask 'er awkward questions. Pretending to misunderstand 'er every time is enough to send me crazy; and she's so sudden in what she says there's no being up to 'er.

5000|$|... "Regrets" [...] was Farmer's first duet and was {{scheduled}} {{as the second}} single from the album L'Autre... since the release of [...] "Désenchantée". According to Farmer, the song was [...] "very long to write". The idea of the duet started from an [...] "irregular but faithful" [...] correspondence through letters between both singers for a year. Murat explained: [...] "One day, in the box of letters, I have a letter of Mylène. <b>She</b> is <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I want to sing with her. This letter is not a legend, I received by the post, simply. I do not believe my eyes, she gives me her phone number." [...] Finally Murat called her and they met in Paris.|$|R
60|$|While I {{was feeling}} badly at leaving Miss Pondar your letter came, dear madam, and I must say it gave heavy hearts to Jone and me, to me especially, {{as you can}} well understand. I went off into the summer-house, and as I sat there {{thinking}} and reading the letter over again, I do believe some tears came into my eyes; and Miss Pondar, who {{was working in the}} garden only a little way off--for if there is anything she likes to do it is to weed and fuss among the rose-bushes and other flowers, which she does whenever her other work gives her a chance--she happened to look up, and seeing that I was in trouble, she came right to me, like the good woman <b>she</b> is, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had heard bad news, and if I would like a little gin and water.|$|R
