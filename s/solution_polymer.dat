40|$|This licentiate thesis {{comprises}} {{two parallel}} studies dealing with water-based flexographic inks on PE-coated liquid packaging board. The commercial waterbased inks {{that were used}} in both studies vary in type of pigment and acrylatepolymer vehicle, and in pigment/vehicle mixing proportions. One vehicle is solely based on emulsion polymer, another contains <b>solution</b> <b>polymer,</b> and the third is a 50 / 50 blend of these two. The first study presents results from characterisation of a matrix of these water-based inks with respect to their rheology, surface tension and wetting of PE-coated board. The rheological properties were measured over a wide range of shear rates relevant to various stages in the printing process. All inks represent shear thinning fluids, forming thixotropic structures. The plastic viscosity and yield stress are shown to increase strongly with content of solution polymers (at comparable solids contents). Measurements of static surface tension and drop spreading, on untreated as well as corona treated board, clearly display differences in interfacial properties for the vehicles. An increasing amount of <b>solution</b> <b>polymer</b> give lower surface tension values, while the equilibrium contact angles increase. The validity of a simple model for expressing the ink drop spreading dynamics was tested and could be applied to spreading on treated board. The rheology, surface tension and wetting properties are also shown to depend on the pigment type (cyan or black) in the ink and on the pigment/vehicle mixing proportion. In the second study, the print performance of this matrix of inks on the PE-coated board was evaluated. Changes in the ink formulation are shown to have significant influence on the ink amount transferred to the board and the print quality parameters. The 50 / 50 intermediate vehicle consistently gave the highest ink amounts, although the highest print density generally was obtained with the vehicle containing most <b>solution</b> <b>polymer.</b> High contents of <b>solution</b> <b>polymer</b> also resulted in more uniform prints and high print gloss. Mottling was most severe with the vehicle containing solely emulsion polymers. The transferred wet ink amount is demonstrated to correlate well with the plastic viscosity and static surface tension of the ink...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} of polymers can {{be significantly}} altered {{by the use}} of solvent mixtures. The solvent composition also effects the self-assembly properties of amphiphilic copolymers. In addition, water–ethanol mixtures are known to exhibit abnormal physicochemical properties due to the presence of hydration shells around the ethanol molecules, {{while at the same time}} both solvents have very low toxicity. However, the solution properties of amphiphilic copolymers in water– ethanol mixtures have been scarcely studied. Here we show that the <b>solution</b> <b>polymer</b> properties of amphiphilic copoly(2 -oxazoline) s can be significantly altered in binary water–ethanol mixtures resulting in increased solubility, tuneable lower critical solution temperatures as well as polymer– solvent combinations with both a LCST followed by an UCST and improved dispersion stability. Surprisingly, it was found that polymers insoluble in both ethanol and water could be dissolved in water–ethanol mixtures, opening the way to novel formulations for drug delivery or personal care applications.

In the millbase, the pigment, <b>solution</b> <b>polymer,</b> water, defoamer, and surfactant were first added together and mixed in a glass bottle.

The container was then closed and placed in a shaker for 1  h. The millbase viscosity was controlled for proper pigment grinding and also to prevent breaking the container.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{a series}} of experiments, {{including}} atomic force microscope (AFM), environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), and core displacement tests were conducted to investigate the effect of polymer solution structure on solution properties and oil displacement efficiency. The results show that in the HPAM <b>solution</b> <b>polymer</b> coils were formed and then aggregated into a loose structure, while the HAP 2010 solution formed a strong network structure, which would significantly improve the solution viscosity and flow resistance so as to upgrade the capacity of piston-like oil displacement in highly permeable porous media. Meanwhile, the retention of the HAP 2010 solution at pore throats were also enhanced, which could reduce water production during subsequent water flooding and enlarge the swept volume during polymer flooding. Therefore, enhancing the interaction among polymer molecules is {{an effective way to}} improve the displacement efficiency of polymer solutions in heavy oil reservoirs with high permeability.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis comprises three studies dealing with water-based flexography on polymer-coated boards, {{which have been}} presented in the five papers included {{at the end of}} the thesis. The first study (covered in three papers) presents results from characterisation of a matrix of water-based inks with respect to their rheology, surface tension, wetting, and fulltone printing performance on PE-coated board. The commercial water-based inks used vary in type of pigment and acrylic vehicle, and in pigment/vehicle mixing proportions. For all mixing proportions, the inks were shear thinning, with viscosity increasing strongly with content of solution (versus emulsion) polymer in the vehicle. Increasing amount of <b>solution</b> <b>polymer</b> also gave the indirect consequence of lower surface tension values. The wet ink amount transferred to the board and the resulting print uniformity responded sensitively to ink formulation and could be correlated to the corresponding changes in these two ink properties. Transferred amount correlated well with ink plastic viscosity and static surface tension, exhibiting a maximum at intermediate values of both. Print mottle decreased with increasing content of <b>solution</b> <b>polymer,</b> principally due to the associated increase in low-shear viscosity and decreased surface tension, both serving to reduce substrate dewetting. In the second study, the effect of corona discharge treatment of PE-coated board on its surface chemistry and print resistance properties was evaluated. The increase in total surface energy, due to its polar component, with increasing corona level was strongly correlated to surface oxidation fraction from XPS. AFM revealed oxidised material nano-mounds, which increased in size and substrate coverage with corona level. Wet rub resistance (with water) first increased for lower corona dosages before decreasing at higher dosages. This worsened water resistance at higher dosages is presumably due to the oxidised material dissolved and dispersed in the ink film. The third study presents results from another set of water-based acrylic inks printed on boards coated with PE, OPP and PP. Print quality and resistance properties, though dependent on the polymer type, were strongly influenced by the choice of emulsion polymer and presence of silicone additive in the vehicle, with corona treatment level playing a lesser role. The emulsion polymer giving best resistance performance was generally found to give poorest press performance and visual appearance. Again the trends could be understood in terms of wet ink surface tension (versus substrate surface energy), dictating print uniformity, and dry print surface energy (and swellability), dictating resistance properties.

The quality (i. e. pore regularity and pore size) of the films was optimised by controlling casting variables including humidity, airflow, concentration of polymer <b>solution,</b> <b>polymer</b> architecture, molecular weight of polymer, substrate, and casting volume.
