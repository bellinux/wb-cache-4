5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{meets with}} each of his {{employees}} to discuss their job performance. He plunders the employee <b>suggestion</b> <b>box</b> for ideas to impress his own boss, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), but the ruse backfires and he embarrasses himself. Michael relentlessly pesters Jan about their previous romantic connection but she bluntly rejects him, especially when, during the office's <b>suggestion</b> <b>box</b> meeting, she discovers {{that everyone in the}} Scranton branch is aware of the incident. As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is not ready for a relationship. Meanwhile, the stunned staff listens in.|$|E

500|$|During the <b>suggestion</b> <b>box</b> scene, Larry Wilmore envisioned Dwight as an Ed McMahon-type character, repeating {{everything}} Michael said. Paul Lieberstein {{claimed that}} {{figuring out the}} logistics for the conference room scene was [...] "the heart" [...] of the episode. Hardin recalled that it was extremely difficult to stay in character, due to the humorous nature of the dialogue and the cast members' reactions. In fact, the cast broke more than usual during filming. During the scene, Michael reads a suggestion from someone named Tom, who asks for better help for people with depression. After inquiring who this mysterious Tom is, Phyllis tells Michael that he worked in accounting several years ago and committed suicide. Wilmore claimed during the DVD commentary for the episode that the writers would be bringing {{him back in the}} show's third season, in which his backstory would be explained, although this never panned out. However, during the Writer's Block Q session at The Office Convention in 2007, the writers, perhaps sardonically, suggested that Tom's death was the reason that Ryan was brought in as a temporary worker. Tom's name is briefly seen on Dwight's organization chart in the fourth season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?", where his name is revealed to be Tom Peets.|$|E

After gaining the signed pledges of workers, the military [...] "officer-organizers" [...] would see that civilian members were gathered into [...] "locals" [...] — groups which elected grievance committees which were nominally responsible for the mediation of problems in the woods or the mill with owners and bosses. In the view of at least one historian this function seems to have been only of minimal effectiveness in practice, however, since [...] "in the early months, the only real function of the local was to meet production quotas, perhaps manage a <b>suggestion</b> <b>box,</b> and be a display counter of pledged patriots." [...] Indeed, {{at the time of its}} inception Disque did not envision the LLLL as a union of any kind, but rather a loose patriotic society.|$|E
2500|$|In week six the housemates had to rub another housemate {{with soap}} {{until all of}} the soap was gone. Imogen, Glyn and Susie won, and had the prize {{of the use of}} a luxury spa. The housemates had to stop milk from {{emptying}} out of a tank within a 48-hour period. Imogen was secretly told the real task, to cause the milk to empty below the red line point, without the other housemates' knowledge, and she succeeded, and the housemates received a luxury shopping budget. Day 43 saw the housemates write in a <b>suggestion</b> <b>box</b> ways that three housemates could improve, and the following day these suggestions were read out, and the housemates were provided with things to help them better themselves. If housemates could last the next few hours bettering themselves they would receive a treat, they later received a karaoke party. Aisleyne and Susie were put to the public vote, but not to evict, the vote was to decide who moved into a secret [...] "House Next Door". Aisleyne was moved to the House Next Door on Day 45. and she was joined by five new housemates: Jayne, Jennie, Jonathan, Michael and Spiral.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to {{emerging from a}} group that wants to solve a problem, or create a product, ideas for a creative product can come from different places in the organization {{and so it is}} important that the organizational context is prepared and open to receive these ideas.
