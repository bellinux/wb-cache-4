40|$|Apart from source excavation, {{the options}} {{available}} for the remediation of vadose zone metal and radionuclide contaminants beyond the practical excavation depth (0 to 15 m) are quite limited. Of the available technologies, very few are applicable to the deep vadose zone with the top-ranked candidate being <b>soil</b> desiccation. An <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> review of the work on infiltration control and supplemental technologies {{identified a number of}} knowledge gaps that would need to be overcome before soil desiccation could be deployed. The report documents some of the research conducted in the last year to fill these knowledge gaps. This work included 1) performing intermediate-scale laboratory flow cell experiments to demonstrate the desiccation process, 2) implementing a scalable version of Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases–Water-Air-Energy (STOMP-WAE), and 3) performing numerical experiments to identify the factors controlling the performance of a desiccation system...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} the second of a two-volume {{document}} that summarizes a joint project by the US Nuclear Regulatory and the Commission of European Communities to assess uncertainties in the MACCS and COSYMA probabilistic accident consequence codes. These codes were developed primarily for estimating the risks presented by nuclear reactors based on postulated frequencies and magnitudes of potential accidents. This two-volume report, which examines mechanisms and uncertainties of transfer through the food chain, {{is the first in}} a series of five such reports. A <b>panel</b> of sixteen <b>experts</b> was formed to compile credible and traceable uncertainty distributions for food chain transfer that affect calculations of offsite radiological consequences. Seven of the experts reported on transfer into the food chain through soil and plants, nine reported on transfer via food products from animals, and two reported on both. The expert judgment elicitation procedure and its outcomes are described in these volumes. This volume contains seven appendices. Appendix A presents a brief discussion of the MAACS and COSYMA model codes. Appendix B is the structure document and elicitation questionnaire for the <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> on <b>soils</b> and plants. Appendix C presents the rationales and responses of each of the members of the <b>soils</b> and plants <b>expert</b> <b>panel.</b> Appendix D is the structure document and elicitation questionnaire for the <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> on animal transfer. The rationales and responses of each of the experts on animal transfer are given in Appendix E. Brief biographies of the food chain <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> members are provided in Appendix F.

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians 2 ̆ 7 Report and {{proposals}} {{from the perspective}} of constitutional theory. Introduction In January 2012, the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians (‘Expert Panel’) delivered its report to the then Prime Minister making a number of recommendations to amend the Australian Constitution to ‘recognise’ Indigenous Australians. Rather than engage in a legal critique of the substance of the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> various proposals, this article approaches the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> Report and proposals as a whole {{from the perspective of}} constitutional theory. It argues that the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> Report and proposals strongly reflect the constitutional theory of the American constitutional theorist Jack Balkin. In his book Living Originalism, Balkin conceives of the United States Constitution functioning not only as ‘basic law’, distributing powers and setting up institutions of government, but also as ‘higher law’, embodying values and aspirations for the nation, and as ‘our law’, helping to constitute the people of the nation as a people. The first claim made in this article is that the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> conceives of the functions of the Australian Constitution {{in much the same way}} as Balkin conceives of the functions of the United States Constitution. The article makes a second claim. For Balkin, a constitution successfully functioning as basic law gives it procedural legitimacy whilst its success in functioning as higher law and our law gives it moral and sociological legitimacy respectively. Whilst the Australian Constitution does not really function as higher law or our law in Balkin’s sense, the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> adoption of that kind of thinking can be seen as a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> implicitly suggests that the Australian Constitution can be made more legitimate. The article also makes a third claim building upon the first two. It is argued that the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> is engaged in a project of constitutional redemption, a concept that features heavily in Living Originalism and which is the principal subject of its companion work Constitutional Redemption: Political Faith in an Unjust World. This article begins by setting out the background to the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> Report and notes its various proposals for amendments to the Australian Constitution. The article then turns to the first main claim. It explains Balkin’s tripartite view of constitutional functions and explores how the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> report and recommendations appear to be based on a view of the Australian Constitution as higher law and as our law. The article then turns to the second main claim, explaining how it is difficult to accept that the Australian Constitution functions as higher law and our law in Balkin’s sense and showing how the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> adoption of that thinking offers a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The article then turns to the third main claim and explores how the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> appears to be engaged in a project of constitutional redemption. The article concludes with a reference to The Castle and ‘the vibe’ and suggests that it is possible that the Australian people may one day look to the Australian Constitution as higher law and our law...|$|R
