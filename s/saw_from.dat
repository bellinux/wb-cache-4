They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E

30|$|Little {{research}} {{effort has}} focussed on wood property variation within and among cypress genera. Furthermore, some contradictory {{results have been}} found among the few published studies. For example, Watt et al. (2008) studied 4 -year-old Cupressus lusitanica and found diameter (measured at ground level) to be highly correlated with wood density, but Malimbwi et al. (1992) found density and diameter to be unrelated {{in a study of}} 19 -year-old C. lusitanica trees. McKinley et al. (2000) studied a sample of four cypress taxa (C. lusitanica Miller, C. macrocarpa Gordon, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Murray) Parl. and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D.Don) Spach x Cupressus macrocarpa) ranging in age from 13 to 52  years and found wood density was unrelated to tree age. However, wood stiffness of a sample of boards <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> 21 -year-old Cupressus lusitanica trees was shown to be strongly influenced by cambial age (Low et al. 2005). The boards (all <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> butt logs and mechanically tested) were classified as follows: Inner (when <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> the innermost rings), Outer (when <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> the outermost rings) and Intermediate (when <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> intermediary positions). Mean stiffness of the Inner, Intermediate and Outer samples was 4.3, 5.4 and 7.2  GPa, respectively. Given that Low et al. (2005) also found that mean stiffness of C. lusitanica boards was less than that of either C. macrocarpa or the Chamaecyparis nootkatensis x Cupressus macrocarpa boards of the same age, a lowered harvesting age of less than 35  years appears plausible.|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that whereas Roman vaults, like that of the Pantheon, and Byzantine vaults, like that at Hagia Sophia, were not protected from above (i.e. the vault from the inside was the same that one <b>saw</b> <b>from</b> the outside), the European architects of the Middle Ages, protected their vaults with wooden roofs. In other words, one will not see a Gothic vault from the outside. The reasons for this development are hypothetical, but the fact that the roofed basilica form preceded the era when vaults begin to be made is certainly to be taken into consideration. In other words, the traditional image of a roof took precedence over the vault.|$|E
25|$|Prior to mid-2009, {{only some}} music from Warner Music Group (which {{includes}} Green Day's label, Reprise Records) {{had yet to}} be included in games like Guitar Hero or Rock Band, with the gaming industry believing that the music publisher was boycotting the music game genre over how little money they <b>saw</b> <b>from</b> the sales of the game. However, Warner Music Group and MTV Games stated that the lack of songs from the publisher was due to current negotiations over new licensing costs. The two companies had reached a deal by June 2009, when a downloadable pack of Green Day songs was made available to the Rock Band series, heralded by both companies.|$|E
25|$|Adrian Lindsey {{was hired}} by Oklahoma to coach the {{football}} team in 1927. Before coming to Oklahoma, Lindsey was an assistant football coach at Kansas, his alma mater. Lindsey is remembered as the coach who resigned quietly after failing to produce a winning team. Lindsey's record (19-19-6) was not that shabby, however. His players were small in size and number and the schedules they faced were too difficult for such a small squad. Lindsey's 1929 Sooners team defeated Nebraska, 20-7, marking the worst defeat the Cornhuskers <b>saw</b> <b>from</b> a Big Six team in two decades. In 1931, he took his team and defeated the Hawaii Warriors in Honolulu by a score of 7-0. This game {{marked the first time}} a university located in the central continental United States was asked to play in the islands. Lindsey resigned as head coach after the 1931 season.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} the influence wood preservatives on glued-laminated-timber (GLT), sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D.Don) laminae {{were treated with}} five kinds of wood preservative (ACQ, NCU, CUAZ 2, NZN, and AAC), and 5 -ply GLTs with low and high density were fabricated using resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) and phenol-resorcinol–formaldehyde (PRF) resin adhesives. They were subjected to 10  years of outdoor exposure testing, and after 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of exposure block-shear tests were conducted. As the result, for GLTs treated with ACQ, NCU, or CUAZ 2, which contain copper as the main ingredient, the specimens <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> both lateral sides were more degraded than the specimens <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> the middle part. In GLTs treated with ACQ, NCU, or CUAZ 2 the glue-layers closer to the upper horizontal surface tended to show greater deterioration. In addition, in some GLTs the lower glue-layers also deteriorated. From {{the results of the}} specimens <b>sawn</b> <b>from</b> the west side of GLTs exposed outdoors, of exposure tests of 2  years, and of accelerated-aging tests using block-shear specimen with 10 and 25  mm width, reduction curves (plots of deterioration vs. exposure time) of shear-strength were obtained and compared. The reduction curves of GLTs exposed outdoors were {{similar to those of the}} outdoor exposure tests using block-shear specimen of 25  mm width.|$|R

25|$|Finally, the Board {{consolidated}} 28 Beck cases under California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224 (1995). The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) {{provided a}} Beck notification to each member yearly via its monthly magazine, and required members to exercise these rights {{once a year}} during a window period. The Board held that the union had committed an unfair labor practice by failing to provide a Beck rights notice to new members and by not providing a Beck rights notice to new members who were resigning from the union but had not yet received the annual notice, but did not commit a ULP by failing to notify resigning union members of their Beck rights {{at the time of}} their resignation. The Board distinguished its holding in California <b>Saw</b> <b>from</b> its prior ruling in Paramax Systems, and found the window period (as well as other restrictions on the submission of resignation and objector status) to be an unfair labor practice. The Board rejected numerous challenges to the way agency fees were calculated, challenges made, and expenditures verified. The California Saw decision was criticized for only applying to nonmembers. The NLRB addressed the Beck rights of members shortly thereafter in United Paperworkers International Union, Local 1033 (Weyerhauser Paper Co.), 320 NLRB 349 (1995). In that case, the NLRB upheld its ruling in California Saw and said that yearly notice to current members, including the rights outlined by the courts and NLRB (not just the statutory language of the NLRA), was all that was required of unions.|$|E

500|$|The {{differences}} in perspective between East and West are set forth {{early in the}} first act, and underscored musically: [...] while the Chinese of the chorus see the countryside as fields ready for harvest, {{the fruits of their}} labor and full of potential, the Nixons describe what they <b>saw</b> <b>from</b> the windows of the Spirit of '76 as a barren landscape.

With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin.

500|$|Dan Casey {{writing for}} Nerdist felt the episode was [...] "the most dramatic, tense hour of {{television}} we’ve seen from" [...] the series, stating that [...] "One of the show’s biggest problems {{has been its}} general lack of depth, particularly {{in terms of the}} characters and making them feel like real people rather than glossy superspies with a seemingly endless wellspring of one-liners" [...] and decided that the episode [...] "made significant steps towards fixing this problem, thanks to some wonderful character interactions and an exploration of Fitz/Simmons’ past". James Hunt of Den of Geek said [...] "whether this episode continues the show's upwards trend, that's debatable. It could've been worse, but there wasn't the leap forward that we <b>saw</b> <b>from</b> episode three to four, or four to five. I'll say this for an episode: it was better than I thought a Fitz & Simmons episode would be. That's progress, of a sort." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., criticized the scope and scale of the episode, but praised the character development for Coulson, feeling it brought his character closer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of the comics.|$|E

Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, remarked that the magazine had offered [...] "just the right mixture of new stories, continuing series, and articles" [...] and praised it for having a [...] "funky, DIY vibe". The staff of the School Library Journal called the magazine [...] "one of a kind" [...] and felt that its loss would leave a void for female fans, a generally under-acknowledged group of comic and manga readers. Staff member Brigid Alverson felt Shojo Beat was a great overall package that [...] "featured intelligent articles that allowed the reader to be enthusiastic about Japanese pop culture without being geeky" [...] making it distinct from other magazines for girls that were normally [...] "filled with brainless celebrity stories or service articles tied to commercial products". Other participants praised the magazine's fashion articles for its educational articles on Japanese culture and for featuring girls of a variety of body types wearing affordable fashions.
