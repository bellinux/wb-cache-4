40|$|The {{terrestrial}} and oceanic salt (NaCl) {{components in}} 39 dust samples from eight sites across south eastern Australia have been calculated from chemical data derived by ion beam analysis (IBA). For samples {{identified as having}} a positive terrestrial salt ratio (TSR; i. e., the abundance of terrestrial salt relative to total <b>salt</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a percentage), back trajectory analysis (estimation of {{the path of the}} wind affecting the site) was used to verify the likelihood of a terrestrial source for such salt. This procedure indicated that the terrestrial salt input to south eastern Australia is non-negligible compared to that of sea salt and the most likely sources of the terrestrial salt deposited in such area are the inland saline regions of the Lake Eyre and Murray Darling Basins. Terrestrial salt ratio values readily screen out the majority of samples for which a terrestrial salt component is unlikely. Thus, calculating the ratios to identify samples which are potentially influenced by terrestrial salt (e. g., prior to conducting a back trajectory analysis on such samples) appears to be useful, especially since such determinations can be done with small sample sets for which statistical analysis is not appropriate.

40|$|The author {{reported}} previously that actomyosin (AM) was precipitated {{twice during}} {{the increase of}} concentration of pyrophosphate (pyro) at pH 7. 0 and 0. 1 ionic strength. In ordor to investigate whether the above mentioned phenomenon is specific or not at 0. 1 ionic strength and whether it is specific or not to pyro alone, the author studied the effect pyro, MgCl 2, CaCl 2, ethylendiamine tetra-acetate (EDTA) and salyrgan upon the solubility of AM-solution. The results are as follows : 1. The dual formation of precipitation caused by the increasing concentration of pyro at 0. 1 ionic strength in AM-solution is found under {{a wide range of}} KCl concentration (0. 05 0. 15 M). Therefore, this phenomenon, caused by pyro, is not specific to 0. 1 ionic strength alone. 2.

Therefore, dual formation of precipitation caused by pyro in AM-solution is not specific to pyro alone. In addition, the mechanism of the formation of precipitated zones was discussed. 3.

To establish if local stimuli on the bone tissue may derive from metastatic colonies of prostatic origin, we evaluated the biologic activities secreted by human prostatic epithelium and effective on osteoblast-like cells in vitro. Supernatant from short-term tissue cultures of human prostatic tissue samples obtained from PRCA (35 cases) and {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH, 12 cases) patients were applied to three models of cells with osteoblastic phenotype: two normal [rabbit osteoblasts (OB) and rat periosteal cells (PO) ] and one transformed (human osteosarcoma cell line, MG 63). Proliferative activity was monitored through enzymatic reduction of tetrazolium <b>salts</b> and <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> relative mitogenic activities (RMA). Analysis of proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a marker of osteoblast function, demonstrates that conditioned media (CM) from PRCA cultures stimulate both growth and activity of osteoblast-like cells {{to a greater extent}} compared to CM from BPH. Furthermore, cell growth and activity of osteoblast-like cells are progressively increased by CM derived from patients with stage B (tumor confined within the prostate capsule), stage C (locally invasive tumor), and stage D (invasive tumor with distant metastasis) disease. One of the mechanisms potentially underlying the CM-stimulated effects on bone cells is associated with the urokinase (uPA) enzyme route, whose release progressively increases with the stage of disease. However, antibodies against uPA and p-aminobenzamidine (a low molecular weight urokinase inhibitor) treatment, which both inhibit the proliferative and differentiative effects induced by exogenous urokinase, partially slow down the effects of CM from PRCA tissue cultures, suggesting that additional factors are secreted by prostatic tumor cells in vitro. In conclusion, we show that the mitogenic and differentiative activities for osteoblasts produced by prostatic tumor cells in short-term tissue cultures are related to PRCA stage and may predict the behavior of skeletal metastases in single cases of tumor. In addition, the culture methods used may represent a valid model to study prostatic and bone cellular interactions, which may indicate new therapeutic approaches in metastatic prostate tumors...|$|R

For comparison we prepared several brews with regard to combinations of unpurified water and distilled water. Higher pH of boiling water was caused due to higher water alkalinity that negatively affected enzyme complex present in used malt. Presence of hydrogenphosphates in used malt had high buffering ability and pH lowering ability.

40|$|Saltwater, or brine, {{underlies}} {{fresh water}} in many aquifers, with a transition zone separating them. Pumping fresh water by wells located above the transition zone produces upconing of the latter, eventually salinizing the pumped water, forcing shut-off. The salinity of the pumped water {{depends on the}} pumping rate, on {{the location of the}} well's screen, on the fresh water flow regime, and on the difference in density between fresh and <b>salt</b> water, <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a dimensionless factor called density difference factor (DDF). Following the well's shut-off, the upconed saltwater mound undergoes decay, tending to return to the pre-pumping regime. In this paper, the upconing-decay processes in an axially symmetrical system are investigated to discover how they are affected by the DDF and by the dispersivities. The code FEAS-Brine, developed for the simulation of coupled density-dependent flow and salt transport, is used. In this code, the flow equation is solved by the Galer:wqkin finite element method (FEM), while the advective-dispersive salt transport equation is solved in the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. This code does not suffer from the instability constraint on the Peclet number {{in the vicinity of the}} pumping well, where advection dominates the salt transport. Simulation results show that upconing is very sensitive to the DDF, which, in our work, is in the range from 0 (for ideal tracer) to 0. 2 (for brine). It is shown that for the DDF of 0. 025 (for seawater), local upconing occurs only for low iso-salinity surfaces, while those of high salt concentration, practically, do not shift toward the pumping well. For an ideal tracer, all iso-salinity surfaces rise toward the pumping well. For brine, however, only iso-salinity surfaces of very low salinity upcone towards the pumping well. The decay process is lengthy; it takes a long time for the upconed saltwater to migrate back to the original horizontal transition zone prior to pumping. However, the wider transition zone caused by hydrodynamic dispersion can never return to the initial one. This indicates that once a pumping well is abandoned because of high salinity, it can be reused for groundwater utilization only after a long time...|$|R
