We also derive new relations for the gradient of the conditional and non-conditional mutual information with respect to the MMSE.

For each claim, we articulate types of new knowledge that is searched for, related research questions, appropriate RTD methods and evaluation strategies. In grounding RTD in Creswell’s framework, we argue that many types of designing can be a respected research method when they comply with the respective rules.

This dissertation report is a primary research project based on studying the project management structure in a SME based in India. A literature review was carried out which related to the theoretical work of authors within the project management community.

Primary data was collected by interviewing the stakeholders in Shuvam Constructions Private Limited, a SME in the Indian Real-Estate construction industry.

Being inexperienced in giving speeches of this kind, it was necessary to choose every word very carefully, and many consultants were helping out writing the speech.

The presentation {{will begin with}} a brief summary of a research project currently being undertaken in a Scottish university. The presentation will then critically analyse the effects and implications of using technology in assessment that is constructively aligned (Biggs and Tang, 2011) to service-learning. This presentation focuses on {{an aspect of the}} research study that involves assessment and feedback in service-learning. The summative assessment includes: a co-assessed oral presentation; a critical incident report; and a reflective journal. Students self-assess their own oral presentation and negotiate a mutually agreed mark with the teacher, who also assesses their presentation. This enables students to compare their self-assessment with the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback. Firstly, the study investigates the use of video recording students 2 ̆ 7 presentations to enhance this process. Secondly, to make the feedback on critical incident reports more effective, the study investigates the use of the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s verbal individual feedback recorded on an audio file and emailed to each student. Thirdly, to support student learning through formative feedback on the preparation of their 5, 000 word reflective journal, the study investigates the use of Mahara, an online tool which is akin to an academic Facebook account. Through Mahara, each student invites the teacher to share their journal entry on a weekly basis so that feedback can be given. The use of technology to support and enhance students 2 ̆ 7 learning through the assessment and feedback processes is critically analysed. It is asserted that the progressive nature of service-learning lends itself aptly to innovative pedagogical methods and that more traditional higher education courses may benefit by adapting similar techniques...|$|R

40|$|Intuitionistic type theories, {{originally}} developed by Martin-Lof, provide {{a foundation for}} intuitionistic mathematics, much as set theory provides a foundation for mathematics. They are of interest to computer scientists because the objects typed are computations, making type theory an appropriate setting for reasoning about computation. Type theories such as Nuprl or the theories of Martin-Lof have types for objects that always terminate, but objects which may diverge are not directly typable. If type theory {{is to be a}} full-fledged theory for reasoning about computations, {{we need to be able}} to reason about potentially diverging objects. In this thesis we show how potentially diverging computations, which we call partial objects, may be typed by extending type theory to partial object type theory. New partial types are added to type partial objects. These types are usable: partial objects written in natural program notation can easily be shown to lie in the types. In addition to being able to express partial objects, it is also important to be able to reason about them; for this purpose general principles are given for proving facts about partial objects via induction. The resulting theory serves as a foundation for computational as well as mathematical reasoning. It also gives insights into abstract recursion theory, leads to a new method for constructive reasoning, and <b>sheds</b> <b>light</b> on inductive <b>methods</b> for reasoning about recursive computation...|$|R
40|$|Background Conditionally-replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) infect and {{replicate}} in tumor cells, releasing viral progeny upon lysis of the cell. This is {{a dynamic}} and inherently exponential process and, thus, the assessment of CRAds should incorporate these dynamics. In vitro experiments are therefore prone to subjective assessment because no validated assay exists that truly appreciates {{the dynamics of the}} process. An objective assay could simplify experiments and reduce the number of CRAd variants required to enter a full preclinical evaluation. Methods We developed a simple and practical mathematical model incorporating easily obtainable parameters of the interaction between replicating viruses and growing tumor cells in vitro and, in the present study, validate this model by fitting the predicted values to experimentally-derived values. Results From the exponential curves of cellular growth and the viral propagation rate in glioma cells, we derive the four parameters needed in this model and show a robust fit to experimental data. Because the initial infection conditions appear to significantly influence the final outcome of CRAd experiments, these conditions are determined using the same cells and correlated with the expression of the primary adenovirus receptor CAR (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor). Conclusions The results obtained <b>shed</b> <b>light</b> upon the <b>method</b> of action of CRAds and provide an objective and practical model and assay for determining and predicting CRAd activity in tumor cells.
