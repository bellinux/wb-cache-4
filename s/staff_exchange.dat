25|$|The A2 class, {{along with}} other post-1900 VR steam {{locomotive}} designs, was equipped with electric lighting from 1926 onwards. Automatic <b>Staff</b> <b>Exchange</b> equipment to allow non-stop high-speed running between track sections was also fitted from 1926 onwards.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, C5 {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to be fitted with a cross-compound air compressor, which was also subsequently adopted across other VR locomotive classes. The C class {{was also the first}} goods locomotive to be fitted with Automatic <b>Staff</b> <b>Exchange</b> apparatus, given their frequent used on express goods and fruit services.|$|E
25|$|Bellingham Sister Cities Association is {{very active}} in {{promoting}} Bellingham's sister city relationships and is very well supported by the community. The relationship with Tateyama, the oldest relationship (which celebrated its 50th year in 2008), is the most active and includes regular events such as an annual city hall <b>staff</b> <b>exchange</b> and community cultural visits. Tateyama frequently fields a team for the annual Ski to Sea race, or at minimum has representation in the Ski to Sea parade.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the Adelaide Express {{was renamed}} The Overland in 1926, despite some {{reluctance}} from the South Australian authorities who jointly ran the inter-capital service. Clapp oversaw {{the reduction in}} running time for the service from sixteen {{and a half hours}} in 1928 to around fourteen hours in 1938 (with the departure time changed from 4:30pm to a much more convenient 7:00pm), achieved at very moderate cost simply through the introduction of Automatic <b>Staff</b> <b>Exchange</b> equipment between Ballarat and Serviceton to allow unimpeded progress from one track section to the next, and design improvements to the existing A2 class locomotive fleet to increase power and efficiency.|$|E

25|$|The narrow carbody {{provides}} for a catwalk along each side between the cabs, with fold back body panels for maintenance access. The cab {{is similar to that}} of the contemporary G class, with an anti-climber beam to prevent upward movement should a collision occur. Twin high impact windscreens are provided, with dual blade wipers. Each cab has room for a two-person crew, as well as an instructor if required. Air conditioning is provided, as well as an air-operated retention toilet at one end accessible from the catwalk. The locos were initially provided with automatic <b>staff</b> <b>exchange</b> equipment, but this was removed in the 1990s when the use of Electric Staff ended. The space remains in the cab side today.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger train speed and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic <b>Staff</b> <b>Exchange</b> apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between track sections, introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of air conditioning equipment on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full bowl of soup in the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, take credit for the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} decade, the camp hosted a few {{international}} staff each year; however, in 1984 Camp Fitch {{was able to}} begin to expand the number of staff coming from abroad. [...] This was primarily due to a close link that had been established between the YMCA España and several YMCAs of Northern Ohio. [...] This partnership at first resulted in a small <b>staff</b> <b>exchange</b> program between the two countries. [...] By 1987 Camp Fitch’s counselor in training program was expanded to actively recruit both Spanish and American youths for staff development.|$|E

50|$|Through the WGA, Governors {{and their}} <b>staffs</b> <b>exchange</b> {{information}} and ideas about problem solving {{for a wide}} range of practical management concerns. The exchange helps Governors manage their resources more efficiently, for example, when they procure services jointly and share development costs for new programs. The exchange also helps build rapport among Governors, cabinet officers and gubernatorial staffs in the region.|$|R
2500|$|The X class, {{in common}} with all broad gauge VR steam {{locomotives}} built from 1907 onwards, underwent design modifications to the smokebox draughting and blastpipe dimensions referred to as 'Modified Front End', {{as well as other}} improvements such as the fitting of smoke deflectors, Automatic <b>Staff</b> <b>Exchange</b> apparatus and cross-compound air compressors. [...] The copper firebox round-top boilers the original eleven locomotives were built with, prone to priming if too much water was carried, were replaced with all-steel boilers featuring Belpaire pattern fireboxes. The new boiler design also featured a combustion chamber and thermic syphons to increase power and efficiency. The VR was so satisfied with the performance of the revised X class all-steel boiler design, a shortened barrel version was considered during the design phase of the R class 4-6-4 express passenger locomotives of 1951.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} three {{different}} mechanisms for globalising engineering education: (1) student and <b>staff</b> <b>exchanges,</b> (2) joint courses, where the students work in globally distributed teams; and (3) joint degree programmes.
