Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the <b>surrounding</b> <b>rocks</b> at depths of 300–600 meters.

The hydraulic support’s supporting stiffness should adapt the <b>surrounding</b> <b>rock’s</b> stiffness to change the dynamic load location of roof by optimizing the structural stiffness of hydraulic support, providing safe working space.
