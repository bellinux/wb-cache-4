25|$|To {{understand}} this notion better, {{it helps to}} consider a relation as mapping every element x∈X to a set xR = { y∈Y | xRy }. This set is sometimes called the successor neighborhood of x in R; one can define the predecessor neighborhood analogously. <b>Synonymous</b> <b>terms</b> for these notions are afterset and respectively foreset.|$|E
25|$|When alpha {{hemolysis}} (α-hemolysis) is present, the agar {{under the}} colony {{is dark and}} greenish. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{and a group of}} oral streptococci (Streptococcus viridans or viridans streptococci) display alpha hemolysis. This is sometimes called green hemolysis because of the color change in the agar. Other <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms</b> are incomplete hemolysis and partial hemolysis. Alpha hemolysis is caused by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium, oxidizing hemoglobin to green biliverdin.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> preference detection that relies on chronological text analysis. Our approach analyses the use of <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> entries in a chronological reference corpus. As a result of preference evaluation, a ranking of preference between all the <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> entries belonging to the same concept is established...|$|R
5000|$|In Special Forces {{circles the}} term [...] "a boblilley" [...] {{is now a}} <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> used to {{describe}} a commando hit-and-run operation.|$|R
50|$|Another largely <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> is wishalloy, {{although}} the sense is often subtly different in that a wishalloy usually {{does not exist}} at all, whereas unobtainium may merely be unavailable.|$|R
2500|$|... "Bishop" [...] (Koine Greek [...] "episcopos") and [...] "elder" [...] (Koine Greek [...] "presbyteros") are (in this view) <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms.</b> Episcopos means {{literally}} overseer {{and describes}} {{the function of}} the elder, rather than the maturity of the officer. A bishop holds the highest office of the church (there is no Patriarch or Pope over bishops).|$|E
2500|$|Cause {{and effect}} are an {{important}} topic in all schools of Vedanta. These concepts are discussed in ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, and other Indian religions, using <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms.</b> Cause {{is referred to as}} [...] (कारण), [...] nidana (निदान), hetu (हेतु) or mulam (मूलम्), while effect is referred to as [...] (कार्य), phala (फल), parinam (परिणाम) or Shungam (शुङ्ग). Vedanta sub-schools have proposed and debated different causality theories.|$|E
2500|$|Various <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms</b> {{exist for}} the various {{polymorphic}} forms of an organism. The most common are morph and morpha, while a more formal term is morphotype. [...] Form and phase are sometimes also used, but are easily confused in zoology with, respectively, [...] "form" [...] in a population of animals, and [...] "phase" [...] as a color or other change in an organism due to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.). Phenotypic traits and characteristics are also possible descriptions, though that would imply just a limited aspect of the body.|$|E
5000|$|Grey import {{vehicles}} are new or used motor vehicles and motorcycles legally imported {{from another country}} through channels other than the maker's official distribution system. The <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> parallel import is sometimes substituted.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{ablation}} is {{a method}} of modifying DNA in order to disrupt {{the production of a}} specific gene. As genetic ablation may lead to Cell ablation, it {{can be used as a}} <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> at appropriate times.|$|R
50|$|The {{word was}} {{subsequently}} extended {{to apply to}} a household servant, who usually filled glasses, placed and removed dishes etc. while standing at meals, while the master and guests remained seated. The roughly <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> lackey may have a similar etymology.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Christian era probably it was known as Mahavana. During the 4th century AD the territory was referred to as Mahakantara (Greater forest). Both Mahavana and Mahakantara are <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms</b> representing the same land. Mahakantara and Kosala (or South Kosala) comprising Sambalpur, Bilaspur and Raipur were two distinct but neighboring territories. Originally these two geographical units were known as Kantara and Kosala in Ramayana and Mahabharata. In the 4th century AD Vyaghraraja was ruling over Mahakantara comprising Kalahandi, undivided Koraput and Bastar region. Asurgarh was capital of Mahakantara. In ancient history Asurgarh region was transition point for trading between Kaling, Mahakantara and Kosal (South). Asurgarh bears special importance so far as the Atavika people are concerned. These people find mention in Ashokan edicts and they are considered to have constituted the fighting forces of Kalinga against Ashoka in the famous Kalinga war. The Gupta emperor Samudragupta defeated Vyaghraraja of Mahakantara after defeating Kosala or South Kosala. But after defeating him the state of Mahakantara was returned to Vyaghraraj, as the Gupta influence in the Deccan was more of cultural than of political significance. The impact of Gupta culture in Kalahandi region is known from the rise of Saktism, Saiviam and Vaishaniam as well as spread of Sanskrit culture in this area in post-Gupta period. In the 5th century AD Sanskritization in Orissa was first started from Kalahandi – Koraput [...] Kalahandi was the cradle of Stambeswari Creed in the 5th century AD due to Sanskritization, which was a forerunner of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra or Jagannatha Cult. The first brick temple in Eastern India, the temple of Goddess Stambeswari, was built at Asurgarh during the 5th century AD.|$|E

60|$|By passing to the king, tithes became {{property}} to a mixed party; by passing from the king, they became absolutely lay property: the partition-wall was broken down, and tithes and Church possession became no longer <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms.</b> No [A?] man, therefore, {{might become a}} fair purchaser of tithes, and of exemption from tithes.|$|E
50|$|Social care is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> with social welfare, and {{as an alternative to}} social work. The term often implies informal networks of support and assistance as well as services funded following assessments by social work and other professions.|$|R
5000|$|The English text of Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, 1997, {{under the}} heading [...] "Episcopal ordination—fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders", uses [...] "episcopal consecration" [...] as a <b>synonymous</b> <b>term,</b> using [...] "episcopal ordination" [...] and [...] "episcopal consecration" [...] interchangeably. (CCC nn. 1556-1558) ...|$|R
5000|$|A data {{processing}} system {{is a combination of}} machines, people, and processes that for a set of inputs produces a defined set of outputs.

6000|$|... "Splendid scheme!" [...] said Hadden. [...] "I've {{only had}} breakfast {{half an hour}} ago; but we'll have a private room, and I'll manage to pick something. It'll brace me up. I was on an awful tear last night, and I've met no end of fellows this morning." [...] To meet a fellow, and to stand and share a drink, were with Tom <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} is agreed, that a DEFINITION is nothing else but THE SHOWING THE MEANING OF ONE WORD BY SEVERAL OTHER NOT <b>SYNONYMOUS</b> <b>TERMS.</b> The meaning of words being only the ideas they are made to stand for by him that uses them, the meaning of any term is then showed, or the word is defined, when, by other words, the idea it is made the sign of, and annexed to, {{in the mind of}} the speaker, is as it were represented, or set before the view of another; and thus its signification ascertained. This is the only use and end of definitions; and {{therefore}} the only measure of what is, or is not a good definition.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly, my dear. Because;' {{here was}} {{something}} to demonstrate, and it set him up again; 'because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on {{the sense in which}} we use the expression. Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms)</b> sentimental. Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes, to very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground. Therefore, perhaps the expression itself - I merely suggest this to you, my dear - may be a little misplaced.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Dogberryism" [...] {{comes from}} the 1598 Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing in which the {{character}} Dogberry utters many malapropisms to humorous effect. Though Shakespeare was an earlier writer than Sheridan, [...] "malaprop/malapropism" [...] seems an earlier coinage than [...] "Dogberryism", which is not attested until 1836.|$|R
5000|$|Pursuant to the {{implementation}} on January 1, 2008 of the Lov om mekling og rettergang i sivile tvister (tvisteloven), the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court changed its Norwegian name from Høyesteretts kjæremålsutvalg to Høyesteretts ankeutvalg, {{on account of the}} sole use of the term anke (appeal) instead of the antiquated <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> kjæremål.|$|R
50|$|A mazār (مزار) is a {{mausoleum}} or {{shrine in}} some places of the world, typically that of a saint or notable religious leader. Medieval Arabic texts may also use the words mašhad, maqām or ḍarīḥ to denote the same concept. Another <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> mostly used in Palestine and in older Western scholarly literature is wali or weli.|$|R
60|$|Darwin himself, in his quiet {{country home}} at Down, was simply {{astonished}} at the rapid {{success of his}} own work. The first edition was published {{at the end of}} November 1859; it was exhausted almost immediately, and a second was got ready in hot haste by the beginning of January 1860. In less than six weeks the book had become famous, and Darwin found himself the centre of a European contest, waged with exceeding bitterness, over the truth or falsity of his wonderful volume. To the world at large Darwinism and evolution became at once <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms.</b> The same people who would entirely ascribe the Protestant Reformation to the account of Luther, and the inductive philosophy to the account of Bacon, also believed, in the simplicity of their hearts, that the whole vast evolutionary movement was due at bottom to that very insidious and dangerous book of Mr. Darwin's.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote D: This implication, in {{the first}} {{principle}} of the utilitarian scheme, of perfect impartiality between persons, is regarded by Mr. Herbert Spencer (in his Social Statics) as a disproof of the pretentions of utility to be a sufficient guide to right; since (he says) the principle of utility presupposes the anterior principle, that everybody has an equal right to happiness. It may be more correctly described as supposing that equal amounts of happiness are equally desirable, whether felt by the same or by different persons. This, however, is not a pre-supposition; not a premise needful to support the principle of utility, but the very principle itself; for what is the principle of utility, if it be not that 'happiness' and 'desirable' are <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms?</b> If there is any anterior principle implied, it can be no other than this, that the truths of arithmetic are applicable to the valuation of happiness, as of all other measurable quantities.|$|E
6000|$|Surveying the subject, then, {{from this}} ego-altruistic position, we can {{perceive}} why matrimony, as we practise it, {{should result in}} increasing the personality of our race: for the reason namely that psychical similarity determines the selection. At first sight, indeed, such a natural affinity {{would seem to have}} little or nothing to do with marriage. As far as outsiders are capable of judging, unlikes appear to fancy one another quite as gratuitously as do likes. Connubial couples are often anything but twin souls. Yet our own dual use of the word [...] "like" [...] bears historic witness to the contrary. For in this expression we have a record from early Gothic times that men liked others for being like themselves. Since then, our feelings have not changed materially, although our mode of showing them is slightly less intense. In those simple days stranger and enemy were <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms,</b> and their objects were received in a corresponding spirit. In our present refined civilization we hurl epithets instead of spears, and content ourselves with branding as heterodox the opinions of another which do not happen to coincide with our own. The instinct of self-development naturally begets this self-sided view. We insensibly find those persons congenial whose ideas resemble ours, and gravitate to them, as leaves on a pond do to one another, nearer and nearer till they touch. Is it likely, then, that in the most important case of all the rule should suddenly cease to hold? Is it to be presumed that even Socrates chose Xantippe for her remarkable contrariety to himself? ...|$|E
50|$|The best-known {{representatives of}} this amalgamated {{tradition}} are Annie Besant (Theosophical Society), Swami Vivekenanda and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (Neo-Vedanta), Anagarika Dharmapala, a 19th-century Sri Lankan Buddhist activist {{who founded the}} Maha Bodhi Society, and D.T. Suzuki, a Japanese scholar and Zen-Buddhist. A <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> for this broad understanding is nondualism. This mutual influence {{is also known as}} the pizza effect.|$|R
50|$|Nihang has various {{meanings}} including 'sword', 'without {{care for}} life or death', and 'alligator'. All Sikhs {{who were willing}} to fight under Guru Gobind Singh were called Nihangs, and collectively they were known as the 'ladlian fauja'. Nihang was the <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> used for the Akalis. They are now considered by some a sect of Sikhism.|$|R
5000|$|Bergie is a {{term used}} for a {{subsection}} of homeless people in Cape Town, South Africa. The word originates from the Afrikaans berg meaning [...] "mountain" [...] - the term originally referred to the homeless people who sheltered in the forests of the slopes of Table Mountain. The <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> stroller typically refers to street children living a bergie lifestyle.|$|R
6000|$|The {{remainder}} of the week passed as weeks are apt to pass in the country, and in summer. Feeling myself so often uncomfortable in {{the society of the}} girls, I was much in the fields; always possessing the good excuse of beginning to look after my own affairs. Mr. Hardinge took charge of the Major, an intimacy beginning to spring up between these two respectable old men. There were, indeed, so many points of common feeling, that such a result was not at all surprising. They both loved the church--I beg pardon, the Holy Catholic Protestant Episcopal Church. They both disliked Bonaparte--the Major hated him, but my guardian hated nobody--both venerated Billy Pitt, and both fancied the French Revolution was merely the fulfilment of prophecy, through the agency of the devils. As we are now touching upon times likely to produce important results, let me not be misunderstood. As an old man, aiming, in a new sphere, to keep enlightened the generation that is coming into active life, {{it may be necessary to}} explain. An attempt has been made to induce the country to think that Episcopalian and tory were something like <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms,</b> in the [...] "times that tried men's souls." [...] This is sufficiently impudent, per se, in a country that possessed Washington, Jay, Hamilton, the Lees, the Morrises, the late Bishop White, and so many other distinguished patriots of the Southern and Middle States; but men are not particularly scrupulous when there is an object to be obtained, even though it be pretended that Heaven is an incident of that object. I shall, therefore, confine my explanations to what I have said about Billy Pitt and the French.|$|E
60|$|The {{licensing}} day came, and the red-faced landlord of the Jolly Boatmen {{walked into}} the town-hall, looking as jolly as need be, having actually put on an extra fiddle for that night, to commemorate {{the anniversary of the}} Jolly Boatmen's music licence. It was applied for in due form, and was just about to be granted as a matter of course, when up rose Nicholas Tulrumble, and drowned the astonished corporation in a torrent of eloquence. He descanted in glowing terms upon the increasing depravity of his native town of Mudfog, and the excesses committed by its population. Then, he related how shocked he had been, to see barrels of beer sliding down into the cellar of the Jolly Boatmen week after week; and how he had sat at a window opposite the Jolly Boatmen for two days together, to count the people who went in for beer between the hours of twelve and one o'clock alone--which, by-the-bye, was the time at which the great majority of the Mudfog people dined. Then, he went on to state, how {{the number of people who}} came out with beer-jugs, averaged twenty-one in five minutes, which, being multiplied by twelve, gave two hundred and fifty-two people with beer-jugs in an hour, and multiplied again by fifteen (the number of hours during which the house was open daily) yielded three thousand seven hundred and eighty people with beer-jugs per day, or twenty-six thousand four hundred and sixty people with beer-jugs, per week. Then he proceeded to show that a tambourine and moral degradation were <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms,</b> and a fiddle and vicious propensities wholly inseparable. All these arguments he strengthened and demonstrated by frequent references to a large book with a blue cover, and sundry quotations from the Middlesex magistrates; and in the end, the corporation, who were posed with the figures, and sleepy with the speech, and sadly in want of dinner into the bargain, yielded the palm to Nicholas Tulrumble, and refused the music licence to the Jolly Boatmen.|$|E
6000|$|She {{proceeded}} to avow her passionate {{interest in the}} feminist movement of which this agitation for the vote was merely the symbol. (A voice: [...] "No!") No one could be {{more aware of the}} falsity of woman's position at the present time than she was--she seemed to be speaking right across the room to Trafford--they were neither pets nor partners, but something between the two; now indulged like spoilt children, now blamed like defaulting partners; constantly provoked to use the arts of their sex, constantly mischievous because of that provocation. She caught her breath and stopped for a moment, as if she had suddenly remembered the meeting intervening between herself and Trafford. No, she said, there was no more ardent feminist and suffragist than herself in the room. She wanted the vote and everything it implied with all her heart. With all her heart. But every way to get a thing wasn't the right way, and she felt with every fibre of her being that this petulant hostility to the census was a wrong way and an inconsistent way, and likely to be an unsuccessful way--one that would lose them the sympathy and help of just that class of men they should look to for support, the cultivated and scientific men. (A voice: [...] "Do we want them?") What was the commonest charge made by the man in the street against women?--that they were unreasonable and unmanageable, that it was their way to get things by crying and making an irrelevant fuss. And here they were, as a body, doing that very thing! Let them think what the census and all that modern organization of vital statistics of which it was the central feature stood for. It stood for order, for the replacement of guesses and emotional generalization by a clear knowledge of facts, for the replacement of instinctive and violent methods, by which women had everything to lose (a voice: [...] "No!") by reason and knowledge and self-restraint, by which women had everything to gain. To her the advancement of science, the progress of civilization, and the emancipation of womanhood were nearly <b>synonymous</b> <b>terms.</b> At any rate, they were different phases of one thing. They were different aspects of one wider purpose. When they struck at the census, she felt, they struck at themselves. She glanced at Trafford as if she would convince him that this was the real voice of the suffrage movement, and sat down amidst a brief, polite applause, that warmed to rapture as Agatha Alimony, the deep-voiced, stirring Agatha, rose to reply.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> Hermetical is also attested in the 17th century. Sir Thomas Browne in his Religio Medici of 1643 wrote: [...] "Now besides these {{particular}} and divided Spirits, {{there may be}} (for ought I know) a universal and common Spirit to the whole world. It was the opinion of Plato, and is yet of the Hermeticall Philosophers." [...] (R. M. Part 1:2) ...|$|R
50|$|Mother dough often {{refers to}} a sourdough, and in this context the term starter often {{refers to a}}ll {{or a piece of}} mother dough; however, mother dough may also refer to a first-generation yeast sponge; so the process used in {{relation}} to the ingredients and fermentation times is important to understanding yeast versus sourdough methods. A roughly <b>synonymous</b> <b>term</b> used in French baking is Chef.|$|R
5000|$|According to some on-line dictionaries, a {{multiprocessor}} is {{a computer}} system having two or more processing units (multiple processors) each sharing main memory and peripherals, in order to simultaneously process programs. A 2009 textbook defined multiprocessor system similarly, but noting that the processors may share [...] "some {{or all of the}} system’s memory and I/O facilities"; it also gave tightly coupled system as a <b>synonymous</b> <b>term.</b>|$|R
