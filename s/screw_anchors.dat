50|$|Screw piles can be {{referred}} to as screw-piles, steel screw-in foundations, screw piers, helical piles, helical anchors, <b>screw</b> <b>anchors,</b> screw foundations and helical piers. Screw piles were first described by the Irish civil engineer Alexander Mitchell in a paper in Civil Engineer's and Architects Journal in 1848 - however, helical piles had been used for almost a decade by this point. Screw foundations first appeared in the 1800s as pile foundations for lighthouses, and were extensively used for piers in harbours. Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 screw-pile lighthouses were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of 2000 kN. Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.|$|E

The tests were carried out on one, two, three and four numbers of anchors in sand for different depths of embedment keeping shallow and deep mode of behaviour in mind. The testing program included 48 tests conducted on three model anchors installed in sand whose density kept constant throughout the tests. It was observed that the ultimate pullout load varied significantly with the installation depth of the anchor and the number of anchors. The apparent coefficient of friction (f*) between anchor and soil was also calculated based on the test results. It was found that the apparent coefficient of friction varies between 1. 02 and 4. 76 for 1, 2, 3 and 4 numbers of single, double and triple helical <b>screw</b> <b>anchors.</b> Plate load tests conducted on model soil showed that the value of ф increases from 35 o for virgin soil to 48 o for soil with four double screw helical anchors.

40|$|For {{capacity}} evaluation, {{the structural}} assessment of existing structures is necessary. Concrete strength {{is an important}} parameter for such assessment. Non-destructive tests (NDTs) are used along with the traditional approach of core testing for strength assessment of concrete in existing structures. The low reliability of NDT results leads to uncertainty in assessing concrete strength. A new method of non-destructive testing is {{presented in this paper}} with the aim of achieving better reliability and reducing uncertainty in the assessment of mortar strength. This approach is based on a modified pullout of post-installed <b>screw</b> <b>anchors.</b> The technique involves a pushin mechanism for a steel screw inside the mortar where a void underneath the screw is left to allow for the uninterrupted movement of the screw inside the concrete.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{occasionally}} observed clinically noticeable postoperative {{transverse plane}} pelvic rotation increase (TPPRI) {{in the direction}} of direct thoracolumbar/lumbar rotational corrective load applied during posterior instrumentation and arthrodesis for double (Lenke 3 and 6) adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) curves. Our purposes were to document this occurrence; identify its frequency, associated variables, and natural history; and determine its effect upon patient outcome. Methods Transverse plane pelvic rotation (TPPR) can be quantified using the left/right hemipelvis width ratio as measured on standing posterior-anterior scoliosis radiographs. Descriptive statistics were done to determine means and standard deviations. Non-parametric statistical tests were used due to the small sample size and non-normally distributed data. Significance was set at P Results Seventeen of 21 (81 %) consecutive patients with double curves (7 with Lenke 3 curves and 10 with Lenke 6) instrumented with lumbar pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>anchors</b> to achieve direct rotation had a complete sequence of measurable radiographs. While 10 of these 17 had no postoperative TPPRI, 7 did all {{in the direction of}} the rotationally corrective thoracolumbar instrumentation load. Two preoperative variables were associated with postoperative TPPRI: more tilt of the vertebra below the lower instrumented vertebra (- 23 ° ± 3. 1 ° vs. - 29 ° ± 4. 6 °, P = 0. 014) and concurrent anterior thoracolumbar discectomy and arthrodesis (5 of 10 vs. 7 of 7, P = 0. 044). Patients with a larger thoracolumbar/lumbar angle of trunk inclination or larger lower instrumented vertebra plus one to sacrum fractional/hemicurve were more likely to have received additional anterior thoracolumbar discectomy and arthrodesis (c = 0. 90 and c = 0. 833, respectively). Postoperative TPPRI resolved in 5 of the 7 by intermediate follow-up at 12 months. Patient outcome was not adversely affected by postoperative TPPRI, whether or not it persisted. Conclusions Our findings suggest that TPPRI is a decompensation caused by extension of the corrective thoracolumbar rotational load into the lumbosacral hemicurve below. As posterior instrumentation of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis becomes increasingly more effective in the transverse plane, postoperative TPPRI may become more widely noticed. This study provides some assurance that recompensation usually occurs, but that in either event TPPRI does not seem to affect clinical outcome. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design the test setup, perform the model tests, and process the data to find the wave forces on a {{submerged}} breakwater. Breakwaters are coastal protection structures used to help prevent {{the erosion of the}} shoreline. Submerged breakwaters are a more recently developed type of offshore detached breakwater that does not interfere with the ocean view and still helps prevent the longshore transport of sediment. For submerged breakwaters that are made of a single structure and placed on the seafloor, the forces must be estimated to ensure proper anchoring. The prototype submerged breakwater that was examined was a 40 ft long 14 ft diameter half cylinder. The model tested in the laboratory was a 4 : 1 scale, with a model diameter of 3. 4 ft and a length of 10 ft. The estimated forcing on the structure came from measurements during model testing in the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory wave tank. Both regular sinusoidal waves and irregular waves were generated. The significant wave heights ranged from 0. 75 ft to 1. 0 ft and wave periods varied from 2. 0 sec to 3. 0 sec using a JONSWAP wave spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3. 3. Theoretical calculations were completed to help size the instrumentation needed to conduct the experiments. Theoretical calculations were based on the drag law to obtain the force, and Airy as well as Stokes 2 nd Order wave theory to obtain the orbital velocities. It was found that the maximum expected load for all cases at the anchor without any factor of safety (FOS) is 38 lb in shear and 9. 9 lb of uplift force. This equates to prototype forces of 2, 433 lb of shear and 633 lb of uplift force. Using a FOS of 2. 0 the prototype horizontal reaction force required is 4, 866 lb and the prototype uplift reaction is 1, 266 lb. A total prototype reaction force of 5, 028 lbs per anchor is needed.

40|$|Conventionally, {{noncompliance}} distal {{movement of}} molars relies exclusively on intraoral anchorage. The distal screw, a distal jet appliance supplemented by two paramedian mini-implants, is an innovative alternative. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the suitability of this device to move molars bodily and distally. The effects of the distal screw were evaluated in a sample of 18 consecutively treated preadolescent and adolescent individuals (nine females and nine males; mean age at the start of treatment, 11. 2 years). Two conical mini-implants (length 11. 0 mm, diameter 1. 5 to 2. 2 mm) were placed in the anterior paramedian area of the palate of each patient. The coil springs of the device were activated to deliver a force of 240 cN per side. The dental and skeletal effects were investigated on pre- and posttreatment cephalometric radiographs. The distal screw produced a Class I occlusion of the first molars by moving them distally 4. 7 mm, which is more than conventional appliances can accomplish. Although this took longer than conventional devices (9. 1 months), it had the advantage of a roughly 2. 1 -mm premolar distal movement (ie, no anchorage loss as with traditional techniques).

METHODS: We conducted 30 uniaxial vertical pullout tests using Material Testing System Instron 5566 A until failure of the anchorage defined as rupture of the threads or anchor or detachment of the anchor. Anchor fixation was on tuberosities of fresh bovine humerus bone. ASAs were spaced four millimetres apart and were compared with a control SA implanted on the same greater tubercle at two centimetres. The tests were all performed at room temperature in a dry environment. Tensile loads (10 mm/min) were applied parallel to the axis of insertion.

40|$|Introduction: The cranioplasty is a {{classical}} surgical procedure to repair large skull defects. The prosthesis fracture was one rare complication following cranioplasty, {{which was only}} known to happen in traumatic head injury or child growing skull. Presentation of case: In the current report, we documented the first reported case of cranioplasty prosthesis fracture in an adult neurological trauma patient at the proximal pterion point region without head trauma. During the first cranioplasty, due to the cerebromalacia at temporal lobe, patient’s temporalis muscle was not stripped from the dura mater and the prosthesis was anchored outside the temporalis muscle. Thus, no screw was used for anchoring the prosthesis at the basitemporal skull. The prosthesis fracture was observed on 12 th-month post-surgically at the proximal pterion point region. During the second cranioplasty, the temporalis muscle was semi-partitioned from the back due to cerebromalacia recovery and five screws were used to anchor the prosthesis onto the basitemporal skull. The follow-up result was unremarkable on 21 st-month post-second-cranioplasty. Discussion: A dynamic load was generated on the prosthesis due to head-pillow contact during sleeping. Via the parietal tuber-temporozygomatic suture line, this inward load generates an outward force at the proximal pterion point region, where became a shearing force locating just right below the lowest <b>screw</b> <b>anchoring</b> in this region. This shearing force eventually led to prosthesis fracture at the proximal pterion point due to the fatigue effect.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} fractionator {{designed for}} {{more efficient and}} accurate separation of medium and fine silt frac-tions from soils and unconsolidated geological sediments i described. Directions are given for its construction and use, including a scaled drawing and photograph of the apparatus. Fractionation of soils and unconsolidated geo-logical sediments into particle-size separates for subsequent mineralogical analysis is a laborious and time consuming procedure. A sliding-base mechanical fractionator that permits more effi-cient and accurate separation of medium and fine (20 - 5 ~ and 5 - 2 #, respectively) silt fractions from unconsolidated sediments has been de-veloped. For the coarse silt (50 - 20 /z) fraction, the unit developed by Beavers and Jones (1962, p. 303 - 304) is satisfactory and efficient. However, be-cause of long sedimentation times, this unit is too time consuming when separating the medium and fine silt fractions. In {{order to reduce the}} sedimentation time but retain the same prin-ciple of operation, the design was modified so the unit could be placed under a centrifugal force. The fractionator developed is shown in figures 1 and 2. The apparatus consists of a plexiglas cylinder mounted on a plexiglas slide, the latter being held under pressure against a teflon plate by two adjustable plexiglas slide clamps. The teflon plate is cemented to the slide base with a Flurocarbon teflon bonding kit and fixed in place with 10 flathead brass screws.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{subsidence}} displacement after cyclic loading among 4 sacral pedicle screw fixations of bicortical, tricortical, standard polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation, and sub-endplate PMMA augmentation in osteoporotic condition. Summary of background data: Implant failure caused by screw loosening is a clinical problem for lumbosacral fusions, especially in osteoporotic patients. To improve sacral <b>screw</b> <b>anchoring</b> strength, the main fixation techniques {{need to be}} evaluated biomechanically. Methods: For this study, 11 fresh osteoporotic cadaver sacra were harvested and bone mineral density was measured with dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry. A 7 mm diameter monoaxial pedicle screw (S 1) was randomly assigned by side (left vs. right) and placed bicortically or tricortically. The 2 screws, followed 2000 cyclic compression loading of 30 to 250 N, were removed. The screw tracts were filled up with PMMA, then, screws 5 mm shorter than the bicortical or tricortical fixation were reinserted (defined as standard and sub-endplate PMMA augmented sacral screw fixations, respectively). The PMMA augmented screws were then retested as before. Screw subsidence displacement after 2000 cyclic loading was measured and compared. Results: The average bone mineral density of 11 specimens was 0. 71 g/cm, ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 78 g/cm. No significant difference of subsidence displacement was detected between tricortical and standard PMMA augmented screws (P> 0. 05), however, the 2 fixations exhibited markedly less subsidence than bicortical screw (P< 0. 05). Sub-endplate PMMA augmented screw showed the least subsidence among all the screws (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: PMMA augmentation can increase the bonding strength of sacral screw-bone interface and the sub-endplate PMMA augmented sacral screw could obtain the highest stability among the 4 fixation techniques in osteoporotic condition. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A Collégia™ cup (Wright Medical France, Créteil, France) was impacted in 23 total hip arthroplasty acetabular component revisions, including 17 cases of SOFCOT grade- 1 bone-stock loss and six of grade 2. ResultsThere were six clinically poor results on the Merle D’Aubigné scale. One case of early migration occurred, in a multioperated acetabulum. There was one isolated dislocation and one recurrent dislocation associated with loose greater trochanter nonunion, but tolerated as it was infrequent. DiscussionThis option simplifies revision surgery and limits the risk of dislocation if the abductor muscles unit is continuous. It is indicated when local bone-site compromise encompass a wall-contained cavitary defect at most. A medial wall defect, if moderate, does not in our view preclude using a primary cup, impacted with {{a certain degree of}} protrusion. Longer-term follow-up will be needed to confirm these medium-term findings. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Prospective non comparative therapeutic study...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report open {{reduction}} and joint stabilization using a prosthetic capsule technique {{for treatment of}} a craniodorsal coxofemoral luxation in a lightweight pony. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical report. ANIMALS: Pony stallion (8 years old, 113 kg). METHODS: A craniodorsal approach to the coxofemoral joint was performed under general anesthesia. After open reduction, a prosthetic capsule technique was used. Four 3. 5 mm self-tapping cortical <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> were implanted: 2 screws were inserted above the cranial aspect of the dorsal acetabular rim, and 2 screws were inserted into the femoral neck. Subsequently, a # 5 USP ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene suture was placed through these <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> in figure- 8 fashion {{to serve as a}} prosthetic capsule. Routine closure and a medial patellar desmotomy completed the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the pony was cross tied for 4 weeks to prevent it from lying down. RESULTS: Neither short-term nor long-term complications occurred and the pony was sound at the follow-up examination performed 15 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: A prosthetic capsule technique can be used successfully to stabilize the coxofemoral joint after open reduction of a craniodorsal luxation in a lightweight pony...|$|R
50|$|Being able {{to degrade}} into {{innocuous}} lactic acid, PLA {{is used as}} medical implants {{in the form of}} <b>anchors,</b> <b>screws,</b> plates, pins, rods, and as a mesh. Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down inside the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body (e.g. the bone) as that area heals. The strength characteristics of PLA and PLLA implants are well documented.|$|R
