5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E
500|$|In {{his youth}} at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Margarita, Crown Princess of Romania. Margarita said about it: [...] "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing." [...] An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: [...] "She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1940, Jill Esmond {{agreed to}} divorce Laurence Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Vivien, {{although}} they maintained a strong friendship {{for the rest}} of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On 31 August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California, in a ceremony attended only by their hosts, Ronald and Benita Colman and witnesses, Katharine Hepburn and Garson Kanin. Leigh had made a screen test and hoped to co-star with Olivier in Rebecca, which was to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock with Olivier in the leading role. After viewing Leigh's screen test, David Selznick noted that [...] "she doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> as to sincerity or age or innocence", a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh's mentor, George Cukor.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the release}} of Return of the Jedi, the name Jabba the Hutt has become synonymous in American mass media with repulsive obesity. The name is {{utilized}} as a literary device—either as a simile or metaphor—to illustrate character flaws. For example, in Under the Duvet (2001), Marian Keyes references a problem with gluttony when she writes, [...] "wheel out the birthday cake, I feel a Jabba the Hutt moment coming on." [...] Likewise, in the novel Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family (2000), Laura Kalpakian uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize {{the weight of a}} character's father: [...] "The girls used to call Janice's parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookiee. But then Jabba (Janice's father) died, and it didn't <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> to speak of the dead on those terms." [...] In Dan Brown's first novel Digital Fortress, an NSA technician is affectionately nicknamed Jabba the Hutt.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN said he {{was happy}} with the new, {{unpredictable}} direction The Office was taking. He particularly praised the Michael/Pam relationship in the episode, as well as soccer subplot involving Jim and Charles {{and the return of}} Ryan; he said Ryan's new bleached blond hair and his theft of bowling shoes were particularly funny moments. Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode has provided a change the show needed, and said, [...] "Considering how unlikely it was that The Office was going to allow Michael and Pam to degrade into homelessness and squalor, the show has handled the predictable transition as well as possible." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the episode included a good exploration of Michael and Pam's relationship; he said [...] "they're weirdly good together". Phipps, who gave the episode an A- grade, also said the Dunder Mifflin material worked well, [...] "although Idris Elba has been so good at portraying a heartless professional it almost doesn’t <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> for anything to break through his icy exterior." ...|$|E
500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn thing out of this tax problem. I listen to one side, and they <b>seem</b> <b>right,</b> and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E

500|$|Planning and rehearsals for {{the concert}} took {{about three weeks}} in a Manhattan theater. The rehearsals were {{characterized}} by past tensions that resurfaced between the performers under the intense time pressure. Paul Simon later said: [...] "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time." [...] An early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance, with Simon allotted the greater amount of time, and to conclude with the duo performing their joint works. This idea was rejected because, according to Garfunkel, [...] "It didn't <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> to either of us that Paul should be the opening act for Simon & Garfunkel, {{and for him to}} follow Simon & Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense". The two decided to perform most of the show together, with room for each to showcase some solo material. [...] Simon, who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus, interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for the concert preparations. He used the live show as an opportunity to test one of his new songs in front of an audience. Garfunkel also planned to present a new song, [...] "A Heart in New York", from his soon-to-be released album Scissors Cut.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album’s lyrics, Kris Ex from Pitchfork said [...] "The rhymes {{here are}} at once {{conversational}} and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. The lyrics are 25 years old. But were they released today they'd <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> on time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weil {{recalled}} that, [...] "after Phil, Barry and I finished , {{we took it}} over to the Righteous Brothers. Bill Medley, who has the low voice, {{seemed to}} like the song." [...] However, Medley initially felt that the song didn't suit their more up-tempo rhythm and blues style, and Mann and Spector had sung the song in a higher key: [...] "And we just thought, [...] "Wow, what a good song for The Everly Brothers." [...] But it didn't <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> for us." [...] The song, which has a very big range, was originally written at a higher key of F. To accommodate Medley's baritone voice, this was gradually lowered, eventually down to C, which, together with slowing the song down, changed the [...] "whole vibe of the song" [...] according to Medley.|$|E

2500|$|A few {{analysts have}} offered their {{opinions}} about the film's performance at the Indian box office. Trade analyst Komal Nahta commented, [...] "There {{was a problem with}} the title itself. Slumdog is not a familiar word for majority Indians." [...] In addition, trade analyst Amod Mehr has stated that with the exception of Anil Kapoor, the film lacks recognisable stars and that [...] "the film... is not ideally suited for Indian sentiment." [...] A cinema owner commented that [...] "to hear slum boys speaking perfect English doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> but when they are speaking in Hindi, the film seems much more believable." [...] The dubbed Hindi version, Slumdog Crorepati, did better at the box office, and additional copies of that version were released. Following the film's success at the 81st Academy Awards, the film's takings in India increased by 470% the following week, bringing its total up to $6.3million that week. As of 15 March 2009, Slumdog Crorepati had grossed [...] at the Indian box office.|$|E
2500|$|Side B {{begins with}} one of the band's only {{politically}} based songs, [...] "My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)" [...] The lyrics comprised Joey, Dee Dee, and Beauviour's feelings while watching US President Ronald Reagan visit military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany to pay tribute to the victims of Nazism. In an interview with East Coast Rocker, Joey explained: [...] "What Reagan did was fucked up. Everybody told him not to go, all his people told him not to go, and he went anyway. How can you fuckin' forgive the Holocaust? How can you say, 'Oh well, it's OK now?' That's crazy!" [...] Dee Dee also asserted that Johnny had made the band <b>seem</b> <b>right</b> winged. [...] "It {{was the first time we}} could make a statement to show we weren't prejudiced," [...] he explained. [...] "We'd just had these skinheads at or gigs, punks walking around wearing swastikas." [...] Johnny disliked the song and went so far as to never play the song live, saying Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime.|$|E
