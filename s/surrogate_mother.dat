After {{another round}} of IVF fails, Toyah is told that future {{treatment}} is not recommended as problems with her uterus mean she is very unlikely to ever get pregnant. She and Peter look into surrogacy after talking to Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston). She and Peter are accepted as clients by a surrogacy agency and Jackie, a <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother,</b> agrees to carry their baby after meeting them.|$|E
50|$|Agent Grant {{arrives at}} the clinic {{in an attempt to}} rescue Claire but finds that she has already given birth. Claire {{explains}} that the embryos the clinic implants in the <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> are parasitic aliens which consume the human host from the inside out. The aliens cannot reproduce on their own, and rely on <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> like Claire for appropriate sites to gestate. Dr. Deanston, the other clinic employees, and all the <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> who have already given birth are aliens wearing the skin of their hosts. Agent Grant is killed by the aliens who have inhabited the bodies of Claire and one of the other <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Pouch-young {{removal and}} cross-fostering trials were {{undertaken}} in the brush-tailed rock-wallaby, Petrogale penicillata, to assess whether this procedure {{could be used to}} accelerate breeding and recruitment in this threatened marsupial species. Basic reproductive data, lacking {{at the time of the}} study, were also collected. Eighteen pouch young, weighing 1 - 106 g, were fostered to either tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, or yellow-footed rock-wallaby, Petrogale xanthopus, <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers.</b> Sixteen P. penicillata pouch young were transferred to <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> whose own young were greater or equal in size to the P. penicillata young being transferred. Fourteen of these young survived (88 %). Two of the P. penicillata pouch young were transferred to <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> whose own young was smaller in size than the P. penicillata young being transferred. Neither survived. Growth curves for pouch young on <b>mothers</b> and <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> were estimated. P. penicillata young reared by <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> grew at a similar rate, and were weaned at a similar age, to the pouch young of the foster species. Like other rock-wallaby species, P. penicillata underwent embryonic diapause and had a gestation period of similar to 30 days. Permanent pouch exit occurred at similar to 200 days and young became sexually mature at similar to 23 months for males and no later than 21 months for females. This study clearly demonstrates that pouch young of P. penicillata, as small as 1 g (similar to 8 days old), can be removed and cross-fostered successfully. These procedures can be used to accelerate breeding and recruitment by up to six times in this threatened species provided an adequate source of <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> is available...|$|R
50|$|Other factors, such as {{new laws}} {{regarding}} reproductive technologies using donated eggs and sperm and <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers,</b> can mean that the female giving birth {{is not necessarily the}} legal mother of the child. For example, in Canada, the federal Human Assisted Reproduction Act provides for the use of hired <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers.</b> The legal mother of the child may, in fact, be the egg donor. Similar laws are in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright and co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin. The idea for Kudrow's character Phoebe becoming a <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> coincided with the actress' real-time pregnancy. The producers {{wanted to find a}} way to use the pregnancy in a narrative for the fourth season and designated the task to the writers. Ribisi and Rupp reprised their recurring roles of Frank Jr. and Alice respectively which was initially difficult as both had filming commitments.|$|E

Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) has agreed to be a <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> for her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp), but is concerned that they are paying $16,000 for the IVF procedure which only has a 25% chance of success, and is helpless to influence the results.|$|E
40|$|People {{faced with}} {{challenging}} life events, such as pregnancy; need social support for well being. Traditionally, this {{support has been}} given via face-to-face contact in communities. It is known that online messaging promotes effective social support among people with disabilities or illnesses, and during life events such as pregnancy and parenting. It has been further suggested that <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers,</b> women who contract with another person or a couple to bear a child, receive less social support from their families than other mothers. What is not known is how effective online social support is for <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> {{and how much they}} rely on the online support. Therefore, this exploratory study was designed to elucidate the relationship between online messaging and social support in <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers.</b> Eighty-five subjects responded to notification posted on active Internet sites established for <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers.</b> During an 8 -week recruitment period in the spring of 2004, these self-selected mothers indicated their interest by entering a link to the online consent form and then into the survey.

5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} {{her college}} reunion at Salve Regina University with Peter, Lois spots her old roommate, Naomi Robinson, {{with whom she}} had a brief lesbian relationship in college.

Assuming that he will participate in a threesome with Lois and Naomi, Peter sends Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian out of the house. After Naomi arrives, she introduces her husband Dale. Peter expects that they will now be participating in an orgy, and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes. When they clear the air to a dismayed Peter that they're not there for sex, Naomi and Dale tell Lois and Peter they've had trouble conceiving and ask Lois to be a <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> for them, and Lois considers the matter.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
5|$|In the fourth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel briefly {{reconcile}} after Ross {{pretends to}} read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him, but continues {{to insist that the}} two were on a break so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey forgives Chandler only after he spends a day in a box as punishment. Phoebe becomes a <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> for her brother and his wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between the girls. Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and the season finale features their wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel decides to attend Ross and Emily's wedding. While saying his vows, Ross uses the wrong name at the altar (Rachel's), to the shock of his bride and the guests.|$|E
5|$|Season 6 {{focuses on}} Rachel Berry, who returns to McKinley after her {{television}} pilot fails. She decides to reconstitute the glee club with all-new McKinley students and with Kurt's help. Will Schuester is now coaching rival club Vocal Adrenaline, while Blaine is coaching the Dalton Academy Warblers. All {{of the new}} main cast members from the fifth season have returned to guest star status in this final season when they appear; Amber Riley as Mercedes rejoins the main cast, and Dot-Marie Jones as Coach Beiste joins the main cast for the first time. The cast members deal with gay marriage, gender identity, transitioning and other social issues. The newly reconstituted club wins the Nationals competition, Sue is fired as principal and Will is hired to be the principal of a McKinley High repurposed as a magnet arts school, with Sam as the new director of New Directions. The finale jumps five years into the future: Rachel has married Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), wins a Tony Award, and is a <b>surrogate</b> <b>mother</b> for Kurt and Blaine (who are themselves Broadway stars). Artie has directed Tina in a film, Mercedes is a highly successful recording artist, and Sue has just been re-elected Vice President of the United States.

40|$|Throughout {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, {{literary}} representations of replacement maternal figures helped normalize forms of surrogate motherhood within Victorian childrearing and caregiving structures. Through cultural and literary study, this dissertation articulates the dialectical relationship that developed between fiction and society as maternal norms developed and shifted. Through {{an analysis of}} advice texts and the social influence of Queen Victoria’s performance of maternal norms, this work expands previous understandings of how motherhood came to be imagined and idealized {{in the early years}} of Victoria’s reign. It then demonstrates how literature highlights the need to revise and expand prevailing understandings of maternity. Next, it reveals how fictional <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> establish power to overcome the threats they pose to social, familial, and maternal constructions. It ultimately demonstrates that <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> help revise maternal norms by playing integral roles in enhancing the future prosperity of the middle and upper classes of England. By unmooring motherhood from biological constraints, fictional <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers</b> call into question the intrinsic nature of dominant maternal norms and open up spaces for female social agency...|$|R

40|$|Embryo {{transfer}} (ET) in mice {{is a key}} {{technique in}} biomedical research, and is carried out mostly via surgery by transferring founder embryos into pseudo-pregnant recipient females. To cover post-operative analgesic requirements in <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers,</b> oral self-administration of painkillers has several advantages, but its effectiveness has also been criticized as voluntary ingestion of the drug can be uncertain. Additionally, concerns about potential negative side effects of analgesics on embryo viability and development have been raised. In this regard, we investigated the impact of orally administered analgesia by comparing the outcome of ET with and without para-cetamol in the drinking water (3. 5 mg/ml) of <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers.</b> Water intake increased significantly when paracetamol, as a sweet-tasting formulation (children's syrup), {{was added to the}} drinking water. Measurements of paracetamol concentrations in blood serum confirmed reasonable drug uptake. Success rate of ETs and the body weight of newborn offspring were not different whether paracetamol was administered for two days after surgery or not. In conclusion, paracetamol in drinking water was consumed voluntarily in substantial doses, without detectable side-effects, by freshly operated <b>surrogate</b> <b>mothers,</b> and can therefore be recommended as a feasible method for providing analgesic treatment for surgical ET in mice...|$|R
