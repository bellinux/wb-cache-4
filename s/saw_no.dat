5|$|Even though Lazar Kaganovich and Kalinin {{were both}} {{commissioned}} {{before the end}} of the war, they <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> action during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945; in any event, Lazar Kaganovich was not fully completed until 29 January 1947.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's Imperial Guard, {{the only}} unit on the {{battlefield}} that <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> fighting, was available to swing into action at a moment's notice.

5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was unprepared to fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{served in}} the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the {{operations}} off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto, and Valona; they <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet {{for a few years}} after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank.

Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which <b>saw</b> <b>No.</b> 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E

The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
