30|$|The polymer {{waveguide}} optical biosensor {{based on}} the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) by using <b>spectral</b> <b>splitting</b> effect is investigated. The MZI based biosensor has two unequal width sensing arms. With the different mode dispersion responses of the two-arm waveguides to the cladding refractive index change, the <b>spectral</b> <b>splitting</b> effect of the output interference spectrum is obtained, inducing a very high sensitivity. The influence of the different mode dispersions between the two-arm waveguides on the <b>spectral</b> <b>splitting</b> characteristic is analyzed. By choosing different lengths of the two unequal width sensing arms, the initial dip wavelength of the interference spectrum and the <b>spectral</b> <b>splitting</b> range can be controlled flexibly. The polymer waveguide optical biosensor is designed, and its sensing property is analyzed. The {{results show that the}} sensitivity of the polymer waveguide optical biosensor by using <b>spectral</b> <b>splitting</b> effect is as high as 104 nm/RIU, with an improvement of 2 – 3 orders of magnitude compared with the slot waveguide based microring biosensor.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the expected galactic supernova neutrino signal at large next-generation underground detectors. At different epochs after the explosion, the primary fluxes {{can be quite}} different. For these primary neutrino fluxes, <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> induced by collective neutrino flavor transformations can arise for either mass hierarchy in both neutrino and antineutrino channels.

40|$|Neutrino-neutrino {{interactions}} inside core-collapse supernovae {{may give}} rise to collective flavor oscillations resulting in swap between flavors. These oscillations depend on the initial energy spectra, and relative fluxes or relative luminosities of the neutrinos. It has been observed that departure from energy equipartition among different flavors can {{give rise to}} one or more sharp spectral swap over energy, termed as splits. We study the occurrence of splits in the neutrino and antineutrino spectra, varying the initial relative fluxes for different models of initial energy spectrum, in both normal and inverted hierarchy. These initial relative flux variations give rise to several possible split patterns whereas variation over different models of energy spectra give similar results. We explore the effect of these <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> on the electron fraction, $Y_e$, that governs r-process nucleosynthesis inside supernovae. Since <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> modify the electron neutrino and antineutrino spectra in the region where r-process is postulated to happen, and since the pattern of <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> depends on the initial conditions of the spectra and the neutrino mass hierarchy, we show that the condition $Y_e < 0. 5 $ required for successful r-process nucleosynthesis will lead to constraints on the initial spectral conditions, for a given neutrino mass hierarchy.

40|$|Neutrinos {{streaming}} off {{a supernova}} core transform collectively by neutrino-neutrino interactions, leading to "spectral splits" where an energy E_split divides the transformed spectrum sharply into parts of almost pure but different flavors. We present {{a detailed description}} of the <b>spectral</b> <b>split</b> phenomenon which is conceptually and quantitatively understood in an adiabatic treatment of neutrino-neutrino effects. Central to this theory is a self-consistency condition in the form of two sum rules (integrals over the neutrino spectra that must equal certain conserved quantities).

40|$|It was {{recently}} realized that three-flavor effects could peculiarly modify {{the development of}} <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> induced by collective oscillations, for supernova neutrinos emitted during the cooling phase of a protoneutron star. We systematically explore this case, explaining how {{the impact of these}} three-flavor effects depends on the ordering of the neutrino masses. In inverted mass hierarchy, the solar mass splitting gives rise to instabilities in regions of the (anti) neutrino energy spectra that were otherwise stable under the leading two-flavor evolution governed by the atmospheric mass splitting and by the 1 - 3 mixing angle. As a consequence, the high-energy <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> found in the electron (anti) neutrino spectra disappear, and are transferred to other flavors. Imperfect adiabaticity leads to smearing of spectral swap features. In normal mass hierarchy, the three-flavor and the two-flavor instabilities act in the same region of the neutrino energy spectrum, leading to only minor departures from the two-flavor treatment.

Splitting of speech using time-varying comb filters, in which the bands of the comb filter are cyclically swept to have spectral and temporal splitting simultaneously, provided improvement in features of place and duration, without affecting the other features. An overall evaluation has been carried out, by conducting listening tests on seven normal hearing subjects with simulated hearing loss, on the three processing schemes: (i) <b>spectral</b> <b>splitting</b> with comb filters based on auditory critical bands designed for minimum spectral distortion and perceptual balance, (ii) temporal splitting with inter-aural switching of 20, 40, and 80 ms with trapezoidal fading functions of 70 % duty cycle and 3 ms transition, and (iii) combined spectral and temporal splitting using time-varying comb filters with sweep cycles of 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 ms, each with 4, 8, and 16 shiftings.

40|$|Collective flavor {{oscillations}} {{are known}} to bring multiple splits in the supernova (SN) neutrino and antineutrino spectra. These <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> depend {{not only on the}} mass hierarchy of the neutrinos but also on the initial relative flux composition. Observation of <b>spectral</b> <b>splits</b> in a future galactic supernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of the neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) comprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and since different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial fluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of collective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra. Since the actual distribution of SN with initial relative flux spectra of the neutrinos and antineutrinos is unknown, we assume a log-normal distribution for them. We study the dependence of the hierarchy sensitivity to the mean and variance of the log-normal distribution function. We find that the hierarchy sensitivity depends crucially on the mean value of the relative initial luminosity. The effect of the width is to reduce the hierarchy sensitivity for all values of the mean initial relative luminosity. We find that in the very small mixing angle (θ_ 13) limit considering only statistical errors even for very moderate values of variance, there is almost no detectable hierarchy sensitivity if the mean relative luminosities of ν_e and ν̅_e are greater than 1.
