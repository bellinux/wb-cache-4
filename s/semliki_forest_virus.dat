25|$|Recombinant alphavirus-based vectors {{have been}} used to improve DNA {{vaccination}} efficiency. The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus replicon, replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural replicase genes intact. The Sindbis virus and <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>virus</b> {{have been used}} to build recombinant alphavirus replicons. Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells and are only transiently expressed. Alphavirus replicase genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it {{may be due to the}} high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proteolytic}} maturation of P62 into E2 and E3 {{causes a}} change in the viral surface. Together the E1, E2, and sometimes E3, glycoprotein [...] "spikes" [...] form an E1/E2 dimer or an E1/E2/E3 trimer, where E2 extends from the centre to the vertices, E1 fills the space between the vertices, and E3, if present, is at the distal end of the spike. Upon exposure of the virus to the acidity of the endosome, E1 dissociates from E2 to form an E1 homotrimer, which is necessary for the fusion step to drive the cellular and viral membranes together. The alphaviral glycoprotein E1 is a class II viral fusion protein, which is structurally different from the class I fusion proteins found in influenza virus and HIV. The structure of the <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>virus</b> revealed a structure that {{is similar to that of}} flaviviral glycoprotein E, with three structural domains in the same primary sequence arrangement. The E2 glycoprotein functions to interact with the nucleocapsid through its cytoplasmic domain, while its ectodomain is responsible for binding a cellular receptor. Most alphaviruses lose the peripheral protein E3, but in Semliki viruses it remains associated with the viral surface.|$|E
2500|$|Alphaviruses are of {{interest}} to gene therapy researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>virus,</b> and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses. [...] Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to integrate the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations {{to the use of}} alphaviruses in the field of gene therapy due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death. [...] The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create replicon vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecombinant <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses</b> (SFV) that express one or {{none of the}} viral {{structural}} proteins {{were used}} to infect cells and to analyze the fate of incoming superinfecting wild-type viruses. It was found {{that in addition to}} the previously described block in replication that superinfecting viruses encounter within 15 min of infection, other mechanisms of superinfection inhibition occurred at later times. Over a 6 -hr infection period, inhibition was seen in binding of virus to the cell surface, in acid-activated penetration into the cytoplasm, and in uncoating of nucleocapsids. For each of these processes, the inhibitory mechanism was investigated. In summary, we found that infection evoked several independent mechanisms for blocking the entry and uncoating of superinfecting viruses.

40|$|Few {{structures}} of viral serine proteases, those encoded by the Sindbis and <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses,</b> hepatitis C virus (HCV) and cytomegalovirus, have been reported. In {{the life cycle}} of HCV a crucial role is played by a chymotrypsin-like serine protease encoded at the N- terminus of the viral NS 3 protein, the solution structure of which we present here complexed with a covalently bound reversible inhibitor. Unexpectedly, the residue in the P 2 position of the inhibitor induces an effective stabilization of the catalytic His-Asp hydrogen bond, by shielding that region of the protease from the solvent. This interaction appears crucial in the activation of the enzyme catalytic machinery and represents an unprecedented observation for this family of enzymes. Our data suggest that natural substrates of this serine protease could contribute to the enzyme activation by a similar induced- fit mechanism. The high degree of similarity at the His-Asp catalytic site region between HCV NS 3 and other viral serine proteases suggests that this behaviour could be a more general feature for this category of viral enzymes...|$|R

40|$|The {{complete}} gene 4 {{nucleotide sequence}} was determined for rhesus rotavirus {{and each of}} 11 viral variants selected by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Gene 4 is 2362 bases in length and encodes a protein, VP 3, of 776 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 86, 500. A conserved trypsin cleavage site, located at amino acid 247, divides VP 3 into VP 8 and VP 5. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed at VP 3 were used to select variants that escaped neutralization. Each variant contains a single gene 4 mutation that permits viral growth {{in the presence of}} the antibody. Variant mutations were identified in six distinct neutralization regions in VP 8 and VP 5. Five of the six neutralization regions were found in VP 8. The VP 8 regions were primarily associated with strain-specific or limited heterotypic rotavirus neutralization. One region was identified in VP 5 by three monoclonal antibodies that neutralize a broad range of rotavirus serotypes.

Antisera prepared in rabbits against purified SIN or <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses</b> were highly cytotoxic for cells infected with wild-type SIN and for cells infected at the permissive temperature with maturation-defective, ts mutants of SIN belonging to several distinct complementation groups. When these SIN mutants were analyzed by antibody-dependent, complement-mediated cytolysis at the restrictive temperature only cells infected with the SIN mutant of complementation group E, ts 20, participated in both homologous (with anti-SIN serum) and heterologous (with anti-Semliki <b>Forest</b> <b>virus</b> serum) antibody-dependent, complement-mediated cytolysis reactions. These data and the known defect of ts 20 suggested that the cell-associated viral E 1 glycoprotein was a functional target antigen for homologous and cross-immunoreactivity in alphavirus-infected cells. At the restrictive temperature there were quantitative differences in antibody-dependent, complement-mediated cytolysis reactivity of ts 20 - versus wild type-infected cells consistent with the suggestion that ts 20 -infected cells do not fully express all of the homologous or the cross-reactive antigenic determinants found in wild-type infection.

40|$|The calyx of Held {{serves as}} a model for {{synaptic}} transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. While offering unique access to the biophysics of presynaptic function, studies addressing the molecular mechanisms of neurotransmitter exocytosis in this model have been mainly limited to pharmacological interventions. To overcome this experimental limitation we used stereotaxic delivery of viral gene shuttles to rapidly and selectively manipulate protein composition in the calyx terminal in vivo. Sindbis or <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses</b> encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected into the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of rats (postnatal days 7 - 21) and yielded bright fluorescence in cells of the VCN, including globular bushy cells with their axon and calyx terminal. Fluorescence imaging and three dimensional reconstructions visualized developmental changes in calyx morphology. Small cytoplasmic and synaptic vesicle proteins were successfully overexpressed in the calyx. We extended two-photon microscopy to obtain simultaneous fluorescence and infrared scanning gradient contrast images, allowing for efficient patch-clamp recordings from EGFP-labelled calyces in acute brain slices (postnatal days 9 - 14). Recordings of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and short-term depression in synapses overexpressing EGFP or synaptophysin-EGFP revealed normal synaptic function. Thus, Sindbis and <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> virus-directed overexpression of proteins in the calyx of Held provides a new avenue for molecular structure-function studies of mammalian central synapses...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} system for {{generating}} infectious papillomaviruses in vitro that facilitates the analysis of papillomavirus assembly, infectivity, and serologic relatedness. Cultured hamster BPHE- 1 cells harboring autonomously replicating bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV 1) genomes were infected with recombinant <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses</b> that express the structural proteins of BPV 1. When plated on C 127 cells, extracts from cells expressing L 1 and L 2 together induced numerous transformed foci that could be specifically prevented by BPV neutralizing antibodies, demonstrating that BPV infection {{was responsible for the}} focal transformation. Extracts from BPHE- 1 cells expressing L 1 or L 2 separately were not infectious. Although <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> virus-expressed L 1 self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs), viral DNA was detected in particles only when L 2 was coexpressed with L 1, indicating that genome encapsidation requires L 2. Expression of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) L 1 and L 2 together in BPHE- 1 cells also yielded infectious virus. These pseudotyped virions were neutralized by antiserum to HPV 16 VLPs derived from European (114 /K) or African (Z- 1194) HPV 16 variants but not by antisera to BPV VLPs, to a poorly assembling mutant HPV 16 L 1 protein, or to VLPs of closely related genital HPV types. Extracts from BPHE- 1 cells coexpressing BPV L 1 and HPV 16 L 2 or HPV 16 L 1 and BPV L 2 were not infectious. We conclude that (i) mouse C 127 cells express the cell surface receptor for HPV 16 and are able to uncoat HPV 16 capsids; (ii) if a papillomavirus DNA packaging signal exists, then it is conserved between the BPV and HPV 16 genomes; (iii) functional L 1 -L 2 interaction exhibits type specificity; and (iv) protection by HPV virus-like particle vaccines is likely to be type specific...|$|R

40|$|Maximum {{amounts of}} 42 S and 26 S {{single-stranded}} viral RNA and viral structural proteins were synthesized in Aedes albopictus cells at 24 h after Sindbis virus infection. Thereafter, viral RNA and protein syntheses were inhibited. By 3 days postinfection, only small quantities of 42 S RNA and no detectable 26 S RNA or structural proteins were synthesized in infected cells. Superinfection of A. albopictus cells 3 days after Sindbis virus infection with Sindbis, <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest,</b> Una, or Chikungunya alphavirus {{did not lead}} to the synthesis of intracellular 26 S viral RNA. In contrast, infection with snowshoe hare virus, a bunyavirus, induced the synthesis of snowshoe hare virus RNA in both A. Ablpictus cells 3 days after Sindbis virus infection and previously uninfected mosquito cells. These results suggested that at 3 days after infection with Sindbis virus, mosquito cells restricted the replication of both homologous and heterologous alphaviruses but remained susceptible to infection with a bunyavirus. In superinfection experiments the the alphaviruses were differentiated on the basis of plaque morphology and the electrophoretic mobility of their intracellular 26 S viral RNA species. Thus, it was shown that within 1 h after infection with eigher Sindbis or Chikungunya virus, A. albopictus cells were resistant to superinfection with Sindbis, Chikungunya, Una, and <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses.</b> Infected cultures were resistant to superinfection with the homologous virus indefinitely, but maximum resistance to superinfection with heterologous alphaviruses lasted for approximately 8 days.

To provide more reliable IFAs, we established recombinant <b>Semliki</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>viruses</b> (rSFVs) expressing the HHV- 8 -specific proteins ORF 73 and K 8. 1 and used BHK- 21 cells infected with these rSFVs for IFA (ORF 73 -IFA and K 8. 1 -IFA). Expression of the HHV- 8 -specific proteins at very high levels by the rSFV system allowed easy scoring for IFA and thereby increased specificity. The rSFV system also allowed detection of antibodies against glycosylation-dependent epitopes of K 8. 1. Titers measured by rSFV-based IFAs and PEL-based IFAs correlated well (correlation coefficients of > 0. 9), and concordances of seroreactivities between rSFV-based and PEL-based IFAs were > 97 % (κ > 0. 93). K 8. 1 -IFA was more sensitive than either ORF 73 -IFA or peptide ELISAs. Using PEL-based lytic IFA as a reference assay, the sensitivity and specificity of K 8. 1 -IFA were estimated to be 94 and 100 %, respectively.
