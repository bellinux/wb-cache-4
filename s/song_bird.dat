5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common {{starlings}} were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American Acclimatization Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland <b>Song</b> <b>Bird</b> Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.|$|E
500|$|President of the German <b>Song</b> <b>Bird</b> Society, Dekum contributed {{money to}} import German song birds, {{including}} [...] thrushes, starlings, and nightingales, to Oregon. According to one report, the society brought {{a total of}} about 500 German birds to Oregon at various times and released many of them into the wild, mainly in Portland parks. Although birds from these early importations survived for years by some accounts, they all eventually disappeared. Dekum was also president of the German Aid Society of Portland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{chaffinch}} {{was once}} popular as a caged <b>song</b> <b>bird</b> and {{large numbers of}} wild birds were trapped and sold. At {{the end of the}} 19th century trapping even depleted the number of birds in London parks. In 1882 the English publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton issued a guide on the care of caged birds and included the recommendation: [...] "To parents and guardians plagued with a morose and sulky boy, my advice is, buy him a chaffinch." [...] Competitions were held where bets were placed on which caged chaffinch would repeat its song the greatest number of times. The birds were sometimes blinded with a hot needle in the belief that this encouraged them to sing. This practice is the subject of the poem The Blinded Bird by the English author Thomas Hardy which contrasts the cruelty involved in blinding the birds with their zestful song. In Britain the practice of keeping chaffinches as pets declined after the trapping of wild birds was outlawed by the Wild Birds Protection Acts of 1880 to 1896.|$|E

50|$|Often times females mate voluntarily {{with more}} than one male. Mating with several males reduces the risk of females having un{{fertilize}}d eggs because one male may not have enough sperm to fertilize all her eggs. In dark-eyed juncos, a female mates {{with more than}} one male because often times, her social partner is of low genetic quality than other potential sperm donors. The females voluntarily mate with other males besides their mate because she sees the potential to improve her offspring viability and sexual attractiveness. Females may also mate with several males for genetic benefits such as genetic diversity among her offspring due to the variety of sperm available to her. In <b>song</b> <b>birds,</b> extra-pair matings occur because females are able to sneak away from their home territories to solicit to other males. When female <b>song</b> <b>birds</b> seek extra-male partners, they sexually select males with colorful plumage more elaborate than those of their social partner. Studies show that female <b>song</b> <b>birds</b> that have less plumage partners most actively seek extra-pair matings, furthermore males with the most developed traits—such as longer tails or brighter plumage survive better. Thus, when female <b>song</b> <b>birds</b> have multiple mating partners, they are increasing the genetic quality of their offspring.|$|R
