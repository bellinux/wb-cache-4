According to the performed analysis: the change in the plant's <b>specific</b> fuel <b>consumption</b> is determined by the following four statistically important parameters: boiler efficiency; power generation efficiency; heat production efficiency indicators and outdoor temperature. The <b>specific</b> fuel <b>consumption</b> rate, calculated using regression equation, is compared to the <b>specific</b> fuel <b>consumption</b> rate observed in the CHP during operation.
