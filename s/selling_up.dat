On January 27, Six Flags announced the sale of Frontier City and White Water Bay after the 2006 operating season. At the same time, Six Flags announced it would close corporate offices in Oklahoma City, moving its headquarters to New York City. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or <b>selling</b> <b>up</b> to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in (Concord, California), Wild Waves and Enchanted Village in Federal Way, Washington, Splashtown in Houston, Texas and, most notably, Six Flags Magic Mountain.

Ultimately, Six Flags Magic Mountain was spared, with the remaining six parks sold on January 11, 2007 to CNL Lifestyle Properties for $312million: $275million cash and a note for $37million.|$|E

The ability to recognize those passengers willing to "sell up". or pay more for a seat on a given flight is also important, yet it has received little research attention. The proper detection and booking management of these passenger types can allow air carriers to realize higher flight revenues. This dissertation begins with an overview of airline pricing policies and seat inventory control management practices. Current fare structures and fare class designations are described in detail. Airline demand and consumer utility measures are then presented. Consumer behavior during the booking process. particularly in relation to <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> behavior, is discussed. Price elasticities of demand also play an important role in the prediction of <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> behavior. An in-depth description of <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> and its measurement follow. Once specific flights have been identified as having <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> potential, a <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategy can be implemented. Methods of testing the revenue benefits/costs of a particular <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategy were developed and used in an actual airline environment. A study consisting of a preliminary <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> test followed by an expanded study incorporating different <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategies was performed. Revenue results of the <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategies are presented and the impacts of each policy are discussed. Price elasticities of demand were estimated for individual fare classes. In general, <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> was found to be flight specific and more prevalent in the highest two fare classes (in terms of fare values) while being almost non-existent in lower fare classes. 1990 Also issued as an M.

500|$|The first Danish farmer-owned {{co-operative}} bacon factory {{was established}} in 1887. [...] There were soon more, and by 1897 there were dozens. [...] By 1900 the co-operatives outnumbered private enterprises. [...] By this time the export of live pigs had almost ceased, being replaced by export of pork and bacon. [...] There followed intense competition between the co-operatives and private producers, with the co-operatives eventually winning out. [...] The co-operatives had competition from foreign investors as well as indigenous enterprises. [...] The first of these was I. D. Koopmann of Hamburg, who bought and opened new bacon factories {{in order to get}} around the German ban on live pigs. [...] Koopmann refused to do business with the co-operatives, calling the movement [...] "a sick idea". [...] They worked closely with Denny & Co. of London—the Denny family were a major bacon manufacturer in Ireland and between them they controlled {{a large portion of the}} UK market. [...] Denny's took over Koopmann's when the latter got into debt in 1894. [...] Denny's never managed to get on top of the co-operatives, but they held on in Denmark until 1968 when they finally sold what was left of the Danish operation to the Federation of Danish Co-operatives. [...] Another major foreign player, ironically, was the English Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). [...] The CWS had depots in Denmark from 1881, taking advantage of the refusal of London dealers to buy from the co-operatives. [...] From 1899, however, they started setting up their own manufacturing in Denmark. [...] Production grew until 1930 but then slowly declined and CWS started <b>selling</b> <b>up</b> in 1971.|$|E
