"I reckon {{the time}} {{will come when}} {{you will be able}} to go up either the Mississippi or Missouri to the upper waters without seeing a tree {{drifting}} down, and when there won't be a snag in their beds. I mind the time when the snags were ten times worse than they is now. I mind once we ran on one of the darned things in pretty nigh as wild a night as this is going to be. I had six hands along with me, and we wanted to get down, 'cause we knew the old man would have a cargo ready for us, and we wanted a run of a day or two on shore at Orleans before we started up again, so we held on. The wind was higher than we reckoned on, and we was just <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have done better to tie up, when there was a crash. I thought at first that she would have gone over with the shock, but she didn't--not that it would have made much odds, for there was a snag through her bottom, and the water pouring in like a sluice. It was darkish, but we could make out there was some trees a boat's-length or two ahead which had been caught as they rolled down by another snag, and hung there. The boat didn't float more than a minute after she struck, and then we were all in the river, those who couldn't swim gripping hold of the oars and poles; half a minute and we were all clinging to the boughs, and hoisting ourselves as well as might be clear of the water.|$|E
60|$|All the Englishmen got well, {{and were}} discharged. Chapman, the American, however, remained, being {{exceedingly}} feeble {{with the disease}} of the country. With this poor young man, I prayed, as well as I knew how, and read, daily, to his great comfort and consolation, I believe. The reader may imagine how one dying in a strange land, surrounded by idolaters, would lean on a single countryman who was disposed to aid him. In this manner did Chap man lean on me, and all my efforts were to induce him to lean on the Saviour. He thought he had been too great a sinner {{to be entitled to}} any hope, and my great task was to overcome in him some of those stings of conscience which it had taken the grace of God to allay in myself. One day, the last time I was with him, I read the narrative of the thief on the cross. He listened to it eagerly, and when I had ended, for the first time, he displayed some signs of hope and joy. As I left him, he took leave of me, <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never meet again. He asked my prayers, and I promised them. I went to my own ward, and, while actually engaged in redeeming my promise, one came to tell me he had gone. He sent me a message, to say he died a happy man. The poor fellow--happy fellow, would be a better term--sent back all the books he had borrowed; and it will serve to give some idea of the condition we were in, in a temporal sense, if I add, that he also sent me a few coppers, in order that they might contribute to the comfort of his countrymen.|$|E

He said engagement with the Department of Energy and Climate Change had been particularly fruitful, with UCL providing some [...] "focused advice" [...] on the issues it was currently facing, as well as helping it to understand where the research agenda was going and providing it with [...] "wise counsel" [...] about how the coming challenges could be met." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I defend a methodological view {{about how we}} should conduct {{substantive}} ethical inquiries {{in the fields of}} normative and practical ethics. I maintain that the direct plausibility and implausibility of general ethical principles – once fully clarified and understood – should be foundational in our substantive ethical reasoning. I argue that, in order to expose our ethical intuitions about particular cases to maximal critical scrutiny, we must determine whether they can be justified by directly plausible principles. To expose apparently plausible principles to maximal critical scrutiny, we must determine whether their direct plausibility can survive careful clarification of what they are really saying. This means that intuitions about cases are useful only in (a) suggesting principles that must stand on their own two feet, and (b) illustrating or otherwise helping us clarify what a principle is really <b>saying.</b> <b>We</b> <b>should</b> not reject principles that seem most directly plausible after we have fully clarified their content simply because they conflict with our intuitions about cases, because to do so is to side with uncritical prejudices over the teachings of critical scrutiny...|$|E
40|$|What is the {{rationale}} for social policy? By what values and vision should it be oriented? It would seem that almost everyone who has a role in leading public opinion conspires {{to tell us that}} such a fundamental debate cannot be afforded at this time of scarce public resources. That we do not need vision because we cannot afford it. This is a strange conception of public policy. It is actually <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not have a vision. It proposes that we allow the means to establish the ends of public policy, rather than ask what ends should public policy follow, and with what consequences for a public revenue base, and its justification. Why is it that we are not encouraged to think about the ends of public policy at this time? My answer is that it is because we live in an era of laissez-faire. Laissez-faire is a framework for public policy that is designed to free up the market to be selfregulating. The rules for operation of a market economy of any kind derive from government. Government policy of the kind that favours a self-regulating market economy is no less interventionist than any other kind of government policy.
