The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys. Readers are asked to note that, {{with the exception of the}} surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association's magazine Which? and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public. Surveys 69005 - 69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of Which? readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of Which? readers are unlikely to be typical. Main Topics : The loan: date of application; source of loan (including number of lenders approached); type of loan obtained (9 categories); amount borrowed (also represented as a percentage of purchase price); length of loan repayment and interest rate at <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> (also whether repayment was fixed or variable). Data include: whether spouse's income was taken into account and whether there were any problems likely to affect application. Subsequent changes affecting repayment of loan are considered in detail (e. g. where interest rate has been increased, where loan has been added to, where there has been a change in personal circumstances etc.). Respondent is asked to assess service received (e. g. easiness of obtaining loan, time that loan took to arrange and whether this delayed property purchase negotiations, satisfaction with service received from staff of lending institution, assessment of overall treatment received etc.). In addition, respondent is asked if he/she has any suggestions for improving the present situation on borrowing for house purchase (he/she is also given a list of 9 suggestions and asked to rate each for importance on a 5 -point scale. Details of property: description (e. g. detached house/cottage); number of storeys; approximate age; whether sold with NHBRC guarantee (if new); amount paid; whether it was offered freehold (6 categories) and with complete vacant possession. Background Variables Sex, age, marital status, number of children under 21 years, and at time of applying for loan, employment status for self and spouse (i. e. full-time, part-time etc.), whether respondent received a steady income. Pre-tax income for self (joint pre-tax income where applicable) is stated...|$|E
50|$|The Portugal Fund was {{established}} in 1975 when Portugal was still a member of EFTA. It was to provide funding {{for the development of}} Portugal after the Carnation Revolution and the consequential restoration of democracy and the decolonisation of the country's former empire. This followed the period of economic sanctions by most of the international community, having left Portugal economically underdeveloped compared {{to the rest of the}} western Europe. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985 in order join the EEC, the remaining EFTA members decided to continue the Portugal Fund so that Portugal would continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-interest loan from the EFTA member states to the value of USD 100 million. Repayment was originally to commence in 1988, however EFTA then decided to postpone the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>repayments</b> until 1998. The Portugal Fund has now been dissolved.|$|R

40|$|Despite many {{positive}} impacts of micro-credit, some {{studies found that}} micro-credits are not reaching the extreme poor. This study is designed {{to find out the}} major causes why rural women do not join micro-credit programme. The present study conducted case studies on ten dropped out members, three non-NGO/MFI members and five NGO/MFI officials. The important causes for dropout are high interest rate, poor management of loan money by clients, management of default cases by NGO/MFI officials, <b>starting</b> time <b>of</b> <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> instalment, improper utilisation of loan money, husband’s unacceptable interference, lack of training to utilise the money and difficulty in getting large amount of loan. On the other hand, worry of failure to repay the instalment, unwillingness to take loan and husband’s opposition are the main reasons for non-membership of micro-credit programmes. Tough membership criteria set by the NGOs/MFIs restricts the access to micro-credit option for many of the poor families. Though some NGOs/MFIs have some programmes to support the ultra poor, the coverage is limited. One important hurdle to overcome is the psychological poverty. There are many poor people who are not motivated {{to get involved in the}} process despite many NGOs/MFIs are operating at their doorsteps. Appropriate actions are needed to increase the coverage of the micro-credit programme to fight against poverty. NGOs/MFIs should focus not only on the profit but also on the true achievement in poverty alleviation...|$|R
40|$|The {{forecasts}} underpinning {{the construction}} of the Channel Tunnel largely and systematically overestimated the total size and growth of the cross-Channel passenger and freight markets. The share of the cross-Channel markets captured by the Tunnel was accurately predicted. However, this was only achieved through a competitive battle with ferry operators, which resulted in reduced tariffs. The combination of these two factors resulted in revenues much lower than predicted. For completely separate reasons, the construction costs of the Tunnel doubled. The cost benefit appraisal of the Channel Tunnel reveals that overall the British economy {{would have been better off}} had the Tunnel never been constructed, as the total resource cost outweighs the benefits generated. Users have gained significantly at the expense of owners (producers). The latter [...] both ferry operators and the Tunnel operator have incurred substantial losses. The single biggest component of user's gain has not, as originally expected, been in terms of travel time savings, but due to the transfer from producers. The longer-term evaluation of the project confirms the poor viability of the investment both in financial and cost benefit terms. Eurotunnel has in recent months been the focus of much media attention. In the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of April 2004 the shareholders voted to replace the management with a new French-dominated Executive. Project DARE was launched in October 2004, with the aim to address the company's difficult situation. The developments over the next few months will be critical for Eurotunnel, given the approaching end of the Minimum Usage Charge (MUC) period in November 2006 and the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> junior debt from 2007. ...|$|R

This regulation pertains to the possibility of the reduction <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> to co-owners <b>of</b> a farm in the circumstances when it is conceded to one of them. The author ponders on the aspects of the doctrine and the standpoint of the Constitutional Tribunal referring to the premises of the reduction <b>of</b> these <b>repayments</b> and compatibility <b>of</b> the regulations with the Constitution.

40|$|In 1961 Kenya {{embarked}} on a program of agricultural reform called the Million Acre Settlement Scheme providing for the transfer of ownership {{of land in the}} Rift Valley from outgoing white settlers to local farmers. These new settlers were given loans by the Kenya Government {{to cover the cost of}} the purchase of their plots and of certain development inputs. Over course of time most of these farmers have fallen heavily into arrears with <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> their loans and this problem provides the focus for this study of problems of farmers on the settlement schemes, which has the ultimate objective of making recommendations for improving the present poor rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> Not unexpectedly overall income was found to be the crucial factor affecting rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment,</b> however the relationship of size of income to rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> is not straightforward as other factors intervene, especially patterns of expenditure, and more importantly perhaps to any solution are those which indirectly affect rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> through their influence on income levels. It was furthermore discovered that some loan instalments are never credited due to poor administration and that the quality of administration permeates many other variables. This is a purely introductory paper since most data is still being analysed and few figures are adduced in support of the main arguments, which should be taken as provisional in nature. For the same reason no suggestions are made herein for action to improve the situation...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} an {{analysis}} of two criter of choice of investment variants: the criterion of limited time <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> and the criterion of capital invested. The defining of these criteria substantiates the hypothesis that individual times <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> for particular variants drawn up in increasing sequence according {{to the size of}} the invested capital, should be calculated only on the grounds of changing basis, hence by the 'chain' method, and not on a permanent basis. In addition the author indicated that the attempts, met with in literature, at applying simultaneously, permanent and changing bases in calculating individual repayment times, is merely illusory. Further on in the article the author proves that the generally accepted hypothesis on the equiponderance of the criterion of limited time <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> and the criterion of capital invested is not true, and at the same time indicates in which particular cases this equiponderance can take place.

40|$|Purpose – Information {{concerning}} the long‐term consequences <b>of</b> credit <b>repayment</b> decisions {{is often not}} available for flexible credit facilities such as credit cards. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the role of such information in repayment decisions. A dual mental accounting model of money management predicted that repayments would be influenced by both total cost and loan duration information. Experiment 2 also investigated the role of key economic and psychological factors, including some related to a risk defusing operator model of risk management. Design/methodology/approach – In two questionnaire‐based experiments bank customers (n= 241; 300) were presented with credit card and remortgage repayment scenarios. In both studies, total cost and loan duration information were varied in a 2 × 2 randomised‐groups factorial design. Findings – In both studies, analysis of covariance showed that information on the long‐term consequences <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> decisions lead to significantly higher levels <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> However, in Experiment 2, it was found using hierarchical multiple regression that disposable income, level of education, and the perception of, and worry about, repayment difficulties had larger significant effects on repayment levels. Research limitations/implications – The effects of long‐term consequence information were interpreted in terms of mental accounting and future‐oriented thinking. The effect of concern with future repayment difficulties suggests that borrowers choose lower repayments to control such risks. Practical implications – Providing total cost and loan duration information for a range <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> levels could help borrowers make better repayment decisions. Originality/value – These novel findings contribute to our understanding <b>of</b> borrowers’ <b>repayment</b> behaviour...|$|R
