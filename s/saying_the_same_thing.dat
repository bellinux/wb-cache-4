500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E

2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
2500|$|The paschal or Easter-month is {{the first}} one in the year to have its fourteenth day (its formal full moon) on or after 21 March. Easter is the Sunday after its 14th day (or, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> the Sunday within its third week). The paschal lunar month always begins on a date in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive. Its fourteenth day, therefore, always falls on a date between 21 March and 18 April inclusive, and the {{following}} Sunday then necessarily falls on a date in the range 22 March to 25 April inclusive. In the solar calendar Easter is called a moveable feast since its date varies within a 35-day range. But in the lunar calendar, Easter is always the third Sunday in the paschal lunar month, and is no more [...] "moveable" [...] than any holiday that is fixed to a particular day of the week and week within a month.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have accused}} Slaughterhouse-Five {{of being a}} quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim {{believes}} {{that the notion of}} free will is a quaint Earthling illusion. The problem, according to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, is that [...] "Vonnegut's critics seem to think that he is <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> [...] For Anthony Burgess, [...] "Slaughterhouse is a kind of evasion—in a sense, like J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan—in which we’re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy..." [...] For Charles Harris, [...] "The main idea emerging from Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance." [...] For Alfred Kazin, [...] "Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden... He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, 'So it goes.'" [...] For Tanner, [...] "Vonnegut has... total sympathy with such quietistic impulses." [...] The same notion is found throughout The Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut’s most loyal academic fans.|$|E

2500|$|However, on July 26, 2012, Vilma {{and seven}} {{witnesses}} from the Saints testified {{in front of}} a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal."Everybody was sworn in under oath {{in front of a}} judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," [...] Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. [...] "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose." [...] Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, [...] "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mike Peterson's {{theme is}} most {{commonly}} performed on a solo electric guitar—McCreary felt that [...] "the {{image of a}} single guitar player trying to hold his own against a 90-piece orchestra is a nice metaphor for how Mike must feel"—which is [...] "consumed by distorted synthesizers and low brass" [...] whenever the darker or more unstable sides of the character's superpowers are shown. McCreary also introduced a theme for the mysterious Centipede group in the pilot. [...] "To imply the centipede-nature of the theme," [...] McCreary [...] "used ten notes, {{divided into two groups}} of 5. Played on delicate bells and de-tuned piano, the percussive nature of the notes evokes two rows of tiny insect feet crawling across a string." [...] This theme also comes to represent the group's leader, the Clairvoyant. The emotional bond between the central characters is represented by [...] "The Agents" [...] theme, a much more intimate and accessible idea than the main theme. McCreary described the theme as unfolding [...] "essentially like a pop-song, with a simple A-B-A-A structure". The Skye theme is most clearly heard in emotional moments dealing with that character's backstory, but also appears in many other variations, including brief, romantic statements to highlight her early relationship with Grant Ward. Fitz and Simmons' theme is [...] " [...] less melodic than the other themes, and more motivic. It’s essentially an ostinato that rolls over itself again and again, evolving into subtly different variations with each turn through the pattern. This musically emulates their speaking pattern, where they are constantly stumbling over one another and <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> in slightly different ways." [...] "The Hub" [...] introduces the audience (and Skye) to [...] "Big S.H.I.E.L.D.", as opposed to Coulson's small team, which McCreary gave its own, more militaristic theme. The theme for John Garrett has two parts, an ostinato and a melody, and [...] "represents his adventurous personality, designed to be fun, bouncy and as far away from ominous as possible".|$|E
