50|$|Components of PPE include gloves, gowns, bonnets, <b>shoe</b> <b>covers,</b> face shields, CPR masks, goggles, {{surgical}} masks, and respirators. How many {{components are}} used {{and how the}} components are used is often determined by regulations or the infection control protocol of the facility in question. Many or most of these items are disposable to avoid carrying infectious materials from one patient to another patient and to avoid difficult or costly disinfection. In the US, OSHA requires the immediate removal and disinfection or disposal of a worker's PPE prior to leaving the work area where exposure to infectious material took place.|$|E
50|$|In 1884 German surgeon Gustav Neuber {{implemented}} a comprehensive set of restrictions to ensure sterilization and aseptic operating conditions {{through the use}} of gowns, caps, and <b>shoe</b> <b>covers,</b> all of which were cleansed in his newly invented autoclave. In 1885 he designed and built a private hospital in the woods where the walls, floors and hands, arms and faces of staff were washed with mercuric chloride, instruments were made with flat surfaces and the shelving was easy-to-clean glass. Neuber also introduced separate operating theaters for infected and uninfected patients and the use of heated and filtered air in the theater to eliminate germs. In 1890 surgical gloves were introduced to the practice of medicine by William Halsted. Aseptic surgery was pioneered in the United States by Charles McBurney.|$|E

The Alpine companies were among the most highly decorated units of the imperial forces. Several members were awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa, for example, Lieutenant Peter Scheider of the 17 Alpine Coy for the capture of the Monticello Ridge on the Tonale Pass (together with the 28 Coy under Lieutenant Toni Kaaserer) in the summer of 1918 during Operation Avalanche (Unternehmen Lawine).|$|E
50|$|The WHO {{recommends}} {{the use of}} 2 pairs of gloves, with the outer pair worn over the gown. Using 2 pairs may {{reduce the risk of}} sharp injuries; however, {{there is no evidence that}} using more than the recommended will give additional protection. WHO also {{recommends the}} use of a coverall, which is generally appraised in terms of its resistance to non-enveloped DNA virus. When a gown (or coverall) is worn, it should continue beyond the <b>shoe</b> <b>covers.</b> According to guidelines released by the CDC in August 2015, updates were put in place to improve the PAPR doffing method to make the steps easier, and affirm the importance of cleaning the floor where doffing has been done. Additionally, a designated doffing assistant was recommended to help in this process. The order in which boot covers are removed, by these guidelines, indicates their removal after the coverall or gown. Finally, a trained observer is to read to the healthcare worker each step in donning and doffing, but must not physically assist therein.|$|E

5000|$|In field hockey, the goalkeeper {{generally}} wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, {{face and}} neck guards, chest and leg padding, arm or elbow protectors, special gloves (the left glove is designed purely to block the ball, the right glove also has this function but in addition is designed to permit the goalkeeper to hold and use his or her stick), lower leg guards (known as pads) and <b>shoe</b> <b>covers</b> (known as kickers). The gloves, pads and kickers are almost always made of special high density foam material that both protects the goalkeeper and has excellent rebound qualities. He or she is also equipped with a stick; either one designed for goalies or one as used for normal play. Specialist goalkeeper sticks must conform to the same dimensional limitations as field players' sticks but are designed for optimal use {{with one hand and}} for blocking rather than hitting the ball. From 2007 teams may elect to play with 11 field players, and no-one has the privileges of a goalkeeper. If a goalkeeper is used, they fall into one of two categories: a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, unless they are nominated to take a penalty stroke against the opposing goalkeeper, wear a different colored shirt and at least foot and leg guards (arm and upper-body protection is optional); or they may opt to wear only a helmet. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to play or deflect the ball, although they can't obstruct its play (for example by lying on top of it), and they can only do so within the goal circle (or [...] "D"). Outside the D they are subject to the same rules as field players and may only use their stick to play the ball. Goalkeepers who are wearing a helmet are not permitted to pass their team's 23 m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes. However a goalkeeper who has elected to wear only a helmet is permitted to remove it and provided it is not left on the field of play, they may take part in the game in any part of the pitch, and retain their goalkeeping privileges, even if they do not have time to replace the helmet before making a save. It is compulsory to wear a helmet when defending a penalty stroke or penalty corner.|$|E

Although healthcare workers commonly understand the use of PPE, the importance of properly adhering to those guidelines often does not meet the standards set aside by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is also known that although healthcare workers may exhibit compliance, they may not properly put on (donning) and take off (doffing) the PPE. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to determine educational methods that can utilized in the healthcare setting to improve compliance, adherence, and correct usage of PPE...|$|E

40|$|Certified Campylobacter-free poultry {{products}} {{have been produced}} in Denmark since 2002, the first example of fresh (unprocessed and nonfrozen) chickens labeled “Campylobacter free. ” This success occurred partly through use of a 4 -hour gel-based PCR testing scheme on fecal swabs. In this study, a faster, real-time PCR approach was validated in comparative and collaborative trials, based on recommendations from the Nordic system for validation of alternative microbiological methods (NordVal). The comparative real-time PCR trial was performed in comparison to two reference culture protocols on naturally contaminated samples (99 <b>shoe</b> <b>covers,</b> 101 cloacal swabs, 102 neck skins from abattoirs, and 100 retail neck skins). Culturing included enrichment in both Bolton and Preston broths followed by isolation on Preston agar and mCCDA. In one or both culture protocols, 169 samples were identified as positive. The comparative trial resulted in relative accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98 %, 95 %, and 97 %, respectively. The collaborative trial included nine laboratories testing neck skin, cloacal swab, and shoe cover samples, spiked with low, medium, and high concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni. Valid results were obtained from six of the participating laboratories. Accuracy for high levels was 100 % for neck skin and cloacal swab samples. For low levels, accuracy was 100 % and 92 % for neck skin and cloacal swab samples, respectively; however, detection in shoe cover samples failed. A second collaborative trial, with an optimized DNA extraction procedure, gave 100 % accuracy results for all three spiking levels. Finally, on-site validation at the abattoir on a flock basis was performed on 400 samples. Real-time PCR correctly identified 10 of 20 flocks as positive; thus, the method fulfilled the NordVal validation criteria and has since been implemented at a major abattoir...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVolume {{reduction}} of radioactive solid wastes {{is carried out}} with an aim to minimize disposal space requirement. Cellulosic combustible solid wastes like cotton, paper etc. are treated by incineration and the plastic wastes are volume reduced by baling. Compaction of plastic wastes by baling gives low volume reduction factors (3 – 5) and also the resultant waste bale may spring back to original volume after disposal. With a view to achieve higher volume reduction factors, studies were conducted at CWMF on the melt-densification of plastic wastes at 180 - 190 C. The melted plastics were characterized by TGA/DTA & IR Spectroscopy and {{found that there was}} no structural loss of the polymer compounds. The melted mass was observed to have the expected theoretical density. A melt densification unit (MDU) was set up at CWMF with a facility for melting 20 kg of the plastic waste in each batch in a 200 L MS drum. The system has a furnace with vacuum chamber where plastic waste in drum is melted and an off gas treatment system consisting of a scrubber followed by HEPA filter. A continuous stack monitor is installed to estimate any release of radioactivity in the off-gases. This paper describes the operational experience of melting of different plastic wastes namely polythene sheets & bottles, HDPE pipes and cans, PVC <b>shoe</b> <b>covers</b> and neoprene gloves. About 47 M 3 of β-γ and 18 M 3 of α contaminated plastic wastes were melted using the above MDU. The volume reduction factors varied from 2. 5 to 30 depending on the initial bulk density of the material. The radioactivity in the off-gases was found to be always below detectable limits. The leach indices of waste matrices were 2 to 3 orders better than the stipulated limits...|$|E

40|$|The {{health hazard}} {{evaluation}} (HHE) Program evaluated concerns about lead exposure at an aircraft repair and flight school facility. Single-engine aircraft {{at the facility}} use leaded aviation fuel which generates lead-containing particulates as a combustion byproduct. No one at the facility reported work-related symptoms. Lead was detected in blood samples collected from all facility personnel. The hangar area had the highest surface concentrations of lead; lead was also found {{on the steering wheel}} of an employee's car. All airborne concentrations of lead and other elements measured over a work shift were low. Airborne lead concentrations approached the occupational exposure limit for a short-term exposure when spark plugs were being sandblasted. There was no routine cleaning schedule in place for the hangar and a leaf blower was reportedly used to clear dust from surfaces. Lead dust was found on toys and a baby walker in the work area. Investigators also found that chemicals were improperly labeled and stored. HHE Program investigators recommended that the employer develop a respiratory protection program and require employees to use a respirator when sandblasting spark plugs. Wet cleaning methods, instead of dry cleaning methods, should be used to clean the hangar. Chemicals should be properly labeled and stored in closed containers within safety cabinets. The employer should provide employees with disposable <b>shoe</b> <b>covers</b> and on-site laundering for work clothes to reduce the potential for take-home lead contamination. Investigators also advised that children not be allowed in work areas. Employees were encouraged to wash their hands thoroughly before eating and drinking, before and after putting on gloves, and before leaving the facility.
