The {{purpose is to}} explain the performance differences between {{phase shifters}} fabricated using additive manufacturing and those fabricated with conventional subtractive techniques. All phase shifters are designed to operate at a center frequency of 2. 45 GHz with a 100 MHz bandwidth. The 1 -bit 45 ° <b>switched</b> <b>line</b> phase shifters have an average insertion loss of 1. 3 dB and a 220 mm 2 footprint, while the 1 -bit 180 ° high-pass low-pass phase shifters have an insertion loss 1. 56 dB and a 180 mm 2 footprint. The 4 -bit high-pass low-pass, <b>switched</b> <b>line</b> hybrid phase shifters {{on the other hand}} show an average state insertion loss of 5. 4 dB and have a 660 mm 2 foot print.

The {{phase shifters}} are constructed of single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches with additional reference and phase offset transmission line lengths. The one- and two-bit phase shifters are fabricated on high resistivity (HR) silicon with a dielectric constant, Epsilon(sub T) = 11. 7 and a substrate thickness, t = 500 microns. The switching architectures integrated within the phase shifters consist of MEMS switches that are doubly anchored cantilever beam capacitive switches with additional high inductive sections (MEMS LC device). The SPDT switch is composed of a T-junction with a MEMS LC device at each output port.

40|$|In the {{above-mentioned}} paper(1) a variable structure sliding mode controller (VSSMC) {{design for the}} tip position control of a flexible one-link manipulator has been presented, where a <b>switching</b> <b>line</b> constructed from the tip position and its derivative was employed for the design. The claim was that if the slope of this line is chosen positive and the system variables are made to stay on this line, they will converge to zero exponentially, thus yielding a stable system in sliding mode (SM). The purpose of this comment {{is to show that}} the choice of a positive constant as the slope for this <b>switching</b> <b>line</b> will not guarantee the stability of the system in SM because, in view of the functional relationship of the tip position with the generalized coordinates of the system through the mode shape functions, what is presented as a <b>switching</b> <b>line</b> is in fact a switching hypersurface, Hence, the stability of the system in SM is guaranteed only if the motion on this hypersurface is asymptotically stable. A positive value for the slope of the <b>switching</b> <b>line</b> employed by Qian and Ma will not guarantee this stability because variations in the mode shape functions due to varying payload conditions or other disturbances at the tip will lead to a varying switching surface, These variations can be such that the resulting sliding motion becomes unstable. Also, the varying switching surface implies that the controller will fail to maintain sliding mode motion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} how the power dissipation of on-chip buses is affected by introducing a relative delay between the <b>switching</b> <b>lines.</b> Relative delay is shown to reduce the dissipated power of oppositely <b>switching</b> <b>lines</b> while causing a power penalty for similarly <b>switching</b> <b>lines.</b> A new low-power bus scheme that uses this effect is proposed and analyzed. As the introduced delay increases, the achieved power reduction increases while decreasing the bus throughput. Thus, a tradeoff between power reduction and throughput is required when selecting the imposed relative delay. The proposed low-power scheme, dynamic delayed line bus (DDL) scheme, led to a power reduction of up to 25 %, 33 %, and 42 % when applied to data, address, and differential buses, respectively. Simple DDL hardware is designed and implemented in a 0. 18 - m TSMC CMOS technology and applied to a 4500 - m long Metal 4 bus. Circuit simulation results for different bus widths are presented.

40|$|To make {{a double}} CubeSat with limited power {{resources}} capable of transmitting {{large amounts of}} data to Earth a high gain antenna is needed. In this thesis a switched beam MSA array operating at 5. 84 GHz {{has been designed to}} operate on a double CubeSat. The array has 5 beams and uses a switched-line phase shifter to switch between beams. Three different array geometries has been proposed. Computer simulations suggest that the array should be capable of an effective beamwidth of over 60 degrees with a directivity of over 11 dBi. A feed network has been designed to fit the best suited geometry. A ground plane will separate the feed network from the antenna elements. Along with the full array solution all the sub parts has been realized as test circuits. This allows for an evaluation of their characteristics. A TRL calibration kit has also been designed so that the sub parts could be more accurately evaluated. When sending the circuits to fabrication it appeared to be a problem with the selected substrate used for the antenna elements. A redesign using the same substrate for the feed network and antennas was done and production commenced. As it turns out, the TRL calibration kit was not good enough so the S-parameters had to be measured with regular SOLT calibration. Significant problems with connection to ground and mismatches due to a poor SMA-to-microstrip transition was encountered. This caused large deviations between measured and simulated results. It was also discovered that the wrong dielectric constant had been used. This error caused the antenna elements to be dimensioned for operation at 5. 70 GHz instead of 5. 84 GHz. Problems was also encountered in the <b>switched</b> <b>line</b> phase shifter design. Beam-lead PIN-diodes has been used and due to their small size, a sufficient quality of the soldering was not achieved. This lead to different losses through the phase shifter which again caused the different beam directions to vary from simulations. Only one beam had characteristics similar to simulations. Measurements on the array without phase shifters showed good correspondence with simulation results (adjusted for the correct dielectric constant). It is concluded that by making a better SMA-to-microstrip transition, improve the soldering work and do a redesign with the correct dielectric constant, the array configuration should work as outlined in the design process. </p...|$|E
