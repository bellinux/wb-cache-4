5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe <b>starts</b> <b>talking</b> to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

And then we'd <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about issues or problems or relationships with people. That was the only way, because you know, writing together with somebody is very intimate. So {{we had to find}} a place to <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about something we cared about, so we could get into writing about something we cared about."

I don't like to make the [...] outright say [...] "I need you to do X, then I'll give you Y"...– it makes the character into an automated quest kiosk.

500|$|In house music, {{a desire}} to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the {{interposition}} of prefixes like [...] "progressive", [...] "tribal", and [...] "intelligent". According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term [...] "progressive" [...] was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed [...] "progressive" [...] because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. In this context, Reynolds criticizes terms like [...] "progressive" [...] and [...] "intelligent", arguing that [...] "when an underground scene <b>starts</b> <b>talking</b> this talk, it's usually a sign that it's gearing up the media game as a prequel to buying into traditional music industry structure of auteur-stars, concept albums, and long-term careers. Above all, it's a sign of impending musical debility, creeping self-importance, and the hemorrhaging away of fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it worried how {{the series}} would fit in [...] "the likes" [...] of Elvis Costello, Mary J.

[...] In regards to the storylines, itself, he noted that Jack's quest in getting Milton a kidney [...] "balanced nicely" [...] with Liz's story, and that Tracy's [...] "had some good moments". In conclusion, Porter wrote [...] "For a show that doesn't always know how to end episodes, it's done really well at ending seasons." [...] TV Guide Magazine’s Sandra Kofler wrote that the [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] song was hilarious, and that it [...] "stole [...] season finale." [...] Patrick Goldstein, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was favorable to the musical number, reporting [...] "he song itself is a hoot, highlighted by a wonderful spoken-word kidney donation pitch that begins with Costello saying: 'Listen, when someone <b>starts</b> <b>talking</b> {{in the middle of a}} song, you know it's serious.'" [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett said [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "sweet and all", and noted that the [...] "Vontella-as-Tyra spoof" [...] was [...] "brilliant." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that this episode [...] "was a fitting end for a guest-star-heavy... season of 30 Rock", but added that the finale overall was [...] "maybe average", however, [...] "the ending at least delivered the goods, with the best sitcom celebrity benefit song".|$|E

500|$|In Homer's dream, Homer has {{the role}} of King Solomon who, {{according}} to the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles was a King of Israel, {{as well as one}} of the 48 prophets according to the Talmud. Bart's dream shows Bart as King David and, rather than telling the story of David and Goliath, Bart's dream is a [...] "sequel" [...] to the story. The segment is inspired by and contains references to several films by Jerry Bruckheimer, including Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, and borrows elements from other action films. At one point in the segment, Bart's dog Santa's Little Helper <b>starts</b> <b>talking</b> to him. The dog's voice {{is similar to that of}} Goliath in the Christian stop-motion animated television series Davey and Goliath. Inside the whale skeleton in the episode, Bart finds the remains of Jonah. Jonah was a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel, according to the Hebrew Bible. Nelson lives in the Tower of Babel which, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower that the humans built in order to reach heaven. After being defeated by Bart, Nelson reappears while a variation of Modest Mussorgsky's composition St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain plays in the background. At the end of the segment, Bart is arrested and Chief Wiggum says [...] "Where's your messiah now?" [...] Wiggum's line was also taken from The Ten Commandments, from a character played by Edward G. Robinson, on whom Wiggum's voice is based. King David's (Bart) training montage of arm-wrestling with his sheep is a reference to the film Over the Top, complete with Sammy Hagar's [...] "Winner Takes It All" [...] from the film.|$|E

Nicholas {{said of the}} storyline, [...] "Gavin {{will be up to}} the usual sullied, nasty things", while Taylforth explained, [...] "He is coming back to cause the usual mayhem that he always does. Paul is great playing a villain, we all love him to bits! He still controls Kathy in a certain way. She thought last time that she could control him – as soon as <b>starts</b> <b>talking</b> to her, he wins her over again—as he always does!" [...] The storyline includes a cliffhanger where it is not known if it is Margaret or Kathy who has been killed. Kilkelly said the end of the episode was a [...] "sinister surprise" [...] and that [...] "Gavin Sullivan appeared to reach villainous new heights". Duncan Lindsay from the Metro said of Gavin, [...] "He's clearly lost it and with a body on his hands and the control slipping from his grasp, there's no telling what Gavin might do next", adding that [...] "The final chapter of the saga is about to unfold in dramatic fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|A subtle running joke {{throughout}} {{the series is}} Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to [...] "hook up" [...] at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In [...] "Night Out", Dwight hooks up with a women's basketball player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael {{that he will not}} do. In [...] "Niagara", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight <b>starts</b> <b>talking</b> about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's horses. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in [...] "The Delivery" [...] that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in [...] "Happy Hour", and bond further, kissing {{at the end of the}} episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, Mindy Kaling noted that Dwight is not a typical [...] "nerd" [...] character, that he is a [...] "farmer and kind of strapping and tall", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in [...] "A.A.R.M.". In the final episode, Dwight marries Angela Martin.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Silas sets newcomer Jenny (Daisy Turner) in his sights as his next victim in April 2011.

Jenny has no idea that she is talking to Silas. Rawle called it a [...] "tantalising game of cat and mouse". Jenny thinks Silas is a millionaire who she can get the better of, and Silas thinks she will be a [...] "soft" [...] target for him. Rawle explained that the Hollyoaks team are keen to keep educating viewers about [...] "stranger danger" [...] on the internet. He said [...] "It's an ongoing message we're trying to put out that the internet can be a dangerous place. Silas could be grooming up to 200 girls, waiting for just one to let down their guard - and that's where Jenny comes in." [...] Jenny realises that Silas is not a [...] "harmless pensioner" [...] after she looks through his bag, which contains a rope, a knife and some gloves. Rawle opined that Jenny is a [...] "very clever adversary" [...] for Silas. Jenny is chased through the woods and realises that Silas has given her the drugged drink that was meant for him. Jenny starts to feel [...] "woozy" [...] and Rawle said that [...] "there was no way that she could get away with drugging Silas". The actor added that Jenny would have to be [...] "quite audacious" [...] to outsmart someone who has been a killer for quite some time. Silas then murders Jenny. Jenny is revealed to be Rebecca Massey, the girlfriend of Doug Carter (PJ Brennan). Brennan hoped that Doug would be involved in Silas's downfall and said [...] "I have my fingers crossed that Doug will be somehow involved, as I'd love him to be".
