40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evaluate the dynamic mechanical response of MAX phase material Ti 2 AlC at high temperature (HT) and under radial confinement. A Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus {{was employed to conduct}} experiments at a strain rate of 500 s 1. High speed photography was used to capture the dynamic response of unconfined specimens. An induction coil was used to heat the specimens from 25 to 1000 °C. Nickel-cobalt-ferrous alloy (Kovar) <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> <b>sleeves</b> were utilized to produce a mechanical radial pressure of 30 to 195 MPa. Unconfined room temperature (RT) and HT experiments revealed that Ti 2 AlC fails in a gradual brittle (also referred to as graceful failure) manner with a low dependency on temperature up to 800 °C. All experiments conducted with radial confinement produced a fully plastic response without failure. The addition of hydrostatic confinement increased the maximum compressive stress for all temperatures and allowed specimens to reach strains in excess of 8 % without failing. Optical and Scanning Election Microscopy (SEM) images were taken of the cross-section of recovered confined specimens. Imaging revealed conical damage patterns on each end of the specimen which facilitate the plastic response. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{shrink-fit}} is a semi-permanent assembly system, {{widely used}} in industry, {{which is designed to}} resist the relative movement or transmit torque between two components. This done by creating high radial pressures at the interface of the constituent parts. Examples include fitting of gears to shafts to transmit torque and <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> hard wearing <b>sleeves</b> to shafts for steel rolling mills. This paper presents measured and predicted residual stresses from a variety of <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> assemblies, including aluminium alloys, stainless steel and cast irons. In a number of cases the <b>sleeves</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> to the shaft were subjected to prior machining or prior quenching to introduce initial residual stresses in the sleeve. Residual stresses were measured using a combination of deep-hole drilling (DHD) and incremental centre hole drilling (ICHD) techniques. The ICHD method provided near surface residual stress measurements to depths up to about 1 mm. The DHD method measured through thickness residual stresses along radial lines through the outer sleeve and into the shaft up to depths of 400 mm. Results are shown for a variety of assemblies and reveal residual stress that are significantly different from both simple analysis and finite element studies. For example, prior machining introduced near surface compressive residual stresses, that is then expected to be counteracted by the near surface tensile <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> residual stresses. However, measurements reveal {{that this is not the}} case...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed {{that is capable of}} (1) dynamically loading the specimen in multiaxial compression; (2) controlling the stress state in the specimen in the range from uniaxial stress to uniaxial strain; and (3) allowing the recovery of the sample after loaded by a single, well defined pulse for the characterization of the failure mode. In this technique, cylindrical ceramic specimens were loaded in the axial direction using a split Hopkinson pressure bar modified to apply a single loading pulse, and were confined laterally either by <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> <b>sleeves,</b> or by eletro-magnetic force. Quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial compression experiments have been performed on a machinable glass ceramic, Macor, and a monolithic engineering ceramic, sintered aluminum nitride (A 1 N). The cylindrical ceramic specimens were confned laterally by <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> sleeves: the amount of confining pressure (0 - 230 MPa) was varied by using different sleeve materials. The quasi-static axial load was applied by a hydraulic driven Material Test System (MTS), whereas the dynamic axial load was provided by a modified split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar (SHPB). Under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions, the experimental results for both materials showed that the failure mode changed from fragmentation by axial splitting under conditions of uniaxial stress (without lateral confinement) to localized deformation on faults under moderate lateral confinement. The fault initiation process was studied experimentally in detail. Based on the experimental results, a compressive brittle failure process was summarized. A transition from brittle to ductile behavior was observed in Macor under high confinement pressure which was achieved using a second sleeve around the inner sleeve. The compressive failure strengths of both materials increased with increasing confinement pressure under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The highest dynamic compressive strengths of Macor and A 1 N measured in the experiments were 1. 35 GPa and 5. 40 GPa, respectively, whereas their quasi-static compressive strength were measured to be 0. 43 GPa and 2. 5 GPa, respectively. Based on the experimental results on A 1 N together with available data in the literature, a failure/flow criterion was developed for ceramic materials under multiaxial loading. A Mohr-Coulomb criterion and an improved Johnson-Holmquist model were found to fit the experimental data for brittle failure, whereas the materials exhibited pressure insensitive plastic flow at high pressures. Observations made in other types of dynamic experiments (e. g., shock wave loading) were rationalized based on the postulated failure mechanisms and the possibility of plastic flow beyond the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL). The effect of various material properties on the failure behavior was investigated using the proposed failure criterion. The applicability of the present model to a range of ceramics was also explored and the limitations of the model were outlined. ...|$|R
40|$|Realization of {{electrically}} boosted turbochargers requires {{electric motors}} capable of operating {{at very high}} speeds. These motors often use a permanent magnet rotor with the magnets retained within an interference <b>fit</b> external <b>sleeve.</b> Whilst {{it is possible to}} model such systems numerically, these models are an inefficient tool for design optimization. Current analytical models of rotors typically consider the stresses induced by the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> of the <b>sleeve</b> separately from the stresses generated by centripetal forces due to rotation. However, such an approach ignores the frictional interaction between the components in the axial direction. This paper presents an analytical model that simultaneously accounts for interaction between the magnet and outer sleeve in both the radial and axial directions at designed interference and with the assembly subjected to centripetal and thermal loads. Numerical models presented show that with only moderate coefficients of friction and rotor lengths; axial load transfer between magnet and sleeve takes place over a short distance at the ends of the assembly. The paper then demonstrates how the analytical model aids definition of a feasible set of rotor designs and selection of an optimum design...|$|R
50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from use. If {{the engine is}} not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a limit}} to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where the use of a sleeve or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference <b>fit.</b> The <b>sleeves</b> can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a <b>shrink</b> <b>fit.</b> This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it <b>shrink</b> <b>fits</b> around the <b>sleeve</b> holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} experimental and theoretical study of subsynchronous rotordynamic instability in rotors caused by interference and <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interfaces. The experimental studies show {{the presence of}} strong unstable subsynchronous vibrations in two different rotor setups with interference and <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interfaces that were operated above their first critical speeds. The unstable vibrations occur at the first natural frequency of the rotor-bearing system. The instability caused complete wreckage of the test rig {{in one of the}} setups showing that these vibrations are potentially dangerous to the safe operation of rotating machines. The two different rotor setups that are studied are a single-disk rotor mounted on a uniform diameter shaft and a two-disk rotor with an aluminum <b>sleeve</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> to it at the outer surface of the two disks. In the single-disk rotor, an adjustable interference arrangement between the disk and the shaft is obtained through a tapered sleeve arrangement, which acts as the interference fit joint. The unstable sub-synchronous vibrations originate from slippage in the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> and the interference fit interfaces that develop friction forces, which act as destabilizing cross-coupled moments when the rotor is operated above its first critical speed. The unique contribution offered through this work is the experimental validation of a physically correct model of internal friction which models the destabilizing mechanism as a system of cross-coupled internal moments at the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interface. The dissertation describes stability simulations of various test rotor setups using the correct internal moments model. A commercial finite-element based software called XLTRCTM is used to perform rotordynamic simulations for stability studies. The method of stability study is the computation of eigenvalues of the rotor-bearing system. A negative real part of the eigenvalue indicates instability. The simulations include the test rotors that were experimentally observed as stable and unstable with <b>shrink</b> and interference <b>fit</b> interfaces in their assemblies. The dissertation also describes the simulations of various imagined rotor configurations with <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interfaces, and seeks to explain how configurations differ on rotordynamic stability depending upon several rotor-bearing parameters such as geometry and elastic properties, as well as upon the amount of internal friction parameters, which differ from configuration to configuration...|$|R

40|$|Thermal <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> chucks {{are widely}} used in high {{performance}} machining where excellent concentricity and high torque transmission are required. It was reported that in those milling operations, severe damage of tools, workpieces, and also machine tools occurs due to an extraction of the milling tool out of the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> chuck during the process. Although, theoretically the interference fit assembly should withstand certain process forces, milling tools are apparently pulled out under special process conditions.

40|$|In some powder {{metallurgy}} part forming, when high compacting loads {{would require a}} too large single <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> die, or the inner die diameter is very large but the compaction area is modest, twice <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> dies, which are relatively expensive and complex to build, should be used. In both cases, at any given compacting load, the design should minimise dimensions and stresses. The design targets are minimum die size, optimum intermediate diameter and optimum interference, with maximum stresses on each die item lower than those allowable for the selected materials. In dual mode, for fixed overall dimension, intermediate diameters and shrink fitting interference should enable to maximise the compacting load without exceeding the allowable maximum stresses. In {{the first part of}} this work, for cylindrical shapes (circular profile dies) and axisymmetric plane stress problems, dimensions, interferences and stress–strain states have been analytically calculated to optimise doubly <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> dies in the abovementioned sense. In the second part, the same evaluations for axisymmetric generic problems have been carried out by finite element method (FEM) approach integrated in an optimisation procedure. The minimum overall dimensions of the die are presented as a function of the ratio between applied load and maximum allowable stress. Corresponding interferences and optimum diameters have been calculated. Some approximate equations for a quick and handy optimisation are presented. The differences between analytical and numerical results obviously depend on the consideration of the actually stressed length, or compact height, and total die height.

40|$|The <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> shaft to hub connection, loaded under bending, {{experiences}} Fretting Fatigue {{at the end}} of {{the contact}} where both stress concentration and microslip are acting. <b>Shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> testing is not standard and common as the bridge type test, however, the round geometry implies no edge effect, the shrinkage and the bending loads can be carefully controlled with strain gages, and the stress distribution easily calculated with finite element analyses. Though the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> compressive state, the cyclic bending introduces tensile stresses, hence the introduction of compressive residual stresses can play a significant role to prevent the initiation and the propagation of the fretting fatigue cracks. Experimental results are reported in the paper where the fretting fatigue strength was remarkably improved after a deep rolling treatment. Numerical analyses even predicted the complete mode I closure of potential fretting fatigue cracks by taking into account the compressive residual stresses. SEM investigation showed how the crack pattern was significantly different with deep rolling, having multiple crack initiation sites and then either coalescence or crack branching. From the modelling point of view, the paper shows that the self-arrest theory cannot be used to assess the fretting fatigue strength, for deep rolled specimens, where the crack remains closed. A better prediction can be obtained with a critical plane multiaxial fatigue criterion, based on the shear stress amplitude, which under a compressive stress state can be more effectively assumed as the driving force of the crack. Consistently the orientation of the plane experiencing the maximum shear stress amplitude was found in agreement with the observed initial crack direction...|$|R
