5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>authors</b> have {{regarded}} Geastrum indicum as {{the correct}} name for G.triplex.

If {{it is in fact}} the same species, the first published name (i.e., G.indicum) has nomenclatorial priority according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, <b>several</b> <b>authors</b> argue that G.indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G.triplex maintained as the correct name for the species.|$|E

The critical reception has been generally favourable, with <b>several</b> <b>authors</b> commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E

5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although <b>several</b> <b>authors</b> studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P.
