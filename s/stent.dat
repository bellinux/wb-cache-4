5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery <b>stent,</b> a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting <b>stent</b> placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E

40|$|Aims. This {{study was}} to compare the degradation, complications, and tissue {{reactions}} of two segmented biodegradable esophageal <b>stents</b> in a porcine model. Methods. Uncovered biodegradable segmented <b>stents</b> and fully covered biodegradable segmented <b>stents</b> (FCBDS) were transplanted into the porcine esophagus lumen. Data on biodegradation, complications, and tissue reactions were collected and compared. Results. All animals kept good general conditions. No severe complications and <b>stents</b> migration occurred. <b>Stents</b> degradation commenced at week 3. Compared with uncovered <b>stents,</b> <b>stents</b> structure breakage and complete <b>stents</b> absorption in FCBDS were postponed for 1 - 2 weeks. Hyperplasia was prominent at early stage and ameliorated at late stage after <b>stents</b> insertion. Tissue reactions in FCBDS were milder than those in uncovered <b>stents</b> in the early stage. A longer degradation period was present in FCBDS than in uncovered <b>stents,</b> while FCBDS induced tissue reaction at late stage was mild. Conclusions. Biodegradable esophageal <b>stents</b> with a segmented trunk may be further evaluated in refractory benign esophagus strictures. This FCBDS may be advantageous compared with uncovered <b>stents</b> for a longer degradation period...|$|R
50|$|Some {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} about overzealous use of <b>stents</b> in general. Two studies found about half of patients received <b>stents</b> for unapproved reasons, with worse outcomes for the patients in both studies. More recent data suggest off-label use of both bare-metal <b>stents</b> and drug-eluting <b>stents</b> have increased risks. However, drug-eluting <b>stents</b> seemed to have similar or improved rates of death or MI compared with bare-metal <b>stents,</b> and consistently reduced need for target vessel revascularization. Overall, the data {{support the use of}} drug-eluting <b>stents</b> for off-label indications.|$|R
40|$|The airway <b>stents</b> restore patency in {{the face}} of luminal {{compromise}} from intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathologies. Luminal compromise beyond 50 % often leads to debilitating symptoms such as dyspnea. Silicone <b>stents</b> remain the most commonly placed <b>stents</b> worldwide and have been the "gold standard" for the treatment of benign and malignant airway stenoses over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, silicone <b>stents</b> are not the ideal <b>stents</b> in all situations. Metallic <b>stents</b> can serve better in some selected conditions. Unlike silicone <b>stents,</b> there are large and increasing varieties of metallic <b>stents</b> available on the market. The lack of prospective or comparative studies between various types of metallic <b>stents</b> makes the choice difficult and expert-opinion based. International guidelines are sorely lacking in this area...|$|R

5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a <b>stent)</b> prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The <b>stent</b> can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{squamous}} cell carcinoma of the oesophagus and gastroesophageal junction usually requires palliative treatment, and the method of choice is <b>stenting.</b> There are several types of <b>stents</b> currently available, including: self-expandable metallic <b>stents</b> (fully or partially covered); self-expandable plastic stents; biodegradable <b>stents.</b> Each of the mentioned <b>stents</b> has its advantages and limitations, and requires a proper, patient-tailored selection.

25|$|The {{first use}} of a {{coronary}} <b>stent</b> is typically attributed to Jacques Puel and Ulrich Sigwart when they implanted a <b>stent</b> into a patient in Toulouse, France in 1986. It {{was used as a}} scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid restenosis in coronary surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the <b>stent</b> and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter in 1987, Julio Palmaz (known for patenting a balloon-expandable <b>stent)</b> and Richard Schatz implanted their similar <b>stent</b> into a patient in Germany. The use of these bare-metal stents helped reduce the incidence of restenosis from 30–40% in coronary surgery to 20–30%.|$|E

40|$|To {{review the}} {{outcomes}} {{with the use}} of balloon-expandable covered iliac kissing <b>stents</b> as compared with bare metal <b>stents</b> in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease at the aortic bifurcation. A review of consecutive patients from a single institution with atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the aortic bifurcation treated with balloon-expandable kissing <b>stents</b> was performed between January 1, 2002, and September 1, 2007. Fifty-four patients were identified and divided into two groups: those with bare metal <b>stents</b> and those with covered <b>stents.</b> Technical and clinical success (Fontaine classification), complications, and patency at follow-up were documented. Twenty-six patients (17 men, nine women; mean age, 61 years; age range, 39 - 79 years) received covered <b>stents</b> and 28 patients (15 men, 13 women; mean age, 61 years; age range, 38 - 82 years) received bare metal <b>stents.</b> Technical success was achieved in 100 % of patients in both groups. Major complications occurred in three of the 26 (11 %) with covered <b>stents</b> (P =. 66) and two of the 28 patients (7 %) with bare metal <b>stents.</b> The median follow-up was 21 months (20 months for covered <b>stents</b> vs 25 months for bare metal stents; range, 1 - 62 months). Twenty-two of the 26 patients (85 %) with covered <b>stents</b> had sustained improvement in clinical symptoms during the follow-up period compared with 15 of the 28 patients (54 %) with bare metal <b>stents</b> (P =. 02). Primary patency rates at 1 and 2 years were 92 % and 92 %, respectively, for covered <b>stents</b> and 78 % and 62 % for bare metal <b>stents</b> (P =. 023). The use of covered balloon-expandable kissing <b>stents</b> for atherosclerotic aortic bifurcation occlusive disease provides superior patency at 2 years as compared with bare metal balloon-expandable <b>stents...</b>|$|R
