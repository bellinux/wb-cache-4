The minimal critical region responsible for this 9 q subtelomeric deletion (9 q-) syndrome has been estimated to be < 1 Mb and comprises the euchromatin histone methyl transferase 1 gene (EHMT 1). Previous studies suggested that haploinsufficiency for EHMT 1 is causative for 9 q subtelomeric deletion syndrome. We have performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of the EHMT 1 gene in 23 patients with clinical presentations reminiscent of 9 q subtelomeric deletion syndrome. This analysis revealed three additional microdeletions that comprise the EHMT 1 gene, including one interstitial deletion that reduces the critical region for this syndrome.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subtelomeric {{chromosome}} imbalances {{are increasingly}} {{known as a}} cause for mental retardation. New phenotypes associated with specific rearrangements are also being delineated, such as 9 q microdeletion syndrome. Here we define the major phenotypic features and the parental origin of 9 q deletion. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We present 2 children with a phenotype that is characterized by mental retardation, distinctive facial features and congenital anomalies. Both patients showed a chromosome 9 q subtelomeric deletion detected by MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), and confirmed by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). In order to delimit the size and the parental origin of 9 q deletion, we performed microsatellite segregation analyses. RESULTS: We identified 2 patients with a de novo terminal deletion of the chromosome region 9 q 34. The deleted region spanned less than 0. 8 and 1. 5 Mb, respectively, affecting {{in both cases the}} paternal chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: 9 q 34 deletion syndrome appears as a clinically recognizable phenotype characterised by moderate-severe mental retardation, hypotonia, flat face with hyperthelorism, <b>synophrys,</b> anteverted nares, carp-shaped mouth with protruding tongue and conotruncal heart defects.

40|$|Obesity is {{a symptom}} of {{diagnostic}} value in multiplecongenital anomaly-mental retardation syndromes. While acquired non-specific weight gain related to drug intake or associated behavioural disorders occasionally occurs in the course of mental retardation, obesity is known to be a specific feature of several well defined conditions, includ-ing Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Cohen syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and several chromosomal anomalies. Yet a number of mentally retarded children with apparently early onset weight gain remain undiagnosed. Here, we report on a de novo deletion of chromosome 9 q 34 in two unrelated mentally retarded children with early onset obesity, distinctive facial features (brachycephaly, <b>synophrys,</b> an-teverted nostrils, prognathism), sleep disturbances, and behavioural problems. FISH and microsatellite DNA analyses showed that the two children carried a similar small deletion (3 Mb) of the terminal long arm of chromosome 9 (del 9 q 34). We suggest therefore that the del 9 q 34 is a novel cause of syn-dromic obesity and mental retardation. Its association with distinctive facial features and behavioural problems should help in recognising this novel phenotype. Based on this obser-vation, we suggest giving consideration to cryptic deletions of chromosome 9 q 34 in the diagnosis of unexplained obesity/ mental retardation syndrome...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{regarding}} a Dutch female with microcephaly, mild intellectual disability (ID), gonadal dysgenesis and dysmorphic facial features with <b>synophrys.</b> Upon genotyping, an ~ 455 kb de novo deletion encompassing the first exon of NRXN 1 was found. Bidirectional sequencing of the coding exons of the NRXN 1 alpha isoform was subsequently performed {{to investigate the}} possibility of a pathogenic mutation on the other allele, but we could not find any other mutation. Previously, many heterozygous mutations as well as microdeletions in NRXN 1 were shown to be associated with ID, autism, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric and psychotic disorders. Our results are in agreement with other reports that show that NRXN 1 deletions can lead to ID, microcephaly and mild dysmorphic features. However, this is the first report of gonadal dysgenesis being associated with such deletions. It is not clear whether there is a causal relationship between the NRXN 1 deletion and gonadal dysgenesis, but it is of interest that the FSHR gene, which encodes the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor causative correlation that is mutated in ovarian dysgenesis, is located proximal to the NRXN 1 gene. Given that most of the females carrying NRXN 1 deletions have been diagnosed at a prepubertal age, gynecologic screening of female carriers of a NRXN 1 deletion is warranted...|$|E

While his karyotype and subtelomeric FISH studies were normal, a de novo, 5. 4 Mb interstitial deletion at 1 p 32 [del(1) (p 32. 2 – p 32. 3) ] was identified by oligonucleotide aCGH. The deleted region encompasses a cluster of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol metabolism.

In addition to the loss of the paternal allele, our patient is hemizygous for the A 443 T weak loss-of-function mutation in exon 8 ofPCSK 9. Loss-of-function mutations withinPCSK 9 have been shown to cause hypocholester-olemia. Another gene also mapped to this region and deleted in this patient is DAB 1, reported to be involved in brain development. Based on the findings in the current patient and in the four previously reported individuals with del(1) (p 32. 2 –p 32. 3), we suggest that these patients may have a new microdeletion syndrome that may have gone undetected because of its location in a G-negative band.

The two living affected brothers presented with microcephaly, white matter disease of the brain, hyponychia, dysmorphic facial features with <b>synophrys,</b> epilepsy, diabetes mellitus and ID. Genotyping with a 250 K SNP array in both affected brothers revealed an 18 MB homozygous region on chromosome 18 p 11. 21 -q 12. 1 encompassing the SCKL 2 locus of the Seckel and Jawad syndromes. Sequencing of the RBBP 8 gene, underlying the Seckel and Jawad syndromes, identified the novel mutation c. 919 A>G, p. Arg 307 Gly, segregating in a recessive manner in the family.

40|$|We {{identified}} an {{autosomal recessive}} condition in 11 {{individuals in the}} Old Order Amish of northeastern Ohio. The syndrome was characterized by distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, and mental retardation. The typical craniofacial dysmorphism included brachycephaly, highly arched bushy eyebrows, <b>synophrys,</b> long eyelashes, low-set ears, microdontism of primary teeth, and generalized gingival hyperplasia, whereas Sprengel deformity of scapula, fusion of spine, rib abnormities, pectus excavatum, and pes planus represented skeletal anomalies. The genome-wide homozygosity mapping using six affected individuals localized the disease gene to a 3. 3 -Mb region on chromosome 1 q 23. 3 -q 24. 1. Candidate gene sequencing identified a homozygous frameshift mutation, c. 139 _ 140 delAG, in the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1 (TMCO 1) gene, as the pathogenic change in all affected members of the extended pedigree. This mutation is predicted {{to result in a}} severely truncated protein (p. Ser 47 Ter) of only one-fourth the original length. The TMCO 1 gene product is a member of DUF 841 superfamily of several eukaryotic proteins with unknown function. The gene has highly conserved amino acid sequence and is universally expressed in all human tissues examined. The high degree of conservation and the ubiquitous expression pattern in human adult and fetal tissues suggest a critical role for TMCO 1. This report shows a TMCO 1 sequence variant being associated with a genetic disorder in human. We propose “TMCO 1 defect syndrome” as the name of this condition...|$|E
