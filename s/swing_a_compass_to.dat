50|$|Robert Were Fox FRS (26 April 1789 - 25 July 1877) was a British geologist, natural {{philosopher and}} inventor. He is known mainly {{for his work}} on the {{temperature}} of the earth and his construction of <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> measure magnetic dip at sea.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic dip. The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} (dip) of <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> the horizon differs according to latitude. He shows how to construct a dip instrument. At the equator it is level and increases towards the poles as he has shown earlier with his terrella.|$|R

50|$|Benchmark hunters also {{frequently}} carry <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> (<b>to</b> follow directions {{gleaned from the}} data sheet), a probe (like a long-bladed screwdriver) to search for buried marks, a trowel (or a small shovel) to uncover buried marks, a whisk broom (to clear away debris), and one or more tape measures of various lengths, used in taping out referenced distances found on the data sheets.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{horizontal}} angles {{were measured}} by using <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>a</b> magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with reticles atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see theodolite). Levels and calibrated circles allowed measurement of vertical angles. Verniers allowed measurement to {{a fraction of}} a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century transit.|$|R

50|$|At the carnival, under Joseph’s leadership, Samuel grew {{up into a}} trouble-maker, and {{together}} {{with his right hand}} Eli dabbled in petty crime and felonies, such as robbery, etc. Knowing he couldn’t control Samuel anymore, Joseph exiled Eli from the carnival and even sent Arnold back in time to kill baby Samuel at Coyote Sands, unsuccessfully. Ultimately, Joseph gave Emile Danko <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> find and capture Samuel for everyone’s sake.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> do all <b>compass</b> and straightedge constructions without the straightedge. That is, it {{is possible}}, using only <b>a</b> <b>compass,</b> <b>to</b> find {{the intersection of}} two lines given two points on each, and to find the tangent points to circles. It is not, however, possible to do all constructions using only a straightedge. It is possible to do them with straightedge alone given one circle and its center.|$|R
5000|$|In this game, the {{objective}} is to hold the ball (skull) for the longest amount of time. If holding the ball, a player cannot run or attack unless he drops the ball by pressing the [...] "fire" [...] key.

5000|$|Several {{manufacturers}} offer cameras with {{a built-in}} GPS receiver, but most cameras with this capability are camera phones as camera manufacturers after initial experience in the market came to treat GPS cameras as a niche market. [...] The 2008 Nikon P6000, for example, an early geotagging camera, was replaced in 2010 by the P7000 which lacked that feature. [...] Some models also include <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> indicate the direction the camera was facing when the picture was taken.|$|R

50|$|According to scientists, {{if people}} can stick objects to their body, not only metal but also other materials, it has {{actually}} {{nothing to do}} with magnetism. Skeptic Benjamin Radford has used <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> check the magnetic field of a person that claimed to be a human magnet. He claims that person didn't actually produce magnetic fields. It shows that human magnetism uses different kinds of physical effects. Many scientists and proponents of science, including James Randi, claim that this ability is caused by sticky skin.|$|R

500|$|At any location, the Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{can be represented}} by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is <b>to</b> use <b>a</b> <b>compass</b> <b>to</b> determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the declination (...) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination (...) or magnetic dip. The intensity (...) of the field {{is proportional to the}} force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in [...] (North), [...] (East) and [...] (Down) coordinates.|$|R
