Since the <b>snowlines</b> are thought to generate density and temperature bumps, it is important {{to take into account the}} disk opacity variations when the various dust elements are sublimated. Aims. We track the time evolution of planet traps and <b>snowlines</b> in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk using an opacity table that accounts for the composition of the dust material. Methods. We coupled a dynamical and thermodynamical disk model with a temperature-dependent opacity table (that accounts for the sublimation of the main dust components) to investigate the formation and evolution of <b>snowlines</b> and planet traps during the first million years of disk evolution. Results. Starting from a minimum mass solar nebula, we find that the disk mid-plane temperature profile shows several plateaux (0. 1 − 1 AU wide) at the different sublimation temperatures of the species that make up the dust. For water ice, the corresponding plateau can be larger than 1 AU, which means that this is a snow “region” rather than a snow “line”. As a consequence, the surface density of solids in the snow region may increase gradually, not abruptly. Several planet traps and desert regions appear naturally as a result of abrupt local changes in the temperature and density profiles over the disk lifetime. These structures are mostly located at the edges of the temperature plateaux (surrounding the dust sublimation lines) and at the heat-transition barrier where the disk stellar heating and viscous heating are of the same magnitude (around 10 AU after 1 Myr).

40|$|Understanding {{potential}} {{effects of climate}} warming on snow-dominated watersheds is confounded by several environmental characteristics. Major river basins experience non-uniform climate forcings caused by variations in latitude and elevation. These variations result in hydrologic heterogeneity at multiple spatial and temporal scales, making predictions {{about the effects of}} warming temperatures on surface runoff difficult. Here, we present current results from a study in the Salmon River Basin in central Idaho that highlight the influence of topography and climatic variability within a large river basin on the runoff character. Study tributaries are grouped into three precipitation regimes that were selected using hypsometry. High elevation (2500 - 3200 m) study catchments are dominated by snow and have smooth, broad hydrographs. Mid elevation (1500 - 2200 m) basins span elevations that receive both snow and rain. These hydrographs reflect characteristics of both snowmelt and rainfall runoff. Liquid precipitation dominates lower elevation catchments (400 - 1500), with flashier hydrographs that exhibit low baseflows. The unique behavior of tributaries within different precipitation zones is further revealed by the temporal separation of peak flows within respective elevation/precipitation zones; peak runoff becomes progressively later with increasing elevation and the proportion of snow to rain. Data from our monitoring sites suggest that environmental lapse rate is a first order control on precipitation and that the characteristics of runoff within a given zone is largely controlled by the range of elevations that comprise the catchment. Hydrologic analysis of USGS gages along the mainstem Salmon demonstrate that more water is delivered per unit area from high elevation catchments located on {{the western edge of the}} Salmon River basin. This suggests that there is a strong orographical forced precipitation gradient in a west to east direction and demonstrates that discharge does not scale linearly with drainage area in the Salmon River basin. This analysis provides physically based measurements that 1) highlight the hydrologic heterogeneity present within a large river basin, 2) provide insights about the potential hydrologic evolution of watersheds if <b>snowlines</b> rise by utilizing a space for time substitution, 3) provide an elegant mechanism for understanding the topographic sensitivity of a basin to rising <b>snowlines</b> (hypsometry) and 4) challenge well established theoretical hydrologic scaling relationships...|$|R
