Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czechoslovakia) in 1900, Norbert Troller {{served as}} a soldier in World War I, {{spending}} time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
50|$|The complex {{consists}} of two <b>staggered</b> <b>buildings.</b> The main entrance, made almost completely of glass, {{is located on the}} corner of the front building and is complemented by the four large windows of the lofty council chamber diagonally across the facade to the west. The building contains meeting rooms on the first floor. An extension, completed in 1964 and also designed by Jacobsen, contains three floors of offices. Standing further back, it is connected to the original building with a glass corridor. The complex is built in reinforced concrete, faced in marble from Porsgrunn in Norway, with a copper-plated roof. The square windows are set flush to the outside. When it was opened in 1942, its chairs, desks, lamps and textiles were all designed by Arne Jacobsen. Examples can still be seen inside the building. Comprehensive restoration work was completed in 2003, taking full account of the original design and the materials used. In 1992, Søllerød Town Hall became the first building in Denmark built after 1900 to be given the status of a listed building.|$|R
25|$|Mantetsu quickly {{expanded}} the system inherited from Russia to <b>staggering</b> proportions, <b>building</b> coal mines at Fushun and Yantai, and harbor facilities at Andong, Yingkou, and Dalian. At each station, Mantetsu built hotels for travelers and warehouses for goods. Japanese settlers were encouraged through {{the construction of}} schools, libraries, hospitals and public utilities. The Mantetsu Research Wing was the centerpiece of Japan's colonial program, and instigated agricultural research into development of soybean farming.

50|$|Its {{location}} {{in the foothills of}} Sierra Morena made it possible to design an urban program in which the location and physical relationships between the various constructions were expressive of the role of each in the setting. The palace was located at a higher level, and <b>staggered</b> its <b>buildings</b> {{along the side of the}} mountain in an expression of clear preeminence over the urban hamlets and the Aljama Mosque spread across the plains below. Following the terraces, the first corresponds to the residential area of the caliph, next comes the official area including the houses of the viziers, the guard-room, administrative offices and gardens. Next is the city proper, with housing, crafts, and the great mosque of the two lower terraces separated by another wall in order to isolate the upper palace complex. Archaeological research has revealed an urban morphology characterized by the existence of large areas of undeveloped land, which serves to empty the entire southern front of the fortress, ensuring privacy and maintaining an open, idyllic country landscape. The only spaces built on the lowest level are two broad bands: the western, with an urban management orthogon, and the eastern, with less rigid planning.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} several robust preconditioners {{for solving}} the saddle-point linear systems {{that arise from}} spatial discretization of unsteady and steady variable-coefficient Stokes equations on a uniform <b>staggered</b> grid. <b>Building</b> {{on the success of}} using the classical projection method as a preconditioner for the coupled velocity-pressure system [B. E. Griffith, J. Comp. Phys., 228 (2009), pp. 75657595], as well as established techniques for steady and unsteady Stokes flow in the finite-element literature, we construct preconditioners that employ independent generalized Helmholtz and Poisson solvers for the velocity and pressure subproblems. We demonstrate that only a single cycle of a standard geometric multigrid algorithm serves as an effective inexact solver for each of these subproblems. Contrary to traditional wisdom, we find that the Stokes problem can be solved nearly as efficiently as the independent pressure and velocity subproblems, making the overall cost of solving the Stokes system comparable to the cost of classical projection or fractional step methods for incompressible flow, even for steady flow and in the presence of large density and viscosity contrasts. Two of the five preconditioners considered here are found to be robust to GMRES restarts and to increasing problem size, making them suitable for large-scale problems. Our work opens many possibilities for constructing novel unsplit temporal integrators for finite-volume spatial discretizations of the equations of low Mach and incompressible flow dynamics.

60|$|Harry sprang {{forward and}} Frank {{was glad that}} he did so. He {{realized}} {{that this was not a}} matter for calm discussion, and vigorous action was a relief. Another cloud of smoke met them as they drew near the house, and the sparks that came flying out of it fell thick about them. The heat scorched their faces and they gasped in the acrid vapor, while Frank's eyes were smarting intolerably when he <b>staggered</b> into the <b>building.</b> There was, however, less smoke inside it, and a fierce light beat in through one window. Flinging the old clothes about they came upon the keg and found that the head was lying loose. Working in desperate haste they forced the top hoop upward and Harry wrapped a woolen garment over the top of the keg. After that he flung everything in a lidless wooden case out upon the floor and pounced upon a little box that fell among the rest.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, after briefly {{considering}} {{reconstruction of}} the IMELI building to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was delisted {{by the government of}} Georgia and sold to the Capital Vostok company with the intention to build a luxury five-star Kempinski hotel. The suggested architectural development was designed by Berlin-based architects Christoph Kohl and Rob Krier. In the process of renovation, the investor started to demolish the building without due permission and IMELI lost a number of its original elements, leading to a series of protests from preservationists. By 2008, the project had <b>staggered</b> and the <b>building</b> was sold to the Abu Dhabi United Group, which agreed to stop demolition and preserve the historical façade of the building. In 2011, Tbilisi City Hall gave permission to the new investor to construct, next to the Shchusev building, a 300-metre-high glass skyscraper, which now towers over the largely 19th and early 20th-century architecture of Rustaveli Avenue and is connected to the IMELI building via a glass walkway.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{evolution}} of urban planning of the ancient city of Tortosa {{is one of the main}} projects of the Grup de Recerca Seminari de Protohistoria i Arqueologia of the Rovira i Virgili University. The reconstruction of the urban topography of the Iberian and Roman city is the foremost goal of the project. Starting from the interpretation of the archaeological work carried out in the city, especially the interventions led by our team in Tortosa during the last ten years, we offer a first approach to the reality of the Roman occupation of ancient D ertosa. It is a a proposal of urban reconstruction of a section of the city focused on the Rastre ravine, an extramural area that was part of a southern suburb of the city, probably linked to the operations that took place at the river port. We have seen as the built spaces were adapted to the ground by <b>building</b> <b>staggered</b> platforms, and thus overcoming the morphological constraints imposed by a complex topography. </p...|$|R
5000|$|... 655 Park Avenue is {{designed}} in the Georgian architectural style, with a limestone base on the lower floors, and brick masonry on the upper floors. The building is centered around a courtyard garden facing Park Avenue. The <b>building's</b> <b>staggered</b> height design, considered unique for Park Avenue co-ops of its era, {{was a result of}} restrictions placed on the developer by a syndicate of owners of nearby mansions who sold the land on which 655 Park Avenue was built. Andrew Alpern devotes an entire chapter in the book, [...] "Historic Manhattan Apartment Houses", to the [...] "Battle for Suitable Scale at 655 Avenue." [...] There are three wings, an 8-story wing on 67th Street, a 7-story wing on 68th Street, and the main mid-block building which is 11 stories. The building has a duplex penthouse with a 3000 sqft roof terrace, in addition to lower terraces on top of the 68th Street wing and the 67th Street wing. 655 Park Avenue has entrances on 67th Street and 68th Street and full time doormen and elevator operators.|$|R
30|$|The {{system was}} first {{proposed}} by Fintel (1968), who {{found out that}} the staggered wall systems are very competitive with the conventional form of construction and are more economical. Mee et al. (1975) carried out shaking table tests of 1 / 15 scaled models for the staggered wall systems and found that the consistent mass analysis gave reasonable estimation of dynamic behavior of the system. Kim and Jun (2011) evaluated the seismic performance of partially <b>staggered</b> wall apartment <b>buildings</b> using non-linear static and dynamic analysis, and compared the results with those of conventional shear wall apartment buildings. Lee and Kim (2013) investigated the seismic performance of six and 12 -story staggered wall structures with a middle corridor based on the FEMA P 695 procedure. It was found that the collapse margin ratios of the model structures obtained from incremental dynamic analyses turned out to be larger than the limit states specified in the FEMA P 695. Kim and Han (2013) investigated the sensitivity of design variables to the seismic response of staggered wall structures. It was observed that when the earthquake intensity is relatively small, the yield stress of rebars and the concrete strength in the link beams are important factors as well as inherent damping ratio. As the intensity of seismic load increased, the strength of columns became another important factor. Lee and Kim (2013) derived empirical formulas for fundamental natural period of reinforced concrete staggered wall structures. They found that the natural periods of the staggered wall structures {{are similar to those of}} the shear wall structures having the same overall configuration.|$|R
