25|$|The {{flagship}} title, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, is {{a monthly}} comic book series that debuted on November 28, 2012. The series is typically written in story arcs that span either two or four issues apiece; Katie Cook and Andy Price write and illustrate the first arc, respectively, while Heather Nuhfer and Amy Mebberson perform {{the same on}} the second. It {{was accompanied by a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>publication,</b> Micro-Series, which ran for 10 issues from February to December 2013. Each issue of this title centered around a single character, with Thom Zahler writing the first issue and various writers and artists involved with the others. A second title, subtitled Friends Forever, debuted on January 22, 2014 with the first issue penned by Alex de Campi; it consisted of single-issue stories, each focusing on a different pair of characters. Friends Forever ended in April 2017 after 38 issues and was replaced by a third title, Legends of Magic, that same month. This series presents stories that center on key figures connected to the history and development of magic in Equestria. IDW has also published several one-off issues.|$|E

So for Adair, the issue is that an experimental effect depends on the participants' interpretation of the situation; this is why manipulation checks are important in social sciences experiments. So he thinks it is not awareness per se, nor special attention per se, but participants' interpretation that must be investigated in order to discover if/how the experimental conditions interact with the participants' goals. This can affect whether participants believe something, if they act on it or do not see it as in their interest, etc.|$|R

More medical schools have opened in Saudi Arabia {{in the last few years}} than have existed over the last three decades. Currently, the education of health professionals is based on assumption and traditions and rarely on research findings. Medical teaching has evolved from being opinion-based to evidence-based and the art of teaching is rapidly becoming the &#x 2032;science&#x 2032; of teach-ing. The need for evidence in our teaching and {{medical education}} prac-tices is as important as it is in assessing a new therapy. This approach to education is not only associated with better results in terms of better learning, from the side of the students (the consumers), but also has a wider impact on patient care and the community. Moreover, in this age of accountability, litigations and quality assurance, the need for BEME becomes greater. Some suggestions to implement BEME in Saudi Arabia have been put forward and these are the training of medical education professionals in the use the existing information systems, and dissemi-nating information through the creation of a BEME journal (<b>secondary</b> <b>publication)</b> that publishes a critically appraised summary of medical education articles that are both valid and of immediate clinical use...|$|E

We found duplicate publication cases {{in the field of}} Kampo (traditional Japanese herbal medicine) while compiling the Evidence Reports of Kampo Treatment (EKAT) 2009 published by the Special Committee for Evidence-based Medicine (EBM), the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine (JSOM). Therefore, we checked the articles that appeared in the EKAT 2009 and analyzed how duplicate publication occurred. Methods: The EKAT 2009 contains structured abstracts of 320 randomized controlled trial studies. We checked 384 articles referred to by the structured abstracts to identify duplicate publications according to the following criteria: hypothesis and results are the same; the authors are in common; no description as to a <b>secondary</b> <b>publication</b> is offered; no cross-references to related papers. Results: Eleven articles that appeared in the EKAT 2009 were identified as duplicate publications. These articles showed four duplicate patterns: reproducing an already published article with the same sample data and results (n= 3); adding new sample data with the same results (n= 1); reporting part of the preliminary sample with the same results (n= 1); translating an original article into another language (n= 6). Conclusion:Among the 11 duplicate publications in the EKAT 2009, we discovered 4 duplicate patterns. These patterns reflect Japanese researchers’ behavior that leads to the production of duplicate publications: the authors complete a previous article and submit it to a more prestigious journal; translate an original English article for Japanese physicians without referring to the original paper. To raise the awareness of duplicate publication among researchers, the understanding of publication ethics is essential...|$|E
