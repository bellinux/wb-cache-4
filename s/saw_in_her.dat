25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney {{acted as if}} we had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, being the first London lady with whom I had the pleasure of acquaintance, I <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing her talent, Kollwitz's father {{arranged}} {{for her to}} begin lessons in drawing and copying plaster casts when she was twelve. At sixteen she began making drawings of working people, the sailors and peasants she <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> father's offices. Wishing to continue her studies {{at a time when}} no colleges or academies were open to young women, Kollwitz enrolled in an art school for women in Berlin. There she studied with Karl Stauffer-Bern, a friend of the artist Max Klinger. The etchings of Klinger, their technique and social concerns, were an inspiration to Kollwitz.|$|E

Walter find that his effort to store William's mind has failed, and takes time to {{consider}} William's last message he gave to Olivia: [...] "I knew the dog wouldn't hunt". Later, Peter visits Olivia to rekindle their relationship when he notices a drawing of the same man in the X t-shirt he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mind. Olivia cannot name the man, but nonchalantly refers to him as the person who is going to kill her.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} before she knocked! I <b>saw</b> it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> white face, I <b>saw</b> it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> trembling hands, I <b>saw</b> it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> look at Laura.|$|R

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> a future candidate for high officeâ€”ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] {{opened the door to the}} older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build".|$|E
500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, {{she felt as if she}} was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E

6000|$|And {{there she}} paused; while Ella chattered on: 'Oh, sister, {{if you were}} but at home, you would be a bridesmaid now, and perhaps we should.

60|$|Lady Dennisford had failed. I <b>saw</b> it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face {{as soon as}} I {{entered the}} room, and her first few words {{confirmed}} it.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand to him, unnaturally thin and white, covered with jewels. Again he <b>saw</b> {{something}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes which stirred him vaguely.|$|R

6000|$|Benson paused, half vexed at his volubility, {{and gazed}} keenly at Saxon {{to see if}} she had {{followed}} him. What he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face and eyes satisfied him, and he added, with a short laugh: ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} her {{gratitude}} upon him. For {{the first time}} he <b>saw</b> something <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face--heard it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> tone, which made his heart beat. After all she was human.|$|R
6000|$|... "The woman {{believed}} {{herself in}} the right. She believed that the saints of heaven were on her side. I <b>saw</b> it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> attitude, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> gestures. Perhaps she was right." ...|$|R

60|$|I bowed low, {{such was}} my respect for Dame Paul, and {{she rose and}} curtseyed. She wore a widow's cap and a black gown, and I <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> deep-lined face a {{resemblance}} to her son.|$|E
60|$|Blondell <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{face the}} look of the woman who is willing to assume any guilt, any shame for her lover, and, {{dropping}} his eyes before her gaze, growled a curse and left the room.|$|E
60|$|Her clenched hand {{tightened}} as she spoke. He <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{face she}} would say no more, that she wanted urgently to leave it there. He turned again towards the staircase. He glanced at her and went down.|$|E
