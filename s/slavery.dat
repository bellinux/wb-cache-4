5|$|<b>Slavery</b> {{in ancient}} Greece {{was a common}} practice, as was <b>slavery</b> in other {{societies}} at the time. Some writers in ancient Greece (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered <b>slavery</b> natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in Socratic dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of <b>slavery.</b>|$|E

Taylor's Negro <b>Slavery</b> in Arkansas (1958), Eugene D. Genovese's The Political Economy of <b>Slavery</b> (1961), and Ann J. Lane's anthology of essays The Debate Over Slavery: Stanley Elkins and His Critics (1971).|$|E
5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of <b>slavery.</b> Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions {{that the goal of}} the rebel slaves was to end <b>slavery</b> in the Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending <b>slavery.</b>|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hinde opposed <b>slavery.</b> Although their parents owned slaves, {{he and his}} {{siblings}} repudiated <b>slavery</b> on religious grounds. Hinde's opposition increased and eventually he and other friends became outspoken critics of the institution in Kentucky, where <b>slavery</b> was commonplace {{in the middle and}} western parts of the state. In the Great Awakening, Methodists were prominent among those who opposed <b>slavery,</b> although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Wilberforce {{supported}} {{the campaign for}} the complete abolition of <b>slavery,</b> and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the <b>Slavery</b> Abolition Act 1833, which abolished <b>slavery</b> {{in most of the}} British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek <b>slavery.</b> The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of <b>slavery</b> {{as a mode of}} production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (<b>Slavery</b> in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him <b>slavery</b> was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.|$|E

5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} {{the abolition of}} <b>slavery</b> in Spanish America, as it was {{seen as part of}} the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where <b>slavery</b> was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where <b>slavery</b> was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, <b>slavery</b> had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E
5|$|On {{the issue}} of <b>slavery,</b> Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified <b>slavery</b> in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed <b>slavery.</b> During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending <b>slavery</b> by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slavery</b> in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial <b>slavery</b> had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of <b>Slavery</b> in Antiquity among his works for the abolition of <b>slavery</b> in the French colonies.|$|E

5|$|<b>Slavery</b> in Indiana {{occurred}} {{between the time}} of French rule during the late seventeenth century and 1826, with a few traces of <b>slavery</b> afterward. When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans from the region, <b>slavery</b> was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with the Indians and the French. When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800, William Henry Harrison, a former slaveholder, was appointed governor and <b>slavery</b> continued to be tolerated {{through a series of}} laws enacted by the appointed legislature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slavery</b> issues {{dominated}} Breckinridge's political career, although historians {{disagree about}} Breckinridge's views. In Breckinridge: Statesman, Soldier, Symbol, William C. Davis argues that, by adulthood, Breckinridge regarded <b>slavery</b> as evil; his {{entry in the}} 2002 Encyclopedia of World Biography records that he advocated voluntary emancipation. In Proud Kentuckian: John C. Breckinridge 1821–1875, Frank Heck disagrees, citing Breckinridge's consistent advocacy for <b>slavery</b> protections, beginning with his opposition to emancipationist candidates—including his uncle, Robert Jefferson Breckinridge—in the state elections of 1849.|$|E
5|$|The Fiery Trial {{begins with}} Lincoln's {{encounters}} with <b>slavery</b> {{in his early}} life, growing up in Kentucky and Indiana. He occasionally dealt with issues of <b>slavery</b> in his law practice in Illinois. The book also discusses Lincoln's position on <b>slavery</b> {{in the context of}} his political career. Lincoln was a moderate, attempting {{to bridge the gap between}} the abolitionist Radical Republicans and conservative Democrats, including those in the slave-holding states, whom he hoped would choose preserving the Union over steadfastly defending <b>slavery.</b> Lincoln initially supported the idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to Africa, a stance supported by some politicians at the time, although considered unethical by many. However, Lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on <b>slavery</b> when he determined that to win the American Civil War, he needed to act to end <b>slavery.</b>|$|E

5|$|Up until 1873, when <b>slavery</b> was {{abolished}} in Puerto Rico, {{the wealth}} amassed by many landowners in Puerto Rico derived {{mainly from the}} exploitation of slaves. But <b>slavery</b> generated its antithesis—disobedience, uprisings and flights.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of <b>slavery</b> in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} <b>slavery,</b> and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of <b>slavery,</b> he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates <b>slavery</b> {{with his}} Northern cousin Ophelia who, while {{opposing}} <b>slavery,</b> is prejudiced against black people.

5|$|By March 1808, Jennings {{believed}} that his {{future in the}} Harrison-dominated {{western part of the}} territory was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success {{in the eastern part of}} the territory. Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed <b>slavery</b> and Harrison's aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings's beliefs, while the western portion of the territory and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow <b>slavery</b> were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow <b>slavery</b> in the territory. Jennings and his supporters who opposed <b>slavery</b> wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison's administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of <b>slavery</b> who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that <b>slavery</b> instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of <b>slavery</b> decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that <b>slavery</b> was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E
