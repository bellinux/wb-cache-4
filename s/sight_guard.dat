25|$|The M1928A1 variant entered mass {{production}} {{before the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, {{in place of the}} distinctive vertical foregrip ("pistol grip"), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons {{during the early years of}} World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular <b>sight</b> <b>guard</b> wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.|$|E
5000|$|The Spanish M43, {{produced}} in A Coruña until 1957, was {{a variant of}} the 98k with a straight bolt handle, a front <b>sight</b> <b>guard</b> and a handle groove in the front stock much like the earlier [...] It was chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser calibre. When Spain began switching to the CETME automatic rifle, many M43 were converted to FR8 rifles for military training purposes and Guardia Civil service.|$|E

50|$|Similar to the Type 38 Carbine {{from the}} middle band back. The cavalry carbine is almost entirely {{different}} {{from the middle}} band forward with an under-folding bayonet, metal nosecap, stacking hook {{to the left side}} of the nosecap and wide front <b>sight</b> <b>guards.</b> This model was introduced in 1911. There are three variations of this rifle. Each variation based entirely on the nosecap size and the spacing of the nosecap screws. They have a unique storage compartment in the buttstock for a cleaning rod.|$|R
6000|$|The voyage thence up the Derwent Frith {{displays}} a grand succession of fairy visions, in its entire length elsewhere unequaled. In gliding over {{the deep blue}} sea studded with lovely islets luxuriant to the water's edge, one is at a loss which scene to choose for contemplation and to admire most. When the Huon and Bruni have been passed, there seems no possible chance of a rival; but suddenly Mount Wellington, massive and noble like his brother Etna, literally heaves in <b>sight,</b> sternly <b>guarded</b> on either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney; presently we arrive at Sullivan's Cove--Hobart! ...|$|R
50|$|The pistol {{features}} ambidextrous safety, a decocker {{activated by}} the safety lever, emphasized <b>sights,</b> combat trigger <b>guard,</b> an integrated accessory mounting groove {{in the frame}} (added after the year 2000, in the Pro, for Professional, version), firing pin block; the pistol will not fire unless the trigger is squeezed {{all the way back}} protecting from accidental falling.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle-attached variant {{could be}} {{mounted on the}} {{underside}} of either a Type56, Type 81, or Type 95 [...] It is lightweight, compact, breech-loading, and single-shot. It consists of a hand <b>guard,</b> <b>sight,</b> aluminum receiver assembly, barrel stop, and firing mechanism. The weapon could be used by any front-line assault troops in need of a long range explosive.|$|R
50|$|The Agents {{lived on}} in the film's continuation, the MMORPG The Matrix Online. In line with the {{brokered}} truce created by Neo {{at the end of}} The Matrix Revolutions, Agents were no longer assigned to kill redpills on <b>sight.</b> Instead, they <b>guard</b> various areas of the Matrix that are still restricted to the awakened. The Agents revert to their original programming {{with the collapse of the}} Truce.|$|R
5000|$|Griff - A {{somewhat}} small, timid, and cowardly {{species of}} dragon, {{caught by the}} Inquisition quite easily after failing to bluff his way to freedom and fainting at the <b>sight</b> of a <b>guard's</b> sword. Totemized by them, he is found by the player at the Underground's Crossroads, and aids them in recovering the artifacts needed to restore magic. Voiced in the game by Marty Ingels ...|$|R
5000|$|If war was declared, or {{an enemy}} fleet was <b>sighted,</b> the <b>guard</b> ships could become fully manned {{and ready for}} sea {{in a matter of}} hours or days, as opposed to the months it could take to recommission a ship [...] "in ordinary". This was of {{greatest}} utility to the British prior to the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear against Spain. On 10 July, 1739 King George II authorised preparations for a maritime assault on Spanish colonies. For this purpose, Admiral Edward Vernon was able to assemble a fleet of eight fully armed and provisioned guardships within ten days of the Royal Command. The fleet was so quickly assembled that it reached the Spanish West Indies on 22 October, one day before war was formally declared.|$|R
25|$|Mark of the Ninja {{consists}} of stealth-oriented 2D platforming. The character {{is required to}} sneak {{through a series of}} environments while staying out of <b>sight</b> of <b>guards</b> and performing silent assassinations. Levels are divided into areas of light and darkness; the player character is visible to enemies in the former and invisible in the latter, though passing within a certain immediate distance of an enemy's face results in the player being spotted irrespective of lighting. Sounds such as running may also give away the player character's location and are represented visually by a rapidly expanding circle. Unusual for a platformer, Mark of the Ninja employs a line of sight mechanic, meaning that enemies which would be invisible to the character are also invisible to the player, though their sounds are represented on screen {{in the same manner as}} the player character's.|$|R
5000|$|Wilke grew {{up during}} the Cold War near the Berlin Wall, which he passed every day {{on his way to}} school. The {{frequent}} <b>sight</b> of patrol <b>guards</b> with guns influenced his outlook on life from an early age. He describes Berlin at the time as: [...] "Probably the most left radical place in Germany in the 70s, terrorists, a lot of demonstrations, and probably the first address to hear the latest American music, because of the radio shows the US soldiers brought to Berlin." ...|$|R
60|$|Overpowered by his exertions, he lays {{his head}} back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute, when he again resumes his {{watching}} of the weather and {{his attention to the}} muffled sounds. In the rendering of those little services, and in the manner of their acceptance, the trooper has become installed as necessary to him. Nothing has been said, but it is quite understood. He falls a step or two backward to be out of <b>sight</b> and mounts <b>guard</b> a little behind his mother's chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything is {{arranged}} now," [...] he said. [...] "The {{whole of the}} fellows are bound, and the road is free for you. I should go out by the back way, for there {{is sure to be}} a little crowd in front of the house, attracted by the <b>sight</b> of the <b>guard</b> standing outside. I do not think that there is any extraordinary hurry, but in an hour or so, if either of the men who have ordered your arrest is waiting at the prison, he may get impatient, and send down to see what detains the party here.|$|R
50|$|Freitag to the rescue: All five messengers, 2 Russians and 3 natives, got through. News reached Freitag at Grozny {{around midnight}} of the 15/16th. Freitag had {{foreseen}} {{something of the}} sort and had troops spread out between Grozny and Gerzel. At 9pm on the 18th his advanced <b>guard</b> <b>sighted</b> the camp. The next day Vorontsov joined him and on 20 July the whole force was safe in Gerzel. On the last day one company got left behind and was destroyed, only 3 men escaping. The final day's losses were 81 killed and 148 wounded. Freitag lost 14 killed and 28 wounded.|$|R
50|$|Beijing was a {{location}} of the capital {{during the last three}} Chinese imperial dynasties (the Yuan, Ming, and Qing). It was also secondary capital to two northern dynasties (the Liao and Jin), and is therefore often referred to as an ancient capital of five dynasties. It had an extensive fortification system, consisting of the Forbidden City, the Imperial city, the Inner city, and the Outer city. Fortifications included gate towers, gates, archways, watchtowers, barbicans, barbican towers, barbican gates, barbican archways, sluice gates, sluice gate towers, enemy <b>sighting</b> towers, corner <b>guard</b> towers, and a moat system. It had the most extensive defense system in Imperial China.|$|R
50|$|As La Haye Sainte {{falls and}} with the French skirmishers and cannon slowly {{grinding}} down the British numbers, Colonel Ford, the Prince of Wales' Own Volunteers commander, goes to pieces and Sharpe's friend D'Alembord, who had been previously shot in the leg but insisted on returning to the battle, succumbs to his wound {{as he tries to}} take command. Just then, Napoleon decides to issue the final blow by advancing two columns of the Imperial Guard. Although some of the less-experienced soldiers and officers are unnerved by the <b>sight</b> of the <b>Guard,</b> Wellington is well-experienced at repelling troops in column formation, and personally commands the volleys that destroy the larger column.|$|R
50|$|As a teen {{still in}} Guelph, Caron was {{fortunate}} enough to earn a transfer to the medium security reformatory in Brampton, Ontario, to serve a fourteen-month sentence. His luck didn't last as he had the misfortune of crossing a bigger inmate, which culminated in Caron's smashing said inmate in the neck with a hockey stick during a recreation period. Thinking the inmate was deceased (he was actually only unconscious), Caron hid the body under a boxing ring out of <b>sight</b> of the <b>guards.</b> Knowing he would face serious jail time, possibly hanging, for murdering someone, Caron made the decision to escape as soon as possible.|$|R
5000|$|.....after midday, we <b>sighted</b> the Old <b>Guard,</b> with Napoleon {{riding in}} their midst... the enemy troops, {{sighting}} our unruly force, got their muskets {{at the ready}} and proudly continued on their way without hurrying their step... Like blocks of granite, they remained invulnerable... I shall never forget the unhurried step and awesome resolution of these soldiers, for whom the threat of death was a daily and familiar experience. With their tall bearskin caps, blue uniforms, white belts, red plumes, and epaulettes, they looked like poppies on the snow-covered battlefield... Column followed upon column, dispersing us with musket fire and ridiculing our useless display of chivalry... the Imperial Guard with Napoleon ploughed through our Cossacks like a 100-gun ship through fishing skiffs.|$|R
500|$|A {{ploughed}} strip [...] wide {{was created}} {{along the entire}} length of the inner German border. An adjoining [...] "protective strip" [...] (Schutzstreifen) [...] wide was placed under tight control. A [...] "restricted zone" [...] (...) a further [...] wide was created in which only those holding a special permit could live or work. Trees and brush were cut down along the border to clear lines of <b>sight</b> for the <b>guards</b> and to eliminate cover for would-be crossers. Houses adjoining the border were torn down, bridges were closed and barbed-wire fencing was put up in many places. Farmers were permitted to work their fields along the border only in daylight hours and under the watch of armed guards, who were authorised to use weapons if their orders were not obeyed.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of Taejong's reign, Taejo refused to relinquish the royal seal that signified the legitimacy of a king's rule. Uncomfortable {{at the fact that}} his father did not recognize him as a de jure ruler because of the family deaths he had caused, Taejong sent several messengers, among them his childhood friend Bak Sun, to recover the royal seal. However, Taejo assassinated every messenger that came into <b>sight</b> of his <b>guards</b> as a sign of his fury at Taejong, who remained unaware of their fates. This episode became known as the Case of the Hamhung Envoys, and the term [...] "Hamhung envoy" [...] is still used in the Korean language to refer to a person who has gone on an assignment and has not been heard from.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 30 carbineor cavalry rifle (...) is a {{modified}} version made 300 mm (11.8 in) shorter than the infantry model (the carbine's barrel measures 480 mm (18.9 in) against 790 mm (31.1 in) for the standard infantry issue). Intended to equip cavalry troops with a modern carbine. Differences other than the shorter barrel and stock from the standard infantry rifle is that it lacked a handguard over the barrel, rear sight ladder only went up to 1,500 meters (compared to the rifles 2,000 meters), front <b>sight</b> had protection <b>guards</b> on each side, slight changes to the bolt stop latch and the sling swivels were moved {{to the left side}} of the gun to prevent the bolt from digging into the cavalry trooper's back. The pre-production version lacked a bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|A {{ploughed}} strip 10 m (32.8 ft) wide {{was created}} {{along the entire}} length of the inner German border. An adjoining [...] "protective strip" [...] (Schutzstreifen) 500 m (1,640 ft) wide was placed under tight control. A [...] "restricted zone" [...] (Sperrzone) a further 5 km wide was created in which only those holding a special permit could live or work. Trees and brush were cut down along the border to clear lines of <b>sight</b> for the <b>guards</b> and to eliminate cover for would-be crossers. Houses adjoining the border were torn down, bridges were closed and barbed-wire fencing was put up in many places.

6000|$|... "My darling Jeanne and Virginie, you {{can imagine}} what joy I felt when I {{received}} your little note to-day and heard that you were still safe. I could hardly believe my senses when, on opening the little ball of paper which one of our guards thrust into my hand, I found that it was from you, and that you were both safe and well. I am writing this crouched down on the ground behind Madame de Vigny, and so hidden from the <b>sight</b> of our <b>guards,</b> but I can only write a few lines at a time, lest I should be detected. Tell our good friend that I fear there is little chance of escape. We are watched night and day. We are locked up at night, three or four together, in little cells, but in the day we are in a common hall.|$|R
40|$|Imagine {{a mighty}} drug lord {{confined}} in the toughest maximum-security prison. One night he escapes {{through a hole}} in the shower. This hole leads to a 1500 -metre tunnel that ends in a construction site in a nearby neighbourhood. The tunnel has been equipped by expert mining engineers with lighting and ventilation. Its construction required 3250 tonnes of earth to be removed in <b>sight</b> of the <b>guards</b> in the prison’s towers. It seems like the plot of a blockbuster thriller. Unfortunately, it is an account of Joaquín Guzmán Loera’s jailbreak from the Altiplano prison near Mexico City. Guzmán – known as “El Chapo” (Shorty) – is head of the Sinaloa Cartel, the most powerful global drug-trafficking syndicate. Forbes magazine rated “El Chapo” the 67 th-most-powerful man in the world in 2013. His escape necessarily implies an inside job at some level. The jailbreak hence seemingly confirms American narratives that represent Mexico as a corrupt, sluggish and failing state...|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the other}} {{employees}} learn about the termination Carol announced earlier. Believing that everyone is to lose their jobs, they throw out and destroy all the company equipment and burn everything in <b>sight,</b> forcing security <b>guard</b> Clara (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) {{to put down the}} unruly, now destructive and rebellious party. Clay ends up racing Trina's car towards an opening drawbridge, attempting to jump the gap, a feat he'd earlier mentioned to Josh. Josh drives Mary's minivan alongside him, and tries to convince Clay not to jump, but he is still angered and heartbroken from Carol offering Josh the job, as much as remembering her insults. Believing that he's worthless he still decides to jump, regardless of whether he makes it and whether he lives or dies. After everyone, including Trina, fails to convince Clay to pull over, Josh threatens to jump the gap with him, and Clay reluctantly allows it. Not willing to die, Carol forcefully moves the steering wheel from Josh, causing the car to swerve into Clay's car, crashing both vehicles. Clay's car hits an internet hub, disconnecting the entire city.|$|R
5000|$|In the movie, Gandalf knocks out Denethor {{before taking}} {{command of the}} defence. This does not occur in the book, and Gandalf is {{generally}} far more respectful of Denethor, indeed {{it is not likely}} Gandalf in the novel would be willing or able (allowed) to physically attack and throw down the ruler with impunity in his own citadel, in full <b>sight</b> of his <b>guard</b> and soldiery. In the book Gandalf, though critical, is depicted as more compassionate towards Denethor when the latter goes insane (rather than being disgusted and angry as in the movie), understanding that the source of the madness is Sauron and the Palantír Denethor was using at great risk and difficulty to facilitate Gondors efforts against the Enemy. Rather than being in opposition to Gandalfs command of the defence, in the book Denethor is indifferent, and tells his men to follow whom they will [...] "even the grey fool" [...] (Gandalf). In the movie Denethor is also shown as self-indulgent, eating and drinking gluttonously while listening to Pippins songs as the besiegers approach the city, whereas in the book he is sternly ascetic in his habits, wearing armour and a sword day and night, and never actually has Pippin sing for him.|$|R
40|$|People {{with visual}} {{impairment}} who have achieved their personal independence, needs to mobilize to do daily activities, as has an own transport must use urban transport, constantly expressing discomfort caused by this service. To know the reason, drivers of urban transportation "do not catch people with visual disabilities," was necessary surveys and interviews with drivers, visually impaired, <b>sighted</b> people, transit <b>guards,</b> and a union president. To check the reality, do follow and testimony at stations and bus stops. During this study, we observed that sighted people do not cooperate {{when they see a}} blind person boarding a bus and transport units do not meet the standards set out in the Disability Act. The results obtained in our study indicate that blind people had reason to complain of not being considered transport users, showing that they are at a clear demonstration of discrimination and exclusion by gentlemen drivers when they stop their transport units to catch them. Las personas con discapacidad visual que han logrado su independencia personal, necesitan movilizarse para realizar sus actividades cotidianas, como no cuentan con un transporte propio deben usar el transporte urbano, manifestando de manera constante las molestias causadas por este servicio. Para conocer el por qué, los choferes de la transportación urbana “no cogen a las personas con discapacidad visual”, fue necesario realizar encuestas y entrevistas a choferes, personas con discapacidad visual, personas videntes, vigilantes de transito, y un presidente de cooperativa. Para comprobar la realidad, realizamos seguimientos y testimonios en las estaciones y paraderos de buses. Durante este trabajo observamos que las personas videntes no colaboran cuando ven a una persona ciega abordar un bus y las unidades del transporte no cumplen con las normas establecidas en la ley de discapacidades...|$|R
