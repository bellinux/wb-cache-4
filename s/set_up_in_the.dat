5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|As Altrincham {{was part}} of the Bowdon parish, {{children}} from the township may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system.

Sunday schools were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 18th and early 19th centuries.
