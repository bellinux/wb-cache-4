5|$|Berry's {{calculated}} <b>showmanship,</b> {{along with}} a mix of country tunes and R tunes, sung in the style of Nat King Cole set to the music of Muddy Waters, brought in a wider audience, particularly affluent white people.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{criticism}} that Babb drew for Mom and Dad, in 1951 he received the first annual Sid Grauman <b>Showmanship</b> Award, presented by the Hollywood Rotary Club {{in honor of his}} accomplishments over the years.|$|E
5|$|Artists who possessed strong <b>showmanship</b> {{skills have}} largely {{influenced}} Scogin; {{some of these}} artists include James Brown, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley. He is also fond of Arcade Fire, The Beatles, Björk, Interpol, and The Killers. In an interview, Scogin {{expressed a desire to}} have seen At The Drive-In and Nirvana before they disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to develop}} inventions he could patent and market, Tesla {{conducted}} {{a range of}} experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, {{one of the first}} ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his <b>showmanship</b> at public lectures.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, Berry {{was working with}} local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income. He had been playing blues since his teens, and he {{borrowed}} both guitar riffs and <b>showmanship</b> techniques from the blues musician T-Bone Walker. He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which {{laid the foundation for}} his guitar style.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and <b>showmanship,</b> dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel {{was simply too}} passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ <b>showmanship</b> and abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E
5|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who noted Madonna's <b>showmanship</b> and her {{skills as a}} performer. They also complimented the camera work in the video, for enhancing the visual aspects of the tour. Ciao Italia topped the Music Video sales chart of Billboard, and became the second best-selling music video cassette of 1988. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000copies.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{received}} many awards and nominations, including five Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, one Guinness World Record, {{and was named}} one of Times 100 most influential {{people in the world}} in 2011. In December 2013, he ranked number one on the Forbes 30 under 30 list. Mars is known for his stage performances and retro <b>showmanship.</b> He is accompanied by his band, The Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums and horns, and also serve as backup singers and dancers. Mars performs {{in a wide range of}} musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and <b>showmanship</b> is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|The menu at the Whopper Bar {{features}} {{as many as}} 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or blue cheese. The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model {{in that it is}} in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of <b>showmanship</b> to the concept.|$|E
5|$|Stengel {{had become}} {{famous for his}} humorous and {{sometimes}} disjointed way of speech while with the Yankees, and these skills of <b>showmanship</b> served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. Stengel retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events {{for the rest of}} his life. Although Stengel is sometimes described as one of the great managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during the Yankee years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was only a good manager when given good players. Stengel is remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled <b>showmanship</b> in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Showmanship</b> {{consists}} of presentation, creativity, costumes, and difficulty.|$|E
25|$|A {{horse show}} class that {{considers}} quality of grooming {{for as much}} as 40% of the total score is called <b>showmanship.</b>|$|E
25|$|Border Collies {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at {{competitive}} obedience, <b>showmanship,</b> flyball, tracking, and USBCHA Sheepdog trials and herding events.|$|E
25|$|Stalking, prowling and duckwalking {{is walking}} that {{maintains}} {{a low profile}} by assuming a low partial squatting position. It is a stage element of guitar <b>showmanship</b> popularized by Chuck Berry.|$|E
25|$|In {{their size}} group, the breed dominates dog agility, obedience, <b>showmanship,</b> flyball, tracking, and herding. Herding {{instincts}} and trainability {{can be measured}} at noncompetitive herding tests. Shelties exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Hickok was {{diagnosed}} {{by a doctor}} in Kansas City, Missouri, with glaucoma and ophthalmia. Though just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline, {{as he had been}} arrested several times for vagrancy, despite earning a good income from gambling and displays of <b>showmanship</b> only a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} 1920s and 1930s, {{the master}} of the Alexandra was William “Cappy” Yates (1890–1966), who {{although}} not known as an outstanding seaman, was knowledgeable about the methods of <b>showmanship</b> that made him and the company popular, such as delaying a departure at Bowen Island to retrieve a child's had which had blown overboard.|$|E
25|$|But {{the real}} {{star of the}} {{production}} is that Jolson voice and that Jolson medley. It was good <b>showmanship</b> to cast this film with lesser people, particularly Larry Parks as the mammy kid... As for Jolson's voice, {{it has never been}} better. Thus the magic of science has produced a composite whole to eclipse the original at his most youthful best.|$|E
25|$|John Henry Anderson was {{pioneering}} {{the same}} transition in London. In 1840 {{he opened the}} New Strand Theatre, where he performed as The Great Wizard of the North. His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert <b>showmanship.</b> He {{became one of the}} earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in 1845.|$|E
25|$|Today, people show American Quarter Horses in {{a variety}} of {{competitive}} events, including, but not limited to, halter classes; western style events such as Western Pleasure, Reining, and cutting; English riding events in the hunt seat style, such as Hunter Under Saddle, working hunter, and hunter hack. Driving classes are available at some shows, as are some timed games. There are also equitation and halter <b>showmanship</b> classes for non-pro exhibitors.|$|E
25|$|As a {{motoring}} discipline, drifting competitions {{were first}} popularized in 1970s Japan, and today are held worldwide and are judged {{according to the}} speed, angle, <b>showmanship</b> and line taken through a corner or set of corners. The desired line is usually dictated by the judge or judges, who describe their desired line as well as highlight areas of importance, such as clipping zones, clipping points and touch and go areas.|$|E
25|$|Hammer's <b>showmanship</b> and {{elaborate}} stage choreography, involving fifteen dancers, twelve backup singers, seven live musicians and two disc jockeys, {{gave him a}} powerful visual appeal. Hammer was the first rap artist {{to put together a}} choreographed show of this type, and his visual flair attracted heavy airplay for his videos on MTV, which at the time had a predominantly white viewership that had aired little rap music before Hammer.|$|E
25|$|Mesmer did not {{contribute}} religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as hypnotism, that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There {{was a great deal}} of professional <b>showmanship</b> inherent to demonstrations of Mesmerism, and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the divine.|$|E
25|$|Mangubat {{claimed that}} {{although}} {{he used to do}} voice lessons before, it was just for a while and that he is more of a self-taught singer. He cites Justin Timberlake, Jesse McCartney, Jonas Brothers, Nick Carter, Backstreet Boys, JC Chasez, Christina Aguilera, Busted, Jojo, Lee Ryan, *NSYNC, Jay Sean, Meljohn Magno, and Melmar Magno as some of his musical influences. He also credits Bon Jovi as an influence for his <b>showmanship</b> when performing.|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{can compete}} in dog agility trials, obedience, <b>showmanship,</b> flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding {{instincts}} and trainability {{can be measured}} at noncompetitive herding tests. English Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. English Shepherds also possess a strong hunting instinct from their past use as an all purpose farm dog. They are known to tree prey and can be trained to flush birds {{by taking advantage of}} the innate herding instinct.|$|E
25|$|With {{their new}} singer, Black Flag and the Minutemen made their first tour of Europe in the Winter of 1981. During that tour, the band met punk icon Richard Hell {{and opened a}} concert for him. Rollins later {{published}} his diaries from that tour in his book Get in the Van. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and became known for fist-fights with audience members. Rollins developed a distinct <b>showmanship</b> on stage, where he could entertain an audience just by talking to them.|$|E
25|$|The Who thrived, and {{continue}} to thrive, despite the deaths {{of two of the}} original members. They are regarded by many rock critics {{as one of the best}} live bands from a period of time that stretched from the mid-1960s to the 2000s, the result of a unique combination of high volume, <b>showmanship,</b> a wide variety of rock beats, and a high-energy sound that alternated between tight and free-form. The Who continue to perform critically acclaimed sets in the 21st century, including highly regarded performances at The Concert For New York City in 2001, the 2004 Isle of Wight Festival, Live 8 in 2005 and the 2007 Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
25|$|Bred to {{work the}} fields, Picards are very {{athletic}} and revel in exercise. A good deal of exercise is therefore a must for this breed. Otherwise boredom will give way to destructive behavior and rowdy play. They enjoy swimming, running beside a bike, and nice long walks. The Berger Picard makes an excellent jogging companion. The breed's intelligence and sensitivity have made it increasingly popular in dog sports such as agility trials, Tracking, obedience, <b>showmanship,</b> Schutzhund, Flyball, Lure coursing, French Ring Sport and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berger Picards exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (séances and automatic writing, for example) {{proved to be a}} profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead. <b>Showmanship</b> became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission, fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.|$|E
25|$|While {{the sport}} has {{its origins in}} the banked-track roller skating marathons of the 1930s, Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon are {{credited}} with the basic evolution of the sport to its initial competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of sports entertainment where the theatrical elements overshadowed the athleticism. This gratuitous <b>showmanship</b> largely ended with the sport's contemporary grassroots revival {{in the first decade}} of the 21st century. Although some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms were retained, scripted bouts with predetermined winners were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Rouvas had no vocal lessons {{as a boy}} {{and taught}} himself {{primarily}} by ear, so during the recording of his first album he had to learn music theory in a short time. His voice developed significantly since his early teenaged performances. Rouvas' detractors have criticized his voice as average, or limited, contending that his appeal is based on image. Whatever the assessment of his voice, {{it has often been}} overshadowed by <b>showmanship</b> and appearance in the media; many preferred to watch him perform than to listen to him. These criticisms diminished by the second decade of Rouvas' career; his technical skills (range, power and versatility in particular) and expression are better appreciated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} {{politically}} and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal. In 65 BC, newly elected curule aedile Julius Caesar held games that he justified as munus to his father, who {{had been dead for}} 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used three hundred and twenty gladiator pairs in silvered armour. He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome. Caesar's <b>showmanship</b> was unprecedented in scale and expense; he had staged a munus as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between munus and ludi.|$|E
25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure <b>showmanship.</b>|$|E
