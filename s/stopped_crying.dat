2500|$|Purananuru songs {{exhibit a}} unique realism and immediacy not {{frequently}} found in classical literature. The {{nature and the}} subject of the poems lend us to believe that poets did not write these poems on events that happened years prior, rather they wrote (or sang) them on impulse in situ. Some of the poems are conversational in which the poet pleads, begs, chides or praises the king. One such example is poem 46. The poet Kovur Kizhaar address the Chola king Killivalavan to save the lives of the children of a defeated enemy who are about to be executed by being trampled under an elephant. The poet says, [...] "… O king, you belong to the heritage of kings who sliced their own flesh {{to save the life of}} a pigeon, look at these children; they are so naïve of their plight that they have <b>stopped</b> <b>crying</b> to look at the swinging trunk of the elephant in amusement. Have pity on them…" [...] The almost impressionistic picture the poem paints cannot be anything but by someone who is witness to the events present in the poem.|$|E
2500|$|Wu Zetian {{was born}} into a rich family. She had {{servants}} at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day. So Wu read and learned about many different topics such as politics and other governmental affairs, writing, literature, and music. Wu grew and continued to learn as much as she could, with her father backing her every step of the way. At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education. She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts. When she was summoned to the palace, her mother, the Lady Yang, wept bitterly when saying farewell to her, but she responded, [...] "How do you know that it is not my fortune to meet the Son of Heaven?" [...] Lady Yang reportedly then understood her ambitions, and therefore <b>stopped</b> <b>crying.</b>|$|E
