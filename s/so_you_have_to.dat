Our responsibilities can be overwhelming and things often don't go as you planned, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> roll with it. Susan celebrates rolling with it". She is a hopeless romantic and often expresses her more openly and vulnerably than the other characters in the series. The series begins a year after Susan's first divorce, when she is still emotionally raw. Throughout the series, several other characters have confronted Susan about her inability to live happily and without drama. Susan has {{a close relationship with}} her daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), who often acts as the parent figure in the relationship.|$|E

500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing.

[...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed.

[...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient.

[...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I mean, this man {{is supposed to be a}} spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E

500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be very careful".|$|E

This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, [...] "We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic...

2500|$|Mega Man 9 was co-{{developed}} by Capcom and Inti Creates. The latter {{company had}} developed the Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX spin-off series and employs many former Capcom members {{who worked on}} previous Mega Man games. The first six games in the original Mega Man series were created for the NES during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A plethora of spin-off series, related games, and compilations were published by Capcom {{as a result of}} the original series' immense popularity. The most recent entries in the main series, Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, were first released on more advanced home consoles in 1996 and 1998 respectively. Keiji Inafune, a designer, artist, and producer at Capcom, has been involved in most of franchise's development. As early as 2004, Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", publicly expressed his desire to make a Mega Man 9 as a [...] "throwback to the super [...] ", but that its creation would highly depend on the input of fans. According to Inafune, the simple fun of a classic Mega Man game [...] "doesn't fit into the grandiose and expansive world that the consumer gaming industry has become, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make games that match the current expectations". He also believed that pushing for the creation of a Mega Man in the style of the original [...] "would be quickly criticized for things like being simplistic, outdated, or too expensive", thus making it too difficult to develop such games in the current climate.|$|E

He said, [...] "We have 26-and-a-half total live-action robots that were made for this film. They all have hydraulic neck controls. Atom has RC [...] hands as well." [...] According to Jackman, executive producer Spielberg [...] "actually said to Shawn, 'You should really have real elements where you can.' ... Basically if they're not walking or fighting, that's a real robot." [...] Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park, where Winston's animatronic dinosaurs [...] "got a better performance from the actors, as they were seeing something real, and gave the visual effects team {{an idea of what}} it would look like." [...] As Real Steel was not based on a toy, Meyer said that [...] "there was no guideline" [...] for the robots, and each was designed from scratch, with an attempt to put [...] "different personality and aesthetics," [...] according to Levy. In Atom's case, it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an [...] "everyman" [...] who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show [...] "his identity was a bit hidden, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work harder to get to see him." [...] Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask [...] "became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face." [...] Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.|$|E
