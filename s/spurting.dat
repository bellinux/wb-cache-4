In growth of height data, AMD showed a reliable pubertal growth <b>spurt</b> for most children and a reliable prepubertal <b>spurt</b> for some children.

40|$|In the {{extrusion}} of polymer melts, {{several types}} of flow in stability can occur. One {{example of this is}} <b>spurt.</b> <b>Spurt</b> is manifested by periodic oscillations in the pressure and volumetric flow rate. These oscillations are of relaxation type. An extrusion through a cylindrical die is considered. A discrete model to describe <b>spurt</b> or relaxation oscillations is constructed. This model is based on observations from three-dimensional theory. When <b>spurt</b> occurs, the shear rates very near the wall of the die (i. e., in the <b>spurt</b> layer) are much higher than those in the kernel of the extruded polymeric melt. Therefore, the viscosity in the <b>spurt</b> layer is taken much smaller than in the kernel. In both regions a linear Newtonian fluid model is used. A no-slip boundary condition at the wall is maintained. The model developed here is compared to an analogous model, allowing for slip at the wall of the die. It is shown that corresponding results can be obtained from both models. Application of the model to a piston-driven extrusion flow shows the occurrence of <b>spurt</b> oscillations for a restricted range of prescribed inlet flow rates. The found oscillations are qualitatively in correspondence with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} a phenomenological model {{describing}} the <b>spurt</b> instability in polymer extrusion is presented. Following Georgiou and Crochet [J.

In this way we obtain a two-dimensional dynamical system for the wall slip velocity and the pressure in the barrel, {{which is similar to}} the van der Pol equations. The well-known fact that compressibility and a nonmonotonic slip law lead to <b>spurt</b> is incorporated by assuming the flow in the barrel to be compressible. The obtained dynamical system allows analytical evaluation, and, most importantly, gives a clear exposition of the dynamics underlying the <b>spurt</b> phenomenon. We give explicit expressions for the oscillation frequency {{and the size of the}} <b>spurt</b> window. Shear thinning is shown to give rise to quantitative differences only. It reduces the size of the <b>spurt</b> window and slightly enhances the period of the <b>spurt</b> oscillations. The linear scaling relation between the period of the <b>spurt</b> oscillations and the length of the die and the barrel height, is demonstrated to be independent of shear thinning or the precise form of the slip relation...|$|R

40|$|Growth is {{a complex}} process {{composed}} of distinct phases {{over the course of}} childhood. Although the pubertal growth <b>spurt</b> has received the most attention from auxologists and pediatricians, the midchildhood growth <b>spurt</b> has been less well studied. The midchildhood growth <b>spurt</b> refers to a relatively small increase in growth velocity observed in some, but not necessarily all, children in early to middle childhood. If present, the midchildhood growth <b>spurt</b> typically occurs sometime between the ages of 4 and 8 years, well before the onset of the far more pronounced pubertal growth <b>spurt.</b> In this study we used a triple logistic curve-fitting method to fit individual growth curves to serial stature data from 579 healthy participants in the Fels Longitudinal Study, 479 of whom have been genotyped for about 400 short tandem repeat (STR) markers spanning the genome. We categorized individuals according to {{the presence or absence of}} a midchildhood growth <b>spurt</b> and then conducted heritability and genome-wide linkage analyses on the dichotomous trait. In the total sample of 579 individuals, 336 (58 %) were found to have evidence of having had a midchildhood growth <b>spurt.</b> There was a marked sex difference in presence of the midchildhood growth <b>spurt,</b> however, with 232 of the 293 males (79 %) having had a midchildhood growth <b>spurt</b> but just 104 of the 286 females (36 %) having had one.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>spurt</b> in U. S. unionism during the Great Depression. It {{argues that the}} Depression <b>spurt</b> is better understood as resulting from a Depression sparked endogenous social process than from New Deal legislation and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) leadership. Four pieces of evidence are offered for this interpretation: 1. The ubiquity of <b>spurts</b> in unionization across countries, particularly in the Depression. 2. The widespread use of recognition strikes during the 1930 s <b>spurt.</b> 3. The growth of CIO affiliates with little CIO financial or organizing aid. 4. The growth of American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliated unions. I model unionization as the outcome from a conflict between union/worker organizing activity and employer opposition, both of which depend on the proportion organized. Union organizing and activity rises with density, then falls with density. Employer opposition is high at low densities but falls once unions {{gain control of the}} relevant market. The result is a nonlinear difference equation that produces <b>spurts</b> of union growth. The Depression initiated a <b>spurt</b> by increasing worker desires for unions and by raising density above the critical level' for rapid growth in many industries. ...|$|R

Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.|$|E
500|$|Another {{component}} of the ritual is the slaughter of water buffalo. The more powerful the person who died, the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast. Buffalo carcasses, including their heads, are usually lined up on a field waiting for their owner, {{who is in the}} [...] "sleeping stage". Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey and that they will be quicker to arrive at Puya if they have many buffalo. Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundreds of pigs using a machete is the climax of the elaborate death feast, with dancing and music and young boys who catch <b>spurting</b> blood in long bamboo tubes.

Among three groups(pre-growth <b>spurt,</b> growth <b>spurt,</b> post srowth <b>spurt),</b> the average SLR was lower in the growth <b>spurt</b> group than in the pre-growth <b>spurt</b> group(p＜ 0. 001), and the average FFD is lower in the post-growth <b>spurt</b> than in the growth spurt(p＜ 0. 001).
