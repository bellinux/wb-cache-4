5|$|In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his second <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|The Caxias Cabinet {{lasted for}} almost three years, until the Liberals took the reins in January 1878. With the Conservative Party now the opposition, Rio Branco decided to {{undertake}} a one-year tour of Europe, during which he visited most of its countries. He met Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, King UmbertoI of Italy, Pope LeoXIII and other leaders during this trip. Rio Branco also visited his eldest son, who was then living in Liverpool as a consul representing Brazil. He did not meet his son's children, {{though it is not}} known whether he refused to meet them or whether his <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not present them. Upon his return to Brazil, Rio Branco was met with huge celebrations in each Brazilian port he visited: in Recife, in his native Salvador, and finally in Rio de Janeiro where he arrived on 30 July 1879.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Although Aimée {{accepted}} Islam {{as part of}} the harem etiquette, as well as {{the religion}} of her husband, she always remained a Roman Catholic in her heart. Her last wish was for a priest to perform the last rites.

25|$|In 1660 Monck {{obtained}} from the king the extraordinary warrant promising that should his issue fail in the male line his new title Duke of Albemarle be reverted to his first cousin and colleague {{in the success of}} the Restoration, John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath. Monck's <b>son</b> <b>did</b> indeed die childless in 1688, but no claim was made to the dukedom by the Grenvilles of the new king, William III. And 1697 the King conferred the title, as an earldom, on his favourite Arnold Joost van Keppel.|$|E
25|$|The {{eldest son}} of a king who died before that was barred from direct {{inheritance}} but possessed the right to retake the throne himself on the attainment of majority. The number of princes rebelling just prior to their 30th year may even indicate that {{they were required to}} assert their rights at that point or lose them. If the eldest son were ineligible for whatever reason, his brothers, uncles, and first and second cousins were all considered legitimate substitutes. Likewise, even when the eldest <b>son</b> <b>did</b> inherit, other descendants of his great-grandfather were considered legitimate rulers and not usurpers if they were able to wrest control away from him.|$|E

He asks Oedipus to come back from Colonus to bless his son, Eteocles. Angry that his <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not love him enough to take care of him, he curses both Eteocles and his brother, condemning them both to kill each other in battle. Oedipus dies a peaceful death; his grave is said to be sacred to the gods.|$|E

25|$|After {{months of}} testing by specialists the doctors {{concluded}} {{he had a}} genetic condition called Alexander's disease. They warned her against having more children. Messenger states that her <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not progress past a 4-month old's development {{even when he was}} one year old. She concluded that because of the timing of the vaccinations, the baby's reactions and other parents' stories it was the vaccine that killed him and not a genetic disease. She has since stated that there is a conspiracy with pharmaceutical companies and the medical community to cover-up vaccine related problems, because of financial incentives. She feels like she was lied to by the doctors and believes parents should have all the information about vaccinations in order for the parent to make good decisions.|$|E
25|$|Henry's first {{military}} campaign as sole ruler was in 1040 in Bohemia, where Bretislaus {{was still a}} threat, especially via raids by his Hungarian ally. At Stablo, after attending to the reform of some monasteries, Henry summoned his army. In July, he met with Eckhard at Goslar and joined together his whole force at Regensburg. He set out on 13August, but he was ambushed and the expedition ended in disaster. Only by releasing many Bohemian hostages, including Bretislaus's <b>son,</b> <b>did</b> the Germans procure the release of many of their comrades {{and the establishment of}} a peace. Henry retreated hastily and with little fanfare, preferring to ignore his first great defeat. On his return to Germany, he appointed Suidger bishop of Bamberg, who would later be Pope ClementII.|$|E
25|$|Van Damme {{has been}} married five times to four {{different}} women. He was married to his third wife, bodybuilder Gladys Portugues - {{with whom he has}} two children: Kristopher (born 1987) and Bianca (born 1990) - until 1992, when he began an affair with actress Darcy LaPier, whom he married in February 1994. That same year he had an affair with his Street Fighter co-star Kylie Minogue during filming of that movie in Thailand. LaPier, who was pregnant at the time with their <b>son,</b> <b>did</b> not become aware of this until Van Damme publicly admitted it in 2012. After leaving LaPier, Van Damme remarried bodybuilder Portugues in 1999, and they later again separated. In early 2015, Portugues has filed for a second divorce from Van Damme– citing irreconcilable differences. However, in May 2015 they appeared to have reconciled and called off the divorce.|$|E

25|$|Queen Helena of Adiabene {{converted}} to Judaism. When her son went to war, she vowed {{that if he}} returned in peace, {{she would be a}} nazirite for seven years. Her <b>son</b> <b>did</b> return, and she observed her nazirite vow for seven years. At the end of the seven years, she went to the Land of Israel and the House of Hillel ruled that she had to be a nazirite for seven more years. Towards the end of this seven years, she contracted ritual defilement, and so altogether she was a nazirite for 21 years. Rabbi Judah said that she was a nazirite for only 14 years (plus 30 days). If a person vowed a naziriteship of long duration and completed it and then arrives in the Land of Israel, the House of Shammai taught that the person would then need to be a nazirite for 30 more days, but House of Hillel taught that the person's naziriteship began for its full term again as at the first.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{invitation}} to test one of his cars, Pryce found himself racing in the Formula Two series with Ron Dennis's Rondel Racing outfit. His best result for the team came at the Norisring where he was leading the race until a brake failure meant {{he had to give}} up first place to team mate Tim Schenken. At the end of 1973, Pryce won the Grovewood award for his efforts during the year. Jack Pryce recalled that his <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not want to win the award, as he thought it was [...] "a jinx on a driver's career".|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula. He {{described}} Seattle as [...] "a playground {{for you to}} go nuts in" [...] instead of [...] "a living, breathing world", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second <b>Son</b> <b>did</b> not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. [...] "Approach [...] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
500|$|In Gortyn, epikleroi {{were also}} called patroiokos, {{and they were}} more generously treated than in Athens. The term patroiokos can be {{literally}} translated as [...] "having the father's property", and was {{a description of the}} condition of the heiress. She was considered a patroiouchoi if she had no father or brother by her father living. The relative who had the right to marry her was called a epiballon, and the list of who were eligible for that status was also limited to just her paternal uncles and the sons of those uncles. If there were no candidates fitting those conditions, the patroiouchoi was free to marry as she chose. If she wished, a patroiouchos could free herself from the obligation to marry her nearest relative by paying him part of her inheritance. If her nearest relative did not wish to marry her, she was free to find a spouse in her tribe, or if none was willing, then she could marry whomever she wished. Gortyn may owe the liberality of its heiress laws {{to the fact that it}} was one of the few city-states known to have allowed daughters to inherit even if they had brothers; daughters in Gortyn received half the share of a son. To prevent the abuse of the system, there was a time limit on the right of the closest epiballon to marry her, and if the limit expired, the right passed to the next nearest epiballon until the patroiouchoi was either married or ran out of possible epiballontes. There was a limit, however, that a man could only marry one heiress. Unlike in Athens, the heiress owned her inheritance and her <b>son</b> <b>did</b> not inherit until she died. Her son was also eligible to inherit from his father.|$|E
