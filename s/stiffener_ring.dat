This involved aerodynamic redesign of the CF 6 fan blade to increase fan efficiency while retaining the mechanical integrity, operability, and acoustic characteristics of the existing blade. A further improvement in performance was obtained by adding a fan case <b>stiffener</b> <b>ring</b> to decouple blade-case vibrational characteristics, permitting a significant reduction in running tip clearance. Engine testing was performed to establish the performance, mechanical and acoustic properties of the new design relative to the current fan, and to establish power management characteristics for the CF 6 - 50 C 2 /E 2 engine.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this testing was to {{evaluate}} the residual stresses that occur {{in and around the}} attachment details of a case stiffener segment that has been subjected to flight/recovery followed by proof loading. Not measured in this test were stresses relieved at joint disassembly due to out-of-round and interference effects, and those released by cutting the specimens out of the case segment. The test article was lightweight case stiffener segment 1 U 50715, S/N L 023 which was flown in the forward stiffener position on flight SRM 14 A and in the aft position on flight SRM 24 A. Both of these flights were flown with the 3 <b>stiffener</b> <b>ring</b> configuration. Stiffener L 023 had a <b>stiffener</b> <b>ring</b> installed only on the aft stub in its first flight, and it had both rings installed on its second flight. No significant post flight damage was found on either flight. Finally, the segment was used on the DM- 8 static test motor in the forward position. No stiffener rings were installed. It had only one proof pressurization prior to assignment to its first use, and it was cleaned and proof tested after each flight. Thus, the segment had seen 3 proof tests, two flight pressurizations, and two low intensity water impacts prior to manufacturing for use on DM- 8. On DM- 8 it received one static firing pressurization in the horizontal configuration. Residual stresses at the surface and in depth were evaluated by both the x-ray diffraction and neutron beam diffraction methods. The x-ray diffraction evaluations were conducted by Technology for Energy Corporation (TEC) at their facilities in Knoxville, TN. The neutron beam evaluations were done by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) at the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories in Ontario. The results showed general agreement with relatively high compressive residual stresses on the surface and moderate to low subsurface tensile residual stresses...|$|E

40|$|Shell {{structures}} are usually formed from concrete, steel and nowadays also from many others materials. Steel is typically {{used in the}} structures of chimneys, reservoirs, silos, pipelines, etc. Unlike concrete shells, steel shells are regularly stiffened {{with the help of}} longitudinal and/or <b>ring</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> The authors of this paper investigated steel cylindrical shells and their stiffening with the use of <b>ring</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> The more complete the stiffening, the more closely the shell will act to beam theory, and the calculations will be much easier. However, this would make realization of the structure more expensive and more laborious. The target of the study is to find the limits of <b>ring</b> <b>stiffeners</b> for cylindrical shells. Adequate stiffeners will eliminate semi-bending action of the shells in such way that the shell structures can be analyzed with the use of numerical models of the struts (e. g., by beam theory) without significant divergences from reality.

5000|$|Building a {{pressure}} hull is difficult, {{as it must}} withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression.

40|$|Metal silos {{and tanks}} are {{susceptible}} to an elastic-plastic instability failure at the base boundary condition which is known as "elephant's foot buckling", due to its characteristic shape. This form of buckle occurs under high internal pressure accompanied by axial forces in the shell structure. Current international standards for both the static design and earthquake design include a provision {{to ensure that this}} failure mode is prevented. However, the only available remedy is currently to increase the wall thickness of the bottom course or strake. In this paper, an alternative method of strengthening against elephant's foot buckling is explored in which a light <b>ring</b> <b>stiffener</b> is used at a critical location. The strengthened shell is analysed using linear elastic bending theory in this preliminary study. Within the scope of this research, the strengthening effect is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} size and location of the <b>ring</b> <b>stiffener.</b> <b>Rings</b> that are too small and rings that are too large both cause the strengths to be lower than that when the optimal ring size is used.

Examples include conical end closures to cylindrical vessels and conical reducers between cylinders of different radii. In {{the case of a}} cone large end-to-cylinder intersection under internal pressure, the intersection is subject to a large circumferential compressive force. Both the cone and the cylinder may be thickened near the intersection to resist this compression, but it is often convenient and necessary to augment further the strength of the intersection using an annular plate <b>ring</b> <b>stiffener.</b> Under this large circumferential compression, the intersection may fail by elastic buckling, plastic buckling or plastic collapse.

40|$|Shell structures, {{especially}} cylindrical shells, {{are widely}} used in aerospace and naval architectural industries. Submarine hulls and aircraft bodies can be idealized as cylindrical shell structures. The study of vibrations of cylindrical shells is an important aspect in the successful applications of the cylindrical shells. The free vibration characteristics of a submarine hull have an important influence on the noise signature of the submarine. That makes the free vibration problem of the submarine hull a particular interest for the submarine community. The natural frequencies of cylindrical shells are clustered in a very narrow band and they are thus more prone to becoming involved in resonant vibrations. The determination and control of these frequencies is significant to manage the acoustic signature of the submarine. This thesis focuses on the free vibration characteristics of stiffened and unstiffened cylindrical shells. The analysis is carried out mainly in two parts. First, the unstiffened cylindrical shell is modeled and the free vibration problem is analyzed as the shell thickness decreases. Then the cylindrical shell is stiffened with <b>ring</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and the free vibration problem of the stiffened cylindrical shell is studied. The vibration modes of the unstiffened cylindrical shell are studied for four shells with different thicknesses. Initial tensile and compressive membrane stresses are applied separately to the shells to study {{the effect of the}} initial stresses on the free vibration modes. The vibration modes of the stiffened cylindrical shell are studied in two steps. First, the influence of the positions of two <b>ring</b> <b>stiffeners</b> on the fundamental frequencies is studied; second, the free vibration modes of the stiffened cylindrical shell are studied. Two cylindrical shells with different thicknesses are used and they are stiffened with different numbers of <b>ring</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> which are uniformly distributed along the longitudinal axis of the shell.
