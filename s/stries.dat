40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze and {{evaluate}} the impact of economic integration processes and economic policies on the regional industrial structure and regional comparative advantage development in the period from 1998 – 2008. The paper explores manufacturing industry sectors that have registered the highest increase of foreign direct investment and employment. There are also those which participate significantly in the Czech national export – these are the production of plastics and rubber commodities (DH), the metal industry (DJ), the optical and the electronics indu- <b>stries</b> (DL), and the automotive industry (KM). The examination of comparative advantage dynamics consists of industry concentration, regional specialization, and the technology gap.

Using the same data in another way, we calculate the modified Gini index of specialization with an aim to specify the respective industrial specialization in the NUTS 3 regions. The technology gap is gathered by means of shift share analysis and represents regional techno- logical convergence regarding the technological development of a selected benchmark.

40|$|Agronomie {{selection}} generates {{and maintains}} agrobiodiversity {{which can be}} regarded as an essential resource. To describe phenotypic diversity, genotypes as well as their chemical expression, chemotypes, have been widely used. Tropical root and tuber crops are vegetatively propagated and their genetic bases are often narrow. Therefore, unveiling the impressive phenotypic diversity is still rather difficult through genotyping alone, whereas chemotype studies are very informative. Tropical root crops are staples and represent a good source of compounds related to health benefits and used in food and pharmaceutical indu <b>stries.</b> Those crops have keyroles to play in food security for developing countries and so plant breeding cannot be neglected. Biofortification is effective and does not imply change of dietary behaviours. Analysing, computing and compiling data bases for chernical data on diversity of neglected crops are still needed. Biofortification involving mass selection and profiling of numerous accessions is, however, time-consuming. Thus, efficient protocols and tools facilitating this process are required. Chemotypic variability within Vanuatu germplasm was characterised through core samples from different species and relationships between primary compounds, secondary metabolites and local preferences have been studied. Useful correlations were shown, thus clarifying traditional selection process. This process has permitted the definition of ideotypes that will be interesting for the management of breeding programmes. At least for the two most important species in Vanuatu - taro Colocasia esculenta and the greater yam Dioscorea alata - our work is the fust broad screening of germplasm. The study of carotenoid and anthocyanin content indicates that sorne cultivars show potential for commercial exploitation.

40|$|In Northern Iceland, {{the active}} rift is located 120 km eastward {{with respect to}} the Kolbeinsey Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Tjörnes Fracture Zone connects these two rifts and {{accommodates}} a dextral transform motion. A major active fault of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone is the WNW-ESE trending Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF). The seismic activity associated to the HFF defined a nearly vertical fault surface that cuts through the 12 km thick seismogenic crust. Analyses of major structures combined with inversion of fault slip data allow us to discuss the kinematics and mechanics of the HFF since the Late Tertiary. For the present-day kinematics, we also use inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms provided by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The main state of stress along the HFF corresponds to a dextral transtension, with an ENE-WSW trending extension due to the obliquity of the transform fault relative to the E-W direction of plate divergence. This overall mechanism is subject to slip partitioning that include an extension trending NW-SE, parallel to the HFF, and an extension trending NE-SW, perpendicular to the fault. These three regimes do not reflect a succession in time of tectonic events, but occur simultaneously at different places and in various chronological orders. They are thought to express the geometric accommodation of the transform motion in the oblique transform zone. Near the connection of the HFF to the Kolbeinsey Ridge, most dextral transform faults that trend parallel to the HFF are replaced by normal faults with a dextral component. On {{the opposite side of the}} HFF, at its junction with the northern Icelandic rift, two main transform fault segments have been mapped out. The northern fault directly connects to the northern Icelandic rift as a triple point junction, whereas the southern one progressively evolves from a WNW-ESE trending dextral transform fault to a N-S trending normal fault, parallel to the direction of the rift structures. One hypothesis, which would explain these structural differences, involves the presence of pre-existing structures, like volcanoes, that affect the direction of propagation of the southern transform fault segment. Another hypothesis would be that the southern transform fault, the oldest between these two transform faults, developed and then was connected to the northern Icelandic rift before the rift propagated northward. After this northward propagation of the northern Icelandic rift, the northern transform fault segment propagated linearly to the rift. Moreover, near the junction of the HFF with the northern Icelandic rift, the behaviour of the normal faults associated with the rift appears to be strongly influenced by the dextral transtension characterising the HFF. On other hand, seismic faults have been mapped out near the eastern border of the Flateyjarskagi shelf. Inversions of related focal mechanisms suggest that movements associated with the present-day unlocking of the eastern part of the HFF, considered as locked until recently because of its low seismic activity, are compatible with the proposed model of dextral transtension. The present-day offset between the Kolbeinsey Ridge and the northern Icelandic rift results from an eastward rift jump of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland. As the North American-Eurasian plate boundary drifts westward, eastward rift jumps relocate the rift zones above the Icelandic hotspot. Using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of dykes along a profile parallel to the direction of plate motion in Northern Iceland, a paleo-rift axis has been recognised 60 km eastward to the previously accepted location. This paleo-rift, localised in the continuation of fjord of Skagafjördur and referred to as, remained active until approximately 3 Ma ago. The activity of the northern Icelandic rift started about 8 - 8. 5 My ago, intruding the presently dated 9 - 9. 5 Ma old eastern flank of the Skagafjördur paleo-rift. This age of 1 Ma for the intruded paleo-rift rocks at the rift jump time is considered as a minimal value, resulting to hypotheses assumed in the theoretical model for the dating data interpretation. An important plio-pleistocene glacial erosion, inducing a decrease of the lava pile thickness and thus a diminution of the area covered by the production of the northern Icelandic rift, would explain the presence of dykes related to the northern Icelandic rift as far as 25 km outside of its borders. The two rifts were thus simultaneously active during 5 - 5. 5 Ma. During this period, the accretion rates along the two rift zones were nearly equal. However, accretion was asymmetrical along each rift, with the higher rate of accretion situated on the external flank. The supposed absence of drift from the northern Icelandic rift since its initiation implies a strong asymmetry of accretion, favouring the Northern American plate. A decrease of the hotspot activity would release the northern Icelandic rift and allow it to drift westward with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Then, an increase of the hotspot activity would facilitate the shift of the accretion zone above to the hotspot by an eastward rift jump. The tectonic changes related to the last rift jump explains the observed deformations in Northern Iceland. The Skagafjördur paleo-rift shrank, after it became extinct, both towards the Kolbeinsey Ridge and towards the active volcanic zone of central Iceland. This volcanic zone of central Iceland probably corresponds to an "en échelon" zone between the northern and the southern Icelandic rifts. The weight of the lava flows spread out by the volcanic zone of central Iceland since 3 Ma has induced a flexuring of the tertiary lava flow pile produced by the Skagafjördur paleo-rift. In a similar way, the lava flows erupted by the Skagafjördur paleo-rift have been flexured by those erupted by the northern Icelandic rift. These flexures are directed towards the volcanic zone of central Iceland and towards the northern Icelandic rift, respectively. They define a continuous flexure belt through Northern Iceland. An important extensive fracturing is related to the flexure of the lava flows. Such a flexure would explain that the synform-like arrangement of the lava flows, considered as a characteristic of an Icelandic rift axis, is absent along the southern part of the Skagafjördur paleo-rift axis, whereas such a structural shape is recognised along its northern part. The synform that was initially thought to localise the axis of the paleo-rift would be the axis of the flexural zone produced by the weight of plio-pleistocene lava flows erupted from the south, in the volcanic zone of central Iceland. Despite the limited number of radiochronological data available as time constraints in Southern Iceland, a global model of the tectonic evolution of the island, based on the model proposed for the evolution of Northern Iceland, is presented. This model highlights the importance of the volcanic zone of central Iceland. This volcanic zone would accommodate the differences in the tectonic evolution, like diachronisms in rift jump process and consequently shifts of the accretion zones, between the northern and southern parts of Iceland. Le rift nord islandais peut être considéré comme l'équivalent émergé de la dorsale de Kolbeinsey. Il est cependant décalé de 120 km vers l'est par rapport à celle-ci. La Zone de Fracture de Tjörnes, une zone transformante dextre, absorbe ce décalage. L'analyse des grandes structures ainsi que l'inversion de données de failles à <b>stries</b> ont permis de caractériser la géométrie et le fonctionnement de la faille d'Húsavík-Flatey (FHF), l'une des structures majeures de la Zone de Fracture de Tjörnes. L'inversion de mécanismes au foyer, fournis par l'Office Météorologique Islandais, a permis de compléter l'étude, pour la période actuelle. L'obliquité de la FHF, de direction WNW-ESE, par rapport à la divergence des plaques de direction E-W induit depuis la fin du Tertiaire une transtension dextre de direction ENE-WSW le long de la FHF. Ce mouvement transtensif se partitionne localement en une extension de direction NE-SW, sub-perpendiculaire à la FHF, et une extension de direction NW-SE, sub-parallèle à la FHF. Ces trois régimes ne correspondent pas à une succession bien définie d'épisodes régionaux mais à des variations locales et temporelles du mouvement transformant. A proximité de la jonction de la FHF avec la dorsale de Kolbeinsey, les failles dextres qui accommodent principalement le mouvement décrochant sont majoritairement remplacées par des failles normales à composante dextre. A l'autre extrémité de la FHF, au niveau de sa jonction avec le rift nord islandais, la faille est divisée en deux branches parallèles. L'une d'elles se connecte directement au rift nord islandais en définissant un point triple tandis que l'autre branche évolue progressivement d'une faille transformante de direction WNW-ESE jusqu'à une faille normale de direction N-S parallèle au rift. Ces différences structurales s'expliqueraient par la propagation vers le nord du rift nord islandais ainsi que par l'influence de structures préexistantes, telles que des volcans, lors du développement de ces deux failles. De plus, le fonctionnement du rift nord islandais à proximité de la FHF paraît fortement influencé par celui de cette dernière. Enfin, l'activité séismique liée à l'actuel déblocage de la partie de la FHF bloquée depuis la dernière crise éruptive du rift nord islandais s'intégrerait dans le modèle de fonctionnement en transtension dextre de cette faille. Le décalage du rift nord islandais et de la dorsale de Kolbeinsey résulte d'un saut vers l'est de la zone d'accrétion nord islandaise. La dérive vers l'ouest de la dorsale médio-Atlantique par rapport au point chaud islandais serait à l'origine de tels sauts. A partir de datations 40 Ar/ 39 Ar de dykes échantillonnés le long d'un profil parallèle à la direction de divergence des plaques, l'initiation de l'actuel rift nord islandais a été datée à 8 - 8. 5 Ma. Elle eut lieu dans des roches qui n'avaient alors que 1 Ma. Le paléo-rift, dont l'axe a été localisé le long du fjord de Skagafjördur, c'est-à-dire 60 km à l'est de l'emplacement généralement admis, et le rift actuel ont fonctionné simultanément et de façon asymétrique, l'accrétion étant plus importante sur leurs flancs extérieurs, jusqu'à 3 Ma. L'absence supposée de dérive du rift nord islandais par rapport au point chaud implique une très forte asymétrie d'accrétion de la plaque Nord Amérique par rapport à la plaque Eurasie. Si l'activité du point chaud venait à diminuer, le rift nord islandais pourrait être libéré et dériver vers l'ouest jusqu'à ce qu'un nouveau pulse mantellique provoque un saut de rift vers l'est et ramène la zone d'accrétion à l'aplomb du point chaud. Les déformations observées dans le Nord de l'Islande s'expliquent par la réorganisation tectonique liée au dernier saut de rift. Le mécanisme d'abandon du paléo-rift de Skagafjördur est interprété comme un retrait symétrique et synchrone vers la ride de Kolbeinsey et vers la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande, cette dernière constituant probablement une zone de relais entre les rifts nord et sud islandais. Le poids des laves émises depuis 3 Ma par la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande a provoqué une flexuration des laves issues du paléo-rift vers le centre de l'Islande de la même manière qu'elles ont été flexurées par et en direction de celles émises par le rift nord islandais. Cette profonde réorganisation structurale expliquerait l'absence d'une synforme le long de la partie méridionale du paléo-rift de Skagafjördur alors qu'une telle synforme, caractéristique d'un rift en Islande, est présente le long de sa partie septentrionale. La synforme initialement considérée comme localisant l'axe du paléo-rift dans le Nord de l'Islande ne serait alors que l'axe d'une zone de flexure due à l'épanchement des laves plio-pléistocènes. Malgré la faible quantité de données radiochronologiques disponibles pour la partie sud de l'Islande, le modèle d'évolution tectonique proposé pour le Nord de l'Islande a été intégré dans un schéma d'évolution de l'ensemble de l'île. En accommodant les différences d'évolution entre les parties nord et sud de l'île, telles que le diachronisme entre les sauts de rift ayant eu lieu dans ces deux parties de l'Islande et donc le décalage des zones d'accrétion au travers de l'île, la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande a ainsi joué un rôle primordial tout le long du développement de l'île...|$|E
