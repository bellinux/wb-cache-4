50|$|In {{the example}} diagram, the {{resistors}} placed {{in series with}} the capacitors, R1, are made equal to the unwanted stray resistance present in the inductors. This ensures that the attenuation at high frequency {{is the same as}} the attenuation at low frequency and brings the filter back to a flat response. The purpose of the <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors,</b> R2, is to bring the image impedance of the filter back to the original design R0. The resulting filter is the equivalent of a box attenuator formed from the R1's and R2's connected in cascade with an ideal lattice filter as shown in the diagram.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of ammeters are either connected {{in series with}} the circuit carrying the current to be measured (for small fractional amperes), or have their <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors</b> connected similarly in series. In either case, the current passes through the meter or (mostly) through its shunt. Ammeters must not be connected directly across a voltage source since their internal resistance is very low and excess current would flow. Ammeters are designed for a low voltage drop across their terminals, much less than one volt; the extra circuit losses produced by the ammeter are called its [...] "burden" [...] on the measured circuit.|$|E

50|$|PIN diodes {{might be}} used, for example, as {{the bridge and}} <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors</b> in a bridged-T attenuator. Another common {{approach}} is to use PIN diodes as terminations connected to the 0 degree and -90 degree ports of a quadrature hybrid. The signal to be attenuated {{is applied to the}} input port, and the attenuated result is taken from the isolation port. The advantages of this approach over the bridged-T and pi approaches are (1) complementary PIN diode bias drives are not needed—the same bias is applied to both diodes—and (2) the loss in the attenuator equals the return loss of the terminations, which can be varied over a very wide range.|$|E
50|$|The {{common and}} simple {{approach}} to current sensing {{is the use}} of a shunt resistor. The voltage drop across the shunt is proportional to its current flow. Both alternating currents (AC) and direct currents (DC) can be measured with the shunt resistor.The high performance coaxial shunt have been widely used for many applications fast rise-time transient currents and high amplitudes but, highly integrated electronic devices prefer low-cost surface mounted devices (SMDs), because of their small sizes and relatively low prices.The parasitic inductance present in the shunt affects high precision current measurement. Although this affects only the magnitude of the impedance at relatively high frequency, but also its effect on the phase at line frequency causes a noticeable error at a low power factor. The low cost and high reliability make the low resistance current shunt a very popular choice for current measurement system. The major disadvantage of using the shunt is that fundamentally a shunt is a resistive element, the power loss is thus proportional to the square of the current passing through it and consequently it is a rarity amongst high current measurements.Fast-response for measuring high-impulse or heavy-surge currents is the common requirement for <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors.</b> In 1981 Malewski, designed a circuit to eliminate the skin effect and later in 1999 the flap-strap sandwich shunt (FSSS) was introduced from a flat-strap sandwich resistor. The properties of the FSSS in terms of response time, power loss and frequency characteristics, are the same as the shunt resistor but the cost is lower and the construction technique is less sophisticated, compared to Malewski and the coaxial shunt.|$|E

Micro-discharges generate high-amplitude, high-frequency current spike transients superimposed on a low-amplitude, low-frequency current. We have used a high-speed digital oscilloscope to measure the actuator power consumption using the <b>Shunt</b> <b>Resistor</b> method and the Monitor Capacitor method. The measurements were performed simultaneously and compared to each other in a time-accurate manner. It was found that low signal-to-noise ratios of the oscilloscopes used, in combination with the high dynamic range of the current spikes, make the <b>Shunt</b> <b>Resistor</b> method inaccurate.
