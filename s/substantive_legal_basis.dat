40|$|The {{absence of}} a {{relevant}} legal basis between huge commercial partners such as the EU as a single entity and the Russian Federation promoted {{the emergence of a}} legal vacuum. The long term cooperation between Russia and the EU has only one bilateral agreement - the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation signed in 1994, which is however obsolete, and does not meet the contemporary needs. The adequate legal basis for Russia-EU cooperation in the gas sector is still missing. The protection of investments in the gas sector is being realized by bilateral agreements between Russia and EU member states, soft law and general international agreements, without any specifications for those two partners. The only international instrument covering the energy relations of these two partners - Energy Charter Treaty cannot be considered as a reliable mechanism, as Russia withdrew from it more than 8 years ago. The reasons of the withdrawal and the Yukos case as an illustrative example are discussed in this paper. In order to avoid uncertainty in such strategic area as gas investment relations and unpredictable decisions between the states represented by the commercial entities, {{there is a need to}} design a <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> and a need to consider on the adequate dispute resolution body. In this thesis, key [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend of}} retail {{concentration}} across the European Union has raised concerns on the buyer power that retailers {{may have in}} the relation with their suppliers. Specifically, due to the alleged increasing pressure on producer and supplier margins in various distribution chains, but the increased focus on consumer welfare in EU competition policy, various stakeholders call for demands {{for a change in}} the current <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> framework of EU competition law. In this discussion, reference is often made to initiatives at the national level that are specifically designed to deal with disparities in market power in business-to-business relations, such as prohibitions on so-called ‘abuse of economic dependency’ or ‘abuse of superior bargaining position’. This Law and Economics research addresses the underlying premise for these requests and therefore analyses whether there is a ‘gap’ in the current <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> framework of EU competition law, which may cause the underenforcement of the potential harmful effects of buyer power. That is, by applying the conceptual apparatus of economics to the field of EU competition law, it has been assessed from an economic efficiency perspective whether the competition rules provide for a <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to address the potential competition concerns of buyer power. The results show that the EU competition rules are readily applicable to buyer conduct and moreover provide for a <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to address the potential competition concerns of buyer power. The analysis therefore does not indicate that that the current <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> framework of EU competition law is unfit to address the potential harmful effects of buyer power. However, a critical comment is in place with regard to the application of the consumer welfare standard that appears to be used in EU competition policy. While the consumer welfare standard will generally not lead to very different decisions than its alternative, the total welfare standard, and may moreover be preferable due to mitigate regulation costs and undesirable lobbying, it has a specific disadvantage in the context of buyer power. Since buyer power may under specific circumstances harm economic efficiency but does not necessarily directly affect consumer welfare, application of the consumer welfare standard might lead to underenforcement of anti-competitive buyer conduct. There are, however, various indications that the European Commission is aware of this risk and may moreover refrain from the application of the consumer welfare standard in specific buyer power cases. Because this suggests that there is a discrepancy between the actual treatment of buyer conduct and the approach outlined in the European Commission’s guidelines, it seems advisable that these guidelines are clarified...|$|R

The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99.
