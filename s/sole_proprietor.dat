5|$|With the {{prospects}} of {{a link between the}} navigation and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the <b>sole</b> <b>proprietor</b> from 1804, having bought out his sleeping partner. Throughout its life, the navigation had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, to make it an open navigation, where anyone could use it on payment of the appropriate tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E
5|$|Morris and Burne-Jones {{then spent}} time {{with one of the}} Firm's patrons, the wealthy George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle and his wife Rosalind, at their Medieval home in Naworth Castle, Cumberland. In July 1874, the Morris family then took Burne-Jones' two {{children}} with them on their holiday to Bruges, Belgium. However, by this point Morris' friendship with Rossetti had seriously eroded, and in July 1874 their acrimonious falling out led Rossetti to leave Kelmscott, with Morris' publisher F.S. Ellis taking his place. With the company's other partners drifting off to work on other projects, Morris decided to consolidate his own control of the Firm and become <b>sole</b> <b>proprietor</b> and manager. In March 1875, he paid £1000 each in compensation to Rossetti, Brown, and Marshall, although the other partners waived their claims to financial compensation. That month, the Firm was officially disbanded and replaced by Morris & Co, although Burne-Jones and Webb would continue to produce designs for it in future. This accomplished, he resigned his directorship of the Devon Great Consols, selling his remaining shares in the company.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Analyse {{mortality}} differences between self-employed and paid employees {{with a focus}} on industrial sector, educational level and gender using Swedish register data. Methods:A cohort of the total working population (4 776 135 individuals; 7. 2 % self-employed; 18 – 100 years of age at baseline 2003) in Sweden with a 5 -year follow-up (2004 – 2008) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality (57 743 deaths). Self-employed individuals were categorised as <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> or limited liability company (LLC) owners according to their enterprise's legal form. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to compare mortality rates between <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors,</b> LLC owners and paid employees, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders. Results: Mortality from cardiovascular diseases was 16 % lower and from suicide 26 % lower among LLC owners than among paid employees, adjusted for confounders. Within the industrial category, all-cause mortality was 13 – 15 % lower among <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> and LLC owners compared with employees in manufacturing and mining (MM) as well as personal and cultural services (PCS), and 11 – 20 % higher in <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> in trade, transport and communication and the welfare industry (W). A significant three-way interaction indicated 17 – 23 % lower all-cause mortality among male LLC owners in MM and female <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> in PCS, and 50 % higher mortality in female <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> in W than in employees in the same industries. Conclusions: Mortality differences between self-employed individuals and paid employees vary by the legal form of self-employment, across industries, and by gender. Differences in work environment exposures and working conditions, varying market competition across industries and gender segregation in the labour market are potential mechanisms underlying these findings...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the effects of three {{different}} internal bank ratings - Risk-, Property- and Creditworthiness-Rating - on the loan maturity. We use a sample of about 5, 000 loans given to <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> and corporate borrowers by two German banks from January 2003 till July 2005. The estimation results for corporate borrowers are consistent with Diamond's (1991) predictions of non-monotonic relationship between ratings and maturity. The best rated and the worst rated loans tend to have shorter maturities than loans with an intermediate rating. However, our results for <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors</b> conflict with the predictions of Diamond and with the majority of the empirical literature. We find a negative association between ratings and maturity of the loans given to <b>sole</b> <b>proprietors.</b> loan maturity, internal bank ratings, risk of default, creditworthiness...|$|R

25|$|In around 1850 {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} were found nearby and Messrs. Merry & Cunninghame, Ironmasters, built {{a row of}} houses for 200 people.
