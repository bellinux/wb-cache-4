2500|$|In January 2005, McCain {{said that}} [...] "one of our big {{problems}} {{has been the}} fact that many Iraqis resent American military presence. ... as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> reduce our visibility as much as possible, the better I {{think it is going to}} be." ...|$|E

"We promise that, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{proceed with}} full operation, Station WDEBS will be {{not merely a}} chronicler of events, nor a vehicle of music and entertainment, though we hope not to fail even in these matters, but a militant, {{fighting}} champion {{of the rights of}} the oppressed, of all those who toil by hand or brain to produce the wealth of this world." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And there's another thing: What {{are we to}} {{do about}} Mr. Todd? We've got to get him up here <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> When you have brought the tea you had better go out and send him a telegram, telling him to come up by the next train." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the start}} of spring training, Mauer {{expressed}} strong dissatisfaction with the previous season, saying [...] "I've kind of been answering...questions [...] all winter, and it left a bad taste {{in a lot of}} people's mouths, and mine included, but it's a new year, and as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> forget about 2011, the better, and focus on not letting it happen again."

2500|$|The {{first volume}} of History, subtitled [...] "from the {{earliest}} times to the Age of Macquarie" [...] appeared in 1962, and five more volumes, taking the story down to 1935, appeared over the next 26 years. In his autobiographical memoir A Historian's Apprenticeship published after his death, Clark recalled that his models were Carlyle, Edward Gibbon and T. B. Macaulay – two conservatives and a Whig – {{and that he was}} inspired by the belief that [...] "the story of Australia was a bible of wisdom both for those now living and, I hoped, for those to come after us". By this time he had rejected all the notions of progressive or Marxist historiography: [...] "I was beginning to see Australian history and indeed all history as a tragedy. Failure was the fate of the individual: success could be the fate of society. If that was a contradiction, I could only reply that it was but one of the many contradictions we must accept as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> as part of the human condition".|$|E

6000|$|Melbury {{said that}} he had no manner of doubt, for since his talk with Beaucock it had come into his mind that he had seen some time ago in the weekly paper an allusion to such a legal change; but, having no {{interest}} in those desperate remedies at the moment, he had passed it over.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out the routine {{observations}} for wide-field survey by drift-scan, and detected several radio transients since 2004. We found the following features about these sources. a) Most of radio transients were detected just once (only 1 transient was detected at the same position for two days). b) The distributions of radio transients could be isotropic in our observable region. c) These transients have a flux density {{on the order of}} Jy scale. However, we still haven’t identified the details including the origin or emission mechanism of these sources yet. To identify what type of objects these radio transients were, we have developed an alerting system and this system has been running since last December. If a radio transient will detect by this system, we will obtain the positional information within 70 -min at a maximum from an appearance of it. By obtaining this information <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> follow-up it with other telescopes. 1...|$|R

6000|$|Then the Lady of the Fountain said: [...] "Ewaine, I {{have it in}} my {{mind that}} thou shalt go and visit thy friends at the court of the great king. For after thou hast seen them and hast {{satisfied}} thyself, I believe that thou wilt be better content to be here. So I lay it as my command upon thee that thou shalt go to Camelot, and have converse once again with thy friends and companions.
