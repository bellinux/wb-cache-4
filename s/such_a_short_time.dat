5|$|With Yerkes as chairman, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was {{established}} in 1902 with a capitalisation of £5million, the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which, by 1903, raised a total of £18million (£ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects. Yerkes died in December 1905, and Speyer took his place {{as chairman of the}} UERL. By 1907, the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed. Despite the UERL's engineering success in carrying out the works in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> the company was in a difficult financial position. The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over optimistic and revenues were not covering operating costs. After bailing out the company, Speyer, with Managing Director Albert Stanley, struggled {{for a number of years}} to restore its finances. This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912, as its profits could be used to offset losses elsewhere in the group. In November 1912, Speyer further consolidated the UERL's control of London's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London's two other main tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.|$|E

25|$|The end of Tabinshwehti came {{soon after}} his return from the Siamese campaign. The king, who had always led a highly disciplined life, quickly {{developed}} a liking to wine after having introduced to it by a young Portuguese mercenary who had just entered his service. He became an alcoholic in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> that the king, {{who had been on}} constant military campaigns in every year since 1534, decided not only to forgo any new campaigns but also to hand over day-to-day governing duties to Bayinnaung. Instead, he went on hunting and drinking trips with the mercenary-turned-winemaker, whom he had given a royal handmaiden as wife. The drunken king is said not to have respected other men's wives. Desperate, ministers approached Bayinnaung to take over the throne but he refused. Bayinnaung arrested the winemaking mercenary, paid him off, set him on a ship, and sent him out of the country.|$|E
25|$|On 16 August 2016, Assange's {{lawyer in}} the UK, John Jones, was found dead, {{according}} to the first reports after {{being hit by a}} train in an apparent suicide. An inquest into his death found that the lawyer was accepted since March to a private psychiatric hospital with several issues of mental health, including bipolar disorder, and closed-circuit television cameras showed no-one was near him when he jumped before the train. Coupled with the death of WikiLeaks lawyer Michael Ratner from cancer in May, the death of both lawyers in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> span sparked conspiracy theories, and a tweet by WikiLeaks on 21 August said that an inquest ruled it was not suicide. Some Twitter users took this to imply assassination, but the linked article explained that the inquest found culpability {{on the part of the}} hospital for letting Jones outside since suicide requires mental competence.|$|E

Planned as a full-scale musical, and released as <b>such</b> for <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> {{in the summer of}} 1930, most of the songs were cut from general release prints by the autumn of 1930 due to the public's aversion for musicals.|$|R
25|$|Although the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) {{has been}} in Haiti since 2004, as of 2007, it {{continued}} to struggle for control over the armed gangs. It maintains an armed checkpoint {{at the entrance to}} the shanty town of Cité Soleil and the road is blocked with armed vehicles. In January 2006, two Jordanian peacekeepers were killed in Cité Soleil. In October 2006 a heavily armed group of the Haitian National Police were able to enter Cité Soleil for the first time in three years and were able to remain one hour as armored UN troops patrolled the area. Since this is where the armed gangs take their kidnap victims, the police's ability to penetrate the area even for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> was seen as a sign of progress. The situation of continuing violence is similar in Port-au-Prince. Ex-soldiers, supporters of the ex-president, occupied the home of ex-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide against the wishes of the Haitian government. Before Christmas 2006 the UN force announced that it would take a tougher stance against gang members in Port-au-Prince, but since then the atmosphere there has not improved and the armed roadblocks and barbed wire barricades have not been moved. After four people were killed and another six injured in a UN operation exchange of fire with criminals in Cité Soleil in late January 2007, the United States announced that it would contribute $20 million to create jobs in Cité Soleil.|$|E
