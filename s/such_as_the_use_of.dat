5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances.

It was ranked as Programming Language of the Year for the years 2007 and 2010. It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on C, e.g. C++, Objective-C (note, C# and Java only have partial syntactic similarity to C, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> curly braces, and are closer in similarity to each other than C).|$|E
5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> thermic siphons, bogies and cabs at {{each end}} of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are still unknown, but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific consensus is that no single factor is causing CCD, but {{that some of these}} factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E

5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted finials and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward {{was still a}} child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Cranmer's new Book of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practice her religion.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, with Ken Bates now {{owner of}} the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge {{featured}} a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, {{it was decided that}} the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted {{for the start of the}} 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices.

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory. The inhabitants of Guatemala, for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E

30|$|So {{is there}} {{evidence}} that organizational learning occurred {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>USE</b> project? Educational reform efforts traditionally gauge project efficacy by measuring particular formative and summative indicators. For an initiative <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>USE</b> project, these could include the number of faculty involved in course transformation activities or project effects on faculty teaching practices and/or student learning outcomes. While we do not suggest that these measures are insufficient for evaluating the ultimate effects of an initiative, metrics for capturing if and how an intervention influenced the underlying mechanisms that support organizational behavior are rarely integrated into educational evaluations. That is, measures that could demonstrate that an organization has ‘learned’ or has demonstrated some degree of double-loop learning (Argyris and Schön [1974]) are rarely seen. Given the centrality of organizational memory functions in supporting faculty practice, measuring changes to how curricular information is stored and retrieved would provide insights into these matters. Thus, we consider that one of the hallmarks of the effectiveness of initiatives <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>USE</b> project in influencing teaching and learning is its influence on the core organizational functions of memory storage and retrieval as they pertained to course planning (e.g., new course syllabi).|$|R

5|$|Transit {{observations}} in 1874 and 1882 allowed this value to be refined further. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States—were {{sent to the}} Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined {{the data from the}} last four transits, and he arrived at a value of about 149.59 million kilometers (±0.31 million kilometers). Modern techniques, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> radio telemetry from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit (AU) to be calculated to a precision of about ±30 meters. As a result, the need for parallax calculations has been superseded.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer.
