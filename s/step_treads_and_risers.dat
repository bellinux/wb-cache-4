50|$|The {{sanctuary}} comprises {{almost the}} same area as the nave and consists of a raised platform accessed via <b>steps</b> with marble <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers.</b> A raised platform in the centre houses the altar, and another raised platform against the rear wall houses the Bishop's chair and crosier which are set in a marble framed recess which is clad with marbled vinyl tiles and also has the Bishop's Coat of Arms. Above this a large crucifix is fixed to the rear wall of the sanctuary. The vestry is accessed {{from the rear of}} the sanctuary either side of the Bishop's chair, and also via paired timber panelled doors either side of the sanctuary. The side chapel is located to the south of the sanctuary, and has a marble framed recess clad with marbled vinyl tiles behind the side altar.|$|R

Abundant trains of centimeter-scale, transverse, upwind-facing <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> cut sedimentary structures {{at a high}} angle. Central to {{the formation}} of these erosional steps are crusts produced by microbes lying just beneath exposed sandstone surfaces. <b>Treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> are present on the walls of smoothly curved troughs at the Wave, on the walls of nearby circular scour pits, and on bedrock domes found at the center of scour pits.

50|$|The {{stairwell}} {{occupies the}} tower that terminates {{in the roof}} top belvedere. A primarily timber structure, the stair has ornamental balusters, carved stringers <b>and</b> marble <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> on the flights between ground and first floor. Painted cast iron panels are incorporated into the stair balustrade. Beyond the first floor the stair <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> are timber.

50|$|Generally the {{interiors}} are intact and impressive, particularly {{in view of}} the inadequate system of construction supervision customary at the time. The interior generally has timber framed floors, rendered brick wall, painted panels and lightly detailed timber. The influence of Scandinavian modernism may be seen in the understated blond timber finishes and joinery, and the lightness and precision of the planar composition of court room fittings. The main staircase is light and airy, with grey terrazzo <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> <b>and</b> an almost freestanding handrail tracing a playful line within the generous volume containing the stairs. The stair well creates a remarkable focus in a finely contrived sequence of spaces.|$|R
50|$|Each {{wing of the}} {{structure}} features continuous open balconies on each floor which serve as single-loaded corridors to the classrooms. The architectural design creates well-ventilated, naturally-lighted classrooms. Stairs that service the five floors are wide with comfortable <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers.</b> Structural members are in all honesty defined on both the exterior and interior of the building. There is a grid of discreet sun baffles at {{the west side of}} the entrance hall.|$|R
25|$|The one-room {{interior}} of the Charles Sweeney Cabin has a loft accessible in the northwest corner by a dog-leg stairway. The stairway has many of its original balusters. It also has original trim on the stringers, the structural member of the stairway that supports the <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers.</b> The square newel and rail are formed from one piece of an oak branch. There is a small closet under the staircase that has its original four-paneled door with concave, quarter-circle corners on the raised panels.|$|R
50|$|Since fitted carpet {{became the}} norm in the late 1950s, the word distinguishes less than it once did. A stair carpet was {{characterized}} by not fitting the full width of the stair but leaving the underlying wood of the <b>tread</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> open to view; this was sometimes simply to save on carpet and sometimes to expose features while preventing wear to the underlying surface. Typically, a stair carpet will be more hard-wearing since it gets more punishing footfall than, for example, a carpet in a bedroom.|$|R

50|$|The {{upper floor}} has walls lined with {{vertically}} fixed painted chamferboards and plasterboard sheeting. The ceiling {{is lined with}} plasterboard with some recessed ceiling panels visible. Floors are lined with recent linoleum strip sheeting with carpet in some areas. The internal stairwell has walls lined with long lengths of chamferboards and fibre cement sheeting with cover strips. The staircase has <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> of polished timber and balustrades with timber cappings. The balcony space has walls and ceilings lined with plasterboard. On the lower floor walls and ceilings are generally unlined with some early louvre windows visible which are hidden behind cladding on the outside.|$|R
25|$|An ample gallery {{raised on}} a local-stone podium spans {{the width of the}} facade, the central one-third portion {{projecting}} forward approximately six feet in a square form. Defining the porch is a series of Corinthian columns raised upon a concrete balustrade, one at each intersection of two perpendicular planes. These columns support a full-entablature, ornate cornice and balustered parapet with pommels over each column. Bilateral stairs access the verandah from either side of the projecting central section. The <b>steps</b> contain marble <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> polychrome tile <b>risers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It served several {{purposes}} {{over the}} years and then was {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Culture until June 2000, when it was assigned to the Ministry of Environment. The National Trust states, [...] "Although Mille Fleurs is less ostentatious as some of its neighbours, the quality of finish and detailing is perhaps of a far higher quality; the intricately carved balusters <b>and</b> the marble <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers</b> to both the main and secondary staircases, the elaborate cast iron columns and brackets." [...] However, after a period of time when it was not occupied or maintained, it has deteriorated significantly. It is listed as a heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act.|$|R
50|$|Stairs usually {{consist of}} three components. They are the {{stringer}}, the <b>tread</b> <b>and</b> the <b>riser.</b> The stringer is the structural member {{that carries the}} load of the staircase, the tread is the horizontal part that is stepped on, <b>and</b> the <b>riser</b> board is the vertical part which runs {{the width of the}} structure. There are many types of stairs: open, closed, fully housed, winding, and so on, to mention a few of them.|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of soil in alpine tundra just above timberline may determine {{patterns of}} advance by woody species. Patterns of advance since the Little Ice Age show spatial aggregation. If soil resources have similar patterns of aggregation, they might determine {{the pattern of}} vegetation change. Effective soil depth (ESD), which takes into account stoniness, was measured in tundra just above present timberline on regular grids at two scales <b>and</b> across solifluction <b>treads</b> <b>and</b> <b>risers.</b> No non-random spatial pattern was found, nor was there any difference related to relict solifluction patterns. Current patterns of woody vegetation could not have developed in direct response to the pattern of effective soil depth found in tundra. These patterns may develop in response to other soil factors, but may also include positive feedback. D 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Access to {{the first}} floor is via an elegant timber {{staircase}} with walls and balustrades of paneled timber.

Natural light enters the stairwell through the large arched leadlight window which is framed by wall mounted Art Deco light fittings. The vaulted ceiling over the stair is simply detailed and forms an archway to the upper vestibule. The upper level vestibule has walls lined with hard plaster and timber-paneling. Plaster ceilings have moulded plaster cornices. Timber skirting boards, architraves architrave blocks are intact throughout the room and all interior timber work and joinery has a varnished finish. Internal openings are generous in height and doors feature tall glazed pivoting fanlights.
