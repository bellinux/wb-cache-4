60|$|It remains only, that I should {{determine}} {{how high the}} Water or other Liquor may by this means be raised in a <b>smaller</b> <b>Pipe</b> above the Superficies of that without it, and at what height it may be sustained: But to determine this, will be exceeding difficult, unless I could certainly {{know how much of}} the Airs pressure is taken off by the smalness of such and such a Pipe, and whether it may be wholly taken off, that is, whether there can be a hole or pore so small, into which Air could not at all enter, though water might with its whole force, for were there such, 'tis manifest, that the water might rise in it to some five or six and thirty English Foot high. I know not whether the capillary Pipes in the bodies of small Trees, which we call their Microscopical pores, may not be such; and whether the congruity of the sides of the Pore may not yet draw the juyce even higher then the Air was able by its bare pressure to raise it: For, Congruity is a principle that not only unites and holds a body joyned to it, but, which is more, attracts and draws a body that is very near it, and holds it above its usual height.|$|E

50|$|In 1957 {{the concept}} of a piston being pulled through a tube of water was first purposed as a cheap arrest gear system for land airbases. In the early 1960s, the British took this basic concept and {{developed}} a spray-type arrest gear system for both land and sea use. The engine had hydraulic cylinders that moved through water filled pipe, with a <b>smaller</b> <b>pipe</b> alongside that has holes of various size along its length. The Royal Navy claimed that there was no theoretical weight limit, but there was a speed limit.|$|E
50|$|Bazalgette's {{foresight}} {{may be seen}} in {{the diameter}} of the sewers. When planning the network he took the densest population, gave every person the most generous allowance of sewage production {{and came up with a}} diameter of pipe needed. He then said 'Well, we're only going to do this once and there's always the unforeseen' and doubled the diameter to be used. His foresight allowed for the unforeseen increase in population density with the introduction of the tower block; with the original, <b>smaller</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter the sewer would have overflowed in the 1960s, rather than coping until the present day as it has.|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{upgrades}} {{have also}} been designed into the ship, including a vacuum collection/marine sanitation device (VC/MSD), a new marine sewage system that uses sea water in lieu of fresh water for lower maintenance costs. Many older ships in the U.S. Navy utilize a gravity-driven collection holding and transfer (CHT) system to handle sewage waste. Newer U.S. Navy ships, including now CVN-77, collect sewage waste by vacuum, allowing for greater flexibility in piping installation, <b>smaller</b> <b>pipe</b> sizes overall and reducing water consumption. The collection tanks of George H.W. Bush were modified to accommodate both the VCHT (Vacuum CHT) equipment and {{the elements of a}} marine sanitization device to treat the waste prior to discharge. George H.W. Bush is the only aircraft carrier in the U.S. Navy to combine the two technologies.|$|E
50|$|The navy's {{demand for}} 15-inch guns {{to defeat the}} new Confederate ironclads placed Dahlgren in a dilemma. All of his earlier shell guns had been cast solid, then had the bore drilled out—the {{traditional}} way to make artillery. Dahlgren’s efforts with the XIII-inch shell gun were unsatisfactory {{and it was not}} clear that he could solid cast a 15-inch gun. However 15-inch guns had been successfully cast using the techniques developed by Thomas Jackson Rodman. Rodman developed a hollow casting method, where the gun was cast around a hollow pipe. As the casting cooled, a <b>smaller</b> <b>pipe</b> was inserted into the first and water was pumped through the small pipe. At the same time hot coals were placed against the outside of the casting. This caused the casting to cool slowly from the inside out. As the outer parts of the casting cooled, they compressed the already cooled inner parts, making a stronger gun. The Bureau of Ordnance ordered that the Dahlgren XV-inch and XX-inch shell guns be cast using the Rodman hollow casting method. This use of Rodman hollow casting with a Dahlgren designed gun led to friction between Dahlgren and the Bureau of Ordnance, as well as some confusion in nomenclature.|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from {{laminar to turbulent}} flow in porous media is studied with a pore doublet model consisting of pipes with different diameter. The pressure drop over all pipes is recorded by pressure transducers for different flow rates. Results show that the flow in the parallel pipes is redistributed when turbulent slugs pass through {{one of them and}} six different flow zones were identified by studying the difference between the Re in the parallel pipes. Each flow zone starts when the flow regime of one of the pipe changes. Transitional flow of each pipe increases the correlation between different pipes pressure drop fluctuations. Frequency analysis of the pressure drops show that the larger pipe makes the system to oscillate by the presence of turbulent patches in its flow. However, when the flow in the <b>smaller</b> <b>pipe</b> enters into the transitional zone the larger pipe starts to follow the fluctuations of the <b>smaller</b> <b>pipe.</b> Validerad; 2015; Nivå 2; 20140329 (stlu...|$|E
