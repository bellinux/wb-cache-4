Though Republican Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott did not have a vote, he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> vote for Shumlin, and Republican State Representative Kurt Wright <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do so.

60|$|So the man <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go, but <b>he</b> {{begged the}} Governor {{to be very}} careful to put his finger into the tap-hole the moment he took his out.|$|R

5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very happy and looking forward {{about going to}} school. However, the boy's initial enthusiastic nature is crushed by an uncaring and bitter teacher who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be a failure at life and never amount to anything. Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began {{the process of developing}} his path into the mischievous way of life.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 Labour {{leadership}} election, Andy Burnham <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{introduce a}} graduate tax to replace fees.

5|$|On February 12, 2002, U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham {{made the}} {{decision}} that this site was suitable to be the nation's nuclear repository. The governor of Nevada had 90days to object and did so. However, the United States Congress overrode the objection. If the governor's objection had stood the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen.

60|$|He waited till he {{was safely}} out of sight, and then {{followed}} {{on down the}} street towards his hotel.

60|$|March <b>said,</b> mentally, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go {{with her}} into the jaws of death, if need be; but he {{followed}} up the mental speech with the audible remark <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had better take some weapon with him.|$|R
5|$|Rudd {{initially}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> challenge Gillard, but it {{soon became}} apparent {{that he did not}} have enough support within the party to survive in his position.

However, Neymar himself did not apologise and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> repeat his behaviour in the future.|$|E
60|$|Mr Sparkler perceived, {{by a kind}} of inspiration, {{that the}} {{question}} implied had he not better go? He therefore withdrew the fraternal railing, and neatly <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> with submission, take his leave. He did not go without being congratulated by Amy, as well as she could discharge that office in the flutter and distress of her spirits.|$|R
