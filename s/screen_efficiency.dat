The dependence of the <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> on the aperture size, length and inclination of the screen, {{as well as on}} vibration amplitude, is considered.

A phenomenon exist below 2° such that for a given set of operating conditions, decreasing the inclination angle will increase the bed depth resulting in a lower <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However it will also simultaneously increase the residence time, which results in an increase in the <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It is unsure which effect will be more dominant at inclination angles less than 2°.|$|R

50|$|It is {{an improvised}} {{technique}} {{to the other}} screening techniques in which product on the screen is moved from the centre by radial inclination while the tangential inclination leads to circular motion of the product. Thus tumbler screening provides 99% screening efficiency with gentle screening of delicate particles to prevent particle destruction. The complicated circular three dimensional screening action is adjustable to accommodate different material characteristics and is mainly independent of the material load, improving the separation process. This technique is usually performed after crushing/milling. It {{can be used for}} both dry and wet screening. Tumbler screening technique is a multi-deck elliptical action screening technique in which speed can be adjusted such that it has a faster travel rate at the feed and is slow at the discharge side, which can help increase in <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency,</b> so that products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the main}} {{governing}} equations for a trommel screen include the <b>screening</b> rate, <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> and residence time of particles in the screen. These equations could be applied in the rough calculation done in initial phases of a design process. However, design is largely based on heuristics. Therefore, design rules are often used {{in place of the}} governing equations in the design of a trommel screen. When designing a trommel screen, the main factors affecting the <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> and production rate are the rotational velocity of the drum, mass flow rate of feed particles, size of the drum, and inclination of trommel screen.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} new screening facilities at the Toppenish Creek, Wapato, and Sunnyside canals in southcentral Washington State.

During 1987 at the Wapato Canal, we estimated <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency</b> was 97 % ({+-}l%). We conducted descaling tests at the Toppenish Creek Screens. We estimated that 0. 2 % of steelhead Qncorhynchus mykiss smelts released during tests were descaled. None of the fish released through the fish return pipe were descaled. We measured the time required for fish to move through the screen facilities. The time required for 50 % of the test fish to exit the Toppenish Creek Screen forebay was 4 to 9 h for rainbow trout fry and up to 39 h for steelhead smelts. The time for 50 % of the test fish to exit the Wapato and Sunnyside screen forebays was less than 8 h. As with past studies, exit times varied with canal flow and species. After 39 h at Toppenish Creek, half the steelhead smelts were still in the forebay when canal flows were 20 cfs. At Sunnyside, half the chinook salmon fry exited the forebay in 1 h or less. Methods used in 1988 were the same as those used at Sunnyside in 1985 and in subsequent years at Richland, Toppenish/Satus, and Wapato.

40|$|In genetic screens, {{the number}} of mutagenized gametes {{examined}} is an important parameter for evaluating screen progress, {{the number of}} genes of a given mutable phenotype, gene size, cost, and labor. Since genetic screens often entail examination of thousands or {{tens of thousands of}} animals, strategies for optimizing genetics screens are important for minimizing effort while maximizing the number of mutagenized gametes examined. To date, such strategies have not been described for genetic screens in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we review general principles of genetic screens in C. elegans, and use a modified binomial strategy to obtain a general expression for the number of mutagenized gametes examined in a genetic screen. We use this expression to calculate optimal screening parameters for a large range of genetic screen types. In addition, we developed a simple online genetic-screen-optimization tool that can be used independently of this paper.

Deposit amenability to this coarse separation technique requires an integrated characterisation program involving a carefully designed sampling strategy. A key aspect within this process is the preferential grade by size industrial pilot trial. This paper outlines the screening of 40, 000 tons of Run of mine (ROM) material from a word class Cu-porphyry deposit from an area identified as amenable to coarse preconcentration by size based on geometallurgical characterisation, and investigates three sources of uncertainty upon preferential grade by size pilot trial results. <b>Screen</b> <b>efficiency,</b> fundamental sampling errors and the mathematical model employed describing preferential grade by size response are analysed.

40|$|The yeast {{two-hybrid system}} is a genetic method that detects protein-protein interactions, One {{application}} is the detection by library screening of new interactors of a protein of known function. In the August issue of Nature Genetics, Fromont-Racine et al. (1) showed {{for the first time}} that the construction of the protein interaction map of a complex pathway, such as that of the mRNA splicing machinery, is now possible, because of the combination of recent technical improvements elaborated in several laboratories, With a yeast cell mating procedure that increases <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency,</b> they used their complex yeast genomic library of 5 x 10 (6) clones to lest 700 x 10 (6) interactions against 15 proteins. They identified and classified 170 potential interactors, including approximately 70 proteins of previously unknown function. More than 25 % of the interactors are probably biologically relevant. The achievements of Fromont-Racine et ai. have opened the way to the systematic analysis of the protein interaction networks of the 6, 000 open reading frames-yeast proteome.

40|$|A semi-analytical {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to investigate the}} <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> of trenches to moving-load induced ground vibrations. The ground is modeled as a fully saturated poroelastic half-space governed by Biot's dynamic poroelastic theory. The trenches are obtained by placing three rectangular elastic layers with appropriate width upon the poroelastic half-space. By Helmholtz decomposition, the displacement fields of the elastic layers are decomposed into three scalar potentials. Analytical solutions are obtained based on Fourier transform and Fourier series in the transformed domain. The time-domain results are obtained by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The different performances of trenches on a saturated poroelastic half-space and a single-phase elastic half-space to the moving load-induced ground vibration are identified. It is found that the discrepancy of the <b>screening</b> <b>efficiencies</b> between the two models becomes significant when the load speed approaches the Rayleigh wave speed of the ground surface.

40|$|In this work, {{a steady}} state {{simulation}} of a fertilizer granulation circuit is developed {{in order to}} study strategies for reducing the recycle ratio and improving circuit control. A two-stage population balance model for the continuous granulation drum is developed. This {{is based on an}} experimentally observed mechanism of granulation. Models developed for the screen and crusher units are validated against data from an operating granulation plant. Unit models are then used to develop a steady state simulation of the entire granulation circuit. Several case studies are performed to illustrate the effect of changing granulation model parameters, crusher and screen operating characteristics on circuit performance. Recycle ratio goes through a minimum as liquid content in the granulation drum increases. Operation is very sensitive near the liquid content where a second stage of granulation, which broadens the granule size distribution, begins. Multiple steady states are observed under some conditions, these are related to variations in granule porosity with recycle granule size distribution. A reduction in binder viscosity or granulation drum residence time improves circuit stability. Circuit operation is very sensitive to the efficiency of the crushing and screening station. Efficient crushing reduces recycle ratios at high liquid content and also improves circuit stability. A reduction in <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency</b> causes a large increase in the minimum obtainable recycle ratio...|$|E

Emerging evidence indicates that signaling by Pyk 2 regulates hematopoietic cell response, bone density, neuronal degeneration, angiogenesis, and cancer. These physiological and pathological roles of Pyk 2 warrant it as a valuable therapeutic target for invasive cancers, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and inflammatory cellular response. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, no potent and selective inhibitor of Pyk 2 is available at present. As {{a first step toward}} discovering specific potential inhibitors of Pyk 2, we used an in silico high-throughput screening approach. A virtual library of six million lead-like compounds was docked against four different high-resolution Pyk 2 kinase domain crystal structures and further selected for predicted potency and ligand efficiency. Ligand selectivity for Pyk 2 over focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was evaluated by comparative docking of ligands and measurement of binding free energy so as to obtain 40 potential candidates. Finally, the structural flexibility of a subset of the docking complexes was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation, followed by intermolecular interaction analysis. These compounds may be considered as promising leads for further development of highly selective Pyk 2 inhibitors.

40|$|AbstractThe {{inheritance}} of functional mitochondria depends on faithful replication and transmission of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). A large and heterogeneous group of human disorders {{is associated with}} mitochondrial genome quantitative and qualitative anomalies. Several nuclear genes {{have been shown to}} account for these severe OXPHOS disorders. However, in several cases, the disease-causing mutations still remain unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans has been largely used for studying various biological functions because this multicellular organism has short life cycle and is easy to grow in the laboratory. Mitochondrial functions are relatively well conserved between human and C. elegans, and heteroplasmy exists in this organism as in human. C. elegans therefore represents a useful tool for studying mtDNA maintenance. Suppression by RNA interference of genes involved in mtDNA replication such as polg- 1, encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, results in reduced mtDNA copy number but in a normal phenotype of the F 1 worms. By combining RNAi of genes involved in mtDNA maintenance and EtBr exposure, we were able to reveal a strong and specific phenotype (developmental larval arrest) associated to a severe decrease of mtDNA copy number. Moreover, we tested and validated the <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency</b> for human orthologous genes encoding mitochondrial nucleoid proteins. This allowed us to identify several genes that seem to be closely related to mtDNA maintenance in C. elegans. This work reports a first step in the further development of a large-scale screening in C. elegans that should allow to identify new genes of mtDNA maintenance whose human orthologs will obviously constitute new candidate genes for patients with quantitative or qualitative mtDNA anomalies...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotating}} screen drums are largely used in most powder handling and processing industries. They {{are commonly used}} for size separation of granular materials. Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined {{rotating screen}} drum for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating screen drum equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates. The shaping effects of the rotating screen drum were evaluated from the measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics (size distribution, water content, compactness, and circularity) on wet soft agglomerates. To describe the <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> parameters of a rotary screen drum, a specific method was developed by using a matrix analysis of the different measured weights of the collected products. The impacts of rotating screen drum parameters (angle of inclination, rotating speed, and product flow rate) on the sieving efficiency and on the shaping effects were investigated. The present results demonstrate high apparent <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the rotating screen drum when used with wet agglomerates of durum wheat, ranging between 89 and 96 % depending on the process conditions Finally, using dimensional analysis, two correlations were proposed on the circularity and the apparent <b>screening</b> <b>efficiency</b> whatever the operating conditions used (drum speed, angle of inclination and feed rate) ...|$|R

30|$|Some {{previous}} research has developed our current understanding and theory of single grain screen-penetrating probability. The probability model and equations for a spherical particle penetrating a hole were developed by Subasinghe et al. (1989). Wen and Liu (1982) put forward various characteristic motions that a single particle on the sieve surface may undertake: relative static, relative sliding and projectile motion. Applying chaotic motion theory to analyze {{the movement of the}} single particle, Liu and Lu (2009) concluded that the motion is nonlinear. Beyond the single particle, theory of particle cluster screen-penetrating probability has also been established. In 1972, the collision speed transfer formula of particle clusters in the sieving process was established by Bruder. Using the method of probability statistics, the mathematical model of the penetration probability along the screen was put forth by Chen and Yan (1982). In recent years, discrete element method (DEM) allows for modeling at the particle level and accounts for interaction between particles and boundary objects. Cleary (2004) and Cleary and Sawley (2002) presented a three dimensional model of spherical particle separation on an inclined flat screen based on DEM. Tong explored the relationship between vibration parameters and <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency,</b> as well as performing simulations of stratification and penetration over various structural and vibration parameters based on the DEM (Chen and Tong 2009, 2010; Wang and Tong 2011). The implementation of DEM for screening process gives an insight to study the particulate systems. DEM simulations have been reported positive results in mineral screening and crop cleaning (Zhu et al. 2008; Weerasekara et al. 2013; Cleary and Dsinnott 2015; Cleary 2015; Xue et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans, Notch {{signaling}} regulates developmentally timed sleep {{during the}} transition from L 4 larval stage to adulthood (L 4 /A). To identify core sleep pathways and to find genes acting downstream of Notch signaling, we undertook the first genome-wide, classical genetic screen focused on C. elegans developmentally timed sleep. To increase <b>screen</b> <b>efficiency,</b> we first looked for mutations that suppressed inappropriate anachronistic sleep in adult hsp::osm- 11 animals overexpressing the Notch coligand OSM- 11 after heat shock. We retained suppressor lines that also had defects in L 4 /A developmentally timed sleep, without heat shock overexpression of the Notch coligand. Sixteen suppressor lines with defects in developmentally timed sleep were identified. One line carried a new allele of goa- 1; loss of GOA- 1 Gαo decreased C. elegans sleep. Another line carried a new allele of gpb- 2, encoding a Gβ 5 protein; Gβ 5 proteins have not been previously implicated in sleep. In other scenarios, Gβ 5 GPB- 2 acts with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) EAT- 16 and EGL- 10 to terminate either EGL- 30 Gαq signaling or GOA- 1 Gαo signaling, respectively. We found that loss of Gβ 5 GPB- 2 or RGS EAT- 16 decreased L 4 /A sleep. By contrast, EGL- 10 loss had no impact. Instead, loss of RGS- 1 and RGS- 2 increased sleep. Combined, our results suggest that, {{in the context of}} L 4 /A sleep, GPB- 2 predominantly acts with EAT- 16 RGS to inhibit EGL- 30 Gαq signaling. These results confirm the importance of G protein signaling in sleep and demonstrate that these core sleep pathways function genetically downstream of the Notch signaling events promoting sleep...|$|E
