5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based <b>stress</b> <b>reduction</b> reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{benefits of}} a preventive intervention to the living standards of recently separated mothers. In the Oregon Divorce Study’s randomized experimental design, data were collected 5 times over 30 months and evaluated with Hierarchical Linear Growth Models. Relative to their no- intervention control counterparts, experimental mothers had greater improvements in gross annual income, discretionary annual income, poverty threshold, income-to-needs ratios, and financial stress. Comparisons showed the intervention to produce a greater increase in income-to-needs and a greater rise-above-poverty threshold. Benefits to income-to-needs were statistically independent of maternal depressed mood, divorce status, child support, and repartnering. Financial <b>stress</b> <b>reductions</b> were explained by the intervention effect on income-to-needs.

40|$|Electrical-assisted forming (EAF), where {{current is}} {{directly}} {{applied to the}} workpiece during deformation, {{has been shown to}} dramatically reduce the flow stress of the material. In this paper, the effect of altering the Zn content in Cu specimens during EAF is investigated. Varying results were observed depending on if the threshold density, which produces significant <b>reductions</b> in flow <b>stress,</b> was surpassed. Thus, temperature increases due to resistive heating alone are not the cause of the observed effects. Once the threshold current is exceeded, the flow <b>stress</b> <b>reductions</b> increased with increasing Zn content. These results support theories regarding the physical mechanism of EAF as dislocations are able to move past alloying elements more effectively. (C) 2010 CIRP...|$|R

25|$|The 1960s and '70s saw {{the rapid}} growth of Western Buddhism, {{especially}} in the United States. In the 1970s, psychotherapeutic techniques using “mindfulness” were developed such as Hakomi therapy by Ron Kurtz (1934–2011), possibly the first mindfulness based therapy. Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness-Based <b>Stress</b> <b>Reduction</b> (MBSR) was a very influential development, introducing the term into Western Cognitive behavioral therapy practice. Kabat-Zinn's students Zindel V. Segal, J. Mark G. Williams and John D. Teasdale later developed Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} era, Buddhist {{meditation}} saw increasing popularity {{due to the}} influence of Buddhist modernism and the lay meditation based Vipassana movement. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the Western world paralleled the spread of Buddhism in the West. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn who founded the Mindfulness-Based <b>Stress</b> <b>Reduction</b> (MBSR) in 1979. The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term sati) and related meditative practices has in turn led to several mindfulness based therapies.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to present actual {{calculation}} approaches and design aspects of inflatable dams. The analytical calculation of design relevant stresses in the membrane of inflatable dams is too vague. Therefore, finite element analyses are {{needed to get the}} stresses of the multi-ply composite material with cover layers of rubber. Because of the rubber layers the inflatable dams are sometimes called rubber dams. In the end of the actual investigations, there should be a design concept for inflatable dams accordant to the Eurocode-concept. Stress concentration factors, gained of finite element calculations, lead to the relevant <b>stresses.</b> <b>Reduction</b> factors for the different material behaviours are determined independent of numerous calculations...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{oil and gas}} {{exploitation}} in reservoir {{will lead}} to pore pressure depletion. The pore pressure depletion will result in changes of horizontal in-situ stresses both in reservoirs and caprock formations. Using the geophysics logging data, the magnitude and orientation changes of horizontal stresses in caprock and reservoir are studied. Furthermore, the borehole stability can be affected by in-situ stresses changes. To address this issue, the dehydration from caprock to reservoir and roof effect of caprock are performed. Based on that, the influence scope and magnitude of horizontal <b>stresses</b> <b>reduction</b> in caprock above the depleted reservoirs are estimated. The effects of development on borehole stability in both reservoir and caprock are studied step by step with the above geomechanical model...|$|R

25|$|Secular {{forms of}} {{meditation}} {{were introduced in}} India in the 1950s as a Westernized form of Hindu meditative techniques and arrived in Australia in the late 1950s and, the United States and Europe in the 1960s. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes <b>stress</b> <b>reduction,</b> relaxation and self-improvement. Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of scientific analyses. Research on meditation began in 1931, with scientific research increasing dramatically during the 1970s and 1980s. Since {{the beginning of the}} '70s more than a thousand studies of meditation in English-language have been reported. However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Early {{long-term}} higher-dose {{therapy with}} AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All {{of these conditions}} were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They {{have been attributed to}} several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of thymidine triphosphate, oxidative <b>stress,</b> <b>reduction</b> of intracellular L-carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, nordazepam, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side-effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.|$|E
25|$|Some {{effects may}} include a general {{alteration}} of conscious perception, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation or <b>stress</b> <b>reduction,</b> increased {{appreciation of the}} arts, including humor and music (especially discerning its various components/instruments), joviality, metacognition and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis, however, some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. Cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the adverse effects of THC, including anxiety, that some consumers experience.|$|E
40|$|Relational caregiving skills remain seldom {{studied in}} health professionals. We {{evaluated}} effects on health professional relational caregiving self-efficacy from an eight-week, 16 -hour training in self-management tools. Physicians, nurses, chaplains, {{and other health}} professionals were randomized after pretest to treatment (n = 30) or waiting list (n = 31). Training used a previously researched program of Easwaran (1991 / 1978) derived from spiritual wisdom traditions. Changes were measured using a 34 -item caregiving self-efficacy scale. Positive effects were observed at posttest, eight- and 19 -week follow-up (ds =. 38,. 47,. 37, all ps <. 05), and were mediated by adherence to practices and <b>stress</b> <b>reductions</b> (p <. 05), findings also obtained in qualitative interviews (n = 24).

25|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, Mindfulness and mindfulness-based {{programs}} {{have become increasingly}} important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community {{as a means of}} helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based <b>Stress</b> <b>Reduction</b> program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat. Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} quantifiable research that mindfulness {{has on the}} brain and body {{is one of the}} major reasons why corporate mindfulness programs has become more prominent in the modern day business world. Studies conducted by Yale University found that mindfulness meditation is associated with lower levels of activity in the default mode network (DMN), which is part of the brain network that is responsible for self-related thinking and mind wandering. Volume changes in key areas of the brain are also found as a result of meditation. In 2011, a team at Harvard found that mindfulness can actually change the structure of the brain after conducting an eight-week mindfulness-based <b>stress</b> <b>reduction</b> program (MBSR) on participants. The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in brain cell volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.|$|E
