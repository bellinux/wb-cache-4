5000|$|Silibinin (INN), {{also known}} as silybin (both from Silybum, the generic name of the plant from which it is extracted), is the major active {{constituent}} of silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk thistle seeds, containing a mixture of flavonolignans consisting of silibinin, isosilibinin, <b>silicristin,</b> silidianin, and others. Silibinin itself {{is a mixture of}} two diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B, in approximately equimolar ratio. [...] The mixture exhibits a number of pharmacological effects, particularly in the liver, and there is some clinical evidence for the use of silibinin as a supportive element in alcoholic and child grade 'A' liver cirrhosis.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{potential}} benefit of silymarin (special extract from {{the fruits of}} Silybum marianum) {{in the treatment of}} liver diseases remains a controversial issue. METHODS: For this systematic review electronic databases identified 65 papers for the search terms silymarin, silibinin, <b>silicristin</b> or milk thistle and clinical trial. Only 19 complied with the criteria'double-' or 'single-blind'. These publications were analysed from a clinical point of view and meta-analytic calculations were performed. RESULTS: The clinical evidence ofa therapeutic effect of silymarin in toxic liver diseases is scarce. There is no evidence of a favourable influence on the evolution of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C. In alcoholic liver disease, comparing with placebo, aspartate aminotransferase was reduced in the silymarin-treated groups (p = 0. 01) while alkaline phosphatase was not. In liver cirrhosis, mostly alcoholic, total mortality was 16. 1 % with silymarin vs. 20. 5 % with placebo (n. s.); liver-related mortality was 10. 0 % with silymarin vs. 17. 3 % with placebo(p = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available clinical evidence it can be concluded - concerning possible risks /probable benefits - that it is reasonable to employ silymarin as a supportive element in the therapy of Amanita phalloides poisoning but also (alcoholic and grade Child 'A') liver cirrhosis. A consistent research programme, consolidating existing evidence and exploring new potential uses,would be very welcome...|$|E

Silymarin contains several molecules, including silibinin A, silibinin B, isosilibinin A, isosilibinin B, <b>silicristin,</b> and silidianin. Intravenous infusion of silibinin induces dose-dependent reduction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the principal isomers contained in silymarin preparations for their ability to inhibit HCV enzymatic functions and replication in different models. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of silymarin components was tested in HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NS 3 / 4 A protease enzyme assays. Their ability to inhibit replication of an HCV genotype 1 b replicon model and the JFH 1 infectious HCV model in cell culture was also studied. RESULTS: Silibinin A, silibinin B, their water-soluble dihydrogen succinate forms and Legalon SIL, a commercially available intravenous preparation of silibinin, inhibited HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function, with inhibitory concentrations 50 % of the order of 75 - 100 microM. Silibinin A and silibinin B also inhibited HCV genotype 1 b replicon replication and HCV genotype 2 a strain JFH 1 replication in cell culture. None of these compounds inhibited HCV protease function. CONCLUSIONS: Silibinin A and silibinin B, as well as Legalon SIL, inhibit HCV replicon and JFH 1 replication in cell culture. This effect is at least partly explained by the ability of these compounds to inhibit HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Our results provide a basis for the optimization and subsequent development of members of the Flavonoid family as specific HCV antivirals...|$|E
