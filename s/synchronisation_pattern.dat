Available guidance portrays humans as deterministic robot-like force generators moving at a single frequency with either perfect synchronisation or with random phases. Humans are not robots, and natural variability and imperfect synchronisation of individuals point to a random approach for crowd loading.

40|$|Abstract. Memory {{management}} {{is one of}} the most complex aspects of modern concurrent algorithms, and various techniques proposed for it—such as hazard pointers, read-copy-update and epoch-based reclamation—have proved very challenging for formal reasoning. In this paper, we show that different memory reclamation techniques actually rely on the same implicit <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pattern,</b> not clearly reflected in the code, but only in the form of assertions used to argue its correctness. The pattern is based on the key concept of a grace period, during which a thread can access certain shared memory cells without fear that they get deallocated. We propose a modular reasoning method, motivated by the pattern, that handles all three of the above memory reclamation techniques in a uniform way. By explicating their fundamental core, our method achieves clean and simple proofs, scaling even to realistic implementations of the algorithms without a significant increase in proof complexity. We formalise the method using a combination of separation logic and temporal logic and use it to verify example instantiations of the three approaches to memory reclamation. ...|$|E
40|$|Communicating Sequential Processes for Java (JCSP) is {{a mature}} library that {{implements}} CSP-derived concurrency primitives in Java. A JCSP {{system is a}} hierarchical network of autonomous processes communicating over synchronous (optionally buffered) channels, and multiway synchronising through barriers. This paper presents a significant extension to the barrier mechanism: the fast resolution of choice between any number of barrier events, channel communications (in either direction) and timeouts. Previously, and in line with all currently released libraries and languages offering the CSP concurrency model, choice was restricted to channel inputs and timeouts. The paper demonstrates an application of alting barriers and explains the mechanisms used in their implementation that enables their use as guards in a choice. It also shows how choice over channel outputs becomes possible, as a simple consequence of having choice over barriers. Finally, an efficient implementation of CSP’s broadcasting channels is presented (using a phased barrier <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pattern)</b> and a mechanism for allowing choice over these is discussed. With this extended JCSP, almost all CSP-specified systems can now be directly implemented...|$|E

Such dynamic systems are present in nature, e. g., nervous systems [2] or chemical oscillators [3], and in technical devices like Josephson’s junction [4]. Inference about the interactions in complex systems is also related to such omnipresent phenomena as self-organisation and the 1 f noise [5]. The quantification of synchronisation in complex systems from empirical measurements is accompanied with a difficulty: access to the individual oscilla-tors is crucial otherwise spurious synchronisation will be measured [6]. In many fields these are not easily available, but one rather deals with superpositions of several elementary oscillators [7]. Below it is addressed how the original oscil-lators could be regained by postulating a general synchronisation structure for the system. 2 Superpositions and phase synchrony Phase synchrony between two oscillators uj(t) and uk(t) with arbitrary phase lag can be quantified with the phase locking factor (PLF), the circular variance of the phase lag between them.

The downside of this shift is an increase in programming complexity due to the more subtile concurrency issues. Several special purpose streaming languages have been proposed to help the programmer in coping with these concurrency issues. In this paper, we take a different approach.

40|$|The brain holds key {{information}} regarding the information processing capability of individuals and recent advances in sensor devices and technology have attracted researchers to question the working of this complex organ. It {{is not only the}} elusiveness of the brain that has drawn recent research attention but also the claim of doctors that brain function is key in neurological disorders. Disorders like Autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) not to mention other forms of neurobiological diseases have been attributed to disproportionate and disrupted connectivity in the brain. It is envisaged that more accurate and thorough understanding such connectivity can pave the way for medical research of diseases such as these which are deeply rooted to neural level information exchange deficits. The main objective of this work is to develop an effective means to quantitatively characterise functional connectivity in the brain. Phase synchronisation is reported as the key manifestation of the underlying mechanism of information coupling between different brain regions. This work, therefore first the phase relationships between Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been investigated to understand the <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pattern</b> underlying them during the execution of a task. The pursuit to characterise time evolving phase synchrony leads to the identification of the existence of discrete states with quasi-stable phase topography call synchrostates in EEG datasets from range of subjects. These states exhibited switching patterns which were characteristic to the stimuli provided during a cognitive task, specifically in this case face perception tasks. The switching of these states were modelled in a probabilistic framework using a finite Markov model and the stability of the states are represented by the self-transition probabilities. The degree of phase synchronisation during the existence of each state is then translated into functional connectivity maps and complex network graph measures were applied on it to obtain a set of metrics that quantify the characteristics of such connections formed within the brain. These quantitative brain connectivity measures were used as features to solve a classification problem between autistic and typical children which resulted in an accuracy of 94. 7 %. The connectivity parameters were then used to characterise behavioural trait scores of anxious children by developing a regression model correlating these to the standardised behavioural scores calculated from questionnaires. Traits like sadness, state anxiety and anger could be modelled effectively using the metrics reported in this study. This work lays the foundation for further exploration of these quantitative measures for characterising a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and hence may result in a new type of diagnostic process to aid the existing tools available to the clinicians...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work was {{to contribute to the}} understanding of how the brain deals with rhythmical behaviours, as the title says. The line of approach was to investigate the cerebral correlates of tempo production, using a new and a seldom used behavioural paradigm. The new paradigm consisted of regular and irregular sensorimotor synchronisation (SMS) tasks. Both conditions implied duration estimation, feedback and error correction. Only the regular condition induced an internal rhythm. The seldom used paradigm consisted of self-paced finger tapping tasks at spontaneous motor tempo and other tempi. The use of strictly self-paced tapping made it possible to avoid contaminating the production by any previously heard tempo. Subtraction of selfpaced related brain activation <b>patterns</b> from <b>synchronisation</b> <b>patterns</b> was done in order to isolate the brain mechanisms of synchronisation. Subtracting <b>synchronisation</b> brain activation <b>patterns</b> during irregular finger tapping from those during regular finger tapping conditions was used to isolate cerebral activity involved in the production of isochronous finger tapping. The results suggest that duration estimation and internal timekeeping require similar brain regions. These seem to be involved mainly in duration estimation and retention, and error correction. It is proposed that the signals sent by the body during rhythmical tasks {{play a role in the}} processing of an internal pulsation. It is also suggested that internal timekeeping imply the generation of an internal model of the external stimuli or of the rhythmic pattern to produce. This role could be assumed by the network composed of the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (Grahn, 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|For the {{verification}} of concurrent programs, {{it is essential}} to be able to show that synchronisation mechanisms are implemented correctly. A common way to implement such sychronisers is by using atomic operations. This paper identifies what different <b>synchronisation</b> <b>patterns</b> can be implemented by using atomic read, write and compare-and-set operation. Additionally, this paper proposes also a specification of these operations in Java’s AtomicInteger class, and shows how different synchronisation mechanisms can be built and verified using atomic integer as the synchronisation primitive. The specifications for the methods in the AtomicInteger class are derived from the classical concurrent separation logic rule for atomic operations. A main characteristic of our specification is its ease of use. To verify an implementation of a synchronisation mechanism, the user only has to specify (1) what are the different roles of the threads participating in the synchronisation, (2) what are the legal state transitions in the synchroniser, and (3) what share of the resource invariant can be obtained in a certain state, given the role of the current thread. The approach is illustrated on several synchronisation mechanisms. For all implementations, we provide a machine-checked proof that the implementations correctly implement the synchroniser...|$|R

More precisely, we investigate whether bilateral trade flows affect output synchronisation between the euro area countries and see countries and compare trade-synchronisation patterns between the see countries and new member states that have not yet introduced the euro (NMS). The results show that the levels of output similarities between the see countries and NMS are different and that the see countries exhibit lower output correlation with the euro area members than the NMS. Exploring the role of trade in aligning growth patterns has in some cases found positive effects, much stronger for the see countries, which have lower trade intensity levels. We argue that the reason for these results is related to the fact that other factors could be dominant in the NMS countries (policy measures alignment within the EU), while for the see countries only trade relationships had the opportunity to exert noticeable effects in the analysed period...|$|R

This is a CSP inspired design, expressed and implemented using the occam-pi language. It {{is part of}} the TUNA pilot study on nanite assemblers at the universities of York, Surrey and Kent. The aim for this model is to engineer emergent behaviour from the platelets, such that they respond to a wound in the blood vessel wall in a way similar to that found in the human body [...] i. e. the formation of clots to stem blood flow from the wound and facilitate healing. An architecture for a three dimensional model (relying strongly on the dynamic and mobile capabilities of occam-pi) is given, along with mechanisms for visualisation and interaction. The biological accuracy of the current model is very approximate. However, its process-oriented nature enables simple refinement (through the addition of processes modelling different stimulants/inhibitors of the clotting reaction, different platelet types and other participating organelles) to greater and greater realism. Even with the current system, simple experiments are possible and have scientific interest (e. g. the effect of platelet density on the success of the clotting mechanism in stemming blood flow: too high or too low and the process fails). General principles for the design of large and complex system models are drawn. The described case study runs to millions of processes engaged in ever-changing communication topologies.

40|$|Service Composition {{refers to}} a popular modern {{software}} paradigm for building applications by combining distributed reactive components using the World-Wide-Web as the medium. The approach is characterised {{by the use of}} standardised protocols, languages and representations such as XML, which ensures that services are platform agnostic. Whilst the architecture is well understood for simple single-interaction services built in the style of classical procedures from the traditional programming paradigm, much discussion is still taking place with regard to more complicated, fully reactive services, where the consumer interacts in a stateful manner. The aim of this Thesis is to investigate the way in which composite Web services are built, and provide a useful semantic theory for service composition. Inspiration for this comes from several sources, including existing technologies such as WS-BPEL and WSMO, and the workﬂow patterns research, which defines a diverse collection of control-ﬂow patterns which should be provided by a service composition language. My approach to service composition is based on Abstract Timed Process Calculus. Core to this approach is compositionality – a Web service model must be semantically decomposable to allow component manipulation. An Abstract Timed Process Calculus allows elegant modelling of component systems through a variety of <b>synchronisation</b> <b>patterns</b> such as isochronic broadcast. In this work I will seek to advance this area by constructing a novel timed process calculus which seeks to surpass previous calculi. This calculus will form the underlying meta-model for a semantic theory for a service composition language called Cashew-A.

40|$|Pipelined {{wavefront}} computations are an ubiquitous {{class of}} high performance parallel algorithms {{used for the}} solution of many scientific and engineering applications. In order to aid the design and optimisation of these applications, {{and to ensure that}} during procurement platforms are chosen best suited to these codes, there has been considerable research in analysing and evaluating their operational performance. Wavefront codes exhibit complex computation, communication, <b>synchronisation</b> <b>patterns,</b> and as a result there exist a large variety of such codes and possible optimisations. The problem is compounded by each new generation of high performance computing system, which has often introduced a previously unexplored architectural trait, requiring previous performance models to be rewritten and reevaluated. In this thesis, we address the performance modelling and optimisation of this class of application, as a whole. This differs from previous studies in which bespoke models are applied to specific applications. The analytic performance models are generalised and reusable, and we demonstrate their application to the predictive analysis and optimisation of pipelined wavefront computations running on modern high performance computing systems. The performance model is based on the LogGP parameterisation, and uses a small number of input parameters to specify the particular behaviour of most wavefront codes. The new parameters and model equations capture the key structural and behavioural differences among different wavefront application codes, providing a succinct summary of the operations for each application and insights into alternative wavefront application design. The models are applied to three industry-strength wavefront codes and are validated on several systems including a Cray XT 3 /XT 4 and an InfiniBand commodity cluster. Model predictions show high quantitative accuracy (less than 20 % error) for all high performance configurations and excellent qualitative accuracy. The thesis presents applications, projections and insights for optimisations using the model, which show the utility of reusable analytic models for performance engineering of high performance computing codes. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the model for: (1) evaluating application configuration and resulting performance; (2) evaluating hardware platform issues including platform sizing, configuration; (3) exploring hardware platform design alternatives and system procurement and, (4) considering possible code and algorithmic optimisations.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the FF-LYNX project, {{undertook}} by DII-IET (Pisa) and INFN (Pisa) and relying on a collaboration with CERN (Geneva), and focuses on the development of a high-level SystemC model and simulator of a new communication protocol and interfaces {{to be used in the}} context of High Energy Physics (HEP). The FF-LYNX protocol is meant to provide the diverse and heterogeneous world of HEP experiments with a standard solution to common problems, such as Data Acquisition (DAQ) and Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC). The particle detectors used in HEP experiments generate unwieldy amounts of data following a particle collision (10 TB/s - 1 PB/s). To reduce the amount of data to shift from the detector to the central elaboration system a filter is applied. After a collision the detectors send only a small share of data to the central system. This data is used to ascertain whether the detectors caught interesting events (which are only a few percent of the total). If the results are positive a trigger signal is sent to the detectors to command the acquisition of the interesting events only. This way the data rate becomes manageable. Every HEP laboratory has developed its TTC/DAQ protocol, so no standard solution exists. FF-LYNX aims at defining a standard but flexible approach that could be employed in all the HEP contexts, therefore enabling savings on money, time and efforts. The proposed protocol sits at the data-link layer of the ISO/OSI stack, is serial and synchronous and makes use of Time Division Multiplexing to fit two channels in the same wire. One of these channels carries triggers, frame headers and <b>synchronisation</b> <b>patterns,</b> while the other transports data frames. Triggers undergo a scheduling process to make sure they have fixed and known end-to-end delay (a key requirement in HEP experiments). The high-level simulator has been used to validate the performance of the protocol and to support critical implementation decisions, such as the mechanism for keeping the receiver and transmitter synchronised. A useful set of guidelines have been thus provided for the development of a lower-level VHDL model. The scalable and modular architecture of the simulator will allow it to be reused to control the FPGA emulator that will implement the interfaces at a later project phase...|$|R
40|$|From the introduction]. This paper {{examines}} conceptual {{issues in}} the study of time and European governance. It briefly outlines the main themes {{in the study of}} time, temporality and European governance and then turns to an exploration of various conceptual dimensions that are discussed in the literature on the politics of time, the literature on the sociology of time and research on time in organisations and management. The aim is first of all to run an inventory of usages of time and temporality in the social science literature in order to prepare the ground for the identification of key questions and for the conceptualisation of the temporality of European governance, in particular, the temporality of Enlargement and Europeanisation. 1 The paper suggests that there is relatively little {{research in the area of}} European governance that is genuinely interested in the concept of time and how it matters for European governance. Research that explicitly refers to time tends to use it as a methodological device rather than as a variable that affects political outcomes. Yet, there are only few attempts to conceptualise time as a variable for the study of European governance (an important exception is Ekengren 2002). In many respects, this state of affairs is surprising. The work by Schedler and Santiso (1998), Linz (1998), and Schmitter/Santiso (1998) on democratic politics suggests that issues of time, timing and tempo matter a great deal for the quality of democracy and for political outcomes more generally. Moreover, practitioners seem to be often much more concerned with aspects of temporality than academics, in that they pay particular attention to when things happen, how much time they have, what time horizons prevail, and how aspects of temporality can be intelligently used in the context of their institutions (e. g. Avery 2007, Onestini 2007, Tholoniat 2007). Most of this paper therefore explores how aspects of time and temporality are used in the areas of sociology, organisations and management in order to get inspiration for the study of time and European governance. The discussion here identifies six areas of distinction including the distinction between time as a variable and time as a methodological device; time as an independent and dependent variable; various dimensions of temporality ranging from the analysis of sequences and cycles to the analysis of <b>synchronisation</b> <b>patterns</b> and time boundaries; levels or forms of temporality such as time rules and time discourses; conceptions of time such as clock time and social time; and theoretical approaches to temporality which provide the toolkit for the development of causal mechanisms for the explanation of the origins and consequences of temporal orders and processes in the area of European governance. The discussion concludes that aspects of temporality play a much more prominent role in European governance than hitherto appreciated. There are therefore many grounds to further develop the concept of time and to investigate in more detail the specifics of the time in the context of European governance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Parallel {{computing}} {{is commonly}} used in computational fluid dynamics. For distributed memory machines – currently the most used architecture for large parallel machines – mesh partitioning is utilized to distribute the workload. In iterative codes, the cost of synchronising the partition borders will be the dominant factor in determining the parallel performance. As such, optimal synchronisation is of upmost concern. MPI, the de facto programming model for these machines, traditionally offered multiple ways to implement this synchronisation. However, in practice, inefficiencies in the MPI libraries usually limited portable applications to a single method. Advances in MPI implementations, interconnect networks and processor technology now changed the situation. In this work, we reevaluate boundary <b>synchronisation.</b> The communication <b>pattern</b> arising from the partitioning of different 2 D and 3 D meshes is studied, and used as input {{to a number of}} MPI synchronisation methods, both on distributed memory and on shared memory machines. ...|$|R

Signals were recorded from 275 -channel MEG and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed as the spatial filter. The four-class classification for natural movement intentions was performed offline; Genetic Algorithm based Mahalanobis Linear Distance (GA-MLD) and direct-decision tree classifier (DTC) techniques were adopted for the classification through 10 -fold cross-validation. Through SAM imaging, strong and distinct event related desynchronisation (ERD) associated with sustaining, and event related <b>synchronisation</b> (ERS) <b>patterns</b> associated with ceasing of hand movements were observed in the beta band (15 - 30 Hz). The right and left hand ERD/ERS patterns were observed on the contralateral hemispheres for motor execution and motor imagery sessions. Virtual channels were selected from these cortical areas of high activity to correspond with the motor tasks as per the paradigm of the study. Through a statistical comparison between SAM-filtered virtual channels from single trial MEG signals and basic MEG sensors, it was found that SAM-filtered virtual channels significantly increased the classification accuracy for motor execution (GA-MLD: 96. 51 ± 2. 43 %) as well as motor imagery sessions (GA-MLD: 89. 69 ± 3. 34 %). Thus, multiple movement intentions can be reliably detected from SAM-based spatially-filtered single trial MEG signals. MEG signals associated with natural motor behavior may be utilized for a reliable high-performance brain-computer interface (BCI) and may reduce long-term training compared with conventional BCI methods using rhythm control. This may prove tremendously helpful for patients suffering from various movement disorders to improve their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the evidence for}} the Happisburgh Glaciation—the first Middle Pleistocene glaciation of lowland eastern England and the adjacent margins of the North Sea Basin. We propose that this glaciation occurred during a pre-Elsterian/Anglian (MIS 12) cold stage based on evidence of clasts of till, erratics and heavy minerals from the third youngest terrace of the ‘pre-glacial’ Bytham River in southern Norfolk. The heavy minerals show a progressive increase in glacially sourced materials from the bottom {{to the top of}} the Bytham River third terrace sediments. The till clasts are correlated with the extensive deposits of the Happisburgh Formation on the basis of their colour, heavy minerals and particle size properties. Thus, the Happisburgh Glaciation occurred during the accumulation of the Bytham River terrace deposits and prior to MIS 12, when the Bytham River system was destroyed by the Anglian glaciation. In the absence of any geochronology or robust biostratigraphy, the age of the Happisburgh Glaciation is estimated by the <b>synchronisation</b> of the <b>pattern</b> of large-scale river activity with patterns of Milankovitch-forced global climate change. On this basis, and assuming the British Ice Sheet acted in phase with global patterns of ice volume, the Happisburgh Glaciation is considered to have occurred during MIS 16 and be equivalent of the Don Glaciation of eastern Europe. ...|$|R
40|$|A gonadotrophin, prostaglandin, gonadotrophin + {{progesterone}} (GPG+P 4) programme with fixed-time {{artificial insemination}} (FTAI) {{is the current}} recommended synchronisation programme for both heifers and anoestrous cows on New Zealand dairy farms. However, it is an expensive programme and {{a better understanding of}} the role of all of its components would be very useful in developing alternative cheaper programmes. The two components of the programme that are the least understood, in terms of their underlying physiological actions and how they influence the outcome of synchronisation, are the Day 0 gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) injection and the progesterone device. Additionally it is well known that energy status has a significant impact on fertility but there is little evidence, particularly under New Zealand conditions, of how energy status affects the response to GPG-based treatments in anoestrous postpartum dairy cows. The effects of a GPG (Day 0 : 100 µg GnRH, Day 7 : 500 µg PGF 2 a, Day 9 : 100 µg GnRH) programme upon follicular and luteal dynamics, ovulation <b>synchronisation</b> and <b>patterns</b> of oestradiol and progesterone secretion in postpartum anoestrous dairy cows and nulliparous dairy heifers were compared with (i) a GPG programme plus a progesterone insert from Days 0 – 7 (GPG+P 4) and (ii) a GPG+P 4 programme from which the first GnRH treatment had been omitted (P+G+P 4). Interactions of each treatment with energy balance, as determined by NEFA, IGF-I and insulin concentrations, were also studied in postpartum anoestrus cattle. Finally the conception rate (CR) to fixed time AI of a GPG+P 4 programme in which AI was done concurrent with the Day 9 GnRH injection (Cosynch) was compared with a progesterone + prostaglandin programme (P 4 +PG; Day 0 – 7 : progesterone releasing intravaginal device, morning of Day 6 : 500 µg PGF 2 a, afternoon of Day 9 : FTAI) in heifers. The physiological effects of the GPG and the GPG+P 4 programmes were similar in anoestrous dairy cows. The inclusion of the Day 0 GnRH still appeared feasible in a GPG programme for treating anoestrous cows as it led to a higher probability of a corpus luteum (CL) on Day 7. In addition, treatment response was significantly affected by the postpartum duration and negative energy balance as evidenced by the significantly higher NEFA concentrations on Days 0, 7 and 9, and a lower insulin concentration on Day 0, in cows that failed to ovulate in response to the synchronisation protocol compared with cows that did ovulate. A clear and significant relationship between NEFA concentrations and ovulation in response to all synchronisation protocols showed that, regardless of the regimen that was used to treat anoestrus, the response was moderated and limited by the degree of negative energy balance. In heifers, the removal of the progesterone-releasing device from a GPG+P 4 programme had no effect on follicular dynamics or on the proportion of heifers which ovulated after either the GnRH injection on Day 0 or Day 9. Additionally, unlike the anoestrus cows, omitting the GnRH injection on Day 0 did not result in significantly delayed ovulation at the end of the programme, inasmuch as treatment with P+G+P 4 was associated with earlier ovulation than GPG. Furthermore, synchronising heifers with a significantly less expensive programme (P 4 +PG) resulted in similar CR to synchronising with GPG+P 4 (54. 8 % versus 52. 4 %, respectively) further confirming that Day 0 GnRH was not essential in heifer synchrony. In conclusion, the higher conception rate in cows treated with a GPG+P 4 programme rather than a GPG programme reported previously does not seem to be modulated by the actions on follicular dynamics and improved synchronised ovulation in dairy cattle with postpartum anoestrous (or in nulliparous heifers); however, the treatment response in anoestrous cows can be significantly affected by negative energy balance. In contrast, in dairy heifers, no benefit of Day 0 GnRH or the progesterone device in a GPG+P 4 programme suggests the possibility of more cost effective options (e. g. P 4 +PG) which can lead to a CR as high as those synchronised using a GPG+P 4 programme...|$|R
