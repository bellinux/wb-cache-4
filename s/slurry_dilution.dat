40|$|Biogas {{production}} is a clean {{renewable energy source}} that can improve lives in developing countries. However, winter temperatures in some areas are too low to enable enough biogas production in small unheated digesters to meet the energy requirements of households. Low-cost, high yield reactors adapted to the local climate are needed in those situations. A decision-support model was developed {{to assist in the}} design of biogas reactors capable of meeting households’ year-round energy needs. Monthly biogas production relative to household energy needs was calculated for the scenario of suburban Hanoi, Vietnam. Calculations included pig number, slurry (manure water mixture) dilution, retention time and biogas/solar heating. Although using biogas to heat the digester increased biogas production, it did not lead to an energy surplus, particularly with the 1 : 9 <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> rate commonly used on pig farms. However, at a 1 : 3 <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution,</b> the use of solar heating to provide 90 % and biogas 10 % of the heat required to heat the digester to 35 °C improved the biogas production by 50 % compared to psychrophilic production. The energy needs of an average five-person family throughout the year required 17 fattening pigs. This model can establish the best solution for producing sufficient energy throughout the year...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we present}} a series of country case studies, {{addressing}} specific challenges of reducing ammonia emissions and managing nitrogen on farm and field scale. Section 8. 1 introduces nitrogen management activities in an intensively farmed region of Italy, while Sect. 8. 2 addresses aspects of animal feed in Swiss pig farming. The following Sect. (8. 3) illustrates N management in cattle and poultry operations in Switzerland. The assessment of ammonia abatement cost in dairy farming in the Russian Federation is covered in Sect. 8. 4, with Sect. 8. 5 discussing the costs of adoption of low ammonia emission slurry application methods on grassland in Ireland. A further case study on slurry application addresses the costs incurred by the trailing hose technique and by <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> with water under Swiss frame conditions (Sect. 8. 6). Section 8. 7 highlights the estimated cost of abating volatilized ammonia from urea by urease inhibitors in the EU, and finally Sect. 8. 8 discusses potential N 2 O reduction {{associated with the use}} of urease inhibitors in Spain...|$|E
40|$|A bench-scale {{feasibility}} {{study on the}} use of a Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) process to destroy a slurry laden with tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds has been undertaken. WAO is an aqueous phase process in which soluble and/or insoluble waste constituents are oxidized using oxygen or oxygen in air at elevated temperatures and pressures ranging from 150 C and 1 MPa to 320 C and 22 MPa. The products of the reaction are CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }O, and low molecular weight oxygenated organics (e. g. acetate, oxalate). Test results indicate WAO is a feasible process for destroying TPB, its primary daughter products [triphenylborane (3 PB), diphenylborinic acid (2 PB), and phenylboronic acid (1 PB) ], phenol, and most of the biphenyl byproduct. The required conditions are a temperature of 300 C, a reaction time of 3 hours, 1 : 1 feed <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> with 2 M NaOH solution, the addition of CuSO{sub 4 }. 5 H{sub 2 }O solution (500 mg/L Cu) as catalyst, and the addition of 2000 mL/L of antifoam. However, for the destruction of TPB, its daughter compounds (3 PB, 2 PB, and 1 PB), and phenol without consideration for biphenyl destruction, less severe conditions (280 C and 1 -hour reaction time with similar remaining above conditions) are adequate...|$|E
40|$|When the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is operational, {{processed}} radioactive sludge will {{be transferred}} in batches to the Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME), where glass frit {{will be added}} and the contents concentrated by boiling. Batches of the slurry mixture are transferred from the SME to the Melter Feed Tank (MFT). Hydragard{reg_sign} sampling systems are used on the SME and the MFT for collecting slurry samples in vials for chemical analysis. An accurate replica of the Hydragard sampling system was built and tested in the thermal Fluids Laboratory (TFL) to determine the hydragard accuracy. It was determined that the original Hydragard valve frequently drew a non-representative sample stream through the sample vial that ranged from frit enriched to frit depleted. The Hydragard valve was modified by moving the plunger and its seat backwards so that the outer surface of the plunger was flush with the inside diameter of the transfer line when the valve was open. The slurry flowing through the vial accurately represented {{the composition of the}} slurry in the reservoir for two types of <b>slurries,</b> different <b>dilution</b> factors, a range of transfer flows and a range of vial flows. It was then found that the 15 ml of slurry left in the vial when the Hydragard valve was closed, which is what will be analyzed at DWPF, had a lower ratio of frit to sludge as characterized by the lithium to iron ratio than the slurry flowing through it. The reason for these differences is not understood at this time but it is recommended that additional experimentation be performed with the TFL Hydragard loop to determine the cause...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of our study {{introduces}} a new method for rapidly generating an "improved" Stribeck curve (i. e. Stribeck+ curve) that, compared to traditional Stribeck curves, shows a more complete tribological picture of the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. The method significantly reduces the consumables and time required to obtain the curve compared to traditional means. Results of the Stribeck+ curve are consistent with individual tests using several different consumables combinations. All copper CMP Stribeck+ examples clearly indicate the lubrication mechanism and transitions thereof between different polishing conditions. Variability in COF {{as well as a}} much wider range in U/P are also explored. In the second part of our study, the Stribeck+ curve is successfully applied to silicon dioxide CMP processes to characterize the tribology of such processes under different process conditions and consumables. Results show our Stribeck+ curve methodology to be capable of rapidly determining and differentiating the tribological mechanism among all cases studied. The Stribeck+ curve helps indicate process stability as shown by the spread of the COF vertical clusters. The Stribeck+ curve also confirms a previously known effect that the greater the ratio of pad’s up-features to the total pad area, the greater the probability of wafer hydroplaning. As the third part of our study, we investigate the effect of different pad surface micro-textures on the tribological, thermal and kinetic attributes during copper CMP. Different micro-textures are generated by two different chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond-coated conditioner discs (i. e. Disc A and Disc B). Results show that while pad temperature and removal rate increase with polishing pressure and sliding velocity on both discs, Disc B generates consistently lower removal rates and COF than Disc A. To fundamentally elucidate the cause(s) of such differences, pad surface contact area and topography are analyzed using laser confocal microscopy. The comparison of the pad surface micro-texture analysis indicates that Disc A causes a pad surface with a smaller abruptness (λ) and much more solid contact area which results in a higher removal rate. In contrast, Disc B generates less contact areas and COF. A two-step modified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is employed to simulate copper removal rates as well as chemical and mechanical rate constants. The simulated chemical to mechanical constant ratios indicate that Disc A produces a more mechanically limited process under all conditions tested. In the fourth part of our study, the position of a slurry injection system (SIS) is optimized to achieve a more cost-effective and environmentally benign CMP process using a widely-adopted ceria-based "reverse slurry". Here, SIS is configured with different angles in order to investigate <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> characteristics caused by residual pad rinsing with ultrapure water (UPW) that is known to affect silicon dioxide removal. UPW dilution effect on removal rate, coefficient of friction and pad surface temperature is explained by maintaining a constant dilution ratio for each of the SIS configuration tests. Results indicate that SIS negative rotation angles increase the actual <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> ratio on top of the polishing pad. This generates more Ce 3 + which boosts removal rates. Application of negatively rotated SIS allows significantly lower slurry flow rates and/or shorter polishing times leading to more environmental friendly semiconductor manufacturing processes. Finally, it is confirmed that variations in SIS configuration has no impact on silicon dioxide to silicon nitride removal rate selectivity. In the fifth and final part of our study, the silicon dioxide removal rate using a "reverse" ceria-based slurry is investigated under four different combinations of conditioning modes and slurry application methods. In a “reverse” slurry, addition of water acts to promote material removal. Overall, the process using ex-situ conditioning with the SIS results in the highest removal rate, while the process using in-situ conditioning with the conventional point application (PA) generates the lowest removal rate. This study explains the differences in silicon dioxide removal rate based on the variations of the actual <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> ratio on the pad associated with conditioning and slurry application methods. Frictional analysis and Stribeck+ curves are employed to elucidate the tribological characteristics. Results show that the conditioning modes and the slurry application methods vary the extent of the polishing vibrations. Silicon dioxide removal rate is found to linearly correlate with the extent of COF fluctuation. The work underscores the importance of optimum slurry flow dynamics and injection geometry to obtain a more cost-effective and environmentally benign CMP process...|$|E
40|$|Mesoporous saponites were {{prepared}} at pH 8 and 13 without and with template (surfactant or polymer) at 453 K and autogenic pressure using microwaves or conventional oven during the hydrothermal ageing treatment. Acidity {{was obtained by}} calcination of the NH 4 -form. The effect of dilution (H 2 O/Si molar ratios of 250, 125 and 50) was studied for the samples prepared at pH 8 with surfactant. In order to compare the effect of introducing surfactant during or after saponite synthesis, several samples prepared at pH 13 were modified after synthesis by refluxing or by stirring at room temperature in a surfactant solution. Preparation of samples at pH 13 favoured the ordering in the stacking direction, improved Al T /Al O ratio and led to samples with lower amorphous siliceous material content. The use of microwaves and surfactant for the synthesis at pH 13 afforded a saponite with the highest surface area (603 m 2 /g) and the smallest lamellae crystallite size (about 4 nm). The properties of the samples synthesized at pH 8 with surfactant depended on the dilution. Thus, the degree of delamination, the BET area and the Al T /Al O ratio increased whereas the amorphous siliceous material content decreased at lower <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution.</b> The incorporation of the surfactant by post-synthesis resulted in some degree of delamination especially when using refluxing. However, the degree of delamination was higher for the saponites prepared {{with the addition of}} the surfactant during the hydrothermal synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Turning {{animal manure}} into energy generates a {{leftover}} product: digester bio slurry. Generally this bio slurry is separated in a solid and a liquid fraction. The {{use of the}} liquid fraction bio slurry (LFBS) in combination with residual heat and flu gas from the CHP unit could proof an interesting way to turning LFBS in to valuable biomass locally and thereby reducing the manure processing costs. The goal of the study described here is to assess the application opportunity of LFBS from a cattle manure co-digester in combination with aquatic biomass. In this study different aquatic plant types (submerged, floating and emerged) are used to observe there growth characteristics on different concentrations (1 : 50 an 1 : 100 dilutions) of LFBS. In addition to the aquatic plants soy plants are subjected to the same growth conditions to find out their response to a hydroponic culture using LFBS as sole fertilizer. The used plants (cattail, hornwort, water hyacinth and soy) generally grew well under the selected conditions. Unfortunately hornwort (submerged plant type) was overgrown by duckweed {{on the surface of}} the test setup, this might had led to lower biomass productions. Cattail, hornwort and soy were only tested in outside conditions. Water hyacinth was only tested in greenhouse conditions, first in a small scale setup (12 plastic boxes of 60 x 40 cm) followed by an upscaling step to a race way pond of 175 m 2. While water hyacinth is notorious for its growth potential (potentially invasive in tropical and sub-tropical regions) in this study cattail showed higher specific biomass growth. Maximum projected dry matter biomass yields of 32. 9 and 38. 9 t/ha/year respectively. Soy beans were tested as an alternative to aquatic plants. Beans were directly sown in rockwool, which was used as rooting media floating in the bio <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution.</b> Remarkably the soy plants grew well and even developed beans, the projected yield was comparable to field yield. LFBS proofed to be a suitable nutrient source for the tested plants in an aquatic environment. Especially in countries, such as The Netherlands, where bio slurry and water is abundant, the cultivation of aquatic or terrestrial plants in a LFBS dilution could be an attractive alternative for soil bound agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Soils harbor highly diverse {{bacterial}} communities. It {{is still}} poorly understood whether functional redundancy or {{a multitude of}} ecological niche modify the abundance and community composition of bacteria in soil. Understanding why soil microorganisms are so diverse and which factors control their community composition is of importance because they are essential for maintaining ecosystem processes and functions. Alterations of biotic or abiotic factors as results of natural or anthropogenic disturbances are known to influence soil bacterial diversity. However, the relation of those factors on microbial diversity is not well understood. This work examined effects of several environmental factors, specifically the presence of higher plant species, water content, land use, and soil properties, on bacterial diversity by employing two different soil sources. The reproducibility of bacterial community composition in manipulated soil was analyzed by use of group-specific phylogenetic PCR-DGGE fingerprinting. Soils were taken from lysimeters that had been planted with four different types of plant communities and the water content was adjusted. The composition of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Plancto-mycetes, and Verrucomicrobia populations were clearly different from soils without plants {{compared to that of}} populations in planted soils. In contrast, the composition of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Archaea, and Firmicutes populations did not influenced by the environmental factors tested. No clear influence of plant diversity and water content could be observed. The reproducibility of bacterial composition associated with the absence or presence of plants was true, even for the low-abundance phylotypes as shown by phylotype beta 10 representing up to 0. 18 % of all bacterial cells in planted soils compared to 0. 017 % in those unplanted. A high throughput cultivation approach was performed by employing the MicroDrop and the soil <b>slurry</b> <b>dilution</b> techniques. Soil-solution-equivalent medium (pH 7. 0) supplemented with artificial root exudates, yeast extract, and inducers was utilized. From 217 cultures obtained, isolate byr 23 - 80 showing the same sequence with phylotype beta 10 was recovered and studied in detail as this phylotype displayed a distinct response towards the presence of higher plant species and its sequence affiliated with uncultured bacteria, so far. The strain exhibited high physiological flexibility and was capable of utilizing major constituents of root exudates. A polyphasic taxonomic analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization data supported an assignment of strain byr 23 - 80 as a novel species to the genus Massilia within the family Oxalobacteraceae of the subphylum Betaproteobacteria, for which the name Massilia brevitalea is proposed. Effects of land use and soil properties on the bacterial diversity and activity were determined by employing natural soil from the Kavango region, Namibia. Soil properties in fact controlled the soil respiration rates rather than land use as pristine dark loam soil had remarkably higher respiration rate than pristine sand soil. Exoenzyme activities greatly varied among sites, but did not show a clear correlation to one of the two factors. The quantitative PCR identified Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria as the most abundant phyla about of 30 and 20 % of all Bacteria, respectively. Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes accounted for below 10 %, whereas Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes represented less than 1 %. Clone library of 16 S rRNA genes from pristine dark loam soil revealed a high bacterial diversity with an estimated number of about 5600 phylotypes. The PCR-DGGE fingerprinting of Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria did only show minor differences in composition of the bacterial communities among sampling sites. This study suggests that the bacterial species compositions in soil are determined to a significant extent by abiotic and biotic factors, rather than by mere chance, thereby reflecting a multitude of distinct ecological niches...|$|E
