50|$|Hackers: Due to {{the large}} number of {{accounts}} that have to be created and managed (<b>containing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> such as email, name, address, ewallet, credit card information and often even a copy of the bettor's ID/passport or driver's license), arbitrage traders are highly susceptible to cyber fraud, such as bank account theft. While making deposits is usually made easy and quick, making withdrawals often requires proof of identity in the form of passport/driver license, copies of which need to be shared with the bookmakers via fax/email or even postal mail, which causes additional identity theft risks. Traders are often attracted to high odds comparison sites that yield high percentage profits per stake (5-30%); this is often used by hackers to lure a high number of arbitrage bettors that then place large sums of money on these arb's, only to lose all of the profit and even entire savings in bank accounts to hackers or untrustworthy websites, which may further use the gathered data to sell personal data to criminals.|$|R

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} common {{endocrine}} disorders in women's medicine is the increased androgen and the symptoms of increased androgens in women such as polycystic ovary syndrome. The two main components to diagnose this syndrome are menstrual disorder and clinical or laboratory hyperandrogenism, but other causes should be ruled out in order to confirm the diagnosis. This study aims to examine clinical Hyperandrogenism in female students of 14 to 18 years old in Shiraz in 2010. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 3200 female high school students of 14 - 18 years old in Shiraz. Data collection tools include questionnaires <b>containing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details,</b> clinical Hyperandrogenism features (acne, alopecia and hirsutism based on Freeman-Galway scale) and test results.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aim of this database is to provide an insight into the sociology of the guerrilla movement that fought Napoleon Bonaparte in Spain between 1808 and 1814. Although a phenomenon that is both well known and accorded considerable importance {{in the history of}} the period, the participants in this struggle have never been the subject of detailed study. Many assumptions have been made about them – that the clergy figured disproportionately among their leadership, that many of the rank and file were deserters, etc. – but it has been impossible to test out these ideas. By amassing details of c. 3, 000 of the individuals involved in the struggle, this data base remedies this deficiency, and at the same time allows important conclusions to be drawn about the nature and extent of popular resistance to the French in Napoleonic Spain. Main Topics : This database <b>contains</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> relating to c. 3, 000 participants in the guerrilla war which assailed the French in Spain in the period 1808 - 14. In elaborating the project, the ideal was to build up a complete picture of each individual – age in 1808; place of birth; place of residence; occupation; social class; previous military service; military experience 1808 - 14; history post- 1814, etc. The data from which the database was put together being extremely fragmentary, it has not proved possible to find all the information that would have been desirable, but sufficient material exists in most categories for the data base to be interrogated on a selective basis. <br...|$|R

Originally a Hindu Monarch, he famously {{converted}} to Buddhism and renounced violence soon after being victorious in a gruesome Kalinga War, yet filled with deep remorse for the bloodshed of the war.

We first present a formal definition for Meta Privacy, and then analyze the factors that encompass and influence Meta Privacy. In addition, we recommend some techniques for the protection of Meta Privacy within the information systems.

We analyzed an integrated database that <b>contained</b> clinical and <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> on all 1, 755 patients confirmed to have SARS from 15 February to 22 June 2003. Elementary mapping of disease occurrences in space and time simultaneously revealed the geographic extent of spread throughout the territory. Statistical surfaces created by the kernel method confirmed that SARS cases were highly clustered and identified distinct disease "hot spots. " Contextual analysis of mean and standard deviation of different density classes indicated that the period from day 1 (18 February) through day 16 (6 March) was the prodrome of the epidemic, whereas days 86 (15 May) to 106 (4 June) marked the declining phase of the outbreak. Origin-and-destination plots showed the directional bias and radius of spread of superspreading events. Integration of GIS technology into routine field epidemiologic surveillance can offer a real-time quantitative method for identifying and tracking the geospatial spread of infectious diseases, as our experience with SARS has demonstrated. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In India, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} most common woman-related cancer, killing 1 woman every 8 minutes. Cervical cancer is more common in women who do not have a Pap test regularly. Secondary prevention achieved through Pap smear testing is the single most effective tool in reducing deaths due to {{cervical cancer}}. Scores of women in India fail to carry out this important test till today. In spite of the high incidence of cervical cancer reported from India, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, studies on assessing the knowledge and attitude of this test among women has been scanty. Hence, this study has been undertaken. Objective: The aims of this study are to explore the knowledge of Pap test among women and the association between symptomatology and reasons for availing the Pap test. Methods: The study was performed among 251 women aged between 20 and 65 years. The data was collected through a questionnaire <b>containing</b> their <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> and knowledge of the test. The same was tabulated. Results: The study, conducted over a period of 2 months in a tertiary care urban center, revealed that 80. 1 % of the subjects were not even aware of the term “Cervical Cancer” and a mere 11. 6 % were aware of the lifesaving Pap smear test. 36. 6 % of the subjects experienced one of the cardinal symptoms of cervical cancer while only 2 % approached the doctor to avail the test. The remaining underwent it on recommendation by the doctor. Conclusion: This study will increase awareness of the Pap test and cervical cancer, thereby paving a way for the prevention of cancer of the cervix...|$|R
