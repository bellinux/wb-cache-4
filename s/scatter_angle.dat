The results {{reveal that the}} values of the apparent and effective diffusion coefficients at a <b>scattering</b> <b>angle</b> investigated are consistent and the difference between the effective and Z-average diffusion coefficients {{is a function of the}} mean particle size, size distribution and <b>scattering</b> <b>angle.</b> For the small particles with narrow size distributions, the Z-average diffusion coefficient can be got directly at any <b>scattering</b> <b>angle.</b> For the small particles with wide size distributions, the Z-average diffusion coefficient should be measured at a small <b>scattering</b> <b>angle.</b> For large particles, in order to obtain a good approximate value of Z-average diffusion coefficient, the wider the particle size distribution, the smaller the <b>scattering</b> <b>angle</b> that the DLS data are measured.

40|$|We {{describe}} a technique {{for measuring the}} polarization of hard X‐rays from solar flares based on the angular distribution of {{that portion of the}} flux which is scattered {{off the top of the}} Earth’s atmosphere. The scattering cross section depends not only on the <b>scatter</b> <b>angle</b> itself, but on the orientation of the <b>scatter</b> <b>angle</b> with respect to the incident polarization vector. Consequently, the distribution of the observed albedo flux will depend on the direction and the polarization properties (i. e., the level of polarization and polarization angle) of the source. Since the albedo component can represent a relatively large fraction (up to 40 %) of the direct source flux, there will generally be sufficient signal for making such a measurement. The sensitivity of this approach is therefore dictated by the effective area and the ability of a detector system to ‘image’ the albedo flux. The 4 π coverage of the BATSE detectors on the Compton Gamma‐RayObservatory provides an opportunity to measure both the direct and the albedo flux from a given solar flare event. Although the BATSE design (with its large field‐of‐view for each detector) is not optimized for albedo polarimetry, we have nonetheless investigated the feasibility of this technique using BATSE data...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Light {{scattering}} is {{a widely}} used technique for probing the microarchitecture and interactions of biological materials and solutions. In this paper, we describe {{the use of this}} method in the study of articular cartilage. The experiments presented utilize small-angle static scattering of HeNe laser light (632. 8 nm) from 40 pm thick samples of cartilage taken from the superficial zone of baboon femoral condyle. The specimens were taken from a total of 26 sites in eight animals of various ages. In addition to measuring the dependence of the intensity of scattered light on <b>scatter</b> <b>angle,</b> we performed mechanical testing at the test sites using creep-indentation techniques. The results from the optical and mechanical experiments were compared, and a significant correlation was noted between the average <b>scatter</b> <b>angle</b> and the compressive aggregate modulus. In addition, it was noted that the cartilage of skeletally immature animals had a smaller aggregate modulus and scattered to a higher average angle than the cartilage of skeletally mature animals. A quantitative theory was developed to explain the relation between mechanical and optical properties in terms of the degree of order in the spatial arrangement of the collagen fibers in cartilage. By studying the scattering of light from a material or solution, it is possible to characterize aspects of both its structure and internal interactions. Variation...|$|E

40|$|This work investigates {{complete}} Mueller matrix polarization signatures in scattered light. A {{number of}} samples are studied using Mueller matrix imaging polarimetry, where samples are actively illuminated with a sequence of known polarization states. The capabilities of the Mueller matrix imaging polarimeter for scatter measurements are explored. Measuring polarization properties in scattered light from targets is important in remote sensing because polarization offers additional information unavailable from intensity measurements alone. Polarization helps discriminate surface features or material properties. The Mueller matrix contains detailed polarization and depolarization information possible for scattering objects, and every Mueller element conveys polarization coupling information. Polarization signatures are obtained {{at a number of}} different illumination and scatter angles, and a Mueller matrix bidirectional reflectance distribution function (MBRDF) in one dimension is used to compare various targets. Polarization metrics including diattenuation, retardance, and depolarization obtained from Mueller matrix data images provide methods for comparison, classification, and discrimination of targets. This work examines these reduced polarization parameters and how they vary as a function of scattering geometry, in order to determine which polarization signatures are the best discriminants for remote sensing or metrology. The Mueller matrix bidirectional reflectance distribution function, diattenuation, retardance, and depolarization properties are studied for a diverse group of manmade samples. A group of leaf samples is also studied, to see how natural samples behave and to compare natural and manmade samples. The most prevalent and useful discriminants for scattering samples appear in the depolarization data. Although this is not unexpected, these depolarization properties have not been studied in detail before and are not well described in the literature. Most depolarizing samples investigated showed an inverted Gaussian profile of depolarization magnitude versus <b>scatter</b> <b>angle,</b> with minimum depolarization for specular reflection which increases asymptotically as the <b>scatter</b> <b>angle</b> changes. Other patterns are found in the more noisy diattenuation and retardance data...|$|E
