5|$|In early 1948, Nick Shoemaker, Wiescamp's senior {{stallion}} and Skipper W's sire, {{died in a}} freak accident {{while in}} his paddock, by <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> some ice and breaking his neck against a fence. This meant that Skipper W's show career was cut short so that he could replace his sire as the main breeding stallion. During his entire career, Skipper W never was bred to any mare that was not owned by Wiescamp. Wiescamp {{wanted to make sure that}} the mares that he bred his stallions to were the best possible matches for the particular stallion. From the time of Nick Shoemaker's death until Skipper W's own death, the horse remained Wiescamp's senior stallion.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson family spent Christmas in England, {{before a}} trip to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where Simpson injured himself skiing, {{suffering}} a broken foot and a sprained ankle. He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out {{on the fourth day}} with a cold. His cold worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned Milan–San Remo {{at the foot of the}} Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in Paris–Roubaix after crashing in the lead group. The crash forced him to miss the Tour of Flanders as he struggled to walk on his injured foot. In Liège–Bastogne–Liège he attacked with 's Felice Gimondi, catching an early break. They worked together for , until Gimondi gave up. Simpson rode alone before <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> oil mixed with water; he stayed with the front group, finishing tenth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Viscous Couette flow {{is derived}} for flow between two {{infinitely}} long con-centric rotating cylinders with Navier <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> both. Its axisymmetric linear stability is studied within {{a regime that}} would be hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh’s criterion: opposing gradients of angular velocity and specific angular momentum, based on the rotation rates and radii of the cylinders. Stability conditions are analyzed, by methods based on those of Synge and Chandrasekhar. For sufficiently small <b>slip</b> length <b>on</b> the outer cylinder no instability occurs with arbitrary <b>slip</b> length <b>on</b> the inner cylin-der. As a corollary, <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the inner cylinder is shown to be stabilizing, with no <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the outer cylinder. Two slip configurations are investigated numerically, first with <b>slip</b> only <b>on</b> the outer cylinder, then second with equal <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> both cylinders. It is found that instability does occur (for large outer slip length), and the principle of exchange of stabilities emerges. The instability disappears for sufficiently large slip length in the second case; Rayleigh’s criterion provides an explanation for these phenomena. 1. Introduction. In many areas of scienc...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} US for the Olympics, Kerry was {{threatened}} with {{the cancellation of}} his US visa. Kerry arrived in Moscow facing a four event schedule: he was nominated in both backstroke events and the 4200m freestyle relay and the 4100m medley relay. With the Americans and many other western swimmers absent, Australian officials were confident that their three entrants in the 100m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and Glenn Patching, would all make the final and win medals. Kerry came third in both his heat and semi-final, clocking 58.08s and 58.07s respectively, missing out on the final by just 0.02s. He was the ninth fastest in the closely run semifinals, with the third fastest qualifier being only 0.18s faster. Patching missed the final after <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> the starting wall in his race, while Tonelli went on to finish seventh. Had Kerry matched his personal best of 65.50s, he would have {{won the gold medal}} ahead of Sweden's Bengt Baron.|$|E
5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On the next play, Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> the field and taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On the next play, Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards on the next play. With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time}} in the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the drug controversy, Theodore's play with the Canadiens was marked by a significant drop and he was being outperformed by backup Cristobal Huet. Consequently, he was dealt at the trade deadline to the Colorado Avalanche on March 8, 2006, in exchange for Swiss goaltender David Aebischer. At {{the time of the}} trade, Theodore was on the injured reserve; he strained his Achilles tendon after <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> the winter ice outside his home. He came off the injured reserve with enough time to play in the last five regular season Avalanche games. His 3.04 GAA with the Avalanche combined with his 3.46 rating earned from his previous play with the Canadiens marked the worst GAA of his career. He was nonetheless designated the starting goalie for the playoffs over Peter Budaj, playing in all nine of Colorado's games over the first two rounds before the Avalanche were eliminated 4-0 {{in the second round of}} playoffs by the Anaheim Ducks.|$|E

Sharapova's next tournament was the 2011 Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan. As second seed, she {{received}} a bye into the second round, where she beat Tamarine Tanasugarn. She then beat 13th seed Julia Görges, before retiring against Petra Kvitová in the quarterfinal, 3–4, after <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> the baseline, suffering an ankle injury.

25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Hospital Corps, enlisted medical support in the Navy was limited in scope. In the Continental Navy and the early U.S. Navy, medical assistants were assigned at random out of the ship's company. Their primary duties were to keep the irons hot and buckets of sand at the ready for the operating area. It was commonplace during battle for the surgeons to conduct amputations and irons were used to close lacerations and wounds. Sand was used to keep the surgeon from <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> the bloody ship deck. Previously, corpsmen were commonly referred to as a loblolly boy, a term borrowed from the Royal Navy, and a reference to the daily ration of porridge fed to the sick. The nickname was in common use for so many years that it was finally officially recognized by the Navy Regulations of 1814. In coming decades, the title of the enlisted medical assistant would change several times—from loblolly boy, to nurse (1861), and finally to bayman (1876). A senior enlisted medical rate, surgeon's steward, was introduced in 1841 and remained through the Civil War. Following the war, the title surgeon's steward was abolished in favor of apothecary, a position requiring completion of a course in pharmacy.|$|E
