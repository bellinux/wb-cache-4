5|$|He was <b>sent</b> <b>down,</b> however, on May 1. That began a trend, as he {{was called}} up and send down five more times during the season.|$|E
5|$|Ring {{did most}} of {{his work in the}} non-Test {{first-class}} matches, in which he <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> 3,088deliveries. This was second only to Johnston, who bowled 3,251. In contrast, Lindwall and Miller <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> only 2,105 and 1,749deliveries outside the Tests respectively, as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England. Along with Lindwall, Ring was the equal third highest wicket-taker in first-class matches excluding the Tests, with 59 scalps, doing {{a large part of the}} work in the county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Toshack then bowled Pollard and Bradman caught Young from Johnston's bowling as England were {{dismissed}} for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 after 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl, so the four remaining frontline bowlers <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> {{no less than}} 38 overs each.|$|E

50|$|On June 29, 2010, he was {{purchased}} from Triple-A to replace Joel Zumaya, who {{was placed on}} the 15-day disabled list. He was <b>sent</b> back <b>down</b> to Toledo on June 3. They called him back up on July 20. He was again <b>sent</b> back <b>down</b> to Toledo on July 21. He filed for free agency after the season ended.|$|R

5|$|After bowling 54 overs at Headingley, Johnson was rested as Australia {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an {{innings in}} a match {{that started the}} day after the Fourth Test. He bowled the most overs upon his return in the following match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Johnson <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> 28.4 overs and took 3/58 as the hosts were bowled out for 197; Australia reached 3/215 when the weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|After {{evaluating}} the imagery <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> {{from the late}} inspection, the ground team officially cleared the orbiter's thermal protection system for re-entry. Initially, NASA had planned on releasing Endeavour from its stand-by status following the late inspection, but managers on the ground decided to wait until Atlantis had performed the de-orbit burn before standing down the STS-400 rescue mission officially.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 CBS <b>sent</b> <b>Downs</b> to Berlin {{cover the}} {{blockade}} and subsequent airlift, as {{they wanted a}} reporter with war experience. He stayed there until 1950. He delivered a Christmas broadcast from the cockpit of a Candy Bomber aircraft piloted by Gail Halvorsen as part of Operation Little Vittles. In 1950, he received the Overseas Press Club award {{for his work in}} Berlin.|$|R

5|$|During the 2015–16 season, on January 12, 2016, Higgins {{was put on}} waivers after {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} trade the winger. He cleared waivers {{the next day and}} was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> to the Utica Comets, the AHL affiliate of the Canucks. On March 19, 2016, Higgins was recalled by the Vancouver Canucks after multiple injuries occurred on both the Canucks and Comets rosters. He would finish the season with the Canucks.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was signed}} by the St. Louis Cardinals on January 6, 2003, but was {{released}} on March 26, 2003 after struggling in spring training. Hamilton then re-signed with the Cincinnati Reds on April 11, 2003. After posting a 12.66 ERA in three starts with the Reds, he was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> to Louisville. He made 33 appearances for the Bats with an 83 record and a 3.23 ERA in 86 innings. On October 15, 2003, he became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Most of the equipment, arms, and {{machinery}} at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to {{east of the}} Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862, and accountability for it is lost at that point. By all appearances, the equipment was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, {{and from there to}} Jackson Mississippi, where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{reaching}} his century during the afternoon, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Compton {{went on to}} make 184 and England were eventually out for 441 on the final day. Johnson <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> 42 overs for a return of 1/66. He had the best economy rate of 1.57 runs per over, ahead of Toshack's 1.81; Bradman used both in a defensive manner. This left Australia a target of 98, which they reached with eight wickets to spare.|$|E
5|$|The German {{submarines}} in the Black Sea accomplished little, sinking {{only six}} ships between August {{and the end}} of the year. UB-46 sank one of the six ships when she <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> the 116-ton Russian ship Melanie north of Cape Tarkhan on 7 November. Melanie was the last ship sunk by UB-46. By early December, UB-46 was based out of Varna, Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{decided to}} transfer Sitting Bull {{and his band}} to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota) on the southern border of the state. There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.|$|E

5|$|UB-4 {{departed}} on {{the first}} patrol from Flanders on 9 April, and was responsible for sinking the first ship <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> by the flotilla. The Type UBI boats of the Flanders Flotilla originally patrolled the area between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, but began patrolling the English Channel after UB-6 pioneered a route past British antisubmarine nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June.|$|E
5|$|As he is {{affected}} less by the distortions, Data is <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering Manheim's laboratory. He finds {{a column of}} energy emanating from a dimensional matrix, {{the source of the}} time distortions. Data, though briefly affected by the time distortions, is able to add anti-matter to the matrix, causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions. Dr. Manheim fully recovers, and he and Jenice thank Picard and the crew for their help. Picard and Jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at a Paris café, before she returns with her husband to the planet.|$|E
5|$|Before {{he could}} appear in any games with Colorado Springs, López was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 14. Due to major league rules, Arizona {{was unable to}} call him up until April 24. He had another poor season, having a record of 1–1 and an 11.02 ERA, {{the highest in the}} majors among {{relievers}} who made at least 30 appearances. On July 5, López was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Armando Almanza. He cleared waivers and was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> to the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League {{for the rest of the}} season. He went 0–1 with a 2.22 ERA. On October 15, he was granted free agency.|$|E
50|$|Neal was {{designated}} for assignment by the Indians on January 3, 2013 {{to make room}} for Nick Swisher on their roster. He was released by the Indians on January 12, 2013. The New York Yankees signed him to a minor-league contract later that month. The Yankees promoted Neal to the major leagues on June 14. He was <b>sent</b> back <b>down</b> to Triple-A on June 22. He was recalled again on July 20, <b>sent</b> back <b>down</b> on July 26, and designated for assignment August 2.|$|R

5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} {{that he was not}} on the major league club because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; he felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to the length of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton before he was run out. Soon after, Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Toshack then bowled Pollard and Young was caught from Johnston's bowling as England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl and the remaining four frontline bowlers <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> at least 38 overs each.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was <b>sent</b> <b>down</b> to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E
