50|$|Compared to a <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor,</b> {{the rotor}} of the {{slip ring motor}} has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, and the current lower, than for a <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor.</b> During the {{start-up}} a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher starting torque.|$|E
50|$|If a {{conventional}} <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor</b> has flats ground {{on it to}} create salient poles and increase reluctance, it will start conventionally, but will run synchronously, although it can provide only a modest torque at synchronous speed. This {{is known as a}} reluctance motor.|$|E
50|$|Induction (asynchronous) motor, {{the rotor}} {{magnetic}} field {{is created by}} an induced current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator magnetic field to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction motor rotors, which are <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor,</b> wound rotor and solid core rotor.|$|E

50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor.</b> As well, when close to operating speed, better motors lifted the brushes out of contact.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor</b> is the {{rotating}} {{part of the}} common [...] "squirrel cage" [...] induction motor. It consists of a cylinder of steel laminations, with aluminum or copper conductors embedded in its surface. In operation, the non-rotating [...] "stator" [...] winding is connected to an alternating current power source; the alternating current in the stator produces a rotating magnetic field. The rotor winding has current induced in it by the stator field, and produces its own magnetic field. The interaction of the two sources of magnetic field produce torque on the rotor.|$|E
5000|$|The General Electric Company (GE) began {{developing}} three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse {{signed a}} cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor.</b> [...] Arthur E. Kennelly {{was the first}} to bring out the full significance of complex numbers (using j to represent the square root of minus one) to designate the 90º rotation operator in analysis of AC problems. [...] GE's Charles Proteus Steinmetz greatly developed application of AC complex quantities including an analysis model now commonly known as the induction motor Steinmetz equivalent circuit.|$|E
50|$|Boucherot was {{interested}} in using polyphase supplies to power asynchronous motors as early as 1894. The <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor</b> asynchronous motor was invented by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889 and they were being built industrially from 1891. A problem with asynchronous machines {{is that they are}} difficult to start. The coupling to the rotor is weak until it gets moving and the current drawn by the motor is high. Boucherot solved this problem with his discovery of the double cage asynchronous motor in 1912. In fact, Dolivo-Dobrovolsky had already invented the double cage all the way back in 1893 but it was long since forgotten.|$|E
5000|$|Most common AC motors use the <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor,</b> {{which will}} be found in {{virtually}} all domestic and light industrial alternating current motors. The squirrel-cage refers to the rotating exercise cage for pet animals. The motor {{takes its name from}} the shape of its rotor [...] "windings"- a ring {{at either end of the}} rotor, with bars connecting the rings running the length of the rotor. It is typically cast aluminum or copper poured between the iron laminates of the rotor, and usually only the end rings will be visible. The vast majority of the rotor currents will flow through the bars rather than the higher-resistance and usually varnished laminates. Very low voltages at very high currents are typical in the bars and end rings; high efficiency motors will often use cast copper to reduce the resistance in the rotor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor</b> {{consists}} of laminated steel {{in the core}} with evenly spaced bars of copper or aluminum placed axially around the periphery, permanently shorted at the ends by the end rings. This simple and rugged construction makes it the favorite for most applications. The assembly has a twist: the bars are slanted, or skewed, to reduce magnetic hum and slot harmonics and to reduce the tendency of locking. Housed in the stator, the rotor and stator teeth can lock {{when they are in}} equal number and the magnets position themselves equally apart, opposing rotation in both directions. Bearings at each end mount the rotor in its housing, with one end of the shaft protruding to allow the attachment of the load. In some motors, there is an extension at the non-driving end for speed sensors or other electronic controls. The generated torque forces motion through the rotor to the load.|$|E
5000|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, Haydon then built several models of miniaturized induction motors {{in his own}} workshop. In so doing, he quickly learned {{that he was not}} going to find the solution to the problem by using a normal <b>Squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor.</b> He failed a few times, but his failures finally led to the realization that the performance characteristics he was seeking might be obtained by using permanent magnet steel for the rotor instead of the original squirrel cage induction type rotor. He built many models and finally accomplished the desired operating characteristics. This motor design is covered by Patent No. 1,935,208 [...] and related patents.This motor was capable of oscillating continuously when connected to a hair spring. It would also run synchronously in one direction without the hair spring. This made it usable either independent of, or dependent on, the frequency of current supplied by the local utility company.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} founded on 1 November 1919 as Pelger in Rotterdam in the Netherlands by Mr. Willem D. Pelger, with a funding capital of 40 Dutch guilders The company {{started at the}} Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current electric motor repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, {{as a result of}} the direct current power supply instead of alternating current supply in these early days of electric grid. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a centrifugal fan, brake motors and small induction motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam. Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and mechanical engineer of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. patents were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the centrifugal switch, the centrifugal fan housing and the principle of a <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor.</b> The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a factory designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to study the}} operation of three-phase asynchronous motor with <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>rotor</b> when the stator winding is powered from a single phase network. To create a rotating magnetic field one of the phases is fed through the capacitor. Due to the asymmetry of power feed not only transients, but the steady-state regimes are dynamic, so they are described by differential equations in any coordinate system. Their study cannot be carried out with sufficient adequacy {{on the basis of}} known equivalent circuits and require the use of dynamic parameters. In the {{mathematical model}} the state equations of the circuits of the stator and rotor are composed in the stationary three phase coordinate system. Calculation of the established mode is performed by solving the boundary problem that makes it possible to obtain the coordinate dependences over the period, without calculation of the transient process. In order to perform it, the original nonlinear differential equations are algebraized by approximating the variables with the use of cubic splines. The resulting nonlinear system of algebraic equations is a discrete analogue of the initial system of differential equations. It is solved by parameter continuation method. To calculate the static characteristics as a function of a certain variable, the system is analytically differentiated, and then numerically integrated over this variable. In the process of integration, Newton's refinement is performed at each step or at every few steps, making it possible to implement the integration in just a few steps using Euler's method.
