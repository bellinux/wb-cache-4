The investigation of individual effect of each type of substitutions when replacing each type of amino acids in BSLA WT showed that improved variants were obtainable by substitution with all four types of amino acids: charged (32 – 39 %), polar (30 – 34 %), aliphatic (15 – 28 %), and aromatic (11 – 19 %).

40|$|International audienceIn the {{particular}} context of cultural heritage, protective glazing {{has been the}} subject of only few studies [1 - 2]. In addition to the monitoring of temperature, humidity and light in museums, the conditions of conservation for the preservation of cultural heritage, needs the development of a low cost glass with specific properties. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is one of the most widely used compounds in the manufacture of organic glasses. Indeed it has a refractive index (n = 1. 491) close to that of glass (n = 1. 522), it has a better light transmission and is much lighter and less brittle than glass. Therefore it has been widely applied in conservation for the glassing of artifacts and especially during travelling exhibitions. PMMA is also still used by many artists to produce artworks such as Diasec© (a popular face mounting techniques for photographs), 3 D objects and design furnitures. Unfortunately PMMA is very sensitive to abrasion and after a few years this might alter the visual appearance of the artifact. This work shows the possibility to enhance anti-scratch and <b>solvents</b> <b>resistance</b> of PMMA based glass by combining it with polycarbonate (PCR 39 ®) inside Interpenetrating Polymer Network (IPN) architecture. Our specifications require a transparent final material and a preparation without solvent in order to address specific issue of the cultural heritage preservation community.

According to the chosen free-radical initiators, the PMMA network is formed in the first place followed by the synthesis of PCR 39 ® network. Rigid transparent (transmission higher than 95 %) materials are obtained. Thermomechanical analyses indicate a correct interpenetration of both networks.

The fracture and mechanical properties of an epoxy resin system have been investigated {{as a function of}} changes in stoichiometry and heat treatment. Relationships between the various macroscopically measured properties and the microscopic characteristics of the cured resin are described. The investigation shows that the concept of fracture surface work, Ƴ, measured by a cleavage technique, is a sensitive parameter for monitoring changes in the resin's fracture properties and that the Irwin-Kies and Berry analyses can provide a more sensitive monitor of Ƴ than the Gurney method, in some circumstances. The investigation also demonstrates how the elastic and visco-elastic properties of the resin can effect plasticisation at the tip of a crack, with consequent improvement in fracture toughness. To aid the interpretation of the mechanical data, a morphological characterisation of the cured resin will be described in which quantitative infrared spectroscopy, thermo-mechanical analysis, <b>solvent.</b> uptake <b>resistance,</b> chemical and ion-beam etching methods have been used...|$|R
