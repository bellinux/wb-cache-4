2500|$|The Innocence + Experience Tour {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound, reviewing a Los Angeles show, said, [...] "U2 {{was every bit}} the brash, boisterous, larger-than-life rock stars fans would expect, or even hope for". He complimented the show for feeling intimate and said that performances of the new songs [...] "argued that perhaps the most recent U2 output was given an unfair shake from critics more interested in attacking the new album's release method than the actual songs". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune praised the show, writing, [...] "Visuals, sound and sequencing synced up to tell a story, {{but it was a}} story built on emotionally involving songs presented with a minimum of fuss." [...] Kot, who was critical of Songs of Innocence, thought the album's songs were redeemed by their live performances, saying, [...] "it's tempting to ask for a do-over of [...] latest album... after witnessing this show. Despite the album's flat, <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the Irish quartet made its latest material the centerpiece of its current tour." [...] Jim DeRogatis of WBEZ wrote, [...] "U2 has got its mojo back." [...] Despite doubts about U2 after their previous tour and the release of Songs of Innocence, the band's opening four songs of a Chicago show [...] "convinced [...] that U2 is as ferocious, focused, and no-nonsense committed as it's ever been". Like Kot, DeRogatis agreed that [...] "the new songs were much harder-hitting and far more emotional than in the bland, over-produced versions on record".|$|E

50|$|Burnout (also burning rubber) {{is where}} a vehicle applies {{sufficient}} torque to the wheels during acceleration to cause the tire to skid while rotating. The dynamic friction of the spinning tire against the road causes significant amounts of the tire's rubber surface to be deposited onto the road surface, and increased temperature from friction can also create smoke. Unlike accidental skids in steering or braking on <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces,</b> drivers generally cause a burnout on purpose as a showy display of horsepower but it has no practical use.|$|E

50|$|In addition, tri wetsuits {{have a very}} smooth, {{but often}} fragile, <b>surface.</b> This <b>slick</b> <b>surface</b> helps to reduce water {{friction}} and allow a faster swim, {{but it would be}} easily destroyed by contact with a sandy surfboard. Another advantage of a wetsuit is the added buoyancy. It provides triathletes with a considerable advantage.|$|R
5000|$|Nylon. A popular material, it has {{a smooth}} and <b>slick</b> <b>surface,</b> so most {{manufacturers}} add a high-friction coating to nylon picks to make them easier to grip. Nylon is flexible and can be produced in very thin sheets. Most thin and extra-thin picks are made out of nylon. However, nylon loses its flexibility after 1-2 months of extensive use, becomes fragile and breaks.|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} braking on {{handling}} {{is complicated by}} load transfer, which {{is proportional to the}} (negative) acceleration times the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. The difficulty is that the acceleration at the limit of adhesion depends on the road surface, so with the same ratio of front to back braking force, a car will understeer under braking on <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces</b> and oversteer under hard braking on solid surfaces. Most modern cars combat this by varying the distribution of braking in some way. This is important with a high center of gravity, but it is also done on low center of gravity cars, from which a higher level of performance is expected.|$|E

5000|$|As Eddie Brock explained, the Carnage {{symbiote}} {{was born}} with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor—due {{to the fact that}} it gestated in an environment alien to it—Earth. The alien symbiote endows Cletus Kasady with enhanced physical strength greater than that of Spider-Man and Venom combined and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote tendril. Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to [...] "see" [...] in any direction, warning him of incoming threats. He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The Carnage symbiote has similar abilities of that of Spider-Man's as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.|$|E

Cambellotti found much to admire in the theories of [...] "rational beauty" [...] advocated by Henry van de Velde, {{one of the founders of}} Art Nouveau in Belgium, but at the same time the Italian artist remained loyal to agrarian motifs, and to a non-anthropotechnic, undisrupted relationship with natural forms. The most frequent motif in his works is an ear of corn. He is classed along with Vittorio Grassi (1878-1958) as a leading proponent of the Scuola Romana (as a branch of Art Nouveau), and he steadfastly celebrated the [...] "heroic atmosphere" [...] of the peasant culture over the decadence of cities.

50|$|A {{cardboard}} {{record was}} {{a type of}} cheaply made phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard. These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, <b>slick</b> <b>surface,</b> and tendency to warp like a taco shell. Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the spindle hole to add weight and stability.

5000|$|Midnight Club: Los Angeles {{is set in}} {{the city}} of Los Angeles, again {{providing}} an option to completely free-roam (in an open world environment larger than all the three cities combined from the previous game, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition). New additions are a 24-hour day-to-night cycle, weather effects and traffic with licensed vehicles, adding a realistic aspect to the game. The new dynamic weather system has been reported to alter the gameplay experience, making the vehicle more prone to sliding on <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces.</b> If any damage is inflicted upon a vehicle after races, the player does not necessarily need to drive back to a garage for a full repair, but, instead, can choose the [...] "Quick Fix" [...] option through which old, junkyard-esque parts will be added to the car. To get back that [...] "nice, new car look", the player must actually drive back to repair their vehicle at a garage or gas station. This also means that totaling a vehicle is only possible within a single race or event. With the RAGE system being used for this game, traffic levels fluctuate throughout the day, with light traffic at night, heavy traffic in the morning and afternoon, and heaviest traffic in the evenings. Motorcycles are again part of the game, including the Ducati 999R and the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14. Convertible cars, customizable interiors, in-game photo mode, and customizable exotics are all new additions. Developers placed great emphasis on the elimination of load screens, stating that the player could literally jump from career mode to an online race in under ten seconds.|$|E
40|$|Poor {{traction}} on <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{is difficult}} for dogs with neurologic deficits, osteoarthritis, or recovering from injury or surgery. Many dogs respond inappropriately to <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces</b> by decreasing digital pad-floor contact and extending their toenails. A device marketed to increase paw-floor friction in dogs was evaluated. Fifteen normal dogs underwent kinetic gait analysis before and after application of Dr. Buzby’s ToeGrips®. Ground reaction forces, including vertical peak force (VPF) and impulse for each limb, were measured and compared between pre- and post-application values. Stance time was significantly increased in all limbs after toe grip application. Stride velocity was slower in all limbs but significantly slower only in the left forelimb. VPF was significantly deceased in both hindlimbs after toe grip application, but the decrease was within the group SDs. Vertical impulse was significantly increased in both forelimbs and in the right hindlimb. Dr. Buzby’s ToeGrips® result in a slower gait, with slightly decreased VPF in the hindlimbs and increased effort for propulsion kinetic changes were of minor magnitude and unlikely to be clinically relevant...|$|E
40|$|Se comparó la abundancia de zooplancton {{superficial}}, temperatura superficial del mar e intensidad del viento entre zonas lisas y rugosas en el sector sur de la bahía de Coquimbo, entre el 7 y 9 de noviembre de 2001. La presencia de superficies lisas y rugosas estuvo influenciada por la intensidad del viento y desaparece cuando supera 6 m s- 1 en forma sostenida. La temperatura en los dos primeros días de muestreo fue diferente entre los dos tipos de superficie. El último día la temperatura fue mayor, sin diferencias entre ambos tipos de superficies y con mayor profundidad de la capa de mezcla, debido al aumento de la intensidad del viento. En los dos primeros días, la mayoría de los grupos zooplanctónicos tuvieron abundancias mayores en las superficies lisas, observándose diferencias significativas entre zonas lisas y rugosas en las larvas cypris de cirripedios y en el eufáusido Nyctiphanes simplex. Se estableció que los zooplancteres capturados, tienden a agregarse en superficies lisas o rugosas, dependiendo de sus características adaptativas y de su comportamiento. The surface zooplankton abundances, {{sea surface}} temperature and wind speed in slick and rough surface areas were compared south of Coquimbo Bay on November 7, 8 and 9, 2001. The presence of rough and <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{on the bay}} {{was influenced by the}} wind conditions during sampling hours, demonstrating that increasing the speed steadily over 6 m s- 1 slick and rough areas disappeared, giving a ripple appearance to sea surface. On the first two days of study, thermal structure of slicks areas was different from the rough ones. On the last day, temperature was higher with no differences between both surfaces types, and greater depth of the mixed layer, due to increasing wind speed. The organisms captured were holoplanktonic crustaceans, meroplankton benthopelagic peracarids, fish larvae and eggs, gelatinous zooplankton and gastropod and bivalve mollusks. On the first two days of study, most of zooplanktonic groups had greater abundance in <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces,</b> with significant differences between slick and rough areas in the case of barnacle cypris larvae and the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex. It was concluded that surface zooplankton caught in Coquimbo Bay, tend to aggregate in rough or <b>slick</b> <b>surfaces,</b> depending on their adaptive characteristics and behaviour...|$|E
