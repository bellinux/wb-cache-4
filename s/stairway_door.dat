Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses.

40|$|It was 1989 and I {{was giving}} a talk to local federal {{agencies}} on the newly-released HAZARD I software and its promise for performance-based design for fire safety. After the talk several attendees came up to talk to me, including a gentleman in an electric wheelchair. He {{told me that he}} worked on the 10 th floor of a nearby, high-rise office building and that when he first came to work there the safety officer did not really {{know what to do with}} him. He was instructed that in case of a fire evacuation, he was to go to the stairway. If there was someone there to open the door (he was quadriplegic and could not grip nor turn the knob) he should proceed onto the top landing. Otherwise he should wait at the <b>stairway</b> <b>door</b> for assistance. He told me that it was clear to him that they wanted to know where to go to collect the body. It was just the next year, 1990, when the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed to provide equal access to public buildings for all Americans. The objective of the ADA regulations was to permit people with disabilities access to the places where we live, work, and play with little thought of how they would get out in case of emergency. Fifteen years later we are still addressing this important issue...|$|E

50|$|In 1933 the Lighthouse Service {{decommissioned}} the Colchester Reef Lighthouse {{after the}} automatic electric beacon made the hand-operated system obsolete. Over {{the years the}} light suffered damage from ice floes and gradually fell into disrepair. Nineteen years later, in 1952, it was put up for auction and sold to Mr. & Mrs. Paul and Lorraine Bessette of Winooski, VT. for $50, to be dismantled for timber to construct a home. After this sale, Vermont historian Ralph Nading Hill ferried Electra Webb to the now-derelict lighthouse. Entranced, she persuaded the Bessettes to sell it for $1300 and substitute building materials. Webb purchased the lighthouse and had it moved to the museum grounds in the fall. Undaunted by the hazards involved, her veteran crew catalogued each piece of the building before moving the heavy beams, <b>stairways,</b> <b>doors,</b> and windows to reconstruct the building on museum grounds.|$|R

5000|$|In 1930, Mark Raymond Harrington, {{curator of}} the Southwest Museum, {{purchased}} the abandoned property from the heirs of the Lopez family. He restored the adobe after acquiring it. He later wrote: [...] When I took over the Romulo Pico house about 1930 the walls were still standing, but the roof, <b>stairway,</b> <b>doors,</b> windows, {{and many of the}} window and door frames were missing; also most of the cross beams and most of the floor. I did not 'rebuild' the walls, but I did replace three or four layers of adobe blocks around the top of the walls, the originals having been damaged by the weather. I put in new timbers, new floors, and a new staircase. I regard the main building as having been built in the Mission period - probably early 1830s, the wings possibly added by the Picos. ... The only changes I made were to build an addition to the north wing of the house; put a fireplace in the living room (only the dining room had one originally), rebuild the patio walls and build a garage.|$|R

40|$|This paper realizes {{automatically}} the navigating elements {{defined by}} indoorGML data standard – <b>door,</b> <b>stairway</b> and wall. The data used is indoor 3 D point cloud collected by Kinect v 2 launched in 2011 through {{the means of}} ORB-SLAM. By contrast, it is cheaper and more convenient than lidar, but the point clouds also have the problem of noise, registration error and large data volume. Hence, we adopt a shape descriptor – histogram of distances between two randomly chosen points, proposed by Osada and merges with other descriptor – in conjunction with random forest classifier to recognize the navigation elements (<b>door,</b> <b>stairway</b> and wall) from Kinect point clouds. This research acquires navigation elements and their 3 -d location information from each single data frame through segmentation of point clouds, boundary extraction, feature calculation and classification. Finally, this paper utilizes the acquired navigation elements and their information to generate the state data of the indoor navigation module automatically. The experimental results demonstrate a high recognition accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|The {{ruins of}} the city are {{generally}} conceded {{to be the most}} spectacular surviving example of an entire ancient Greek city intact except for the ravages of time.

The public area is laid out in a grid pattern up the steep slopes, drained by a system of channels. The water distribution and sewer systems survive. Foundations, paved streets, <b>stairways,</b> partial <b>door</b> frames, monuments, walls, terraces can be seen everywhere among toppled columns and blocks. No wood has survived. The city extends upward to the base of an escarpment projecting from Mycale. A narrow path leads to the acropolis above.|$|R

50|$|The {{owners and}} {{builders}} {{in the early}} days of Tower Grove East were for the most part siblings, cousins and extended family members of the prominent German Americans living in Compton Heights. Thus architectural trends originating in Compton Heights and Flora Place influenced the designs of homes on South Compton, Shenandoah and several of the other residential avenues. Like Tower Grove Heights, these residences were built on the four-square plan. The typical house is a pyramid or hipped roof on a two-story cube. Often, a pressed brick or limestone course separates the stories. The original developers then varied the theme through detail choices. Attention was heavily focused on the entry, cornice and windows. Buyers would often choose the architectural elements from pattern books that illustrated multiple styles of windows, <b>doors,</b> <b>stairways</b> and fireplace mantels. Thus the interiors of the homes in Tower Grove East are full of surprises. The often austere exterior facades typically hide a wealth of richly designed entries with carved fretwork; built-in hall benches, mirrors and bookcases; wood paneling; stained-glass windows and elaborate staircases.|$|R
60|$|The {{hall was}} round, painted white and dimly lit by an {{overhead}} electric globe. In the centre {{was a huge}} green vase filled with great branches {{of some sort of}} blossoms. Not a picture hung upon the walls, nor was there any hall stand, chest, closet for coats or hats, or any of the usual furbishings of such a place. There were three rugs upon the polished floor and nothing else except a yawning <b>stairway</b> and closed <b>doors.</b> Whatever servants might be in attendance were evidently in a distant part of the building. Not a sound was to be heard. Still without any lack of courage, but oppressed with that curious sense of unreality, she turned almost automatically towards the door on the left and opened it. Again it closed behind her noiselessly. She realised that she was in one of the principal reception rooms of the house, dimly lit as the hall from a dome-shaped globe set into the ceiling. She moved a yard or two across the threshold and stood looking about her. Here again there was an almost singular absence of furniture. The walls were hung with apple-green silk, richly embroidered. There were some rugs upon the polished floor, a few quaintly carved chairs set with their backs against the wall, and opposite to her the ebony cabinet of which La Belle Nita had spoken. She moved towards it. Somehow or other, she found herself with the other key in her hand, stooping down. She counted the drawers--one, two three--fitted in the key, turned it, and realised with a little start the presence in the drawer of a roll of parchment, tied around with tape and sealed with a black seal. She laid her hand upon it, but even at that moment she felt a shiver pass through her body. There had been no sound in the room, which she could have sworn had been empty when she entered it, yet she had now a conviction that she was not alone. She turned slowly around, her lips parted, breathing quickly. Standing {{in the middle of the}} room, a grim, commanding figure in his flowing green robes, the dim light flashing upon the great diamonds in his belt, stood Prince Shan.|$|R
