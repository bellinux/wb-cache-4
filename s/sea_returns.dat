50|$|Its heroine, Jeannie, is to {{be married}} off {{at the insistence of}} her father to a wealthy man, Lord Saltoun, but she is in love with Annachie Gordon, the subject of the song. The song chronicles her {{resistance}} to the marriage before she is eventually dragged to the church. Jeannie refuses to sleep in the same bed until her father comes down and tells her maid to undo her gown. Jeannie collapses at her father's feet and dies for love of Annachie. Annachie, having been away at <b>sea,</b> <b>returns</b> where Jeannie's distressed maidens tell him that Jeannie has been married in his absence and has now died of a broken heart. Annachie tells the maidens {{to take him to the}} chamber where Jeannie lies and then, having kissed her cold lips, also dies of a broken heart.|$|E

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{have been adopted}} to construct altimeter wind algorithms: one {{is based on the}} mean-square sea surface slope, and the other is based on the Seasat scatterometer wind. Both types of algorithms are critically reviewed with respect to the mechanism governing near-nadir <b>sea</b> <b>returns</b> and the comparison between altimeter and buoy winds. A new algorithm is proposed; it is deduced on the basis of microwave specular reflection and is finely tuned with buoy-measured winds. On the basis of this algorithm and the formula of the wind-stress coefficient, a simple wind-stress algorithm is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|Sea {{electrodes}} {{have been}} used since the first HVDC subsea links were installed in the 1950 s and provide a simple proven solution for the return current path. Today around 30 % of the approximately 40 HVDC subsea links in service use sea electrodes as the return current path under normal or emergency operation conditions. This paper reviews the evolution of interconnectors with sea electrodes and the factors, such as location, environmental impact, current capacity and financial factors (cost, flexibility, losses) which need to be assessed before adopting a sea electrode. In particular findings from environmental studies undertaken on existing sea electrodes are reviewed, as well as, the detailed content of recent Environmental Impact Statements for HVDC projects with proposed <b>sea</b> <b>returns.</b> Finally, the reasons {{for a change in}} design on links with a proposed sea return to a metallic return are also considered...|$|E
40|$|Ocean surface {{roughness}} and wave breaking {{are the two}} main contributors of radar backscattering from the ocean surface. The relative weightings of the two contributions vary with the microwave polarization: the VV (vertical transmit vertical receive) {{is dominated by the}} Bragg resonance scattering mechanism, and the HH (horizontal transmit horizontal receive) and VH (horizontal transmit vertical receive or vertical transmit horizontal receive) contain nontrivial non-Bragg contributions mainly produced by breaking features. A method is developed to obtain the short-scale properties of ocean {{surface roughness}} and wave breaking from Ku, C, and L band polarimetric <b>sea</b> <b>returns.</b> The results are used for quantitative evaluation of the ocean surface roughness spectral models and for deriving understanding of the breaking contribution important to microwave ocean remote sensing, in particular its dependence on wind speed, microwave frequency, and incidence angle. Implications of the results to air-sea interaction applications are discussed. Geoscience & Remote SensingCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} five years, much {{progress}} has been made in the understanding of sky-wave backscatter. An explanation of the various interacting phenomena is presented, as is a review of the current state of knowledge reflecting recent advances in observational methods and analytic techniques. New narrow-beam antennas, coupled with signal modulations that permit fine resolution in time delay, are beginning to yield information concerning the character of the scatterers, which now can be separately discerned. These narrow beams also permit study of polarization fading from small regions, and this shows promise as a means for learning the distant sea state. Doppler shifts of a fraction of a hertz on signals of tens of megahertz are separable, permitting isolation of <b>sea</b> <b>returns</b> from ground returns by virtue of the Doppler effect resulting from sea-wave speed; this also suggests a potential sea-monitoring principle. Despite these advances, there is little practical application of sky-wave backscatter as a means of environmental monitoring. This lack is attributed to the large remaining gaps in our understanding of the echoes and our inability to interpret the forms of data that can be acquired with equipment of reasonable cost...|$|E
