In contrast, only two cases of false negatives were found on frozen <b>section</b> (<b>sensitivity,</b> 88. 2 %).

The corresponding sensitivity factors are quantified by changing cross sections in a given amount and determining the variation in the dose. The influence of total cross sections for all particles, photons and only for Compton scattering is addressed. The PENELOPE code was used in all simulations. It was found that photon cross <b>section</b> <b>sensitivity</b> factors depend on depth. In addition, they are positive and negative for depths below and above an equilibrium depth, respectively. At this depth, sensitivity factors are null. The equilibrium depths found in this work agree very well with the mean free path of the corresponding incident photon energy.

40|$|Capacity {{definition}} recognises {{that only}} traverse point or uniform section of roadway capacity can be estimated. Since midblock median U-turn opening is a nonuniform infrastructure, a novel capacity estimation method is needed. The paper proposes sectioning models for estimating U-turn capacity based on dynamics and regression theory. Surveyed U-turn roadway {{was divided into}} three sections (entry, middle curve, and exit). Traffic data for each section and adjoining priority traffic stream were collected continually for eight weeks. After modifying passenger car values, ensuing traffic flows and computed densities were used to develop capacity model for entry and middle curve. Regression models where traffic flows from the exit section were taken as the dependent variables and flows from the priority stream were taken as independent variable were used to model capacity for the exit <b>section.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis shows that the proposed models can produce reliable and accurate results.

40|$|A well-studied {{possibility}} is that dark matter may reside in a sector secluded from the Standard Model, except for the so-called photon portal: kinetic mixing between the ordinary and dark photons. Such interactions can be probed at dark matter direct detection experiments, and new experimental techniques involving detection of dark matter-electron scattering offer new sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. Typically however it is implicitly assumed that the dark matter is not altered as it traverses the Earth {{to arrive at the}} detector. In this paper we study in detail the effects of terrestrial stopping on dark photon models of dark matter, and find that they significantly reduce the sensitivity of XENON 10 and DAMIC. In particular we find that XENON 10 only excludes masses in the range (5 - 3000) MeV while DAMIC only probes (20 - 50) MeV. Their corresponding cross <b>section</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is reduced to a window of cross sections between (5 × 10 ^- 38 - 10 ^- 30) cm^ 2 for XENON 10 and a small window around ∼ 10 ^- 31 cm^ 2 for DAMIC.

The incidence of marrow involvement in NHL was 35 % (55 patients). The most common histologic type of lymphoma was diffuse large cell lymphoma with 30 % of the cases having bone marrow involvement. The highest incidence of marrow involvement was seen in immunoblastic lymphoma & the lowest incidence in diffuse mixed cell lymphoma. Bone marrow lymphoma was present in 50 % of low-, 34 % of intermediate-, and 55 % of high-grade lymphomas. B-cell vs T-cell lymphoma in cases of marrow involvement was 56 % to 42 %. The most frequent pattern of marrow involvement was interstitial & diffuse (56 % & 31 %). The paratrabecular pattern was rare (4 %).

40|$|Objective: Sentinel {{lymph node}} frozen section {{is used to}} obviate {{the need for a}} second {{operation}} in breast cancer patients with involved nodes. However, the overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of sentinel lymph node frozen section are debated, and the impact of sentinel lymph node frozen section positivity on the risk of additional nodal metastases is not known and was the focus of this investigation. Methods: We used our hospital record system to identify 176 sentinel lymph node biopsies done out of 354 cases of Stage T 1 - 3 N 0 breast cancers managed from 2005 to 2007 and evaluated the sentinel lymph node frozen section results against the predictions of additional nodal metastases based on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Breast Cancer Nomogram which is a validated tool for this purpose. Results: Sentinel lymph node metastases size was an independent predictor of sentinel lymph node frozen <b>section</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and those with macrometastases had 15 times the odds (odds ratio, 15. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 4 - 69. 1) of having a true-positive frozen section when compared with those with micrometastases. The breast cancer nomogram predicted that the latter patients have a very low probability of additional nodal metastases with a median probability at 10 % (inter-quartile range, 7 - 14 %). Conclusions: A negative sentinel lymph node frozen section is also associated with a low probability of additional nodal metastases. Additional prognostic factors in the breast cancer nomogram are of little clinical impact because the most predictive factor in the nomogram is the method of detection...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Despite {{extensive}} investigations {{some patients}} with suspected lung cancer may undergo thoracotomy without preoperative histological proof of malignancy. A questionnaire {{on the use}} of histological examination of peroperative frozen sections in such patients was sent to 50 thoracic surgeons. Replies were received from 41 surgeons and indicated an absence of consensus on the usefulness of histological examination of frozen sections in this context, confirming the need for this study. METHODS [...] During one year 60 consecutive patients undergoing thoracotomy for suspected lung cancer without a prior histological diagnosis were studied prospectively. At thoracotomy the surgeon assessed the lesion macroscopically and a verdict on whether it was malignant was recorded. A biopsy specimen was then taken for examination of a frozen section and the result recorded. The appropriate operation was performed and the surgeon's verdict and the report on the frozen section were compared with the definitive histological diagnosis based on a paraffin section. RESULTS [...] Of 50 malignant lesions, 43 were identified by the surgeon and 47 by examination of the frozen <b>section</b> (<b>sensitivity</b> 86 % and 94 % respectively). Of 10 benign lesions, four were identified by the surgeon and nine by examination of the frozen section (specificity 40 % and 90 % respectively).

However, schedule-induced polydipsia appeared when soybean milk adulterated with 7. 2 or 14. 4 % sodium chloride was delivered under this schedule.

40|$|AIMS: Simultaneous {{assessment}} of DNA ploidy and biomarker expression in paraffin-embedded tissue sections Aims: Aneuploidy {{is a potential}} biomarker for predicting progression of premalignancies. Ploidy assessment is mostly performed on nuclei isolated from tissue sections. Ploidy assessment in situ in tissue sections may be a large improvement, enabling selective sampling of nuclei, thus allowing the correlation between ploidy and histology. Existing ploidy analysis methods in sections suffer from limited sensitivity. The aim was to reliably assess ploidy in sections, combined with simultaneous {{assessment of}} other markers at the individual cell level. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ploidy was measured in 22 paraffin-embedded oral premalignancies. The DNA stoichiometric Feulgen procedure was used on isolated nuclei, as well as fluoresence in situ hybridization analysis. In tissue sections, Feulgen was combined with immunohistochemistry for Ki 67 proliferation marker, enabling distinction between cycling euploid and aneuploid cells. Aneuploidy was reliably detected in tissue <b>sections</b> (<b>sensitivity</b> 100 %, specificity 92 %). One section in which aneuploidy was detected was misclassified in isolated nuclei analysis.
