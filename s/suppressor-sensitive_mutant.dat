40|$|Bacteriophage SPP 1 is a {{nanomachine}} {{built to}} infect the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The phage particle {{is composed of}} an icosahedric capsid, which contains the viral DNA, and a long non-contractile tail. Capsids and tails are produced in infected cells by two distinct morphogenetic pathways. Characterization of the <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> <b>mutant</b> SPP 1 sus 82 showed that it produces DNA-filled capsids and tails but is unable to assemble complete virions. Its purified tails have a normal length but lack a narrow ring that tapers the tail end found at the tail-to-head interface. The mutant is defective in production of gp 17. The gp 17 ring is exposed in free tails competent for viral assembly but becomes shielded in the final virion structure. Recombinant gp 17 is active in an in vitro assay to stick together capsids and tails present in extracts of SPP 1 sus 82 -infected cells, leading to formation of infectious particles. Gp 17 thus plays {{a fundamental role in}} the tail-to-head joining reaction, the ultimate step of virus particle assembly. This is the conserved function of gp 17 and its structurally related proteins like lambda gpU. This family of proteins can also provide fidelity to termination of the tail tube elongation reaction in a subset of phages including coliphage lambda...|$|E

40|$|The <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> of phage φ 29, susB 47 and susN 212, do not {{induce the}} {{synthesis}} of proteins NP 1 and II, respectively, when they infect Bacillus subtilis su−. A new polypeptide of molecular weight 75000, smaller than that of protein NP 1, is produced in susB 47 -infected cells. An analysis of the methionine-containing tryptic peptides of protein NP 1 and the 75000 -molecular-weight polypeptide showed that both proteins are related. When mutants susB 47 and susN 212 infect B. subtilissu+ 3, {{a small amount of}} proteins NP 1 and II, respectively, is synthesized, the level of the suppression being about 10...|$|R
40|$|Four phage phi 29 <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> of cistron O {{have been}} {{examined}} for production of 14 C-labeled viral-specific proteins in restrictive infections of Bacillus subtilis and fail to produce the protein of the viral neck lower collar. Cistrons O and F have {{been placed on the}} genetic map, containing 12 cistrons, by three-factor crosses. The phenotypes of five cistron J mutants have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, and in three instances fragments of the normal polypeptide were detected.

40|$|We {{describe}} the isolation and partial genetic characterization of 247 amber (<b>suppressor-sensitive)</b> <b>mutants</b> of temperate bacteriophage phi 80 of Escherichia coli. Of these 247 mutants, the mutations of 201 mapped {{to the left}} arm of the phi 809 chromosome and the mutations of 39 mapped to the right arm of the genome. Complementation tests among these and previously described left arm mutants defined five additional genes in the left arm of the chromosome. The positions of these genes {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that four of them represent functions essential for phi 80 tail assembly and one represents a capsid assembly function, probably the major coat protein. The identification of these genes brings the phi 80 genome into closer correspondence with the organization of the phage lambda genome. Two- and three-factor crosses performed between mutants with defects in each of the previously identified genes and mutants with defects in the five new genes allowed us to construct a consistent, roughly additive recombination map of the left arm of the bacteriophage phi 80 genome...|$|R
40|$|Suppressor {{mutations}} {{were identified}} in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a comparison was made with Escherichia coli suppressor systems. A suppressor-sensitive (sus) derivative of a plasmid, RP 4 trp, and several Sus mutants of IncP 1 plasmid-specific phages, were isolated by using E. coli. Plasmid RP 4 trp (sus) was transferred to P. aeruginosa strains carrying trp markers which did not complement RP 4 trp(sus), and Trp+ variants were selected. Some, but not all such revertants, could propagate PRD 1 Sus phages, and these mutants {{were found to be}} supressor positive. Plating efficiencies of various Sus phages on these strains were compared with on E. coli strains carrying known suppressor genes. The results suggested that the Pseudomonas suppressors were probably amber suppressors. In iddition, some Sus phages (PRD 1 sus- 55, PRD 1 sus- 56) were obtained which, although apparently of the amber type for E. coli, were able to propagate equally well on sup+ or sup strains of P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, several mutants of phage PRR 1 which were suppressed in E. coli were not suppressed by the P. aeruginosa suppressor. <b>Suppressor-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> were also isolated with P. aeruginosa bacteriophages E 79 and D 3...|$|R

40|$|Serological {{methods and}} {{electron}} microscopy {{were used to}} study the structural proteins of the small Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage φ 29. This virus has {{a large number of}} fibers attached at both ends of its prolate head. A complex neck assembly is comprised of 12 symmetrically arranged appendages as the outer component. Head fibers, neck appendages, and the head surface bind anti-φ 29 antibodies. Immune sera absorbed with defective lysates of <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutants</b> have been used to determine the genetic control of neck appendages production. Studies on the serum-blocking power of lysates defective in different tail components showed that appendages contain the main serum-blocking protein. This finding suggests an essential role of the neck appendages in phage adsorption or DNA injection...|$|R

40|$|Phage φ 29 <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutants</b> of 14 cistrons {{have been}} {{examined}} for production of 14 C-labeled viral-specific proteins in restrictive infections of Bacillus subtilis. Proteins specified by four cistrons (H, J, L, and N) have been resolved and identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, and fragments of the normal polypeptides were detected. Mutants of six cistrons (C, D, E, F, I, and M) demonstrated two or more missing bands in the gel profiles, and thus some of these gene products may have regulatory functions. Mutation was detected in at least five genes coding for low-molecular-weight proteins, but a conditionally lethal mutant in {{only one of these}} genes has been isolated. Preliminary evidence that a precursor protein is cleaved to generate the neck appendage structural protein and a low-molecular-weight product has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|<b>Suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutants</b> of {{bacteriophage}} φ 80 defective in late functions were classified, {{by means}} of in vitro assembly tests, into two complementation groups: head donors and tail donors. Each group of mutants was subdivided, {{by means of}} two-factor crosses, into six cistrons. Deletion mapping revealed clustering of tail and also of head cistrons. The two clusters were located in the left arm of vegetative φ 80 (the tail specifying cluster being distal). In vitro cross complementation between φ 80 and lambda sus mutants revealed that whereas lambda heads could quite efficiently bind φ 80 tails to form viable phage, the union of φ 80 heads and lambda tails was very much less efficient. Deletion mapping of the φ 80 sus mutants, using both φ 80 and iφ 80 hλ deletion lysogens indicated congruent gross gene arrangement in the two related bacteriophages...|$|R
40|$|Three {{classes of}} {{particles}} {{have been identified}} in restrictive phi 29 <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutant</b> infections of Bacillus subtilis, including DNA-containing heads or phage, prohead, and empty heads. Pulse-chase labeling experiments indicate that the prohead, the first particle assembled in 14 -infected cells, is converted to DNA-filled heads and phi 29. In addition to the proteins Hd, P 10, and F found in mature phi 29, the prohead contains a "core" protein P 7 that exits as the prohead matures and appears to recycle during subsequent rounds of prohead assembly. Prohead-like structures accumulate in UV-irradiated cells and are present in restrictive infections with sus mutants of cistrons 9 and 16. Empty heads are observed only when infection results in the formation of DNA-containing particles; this and other evidence indicates that the empty heads are probably not true intermediates. Phage phi 29 assembly apparently occurs by a single pathway in which neck and tail components interact to stabilize the completed DNA-containing head...|$|R
40|$|Restrictive {{infection}} of Bacillus subtilis by <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutants</b> of phi 29 {{has been used}} to search for cistrons that function in viral assembly. The products of cistrons 7, 9, 10, and 16 are necessary for head morphogenesis. The neck upper collar protein P 10 and the tail protein P 9 must be present for DNA packaging to occur. The protein P 7 must be present for phage-related particles to form. A prohead-like particle has been isolated during 16 -restrictive infection. The particle is composed of the proteins Hd, P 10, F, and P 7. P 16 must function for DNA-filled particles to accumulate. A DNA-containing particle produced {{in the absence of the}} cistron 11 product may be an intermediate in the phi 29 assembly pathway. The protein P 13 interacts with P 9 and P 11 to form a stable DNA-filled particle. The products of cistrons 2 and 3 are essential for viral DNA synthesis, and in their absence virus-related particles are not detected...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods have}} been {{successful}} in the isolation of transfer-deficient mutants of the narrow-host-range R plasmid R 91 - 5 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: (i) selection for donor-specific phage resistance; (ii) direct screening after mutagenic treatment with either ethyl methane sulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; (iii) in vitro mutagenesis of plasmid DNA by hydroxylamine followed by transformation and direct screening. The majority of transfer-deficient mutants were donor-specific phage resistant, supporting the view that sex pili and other surface components are essential for conjugal transfer (since the phages PRD 1 and PR 4 adsorb to these sites). Some of the transfer-deficient mutants were also unable to inhibit the replication of phage G 101 or lost entry exclusion or both phenotypes. The ability to revert these pleiotropic mutants to wild type implicates the latter two functions in R 91 - 5 transfer. Suppressor mutations in P. aeruginosa enabled the detection of <b>suppressor-sensitive,</b> transfer-deficient <b>mutants.</b> Such mutants should prove useful in conjugational complementation tests for the identification of the transfer cistrons of R 91 - 5...|$|R
40|$|Suppressor {{mutations}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{have been}} identified. An isolate of strain PAT, initially selected as being temperature sensitive for growth, {{was found to}} suppress two different auxotrophic mutations. A suppressor locus, designated sup- 1, has been mapped and is co-transducible with three closely linked thr loci. The suppressor mutation {{has been used to}} isolate <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutants</b> of the virulent phage E 79 and the R factor R 18. By selecting for revertants of auxotrophic markers, other sup mutants have been isolated and are found to be of two types, either temperature sensitive for growth like the original mutant or showing wild-type growth at 43 C. The mutations giving rise to both these classes of suppressor are very closely linked. One of the sup- 1 alleles of strain PAT also shows suppressor activity when transferred into P. aeruginosa strain PAO. Escherichia coli strains carrying the nonsense suppressors supC, supD, or supF do not suppress the sus mutant of R 18. This suggests that sup- 1 is different from the amber and ochre suppressors of the enterobacteria...|$|R

40|$|By using temperature-sensitive (ts) and <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> (sus) <b>mutants,</b> 11 {{essential}} genes {{have been}} identified in phage φ 105. The order of the genes has been established in two- and three-factor crosses. The genes can be arranged in a linear order; this order is identical in the vegetative phage and in the prophage. One gene essential for phage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis has been found. Marker rescue from prophage and mature DNA, taken up by competent bacteria, was studied by superinfection with phage carrying one sus and one ts mutation. In prophage DNA, all single markers studied are rescued at similar frequencies. The frequency of co-rescue of two markers is proportional to the recombinational distance between the markers. Thus, colinearity between the genetic map and the position on the DNA molecule of those mutations used to establish the map is demonstrated. The results indicate that the recombination frequencies observed in vegetative crosses are a relative measure of the physical distance between markers. All single markers are not rescued at equal frequencies from mature DNA. The frequency of co-rescue of two markers is related to the recombinational distance only over a distance about one-fourth or less of the genetic map. Markers separated by 10 % recombination, or more, are co-rescued at 5 to 10 % of the frequency of rescue of single markers. Shearing of mature DNA into half-sized molecules reduces the efficiency by which single markers are rescued by a factor of 5 to 10. The results of experiments on co-rescue of two markers from half-sized mature DNA indicate a preferred break-point near the middle of the genetic map; the results are compatible with a nonpermuted sequence in mature DNA. It is pointed out and discussed that mature DNA exhibits several anomalies in marker rescue experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of bacteriophage PRD 1 proceeds via formation of empty procapsids containing an internal lipid membrane, {{into which the}} linear double-stranded DNA genome is subsequently packaged. The packaging ATPase P 9 and other putative packaging proteins {{have been shown to}} be located at a unique vertex of the PRD 1 capsid. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a <b>suppressor-sensitive</b> PRD 1 <b>mutant</b> deficient in the unique vertex protein P 6. Protein P 6 was found to be an essential part of the PRD 1 packaging machinery; its absence leads to greatly reduced packaging efficiency. Lack of P 6 was not found to affect particle assembly, because in the P 6 -deficient mutant infection, wild-type (wt) amounts of particles were produced, although most were empty. P 6 was determined not to be a specificity factor, as the few filled particles seen in the P 6 -deficient infection contained only PRD 1 -specific DNA. The presence of P 6 was not necessary for retention of DNA in the capsid once packaging had occurred, and P 6 -deficient DNA-containing particles were found to be stable and infectious, albeit not as infectious as wt PRD 1 virions. A packaging model for bacteriophage PRD 1, based on previous results and those obtained in this study, is presented...|$|R
