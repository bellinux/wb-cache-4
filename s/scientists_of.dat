Gray made several trips to Europe to collaborate with leading European <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> the era, as well as trips to the southern and western United States.

5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which {{ultimately led to}} the development of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E

5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, fully {{automatic}} computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine.

The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, {{but it was not a}} general-purpose machine.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> the day recoiled to {{find that}} Cope's feud with Marsh had become front-page news. Those closest to the {{scientific}} fields under discussion, geology and vertebrate paleontology, certainly winced, particularly as they found themselves quoted, mentioned, or misspelled. The feud was not news to them, for it had lurked at their scientific meetings for two decades. Most of them had already taken sides.|$|E

5|$|Polish science {{reached its}} {{culmination}} {{in the first}} half of the 16th century. The medieval point of view was criticized, more rational explanations were attempted. Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, doing away with its Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the explosion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are one of}} the few animals {{where the}} {{molecular}} basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined. However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E
5|$|The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee {{scientists}} and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> interest and possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities, and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium {{was available in}} Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by assessing {{the size of the}} piles of tailings.|$|E

5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main {{concern is that the}} lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. <b>Scientists</b> <b>of</b> the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
5|$|The first {{decay of}} atoms of {{oganesson}} {{was observed in}} 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists.

On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected {{a total of three}} (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.|$|E
5|$|Forster was {{a central}} figure of the Enlightenment in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, {{including}} his close friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg.

When the French took control of Mainz in 1792, Forster became {{one of the founders of}} the city's Jacobin Club and went on to play a leading role in the Mainz Republic, the earliest republican state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.|$|E

She was also a fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Atomic <b>Scientists</b> <b>of</b> Chicago. She was a charter member of the American Nuclear Society and the president of Iota Sigma Pi, a national honor society for women in chemistry.

Young lecture series in her honor in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> the Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E

Like many <b>scientists</b> <b>of</b> his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.|$|E
