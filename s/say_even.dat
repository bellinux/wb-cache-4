Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E

However, areas of the Reserve have been damaged as it is carved in disconnected patches. In many areas, tapirs, howler monkeys and parrots are already gone.

According to Conservation International, there are 140 peasant settler communities in the Biosphere Reserve and 225 including those in other protected areas in the Lacandon. All but thirty two of these have a certain amount of legal protection as they were registered as ejidos before the Reserve was created.|$|E

Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt.

500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and <b>say,</b> <b>even</b> before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't <b>say.</b> <b>Even</b> if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The case of Tameside {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{as being the}} first case which suggests a novel approach to factual error. There, the court asserted that administrative decisions may be reviewed {{if there has been}} a [...] "misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact", and/or the decision-maker has acted [...] "outside his power, or unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact". That is to <b>say,</b> <b>even</b> if it is for the decision-maker to evaluate the facts, the court can inquire into whether those facts exist and have been taken into account, whether the decision was made on a proper self-direction as to those facts, and whether irrelevant facts have been taken into account. Thus, the court's power in judicial review was broadened to allow for a limited factual inquiry. This ground of judicial review has been termed as an error of material fact.|$|E
2500|$|Karl Menger found mathematicians {{to be too}} parsimonious {{with regard}} to variables, so he {{formulated}} his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: [...] "Entities must {{not be reduced to}} the point of inadequacy" [...] and [...] "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more."

2500|$|While his {{intentions}} for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, {{it is less}} clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended on producing a critical Greek text or {{that he wanted to}} beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, {{there is no evidence to}} support this. Rather his motivation may have been simpler: he included the Greek text to prove the superiority of his Latin version. He wrote, [...] "There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me." [...] He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work: [...] "But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they <b>say,</b> <b>even</b> to a blind man, that often through the translator’s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep." [...] Erasmus' new work was published by Froben of Basel in 1516, becoming the first published Greek New Testament, the Novum Instrumentum omne, diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum.

2500|$|Developers {{also found}} the machine {{difficult}} to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said [...] "The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted". He continued [...] "I'd <b>say,</b> <b>even</b> at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until {{we have the ability}} to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E
2500|$|Quirinus Quirrell is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. Though the character's first name was never {{mentioned in the}} novels, the character is given the first name [...] "Quirinus" [...] in the official Harry Potter Trading Card Game. Quirrell is the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts during Harry's first year and secretly a Death Eater. Prior to his employment at Hogwarts, he is said by Hagrid {{to have had a}} [...] "brilliant mind", and was a fine teacher while studying from books; some time before Harry's arrival at Hogwarts, [...] "he took a year off to get some first-hand experience". Rowling stated in a live web chat on 30 July 2007 that Quirrell had worked at Hogwarts as Muggle Studies teacher for a certain length of time, before taking the cursed Defence Against the Dark Arts position in the same year that Harry joined. There were rumours that he encountered vampires in the Black Forest and one in Romania, and he apparently had [...] "a nasty bit of trouble with a hag". After that, he was 'never the same' – upon his return, he appears perpetually nervous and has developed a stutter and nervous tics [...] and Hagrid was able to <b>say</b> <b>even</b> before the beginning of the autumn term that he was [...] "scared of the students, scared of his own subject". Quirrell's attire includes a new purple turban which he claims to have received as a reward from an African prince for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. Fred and George constantly joke that the turban was full of garlic to ward away vampires and in one part they even enchant snowballs to hit it. According to JK Rowling, Quirrell taught Muggle Studies before Harry studied at Hogwarts, which explains why he was a teacher before {{but at the same time}} only a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for one year.|$|E
