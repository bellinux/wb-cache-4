A new {{technology}} of high efficiency concasting based on inner-outer couple cooling of molten steel in a mould has been advanced, {{that is to}} set an inner cooling apparatus, U shape pipes, in a mould. The flow status of molten steel in mould with inner cooling apparatus is analyzed by using fluid dynamics analysis software FLUENT, and compared with that without inner cooling apparatus.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. This thesis {{presents}} a three-dimensional static analysis and design procedure for a floating {{offshore wind turbine}} support platform constructed of reinforced concrete. Results from a global performance analysis, which considers the dynamic interactions of wind and wave loading, from a conceptual case study by the American Bureau of Shipping are used to infer the equivalent static loading applied to the finite element model. Results from the analysis and applicable load combinations obtained from relevant design guidelines are used to design a floating concrete platform structure that includes precast and cast-in-place components as well as post-tensioning. The proposed concrete platform is a tri-floater, semi-submersible structure that consists of a cylindrical central core column to support the wind turbine tower, stabilized by the three buoyancy columns and a rigid pontoon base. The floating reinforced concrete support platform is shown to be an economically viable option when compared to <b>steel</b> platforms. <b>Floating</b> offshore wind turbine technology {{is a relatively new}} multi-disciplinary field of engineering where current design concepts primarily utilize <b>steel</b> <b>floating</b> support platforms. Reinforced concrete is advantageous over steel because of the durability of concrete exposed to a marine environment.

5000|$|A fixed {{platform}} {{is a type}} of offshore platform used for the production of oil or gas. These platforms are built on concrete and/or steel legs anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting a deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters. Such platforms are, by virtue of their immobility, designed for very long-term use. Various types of structure are used, steel jacket, concrete caisson, <b>floating</b> <b>steel</b> and even <b>floating</b> concrete. <b>Steel</b> jackets are vertical sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed. Concrete caisson structures, pioneered by the Condeep concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore (Norwegian fjords and Scottish firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed. Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about 500 feet (150 m); for deeper depths a floating production system, or a subsea pipeline to land or to shallower water depths for processing, would usually be considered.

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless <b>steel</b> doughnut <b>float</b> is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|R
