50|$|Statistical models include linear and {{non-linear}} models, {{but also}} structural and black-box types of models. Structural models {{rely on the}} analyst’s expertise on the phenomenon of interest while black-box models require little <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> and are constructed from data in a fairly mechanical way. Concerning wind power forecasting, structural models would be those that include a modeling of the diurnal wind speed variations, or an explicit function of meteorological variable predictions. Black-box models include most of the artificial-intelligence-based models such as Neural-Networks (NNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, some models are ‘in-between’ the two extremes of being completely black-box or structural. This {{is the case of}} expert systems, which learn from experience (from a dataset), and for which prior knowledge can be injected. We then talk about grey-box modeling. Statistical models are usually composed by an autoregressive part, for seizing the persistent behavior of the wind, and by a ‘meteorological’ part, which consists in the nonlinear transformation of meteorological variable forecasts. The autoregressive part permits to significantly enhance forecast accuracy for horizons up to 6-10 hours ahead, i.e. over a period during which the sole use of meteorological forecast information may not be sufficient for outperforming persistence.|$|E

40|$|A current {{dilemma in}} {{assessment}} of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) is the burgeoning of ESP assessment {{programs and the}} vaguely understood concept of ESP ability. Douglas (2000) posits the nature of ESP ability lies in the interaction among its three components: language <b>knowledge,</b> <b>subject-matter</b> background <b>knowledge</b> and strategic competence. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the validity of Douglas‘ hypothesis through exploring potential interaction among grammatical knowledge (one aspect of language <b>knowledge),</b> <b>subject-matter</b> background <b>knowledge</b> (operationalized as medical and nursing knowledge), and strategic competence in explaining ESP ability in reading (ESPAR). The study investigated how different components of strategic competence could combine with themselves and with background knowledge and grammatical knowledge to enhance ESPAR. A pool of 1491 medical and nursing students from eight medical and healthcare colleges in China participated by responding to four instruments that were designed to measure medical and nursing knowledge, grammatical knowledge, medical and nursing English ability in reading, and strategic competence, respectively. The study was designed as correlational study. It used two different statistical methods in two stages. In the first stage, the bifactor-multidimensional item response theory (bifactor-MIRT) was used to calibrate, score and formulate composite scores representing students‘ ability measured by each scale and to examine the evidence of factorial validity of the underlying constructs. In the second stage, structural equation modeling with the bifactor-MIRT based composites was applied. This was to done to explore the one-moment main effect of, and the two-moment and three-moment interaction effects among grammatical knowledge, background knowledge and strategic competence in explaining ESPAR. The results of the study offered empirical evidence in support of the validity of the underlying constructs operationalized in the grammatical knowledge test, the background knowledge test, the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) reading test, and the strategic competence survey. The findings suggested that grammatical knowledge produced largest explained variance of the ESPAR, followed by background knowledge and strategic competence. The results also suggested linear moderation between grammatical knowledge and strategic competence, that is, they enhanced or constrained each other‘s capacity in explaining ESPAR. More importantly, the results also showed quadratic moderation of grammatical knowledge on background knowledge. That is, the explanatory capacity of background knowledge increased with the increase of grammatical knowledge until the latter reached a high threshold (theta= 0); when grammatical knowledge continued to increase, background knowledge effect started to decrease. Furthermore, the results showed that different components displayed a Triple-Decker pattern that best enhanced ESPAR, apart from the linear moderation between evaluating and grammatical knowledge and the quadratic moderation of grammatical knowledge on background knowledge. On the lowest deck were automatized grammatical knowledge and background knowledge (Automators); on the middle deck were cognitive strategies (Assistants) that assisted the deficiency of the Automators; and on the top deck were metacognitive strategies (Regulators) that regulated the Assistants. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Most studies have investigated the effectiveness of content experts {{compared with that of}} non-experts as measured either by student satisfaction or academic achievement. A few have compared academic staff tutors with student tutors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between students' perception of overall tutor effectiveness, particular tutor behaviours, clinical qualifications and academic appointment. Method A questionnaire designed to evaluate particular aspects of PBL tutoring technique, related either to <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> or to process-facilitation skill, as well as overall effectiveness, was distributed to students in first year of a PBL medical program at the end of each of three tutor terms. A total of 76 tutor terms were included in the study. Data analysis compared clinical with non-clinical tutors, and staff with non-staff tutors. Results Clinically qualified tutors used their <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> significantly more than non-clinical tutors and were seen as being more empathic with their students. Staff tutors placed more emphasis on assessment than non-staff tutors and were seen as having greater skill in establishing and maintaining an environment of cooperation within their PBL groups than non-staff tutors.

40|$|There is {{international}} {{concern that}} the standard of mathematics education requires improvement. In order to facilitate this improvement, preservice teacher education needs {{to meet the demands}} of our technological age. As well, an international trend in mathematics curriculum development should focus on problem solving and modeling. This trend is evident in Australia, where the first national curriculum is currently being implemented. The need for attention to changing curriculum and introduction of reform-oriented pedagogies has ramifications for programs that provide preservice teacher education. New ways of thinking about mathematics and the teaching of mathematics is an important theme in such reforms. One offshoot of this development is focusing on teacher knowledge and its potential impact on students 2 ̆ 7 performance. Our research is set against this background and the aim of this exploratory study is to identify teacher knowledge that is activated in the context of designing mathematical problems. The methodological approach is qualitative and quantitative. The participants of the study are twenty-six preservice teachers at an Australian university. Findings show that having preservice teachers design rich learning activities which incorporate modeling of problems provides opportunities for them to demonstrate a rich repertoire of mathematical knowledge for teaching. This mathematical knowledge is complex and its development can be captured by mapping the trajectory of their learning. A key finding is that our approach provided opportunities for participants to construct <b>subject-matter</b> and pedagogicalcontent <b>knowledge</b> in a blended manner.

This study attempted to identify trends in the social studies objectives as reflected in the journal Social Education from 1937 to 1986. This Journal has represented and led the field of social studies education since its publication. A content analysis was conducted to identify trends in the field. Each article in the journal from 1937 to 1986 was scanned and articles related to the social studies objectives were separated. These separated articles were classified into one of the categories in the social studies objectives and the number of articles in each category was tabulated. An analysis of the findings of the study provided the basis for the following conclusions: (1) Among the four major aspects in social studies objectives, the <b>knowledge</b> (<b>subject-matter)</b> aspect received the largest number of articles through the five decades. (2) Among the skills objectives, thinking skills attracted the largest number of articles, followed by communication skills, map and globe skills, and information-gathering skills. (3) Among the values and attitudes objectives, global perspectives received the largest number of articles, followed by unum values, pluribus values, and future-oriented perspectives. (4) Among the knowledge objectives, history received the largest number of articles in each period as well as in total count. It was followed by geography, political science, sociology, citizenship education, and economics.

This is an orthodox thesis {{in that it is}} a “book”. However, it is also the practice element of the PhD by part-practice; i. e. it is presented as the practice and the theoretical aspects of the PhD submission. In a sense, it stands for a thesis, in which instance it has become a “stereotypical” thesis, a “straw man” at which the theoretical arguments are launched. The written text describes itself as a self-reflexive paradox, using the well known illusion of the duck-rabbit as an example of its undecidable nature. As a “test” for the representatives of the awarding institution the problem set is whether to regard the thesis as art-work or as theoretical exposition. In order to drive the point home a “version” of the thesis is presented with a spine binding on both ends thus making it impossible to open – literally, a “double-bind”. Much of the discussion is centred on current debates over whether “knowledge” can be extracted from art works — that is to say, knowledge that can be communicated and that could be called “reliable” as a pre-requisite for a PhD. The thesis argues that the available literature on the subject seems to be continually “in pursuit” of a satisfactory answer — a pursuit much like that in Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem, The Hunting of the Snark. Interpretation of art works is the mainstay of this literature and it is the hermeneutical approach that is given most critical attention from a deconstructive angle. The ontological status of “art” is examined {{as a consequence of the}} Duchampian readymade, which is often overlooked as the transparency of art works is often assumed in order to “contain” <b>subject-matter</b> that “embodies” <b>knowledge.</b> This, the thesis argues is a non sequitur and only leads to a dissemination of possible, equally valid knowledge claims and is thus a specious epistemological enterprise. By enunciating the thesis as a work of art, there forms a duality of text and object/image where each reinforces the other at the same time as each cancels the other out.

40|$|Within the {{psychological}} literature, {{there is the}} general assumption that deeper-level processing should be consistently associated with better academic performance (e. g., Block, 2009). However, studies exploring the relation between depth of processing (e. g., deep and surface processing) and learning outcomes have not produced consistent results. The argument guiding the current investigation was that these inconsistent findings regarding the relation between depth of processing and performance may be attributable to individual and situational factors that moderate this relation. Specifically, in this study, the potential moderating effects of a situational factor (i. e., text type) and an individual factor (i. e., <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge)</b> on the relation between depth of processing and performance were investigated. Support for these individual and situational factors were derived from a systematic {{review of the literature}} that also examined conceptualization and operationalization of deep and surface processing. The participants for this study were 151 college undergraduates {{from a wide variety of}} majors. Participants completed measures of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge,</b> read either an expository or persuasive text about the existence of extraterrestrials while thinking aloud, and then completed both a passage recall task and an open-ended task in which they were asked to justify their position on the existence of extraterrestrials. Participants' verbal reports were coded using a scheme based on Pressley and Afflerbach's (1995) Verbal Protocols of Reading and the Construction-Integration Model (Kintsch, 2004). The open-ended task was coded using Biggs and Collis's (1982) Structured Observation of the Learning Outcome (SOLO). Three findings of interest emerged. First, results indicated that the relation between depth of processing and the open-ended tasks were moderated by the type of text (expository or persuasive) participants read. Second, no significant interaction of depth of processing and <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> on either the recall or open-ended learning emerged. Third, significant differences were found in the interaction of depth of processing and type of text between the passage recall measure and open-ended task.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} teacher language awareness (TLA) and a personal reconceptualisation {{of the relationship between}} TLA and other dimensions of teacher knowledge, revisiting issues discussed in Andrews (2001). In {{the first part of the}} paper, knowledge of subject matter is identified as the core of TLA. Given the increased recognition in education that <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> is a key element of teacher professionalism, it is argued that TLA should be seen as equally important for the teacher of language subjects. The middle part of the paper outlines a personal view of the nature and scope of TLA, focusing particularly on the link between knowledge about language (<b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge)</b> and knowledge of language (language proficiency), on the metacognitive nature of TLA, and on TLA as encompassing an awareness of language from the learner perspective. The latter part of the paper explores the link between TLA and the professional knowledge of the L 2 teacher, drawing on two recent models of teacher knowledge (Tsui, 2003; Turner-Bisset, 2001), and examines the impact of TLA on pedagogical practice.

40|$|Data {{collected}} from a diagnostics mathematics test taken by some primary student teachers are reported. Student responses were analysed using the Dichotomous Rasch Measurement Model. Error analyses enabled {{the identification of}} main misconceptions. Findings showed students performed relatively well with basic computations and visually presented data but struggled with word problems. The more complex and abstract the language used, {{the more difficult it}} became, implying that the critical skills of interpreting mathematical concepts, representations, and language and problem solving require explicit remediation. Implications for primary teacher education are provided. Professional Teaching Standards (NCTM, 2005; AAMT, 2006) prescribe requirements such as a deep understanding not only of the teaching and learning processes but also the specific discipline content. Shulman’s (1986) teacher knowledge taxonomy included subject-matter content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and curriculum knowledge. Although curriculum knowledge is knowledge of curriculum programs and instructional materials (Chick, 2002), Shulman (1986) defines <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> as knowledge of both the substantive structure and syntactic structure. Transforming <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> and curriculum knowledge into pedagogical content knowledge conceptualises “the link between knowing something for oneself and being able to enable others to know it ” (Huckstep, Rowland, & Thwaites, 2003). Ma’s (1999) study illustrated the need for primary teachers to have profound understanding of fundamental mathematics in order to promote and extend student learning. Ball and Bass (2000) argued teachers should be mathematically competent in order to effectively address the diversity of studen...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{study in}} progress which {{involves the use of}} a computerised research science database (Birds of the Antarctica) and specially designed curriculum materials. The purpose of the study is to investigate the extent to which students’ inquiry skills can be facilitated by the materials. Much attention is given in the programme to developing both students’ inquiry skills and their <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Year 11 and 12 students’ knowledge and skills development are interpreted as they interact with the computerised database and the curriculum materials. Preliminary findings about students’ abilities and perceptions are discussed and, in particular, constraints to the development of inquiry skills and construction of understanding are explored...|$|E

It is, however, a difficult subject to teach, requiring both mathematical expertise and extensive <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{of a variety of}} disease systems. In this article, we explore several uses of zombie epidemics to make mathematical modeling and infectious disease epidemiology more accessible to public health professionals, students, and the general public. We further introduce a web-based simulation, White Zed ([URL]), that can be deployed in classrooms to allow students to explore models before implementing them. In our experience, zombie epidemics are familiar, approachable, flexible, and an ideal way to introduce basic concepts of infectious disease epidemiology...|$|E

The demonstration is facilitated {{by the use of}} causal graphs. (Epidemiology 2001; 11 : 313 – 320) Key Words: inference, etiology, study design, data collection, data analysis, epidemiologic methods Greenland et al 1 discussed the use of causal graphs in epidemiologic research. A limitation of that paper was that it was lacking concrete examples designed to help the reader see how to take one’s knowledge of study design, temporal ordering, basic biology, and epidemiologic principles to construct an appropriate causal graph. Here I present two epidemiologic thought experiments that make the point that the choice of an appropriate etiologic analysis depends as much on the design of the study and background <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> as on the data. Specifically, in the first, I provide a single hypothetical dataset and three differing study designs, each of which plausibly could have given rise to the data. I show that the appropriate etiologic analysis differs with the design. In the second, I revisit a well-known epidemiologic controversy from the late 1970 s. Horowitz and Feinstein 2 proposed that the strong association between postmenopausal estrogens and endometrial cancer seen in many epidemiologic studies might be wholly attributable to diagnostic bias. Others disagreed. 3 – 5 Part of the discussion centered on the issue of whether it was appropriate to stratify on vaginal bleeding, the purported cause of the diagnostic bias in the analysis. The goal here is to show, using causal graphs, that the answer depends on underlying assumptions about the relevant biological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This review brings diverse {{research}} {{to bear on}} the contention that current achievement tests may underestimate students' <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> and problem-solving ability because of the mismatch between the symbolic form that typical achievement tests use and the specificity of students ' symbolic encoding that arises from instruction and individual differences. More specifically, the possibility that alternative representations of science problems affect achievement estimates is examined for students varying in socioeconomic and ethnic/racial backgrounds. Theory and research are examined for the effects of symbolic encoding on information processing and the effects of translation among symbol systems on problem solving. Testing with alternative symbolic representations is placed {{in the context of the}} literature on minority group testing. Research on minority group testing has rarely focused on th...|$|E

40|$|Capstones are {{culminating}} {{experiences in}} which students synthe-size <b>subject-matter</b> <b>knowledge</b> they have acquired, integrate cross-disciplinary knowledge, and connect theory and application in prepa-ration for entry into a career (Fairchild and Taylor 2000). Durel (1993) evocatively describes them as {{a rite of passage}} or liminal threshold through which participants change their status from stu-dent to graduate. A capstone course should be both a synthesis reflection and integrationand a bridgea real-world preparatory experience that focuses on the postgraduation future (Fairchild and Taylor 2000; Rhodus and Hoskins 1995). In career and technical education (CTE), capstones are most often found in postsecondary business, agriculture, and allied health programs; in their emphasis on integration, experiential learning, and real-world problem solv-ing, they would be valuable in any CTE field. This Brief discusses the rationale for capstones, presents evidence of their effectiveness...|$|E
