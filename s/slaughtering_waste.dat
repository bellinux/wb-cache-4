40|$|Introduction: From August 2009 to October 2010, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research {{together}} investigated 14 {{outbreaks of}} anthrax which included 140 animal and 273 human cases in 14 anthrax-affected villages. Our investigation objectives were {{to explore the}} context in which these outbreaks occurred, including livestock rearing practices, human handling of sick and dead animals, and the anthrax vaccination program. Methods: Field anthropologists used qualitative data-collection tools, including 15 hours of unstructured observations, 11 key informant interviews, 32 open-ended interviews, and 6 group discussions in 5 anthrax-affected villages. Results: Each cattle owner in the affected communities raised a median of six ruminants on their household premises. The ruminants were often grazed in pastures and fed supplementary rice straw, green grass, water hyacinth, rice husk, wheat bran, and oil cake; lactating cows were given dicalcium phosphate. Cattle represented a major financial investment. Since Islamic law forbids eating animals that die from natural causes, when anthrax-infected cattle were moribund, farmers often slaughtered them on the household premises while they were still alive so that the meat could be eaten. Farmers ate the meat and sold it to neighbors. Skinners removed and sold the hides from discarded carcasses. Farmers discarded the carcasses and <b>slaughtering</b> <b>waste</b> into ditches, bodies of water, or open fields. Cattle in the affected communities did not receive routine anthrax vaccine due to low production, poor distribution, and limited staffing for vaccination. Conclusion: Slaughtering anthrax-infected animals and disposing of butchering waste and carcasses in environments where ruminants live and graze, combined with limited vaccination, provided a context that permitted repeated anthrax outbreaks in animals and humans. Because of strong financial incentives, slaughtering moribund animals and discarding carcasses and waste products will likely continue. Long-term vaccination coverage for at-risk animal populations may reduce anthrax infection...|$|E

This study describes the practices associated with raising and slaughtering household poultry to identify {{risk factors for}} H 5 N 1 infection and reasons for non-compliance with preventive measures. |An investigation was conducted of 56 households with household flocks (19 households with human H 5 N 1 cases, 19 with poultry H 5 N 1 cases, and 18 with no reported poultry or human H 5 N 1 cases). Data were collected via structured observations and in-depth interviews. |Half of the households kept at least some free-range poultry and mixed at least some different species of poultry as it was considered beneficial for the poultry. Feeding and cleaning practices exposed children to contact with poultry; slaughtering contaminated homes; use of personal protective barriers was not a norm; waste management exposed the communities to <b>slaughtering</b> <b>waste</b> and dead chickens; and reporting of sick and dead poultry was not a practice. Only minor changes in poultry-handling took place following H 5 N 1 virus outbreaks. |H 5 N 1 virus prevention in Egypt represents both an epidemiological and socio-cultural challenge. Traditional poultry-rearing practices that likely increase exposures to H 5 N 1 -infected poultry are common throughout Egypt. Despite education campaigns following sporadic H 5 N 1 outbreaks, no differences in these practices could be detected between households with previous H 5 N 1 human or poultry cases and those households with any previous experience with H 5 N 1. Development of H 5 N 1 infection-related education campaign strategies should focus on perceptions underlying traditional practices in order to tailor public awareness messages that are meaningful for communities. 23145955 PMC 463426...|$|E

However, the rush to the cure may have been made in haste. Biofuels in particular, have a bad press both in terms of competition with good agricultural land for food, and also in terms of the associated energy balance with the whole life cycle analysis of the biofuel system. The emphasis is now very much on sustainable biofuel production; biofuels from wastes and lignocellulosic material are now seen as good sustainable biofuels that affect significantly better greenhouse gas balances as compared with first generation biofuels. Ireland has a significant resource of organic waste that could be a potential source of energy through anaerobic digestion. Ireland has 8 % of the cattle population of the EU with less than 1 % of the human population; as a result 91 % of agricultural land in Ireland is under grass. Residues such as slurries and <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> together with energy crops such as grass have an excellent potential to produce biogas that may be upgraded to biomethane. This biomethane may be used as a natural gas substitute; bio-compressed natural gas may then be an avenue for a biofuel strategy. It is estimated that a maximum potential of 33 % of natural gas may be substituted by 2020 with a practical obtainable level of 7. 5 % estimated. Together with biodiesel from residues the practical obtainable level of this strategy may effect greater than a 5 % substitution by energy of transport.

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 With {{electricity}} tariffs in South Africa escalating at a {{rapid pace}} the demand for alternative power sources has increased. One of these renewable energy sources includes the use of biogas. Biogas is not {{only one of the}} most efficient and effective renewable energy possibilities available but also requires less capital investment as compared to other renewable sources like hydro, solar and wind and are also more economical as it involves less per unit production cost. Biogas plants have been used around the globe for numerous years, but are a relative new technology in South Africa, predominantly in the red meat industry with the use of <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> as a form of biomass. <b>Slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> offers a vital possible source of renewable energy. A variation of factors makes the production of renewable energy from <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> particularly appealing. The continuous rise of energy prices, waste disposal prices, and incentives for renewable energy production have increased the value of outputs from slaughter waste-to-energy systems. The primary objective of the research is assessing the economic viability of biogas plants at abattoirs in South Africa and if such a biogas plant would be beneficial to an abattoir. The research aimed to determine the viability through various capital budgeting techniques and define what the most significant calculated variables are that should be addressed in such an economic viability model. For {{the purposes of this study}} a Class A abattoir with a slaughtering capacity of 400 cattle per day was used as a case study. Biogas will be generated through anaerobic digestion and the utilising of the gas for the generation of electricity and heat by means of a CHP generator. The economic viability study contains of a base case scenario and two other possible scenarios and provides recommendations and a concluding report, based on the scenario that is the most viable. The succeeding techniques which were recognised were used to analyse the economic viability of the biogas plant: Payback Period, Discounted payback period, Net present value, profitability index, and internal rate of return. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis was done in the study with a pessimistic and optimistic outcome on key variables. The study establish that in the base case scenario a positive net present value was realised, the internal rate of return was more than the required rate of return and the payback periods was shorter than required. In this study the concept of biogas plants in the red meat industry were researched with the purpose of determining the economic viability of these plants. In determining the viability of the biogas plant the key variables that will impact the viability was also identified and discussed. Based on the data gathered and assumptions that was made it was concluded that a biogas plant will be beneficial to an abattoir and was considered economically viable. Master...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{need for}} organic {{recycling}} is justified {{in the case}} of poultry waste because after ensuring hygienization there is a chance of obtaining a compost with substantial fertilizer value. Organic recycling of <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> has its justification in sustainable development and retardation of resources. In the research being described, composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste with maize straw was carried out. Combinations with fodder yeast and postcellulose lime were also introduced in order to modify chemical and physicochemical properties of the mixtures. The experiment was carried out within 110 days in 1. 2 × 1. 0 × 0. 8 m laboratory reactors. Temperature of the biomass was recorded during composting, and the biomass was actively aerated through a perforated bottom. Composting of substrates selected in such a way caused losses of some elements in gaseous form, an increase in concentration of other elements, and changes in relationships between elements. The ability to select substrates influences compost quality. This ability is determined by chemical indicators. Among other things, compost evaluation based on carbon to nitrogen ratio shows the intensity of the composting process and possible nitrogen losses. The addition of <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> to maize straw reduced the content of individual fractions of carbon in the composts, whereas the addition of postcellulose lime intensified that process. The addition of fodder yeast significantly increased the phosphorus content in the compost. Since iron compounds were used in the processing of poultry carcasses, composts that were based on this material had an elevated iron content. The applied postcellulose lime significantly increased the copper, zinc, chromium, nickel, and lead contents. Proper selection of substrates for composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste allows to obtain a compost with chemical properties that create favorable conditions for natural application of that compost. Addition of large quantities of postcellulose lime to the composting process leads to obtaining an organic-mineral substratum for cultivation or to obtaining an agent that improves soil properties...|$|R

The major fraction is lost {{to the environment and}} interferes with all current environmental problems and global change issues. Food is also generally consumed far from its production location and associated N losses remain unknown unless connected to products through consumption-based indicators. We develop the N food-print as an indicator to connect N flows and losses in livestock systems to the consumption of dietary N in the form of beef, pork and fresh milk in France. This N food-print of a product is the N loss associated with its agricultural production. The conversions of N, from field application to recovery in vegetal and animal proteins, are calculated from statistical data on crop and animal production and through modelling of feed rations for cattle and swine. Beef farming to feed an individual in France uses 11. 1 kg N cap− 1 yr− 1 , out of which 3. 8 kg N cap− 1 yr− 1 (or 35 %) is the N food-print, 7 % is recovered in retail products, 3 % is <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> and 55 % returns to agriculture as manure.

The general effect constituents of economic mechanism of the nonwaste production introduction, as well as economic, social and ecological effects which reflect the circumstances of the nonwaste production introduction that should be taken into consideration, have been analyzed. The economic effect includes the following effects, such as the economiceffect of waste processing into biogas; the economic effect of waste processinginto biofertilizers; the economic effect of waste processing into forage admixtures;and cost saving due to the substituting for the mixed fodder by forage admixtures. The social effect lies in the provision of agricultural enterprises and households with cheap and high-quality fertilizers. It shows the possibility of realization of poultry plant wastes as biofertilizers or forage admixtures. The ecological effect is expressed by the reducing the level of the pollutant emissions in the environment. This will lead to the reduced number of fines for environmental pollution. The general effect is calculated by the determination of the enterprise gross receipts by the factors of 1, 5 and 2 on the condition that the factors of influence are permanent...|$|R

40|$|Mobile and semi-mobile abattoirs, {{in which}} animals can be {{slaughtered}} {{on the farm}} or near the farm, could be an alternative slaughtersystem to the conventional one. This alternative is aimed to minimize stress induced by handling and transport activities on animals prior to slaughtering, and thereby attenuate the risks for reduced meat quality. More over, minimized transport could lead to reduction of environmental degradation imposed by emissions generated from vehicles. The objective {{of the project was}} to map out possibilities and constrains associated with mobile abattoirs for cattle, sheep, swine and poultry, and to identify pertinent and steering parameters and factors which may determine the development and implement of mobile abattoirs. The project included a literature review, study visits to abattoirs for cattle and swine and a mobile abattoir for deer. Interviews with relevant individuals and organisations were also carried out. The proposals for the mobile abattoirs are based on the rules and regulations set up by 'Livsmedelsverket' concerning slaughter hygiene and the animal protection act concerning handling of slaughter animals. In common, for cattle, sheep swine and poultry slaughter, the suggested mobile abattoir comprises the following components: a component for stunning, slaughter and cooling and a separate cooling component for transportation of meat. In the semi-mobile abattoir, there will also be a component for butchering of meat. Water of good hygienic quality in sufficient amounts are needed. <b>Slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> may be decomposed after being heated to 70 ° C, which might be a problem in mobile abattoir. In semi-mobile, the waste could be handled easily. It is assumed that mobile and semi-mobile abattoirs could lead to a better handling of slaughter animals, which might decrease stress and give a better quality of meat. If transport of live animals could cease, as with mobile abattoirs, many factors related to stress could be eliminated. But there will always be some factors, for example, preloading handling, that can lead to stress even in mobile abattoir system. The skills and knowledge of the personal handling the animals is very important for good animal welfare. Decreased transport, as with semi-mobile abattoirs, lead to reduction of pressure on the environment...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a statistical model to forecast, with uncertainty, {{the stock of}} Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The model provided good predictions of future biomass of Norwegian farmed salmon and {{can also be used}} to perform what-if analysis exploring the impact of varying scenarios for stocking and slaughtering. The model is based on the number of fish in each weight class (0 - 1 kg, 1 - 2 kg, [...] ., 10 + kg) and their average weight. The model, which is related to standard size-structured models, computes the number of fish growing into the next weight class the next month and the number of fish remaining in the same weight class. In addition, the number of new fish stocked, fish lost, <b>slaughtered</b> and <b>wasted,</b> as well as the sea temperature related to the growth, were modelled. All the model parameters were estimated based on monthly data from 2002 – 2007, and the model was validated statistically. Any animal production involving cycles may benefit from this forecasting tool. Key words: farmed salmon, growth model, population dynamics, stochastic model, validation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will discuss}} the {{pastoral}} care dog and the dog's role in the pastoral care. I {{will focus on the}} pastoral care within the Church of Sweden. Since the dog’s history has developed from living beside humans for shelter and <b>slaughter</b> <b>waste</b> for food, to become a beloved family member, I find the development of the relationship between dogs and humans fascinating. Nowadays the dog is also active in many professions whose main purpose is to provide health and social care. Many studies show that dogs are excellent caretakers who provides comfort for the client. Therefore, I will study how the dog is a good pastoral care taker and how the dog can be helpful in the church’s work. The purpose of this thesis is thus to examine how the dog’s pastoral care characteristics can be helpful within the pastoral care. The method for this thesis is a literature study and further a scientific procession of the material. The material will mainly be interpreted and analyzed based on a hermeneutical perspective. Since my work will touch a new field of research, there is no current studies on the pastoral care dog. I have therefore chosen to focus on studies that partly illustrates the health effects of living in relationship with dogs as well as research concerning the work of the therapy dogs. This thesis will also use literature that discuss the pastoral care mission and how that mission can be executed. The thesis has discussed which components that are needed to make a pastoral care conversation to be pastoral caring for the client. These are for example when the client experience that one is heard, listened to, confirmed and comforted. These components can, theoretically, result that the client experiences the effects of pastoral care. One of the pastoral care givers most important components is to be responsive and listen to the client's story to make the client safe enough to express their feelings. The dog seems {{to have the ability to}} introduce conversation between humans, therefore the dog’s work is quite rewarding within the pastoral care. The dog can in many ways be helpful within the pastoral care and the dog has an ability to see and confirm the client and is therefore a good compliment within the pastoral care...|$|R
