40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{man with}} {{shoulder}} pain, wasting, and weakness had ipsi-lateral cranial nerve abnormalities. Electrodiagnostic studies supported {{a diagnosis of}} neuralgic amyotrophy, but we later demonstrated a spinal ac-cessory mononeuropathy with ipsilateral hypoglossal weakness (Collet– <b>Sicard</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an inacces-sible occipital condyle mass, and disseminated adenocarcinoma was subsequently diagnosed. Although cranial mononeuropathies can occur in neuralgic amyotrophy, this case illustrates the importance of identifying a focal lesion, and highlights the localizing value of electrodiagnosis. © 199...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 57 years old female patient with neck fibrosarcoma. Her main {{complaints}} consisted of hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, {{pain in the}} left side of her neck and left shoulder region, which all indicated the Collet <b>Sicard</b> <b>syndrome,</b> so the working diagnosis was glomus tumor Diagnostic MSCT was used, and the characteristics of the radiologic finding did not indicate any of the paraganglioma types, although the tumor was localized {{in the area of the}} carotid bifurcation, demonstrating the signs of extension into the jugular foramen. The patient has been treated surgically in general anesthesia and pathologic diagnosis was fibrosarcoma. </span...|$|E
