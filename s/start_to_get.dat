5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E

As they finally <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E

25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state {{and asked me to}} go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
25|$|In Dark Magick Morgan was {{betrayed by}} the first boy she ever loved (Cal). Now Morgan must attempt {{to get on with}} her life. Morgan begins to study with Hunter, and slowly begins to realize her {{feelings}} for him. But dark magick seems to be surrounding them and someone close is to blame. Hunter and Morgan slowly <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer throughout the book. Hunter suspects that the dark magick is being used by David Redstone, owner of Practical Magick, and Morgan's friend. Morgan does everything she can to try and prove it was not him, but in the end, Hunter is right. The day before David gets stripped of his powers, Morgan and Hunter share a passionate kiss, and after Hunter strips David of his powers, he gives Morgan the stone Morganite, and it shows that Morgan is the thing/person that Hunter desires most in his heart.|$|E
25|$|After {{occupying the}} Premier League relegation zone {{throughout}} October 2005, Everton stopped Chelsea's nine-game winning {{run with a}} 1–1 draw to spark a short revival that saw the team finally <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> regular results to put much needed points on the board. However, {{this was followed by}} another dismal run including several 4–0 defeats to sides in {{the bottom half of the}} table and a one-sided derby match. A 0–1 win at Sunderland on New Year's Eve started a run of five straight Premiership wins and six matches unbeaten including victory against Arsenal — the club's best run of results since the Premiership began which hauled the team away from the relegation zone, and made a top half finish or even Europe a real possibility. This was not to be as the team remained as inconsistent as ever and a disappointing draw on the last day meant an 11th-place finish instead of moving into the top half. Inconsistency and a shortage of goals let Everton down in 2005–06, and ended their hopes of another European campaign.|$|E

500|$|The 1965 season {{brought more}} {{obstacles}} for Koufax. On March 31, {{the morning after}} pitching a complete spring training game, Koufax awoke to find that his entire left arm was black and blue from hemorrhaging. Koufax returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan, who advised Koufax {{that he would be}} lucky to be able to pitch once a week. Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games—a resolution that lasted only one <b>start.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with codeine for the pain, which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning. He also took Butazolidin for inflammation, applied capsaicin-based Capsolin ointment (called [...] "atomic balm" [...] by baseball players) before each game, and soaked his arm in a tub of ice afterwards.|$|E

Lander considers Bruno Mars a star. He adds [...] "The charisma that he has, you can’t teach.” Finishing with [...] "singer even manages to be suave in his mugshot, which is no small feat!" [...] He sees the video as a collaboration, the video director came up with the vision and Mars added his vision and so on. The video is a mixture of live action and stopped animation and through the animation Bruno shows his girlfriend how beautiful she is.

500|$|As Smith {{entered the}} 1996 season, he {{finalized}} a divorce {{from his wife}} Denise {{during the first half}} of the year. Meanwhile, manager Tony La Russa began his first season with the Cardinals in tandem with a new ownership group. After General Manager Walt Jocketty acquired shortstop Royce Clayton during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win. When spring training concluded, Smith had amassed a [...]288 batting average and zero errors in the field, and Clayton batted [...]190 with eight errors. Smith believed he had earned the position with his spring training performance, but La Russa disagreed, and awarded Clayton the majority of playing time in the platoon situation that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game. La Russa said, [...] "I think it's fair to say he misunderstood how he compared to Royce in spring training...When I and the coaches evaluated the play in spring training—the whole game—Royce started very slowly offensively and you could see him <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better. By what he was able to do defensively and on the bases, Royce deserved to play the majority of the games." ...|$|E

The songs themselves are like little Pop Art vignettes, where the lyrics are starting to match the quality of the melodies and arrangements." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media describes the album as [...] "the most important artistic leap in the Beatles' career – the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter".

2500|$|John Paesano {{sought out}} the {{composer}} role for the first Marvel/Netflix series, Daredevil, after he had previously worked with showrunner Steven S. DeKnight on a proof of concept. After successfully auditioning for the job, Paesano joined the series several weeks into post-production, and had to provide around 25–30 minutes of music per episode. He averaged [...] "around an episode every four or five days". DeKnight [...] "had a very clear vision of what he wanted. He wanted to really keep the show grounded {{and he wanted to}} make it feel real and not so fantastical like some of the other Marvel properties were. He wanted music you could feel and not necessarily hear. We cut the score to be minimalistic." [...] Once Daredevil gets his superhero costume {{at the end of the}} first season, [...] "the music starts to change color and we <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more in to that Marvel universe." [...] Due to his schedule and the style of the score, Paesano ultimately used mostly electronic sounds and music, but did try to add acoustic instruments, such as cellos, where possible to have more of a hybrid sound, often using these in non-traditional ways. Instead of more traditional percussion, Paesano used a low pulse throughout the series, emulating a heartbeat since the titular character often listens to people's heartbeats with his heightened senses. Paesano took inspiration from James Newton Howard's Michael Clayton score for the series' lawyer-oriented scenes.|$|E
