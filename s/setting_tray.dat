5000|$|... #Caption: A Mk V Fuze <b>setting</b> <b>tray</b> with a 4 in (102 mm) {{anti-aircraft}} (A/A) round. The Fuze <b>setting</b> <b>tray</b> {{received its}} fuze timing information, via electrical {{signals from the}} FKC, on a receiver dial. The operator then matched the settings on the receiver dial with the indicator dial on the tray, which then adjusted the clockwork mechanism in the A/A warhead to the calculated time of flight to the target.|$|E

The fuze setting machine {{operators}} are facing the camera, as they prepare to set the mechanical clock-work fuze in the two upper horizontal shells. As each shell's fuze is set the loaders (not shown) will remove it from the fuze setter and place it into the loading trays; the lower horizontal shells will then be automatically lifted into the fuze <b>setting</b> <b>tray</b> via the shell hoist.|$|E

50|$|The {{start of}} the harvest is {{determined}} by the publication of a harvesting permit, usually issued from late August. Harvesting is by hand using two <b>sets</b> of <b>trays.</b> One <b>set</b> of <b>trays</b> is for grapes suitable for the AOC, the other set is for grapes that can not qualify. Chiselling, the removal of damaged grapes or not immmature grapes is not permitted for the AOC grapes. Only vines aged 3 years and older are eligible for the AOC.|$|R
5000|$|The FKC {{received}} {{vertical reference}} {{information from a}} Gyro Level Corrector and aircraft altitude, range, direction, and speed input information from the Rangefinder-Director, and output to the guns the elevation and deflection data needed to hit the target, along with the correct fuze timing information, so that the shells fired would explode {{in the vicinity of}} the target aircraft. Most guns controlled by the FKC had Fuze Setting Pedestals or Fuze <b>Setting</b> <b>Trays</b> where the correct fuze timing was set on a clockwork mechanism within the AA shell warhead.|$|R
60|$|He <b>set</b> the <b>tray</b> {{down for}} her, placed {{a chair in}} front of the table, and busied himself opening the wine. All the time he was looking at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heah is yo' suppah, sah!" [...] {{announced}} Alexander, the waiter, as he <b>set</b> the <b>tray</b> on the table. [...] "Sorry I can't {{leave the}} light, sah." [...] He {{referred to a}} lamp, also, on the tray, which he now removed.|$|R

60|$|Wingrave led the {{way into}} his sitting room and {{dismissed}} his servant who was <b>setting</b> out a <b>tray</b> upon the sideboard.|$|R
60|$|There was a clink {{of glass}} at the cupboard, as Sara <b>set</b> the <b>tray</b> down. She {{came forward and}} stood behind Mrs. Rachel Lynde's chair, resting her shapely hands on that lady's broad shoulders. Her face was very pale, but her {{flashing}} eyes sought and faced defiantly Mrs. George Pye's cat-like orbs. Her voice quivered with passion and contempt.|$|R
50|$|Automatic Pill Dispensing SystemUsually {{manufactured}} with {{a rotating}} tray of some kind, these pill reminders are programmable, and usually dispense medication only {{according to the}} alarm <b>set.</b> A <b>tray</b> filled with the required dosages, dispenses and cycles at each alarm time. Some models like Med-e-lert also have a flashing light and audible alarm that sounds when a dosage is recommended.|$|R
50|$|The HADT {{provides}} target direction, range, speed, {{altitude and}} bearing {{data to the}} HACP, which transmits direction and fuse timing orders to the guns. The HACP transmits the computer generated range rate and generated bearing back to the HADT, creating a feedback loop between the HADT and HACP, so that the fire control solution generated by the computer becomes more accurate over time if the target maintains a straight line course. The HADT also observes {{the accuracy of the}} resulting shell bursts and uses these bursts to correct target speed and direction estimates, creating another feed back loop from the guns to the HADT and thence to the HACP, again increasing the accuracy of the solution, if the target maintains a straight line course. Most guns controlled by the HACS had Fuze Setting Pedestals or Fuze <b>Setting</b> <b>Trays</b> where the correct fuze timing was set on a clockwork mechanism within the AA shell warhead, so that the shell would explode {{in the vicinity of the}} target aircraft.|$|R
60|$|He <b>set</b> {{down the}} <b>tray</b> with a rattle {{and tried to}} pull the door open. But the top bolt had become displaced, and it was several seconds {{before it could be}} shot back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you have, youngster," [...] {{replied the}} captain, with a facetious wink, as he ushered his friends into the cabin, and <b>set</b> a <b>tray</b> of broken biscuit and a {{decanter}} of wine before them. [...] "The wind has been blowin' off shore the whole morning, {{and the good}} ship has been straining at a short cable like a hound chained up. But we'll be off now in another half-hour." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was too}} soon. She rose, {{and went}} {{across the room to}} a drawer, taking out a little tray-cloth. There was {{something}} quiet and professional about her. She had been a nurse beside her husband, both in Warsaw and in the rebellion afterwards. She proceeded to <b>set</b> a <b>tray.</b> It was as if she ignored Brangwen. He sat up, unable to bear a contradiction in her. She moved about inscrutably.|$|R
5000|$|RN destroyers were {{hampered}} {{by the lack of}} good dual-purpose weapons suitable for ships of destroyer size; for much of the war 40° was the maximum elevation of the 4.7 inch guns equipping such ships, which were consequently unable to engage directly attacking dive bombers, although they could provide barrage and predicted fire to protect other ships from such attacks. [...] Destroyers did not use HACS, but rather the Fuze Keeping Clock (FKC), a simplified version of HACS. [...] Starting in 1938 all new RN destroyers, from the Tribal class onwards, were fitted with a FKC and continuous prediction fuse <b>setting</b> <b>trays</b> for each main armament gun. [...] WWII experience from all navies showed that dive bombers could not be engaged successfully by any remote computer predictive AA system using mechanical fuzes due to the lag time in the computer and the minimum range of optical rangefinders. [...] In common with other contemporary navies, pre-war designed RN destroyers suffered from a lack of short range, rapid fire, AA with which to engage dive bombers.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the servant}} {{came in with}} a <b>tray,</b> <b>set</b> it down, lit a naked gas-jet, which roared faintly, and drew down a crackly dark-green blind, which showed a {{tendency}} to fly back again alertly to the ceiling.|$|R
6000|$|Hemlock Jim {{deliberately}} <b>set</b> {{down his}} <b>tray,</b> the Ontario bushman seemed gathering himself together for some purpose, {{and there was}} an ominous glitter in Johnston's eyes, while just as I expected the fray to begin, the proprietor called out laughingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody {{inside there}} talking secrets," [...] {{observed}} the younger lady. [...] "I {{think it is}} Mr. Shackleby, and I don't like that man. Charley, <b>set</b> down that <b>tray</b> and carry my chair and Mrs. Leslie's {{at least a dozen}} yards away." ...|$|R
5000|$|The almost-identical Mk XII gun was {{deployed}} in twin mountings CP Mk XIX on the Tribal class destroyers of 1936 and J, K and N classes of 1938. This mounting limited the maximum elevation to 40 degrees, but all twin CP Mk XIX were dual-purpose mountings and were equipped with Fuze Setting Pedestals or Mk V Fuze <b>Setting</b> <b>Trays,</b> {{to allow the}} mountings to be fired against aircraft while being controlled by the Fuze Keeping Clock fire control computer. Typical maximum rate of fire was twelve rounds per gun, per minute. During gunnery trials in 1930, HMS Basilisk was able to fire [...] "...five rounds in 17 seconds." [...] The Mk XII gun fired a 50 lb shell and used a separate cartridge, with both shell and cartridge being loaded via a loading tray, with power ramming, elevation, and traverse. The maximum range at 40 degrees elevation was 16,970 yards (15,520 m) fired at the new gun muzzle velocity of 2,650 fps (808 m/s). The 40-degree elevation was justified {{on the grounds that}} destroyers would be screening the battle-fleet during aerial attack, and 40 degrees elevation was adequate to engage aircraft that were concentrating their attack on other ships.|$|R

60|$|She {{entered his}} room collectedly. He was lying, neatly dressed, upon a couch with his {{shoulders}} raised against {{the end of}} it, for he had thrown the cushions which supported him upon the floor. As she came in, he leaned down {{in an attempt to}} recover them, and finding himself too late looked up guiltily. The fact that he could move with so much freedom was a comfort to the girl. She <b>set</b> the <b>tray</b> down on a table near him.|$|R

60|$|The {{face of the}} Italian flashed with a non-comprehending smile, he {{finished}} <b>setting</b> out the <b>tray,</b> and was gone. He did not understand: he would understand nothing: he disappeared from the door like a half-domesticated wild animal. It made Ursula shudder slightly, the quick, sharp-sighted, intent animality of the man.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Paraphernalia Set {{is made up}} of {{personal}} utensils of the monarch for daily use which were bestowed on members of the royal family, courtiers and officials, both male and female. The Royal Paraphernalia Set includes items such as betel nut <b>tray</b> <b>sets,</b> betel nut boxes, spittoons, cylindrical kettles and water pitchers.|$|R
60|$|I {{enjoyed it}} so little, indeed, that I fell to poking the sitting-room fire {{when she entered}} with the Mercury; and read the Mercury assiduously while she brought in breakfast.

50|$|The game of Canasta was {{devised by}} Segundo Santos and Alberto Serrato in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1939. In the 1940s the game quickly spread in myriad {{variations}} to Chile, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, where its rules were further refined before {{being introduced to}} the United States in 1948, where it was then {{referred to as the}} Argentine Rummy game by Ottilie H. Reilly in 1949 and Michael Scully of Coronet magazine in 1953. The game quickly became a card-craze boom in the 1950s providing a sales avalanche of card <b>sets,</b> card <b>trays</b> and books about the subject.|$|R
50|$|Later that afternoon, Sylvain Dreyfus and a chemist, Nathan Daniels, {{were in the}} nitrating {{section of}} the works when the {{contents}} of number nine nitrator became unstable. Despite a frantic effort led by Dreyfus to bring the reaction under control, {{the contents of the}} vessel boiled over and set fire to the wooden staging around it. The fire quickly took hold, spreading to the roof. Workers fought to bring the blaze under control to no avail. The flames spread to an area where five tons of TNT packed into kegs was stored. A call was made to the local police station for assistance at around 16.20pm. A few minutes later the works was torn apart by an explosion. It destroyed the factory and threw heavy objects long distances. Most of the workers were killed instantly, including Dreyfus, whose dismembered body was found in the factory yard. The factory was obliterated and two large craters scarred the site. A large crater, where the kegs of TNT had been stored, was about 90 ft by 36 ft across and 5 ft deep. A smaller, shallow crater was just below where the dryer and <b>setting</b> <b>trays</b> used for the final preparation of the TNT had been. Two gasometers in a nearby street were ripped open by the blast, sending a massive fireball hundreds of feet into the air. Hundreds of buildings in the surrounding area were damaged, leaving many of the nearby houses uninhabitable.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s newborn babies at the {{hospital}} had a room off the maternity ward and were [...] "all carefully numbered and ticketed". They slept in [...] "a series of wooden <b>trays</b> <b>set</b> round the walls", according to the writer John Hay Beith. The babies' bathroom had basins where a nurse could control the water by foot, leaving both hands free for handling the baby.|$|R
50|$|Once processed, {{the chips}} were re-inserted {{into the cell}} they {{had been removed from}} earlier. They were then moved out of the reader and into the 1351 Cell File & Control or {{additional}} storage-only 1362 Cell File units. Note the numbering; these units were intended to be shared with the 1350 system. Each file contained 75 trays (5x5 x 3 deep) holding 30 cells each, for a total of 2,250 cells, containing 1/2 a terabit. The system installed at LLNL used one 1361 and one 1362 for a total of one terabit, but other installations typically had two more 1362's for a total of 2 terabits. Cells could be manually moved about by loading them into the front-and-bottom-most <b>set</b> of <b>trays,</b> which could be removed.|$|R
60|$|She <b>set</b> {{down the}} <b>tray,</b> spread his supper, and went away without a word. On her arrival below the landlady, {{who was as}} kind as she was fat and lazy, saw that Elizabeth-Jane was rather tired, though in her earnestness to be useful she was waiving her own needs altogether. Mrs. Stannidge thereupon said with a {{considerate}} peremptoriness {{that she and her}} mother had better take their own suppers if they meant to have any.|$|R

6000|$|... "See here, sister," [...] she said, {{looking at}} Mrs. Deane, as she <b>set</b> the <b>tray</b> on the table, [...] "I thought, perhaps, {{if you looked}} at the teapot again,--it's a good while since you saw it,--you might like the pattern better; it makes {{beautiful}} tea, and there's a stand and everything; you might use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy when she goes to housekeeping. I should be so loath for 'em to buy it at the Golden Lion," [...] said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and the tears coming,--"my teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of its being scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and my letters on it,--see here, E. D.,--and everybody to see 'em." ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 18th {{century to the}} first quarter of the 19th, as the export trade increased, so did the demand from Europe for familiar, {{utilitarian}} forms. European forms such as mugs, ewers, tazza, and candlesticks were unknown in China so models were sent to the Chinese silversmith to be copied. Chinese silversmiths basically made these objects completely based on prototypes from England and America. Common items were tea and coffee <b>sets,</b> spoon, forks, <b>trays</b> and other flat wares.|$|R
