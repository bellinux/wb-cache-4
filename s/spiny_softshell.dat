40|$|Abstract Several {{studies have}} shown that wetland loss and habitat {{fragmentation}} can alter diversity and abundance of herpetofauna, but taxonomic attention has been skewed towards amphibians. We assessed responses of aquatic turtles to features at multiple spatial scales in an intensively farmed region of the Midwestern United States. Spatially hierarchical sampling was conducted from 2001 to 2003 in 35 randomly selected 23 -km 2 cells throughout the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana. Hoop nets were used at wetlands to capture common snapping turtles (Chely-dra serpentina serpentina) (n= 258), midland painted turtles (Chrysemys picta marginata) (151), eastern <b>spiny</b> <b>softshells</b> (Apalone spinifera spinifera) (70), red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) (59), northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) (27), false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica pseudogeographica) (6), Blanding’s turtles (Emy-doidea blandingii) (3), and stinkpot turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) (3). We examined the degree to which these aquatic species were nonrandomly distributed in 14 landscapes. Assemblages of turtles generally were random and the extent of nestedness was influenced by the diversity of landcover, the proportion of grassland, and the total length of roads in each landscape. The occurrence and abundance of several species also were modeled to test hypotheses regarding the importance of site, patch, and landscape-level variables. Red-eared sliders appeared to be most sensitive to habitat fragmentation, whereas pain-ted turtles, snapping turtles, map turtles, and <b>spiny</b> <b>softshells</b> were less affected. Factors at multiple spatial scales affect turtle distributions, suggesting differential responses to landscape fragmentation...|$|R

50|$|The <b>spiny</b> <b>{{softshell}}</b> turtle (Apalone spinifera) is {{a species}} of softshell turtle, {{one of the largest}} freshwater turtle species in North America. Both the common name, <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell,</b> and the specific name, spinifera (spine-bearing), refer to the spiny, cone-like projections on {{the leading edge of the}} carapace, which are not scutes (scales).|$|E
5000|$|The Bellows Bay portion {{is home to}} the <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle and the map turtle. This is {{the only}} known {{location}} on the Ottawa River for the <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell,</b> which is designated as [...] "Threatened" [...] under the Canadian Species At Risk Act, while the map turtle is designated as [...] "Special Concern".|$|E
50|$|Smooth {{softshell}} turtles may {{be easily}} {{confused with the}} <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle (Apalone spinifera), as {{the differences between the}} two species are subtle. <b>Spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtles have a rough carapace with spines along the front edge while, as the name implies, smooth softshell turtles lack such spines. Additionally, the white chin and throat of the smooth softshell are unmarked, compared to the splotchy chin and throat of the <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell.</b> A. mutica is the only species of North American softshell with round nostrils; all other species have ridges on the nasal septum which make the nostrils C-shaped.|$|E
50|$|Apalone mutica is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle (Apalone spinifera) {{over much of}} its range.|$|E

50|$|Two {{amphibians}} {{are named}} after Hartweg: Hartweg's salamander Bolitoglossa hartwegi and Hartweg's spikethumb frog Plectrohyla hartwegi. A subspecies of turtle, western <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle Apalone spinifera hartwegi, and of lizard, Hartweg's emerald lizard Sceloporus taeniocnemis hartwegi, are also named after him.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtles are {{carnivores}} preying {{mostly on}} invertebrates, such as, crayfish and aquatic insects. When they are large enough they will occasionally prey upon small fish. They find their food underneath rocks, logs, branches, {{along the floor}} of lakes, rivers, and streams, and in vegetation. They will sometimes hide in the floor substrate and ambush prey as it swims by.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtles {{have few}} natural predators including, large predatory fish, raccoons, herons, skunks, red foxes, and {{occasionally}} humans. Their nests are often destroyed by raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Young softshell turtles are eaten by raccoons, herons, and large fish; adults, {{on the other}} hand, are killed and eaten only by humans. Being shy creatures they will quickly dive and hide under mud and sand to avoid predators.|$|E
5000|$|Feather Lake is a 43.5 acre {{wildlife}} sanctuary {{based on a}} 40 acre wetland built by the City of El Paso in 1969 as a stormwater-retention basin.

Over 200 different species of birds, especially those associated with water, have been observed at the sanctuary. Fauna residing there include muskrats, <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtles, pond sliders, and Trans-Pecos striped whiptail lizards.|$|E
50|$|White-tailed {{deer are}} common {{throughout}} the park, {{as well as}} raccoons, armadillos, coyote and Fox squirrels. Many bird species {{are found in the}} park such as the Northern Mockingbird, Northern Cardinal, Greater Roadrunner, Carolina Wren, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Painted Bunting and Mourning Dove. Areas in and around the creeks are inhabited by the Guadalupe <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle, Red-eared slider, Alligator snapping turtle and Blanchard's cricket frog. Many species of snakes such as the Texas rat snake, Texas indigo racer and Western diamondback rattlesnake are also found.|$|E
50|$|San Solomon Springs is a {{collection}} of artesian springs located near the small towns of Toyahvale and Balmorhea in Reeves County, Texas. Between 20 million and 28 million US gallons (90,850 cubic meters) of water a day flow from the springs, supplying water for a 1.75-acre (7100 square meter) swimming hole before flowing through a reconstructed marsh, all located within Balmorhea State Park. The springs line the sandy bottom of the central portion of the swimming hole, approximately twenty-five feet (7.6 meters) beneath the water's surface. The pool is home to several species of fish and turtles, including the Texas <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle.|$|E
50|$|These turtles are diurnal animals, {{spending}} {{most of the day}} basking in the sun and foraging for food. They are often seen sunning themselves on logs, river banks, or lake shores. If disturbed, they will quickly retreat into the water and bury themselves in sand, leaving only their heads visible. Like most turtles, they are able to breathe underwater for extended periods of time. They will spend the colder months underwater, buried in the mud or sand in a state of dormancy. When bothered, <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtles will extend their long necks and snap viciously at their attacker, inflicting a painful bite.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Norman Edouard [...] "Kibe" [...] Hartweg (1904 - February 16, 1964) was an American herpetologist, Curator of Herpetology for the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan, and {{president}} of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. He was a specialist in the taxonomy and distribution of turtles, and is honored by having a subspecies of turtle named after him: the western <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle, Apalone spinifera hartwegi. He is also credited with having described several new species, including the Big Bend slider, Trachemys gaigeae, the Oaxacan patchnose snake, Salvadora intermedia, and Dunn's hognose pit viper, Porthidium dunni.|$|E
50|$|Spiny softshells begin mating {{between ages}} 8 and 10. A large female turtle may {{live up to}} 50 years. The turtles mate in mid-to-late spring in deep water. The male will nudge the female's head while swimming, and if she chooses to mate, the male will swim above the female without {{clasping}} her with his claws (unlike other turtles). A few months later, the female turtle quickly lays her eggs along a sunny sandbar or gravel bank in a flask-shaped cavity she has dug close to the water. The turtle nests more than once during a single season. She can lay between 9 and 38 round, calcareous-shelled eggs. The eggs are laid around August and September, and they hatch in the spring. Unlike in other turtles, in the <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle, {{the sex of the}} hatchlings is not determined by temperature variations; it is determined by genetics.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{sea turtles}} live along the Atlantic coast, {{including}} the hawksbill sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, and loggerhead sea turtle. The {{green sea turtle}} and leatherback sea turtle are more common species along the southeastern coastline. Land turtles and tortoises found {{throughout most of the}} Eastern United States are the common snapping turtle, painted turtle, spotted turtle, diamondback terrapin, <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell</b> turtle, eastern mud turtle, northern red-bellied cooter, common musk turtle, eastern box turtle, and the yellow- and red-eared slider. While common species in the northeast include Blanding's turtle, wood turtle, and bog turtle, common species in the southeastern U.S. include gopher tortoise, pond slider, Escambia map turtle, Barbour's map turtle, eastern river cooter, striped mud turtle, loggerhead musk turtle, and the Florida softshell turtle. The smooth softshell turtle is for instance found in the Ohio River and the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5000|$|They {{are called}} [...] "softshell" [...] because their {{carapace}}s lack horny scutes (scales), though the <b>spiny</b> <b>softshell,</b> Apalone spinifera, {{does have some}} scale-like projections, hence its name. The carapace is leathery and pliable, particularly at the sides. The {{central part of the}} carapace has a layer of solid bone beneath it, as in other turtles, but this is absent at the outer edges. Some species also have dermal bones in the plastron, but these are not attached to the bones of the shell. The light and flexible shell of these turtles allows them to move more easily in open water, or in muddy lake bottoms. Having a soft shell also allows them to move much faster on land than most turtles. Their feet are webbed and are three-clawed, hence the family name [...] "Trionychidae," [...] which means [...] "three-clawed." [...] The carapace color of each type of softshell turtle tends to match the sand and/or mud color of its geographical region, assisting in their [...] "lie and wait" [...] feeding methodology.|$|E
