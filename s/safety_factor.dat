25|$|For {{occupant}} comfort, {{the building}} has a tuned mass damper, which also negates much of the wind load. The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, say during a hurricane, the damper might not turn on and a much lower-speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> of 1:1 instead of the column <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger. The problems were discovered in June, the beginning of hurricane season, {{and had to be}} corrected quickly.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{quantitative}} evolutionary design uses evolutionary reasoning (in terms {{of natural selection}} and ultimate causation) to understand the magnitudes of biological reserve capacities, i. e. excesses of capacities over natural loads. Ratios of capacities to loads, defined as <b>safety</b> <b>factors,</b> fall in the range 1. 2 - 10 for most engineered and biological components, even though engineered <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> are specified intentionally by humans while biological <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> arise through natural selection. Familiar examples of engineered <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> include those of buildings, bridges and elevators (lifts), while biological examples include factors of bones and other structural elements, of enzymes and transporters, and of organ metabolic performances. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> serve to minimize the overlap zone (resulting in performance failure) between the low tail of capacity distributions and the high tail of load distributions. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> increase with coefficients of variation of load and capacity, with capacity deterioration with time, and with cost of failure, and decrease with costs of initial construction, maintenance, operation, and opportunity. Adaptive regulation of many biological systems involves capacity increases with increasing load; several quantitative examples suggest sublinear increases, such that <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> decrease towards 1. 0. Unsolved questions include <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> of series systems, parallel or branched pathways, elements with multiple functions, enzyme reaction chains, and equilibrium enzymes. The modest sizes of <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> imply the existence of costs that penalize excess capacities. Those costs are likely to involve wasted energy or space for large or expensive components, but opportunity costs of wasted space {{at the molecular level}} for minor components...|$|R

25|$|The {{length of}} axons' myelinated {{segments}} {{is important to}} the success of saltatory conduction. They should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of Ranvier. In nature, myelinated segments are generally long enough for the passively propagated signal to travel for at least two nodes while retaining enough amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node. Thus, the <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> of saltatory conduction is high, allowing transmission to bypass nodes in case of injury. However, action potentials may end prematurely in certain places where the <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is low, even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the branch point of an axon, where it divides into two axons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a study about safety of reinforced concrete beams subjected to bending moment and designed with the partial <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> proposed by ABNT NBR 6118 : 2014. The main {{goal was to}} assess the uniformity in the safety of the beams considering different values for the neutral axis position and the load ratio, by using the Reliability Theory. A simplified procedure to calibrate the partial <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> was proposed taking into account the nature of each random variable and a target reliability index. From the analysis of the results, an alternative method for the design of reinforced concrete beams was also proposed, in which safety is guaranteed by the using of a probability of failure instead a set of partial <b>safety</b> <b>factors.</b> The results showed the lack of uniformity in the safety of the beams design with de constant set of partial <b>safety</b> <b>factors.</b> The procedures of design and calibration of the new <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> were capable of to give uniformity to the safety of the beams and to achieve the proper structural configuration with the required safety level...|$|R

25|$|The {{safety margin}} for solid {{tantalum}} capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte is typically between 2 and 4. That means {{that for a}} 25V tantalum capacitor with a safety margin of 4 the dielectric voltage proof can withstand 100V {{to provide a more}} robust dielectric.

25|$|Because of its simplicity, the {{principal}} coordinate system is often useful {{when considering the}} state of the elastic medium at a particular point. Principal stresses are often expressed in the following equation for evaluating stresses in the x and y directions or axial and bending stresses on a part. The principal normal stresses can then be used to calculate the von Mises stress and ultimately the <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> and margin of safety.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to biological barriers, the conference advocated {{the use of}} additional safety factors. One such <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> was physical containment, exemplified {{by the use of}} hoods or where applicable, limited access or negative pressure laboratories. Another factor was the strict adherence to good microbiological practices, which would limit the escape of organisms from the experimental situation. Additionally, the education and training of all personnel involved in the experiments would be essential to effective containment measures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{surprising}} {{incidence of}} nonlethal skeletal fractures implies that many organisms operate near their upper performance limits, yet we {{know little about}} the loads at which biological structures break or about the material properties of those structures. In addition, biologically re-alistic estimates of how closely normal maximal loads ap-proach breaking strengths (i. e., <b>safety</b> <b>factors)</b> remain elu-sive. We measured cuticular breaking strength (a material property) and <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> (breaking force/maximum bit-ing force) for intact claws of six species of predatory Can-cer crabs (Crustacea, Brachyura). Cuticular breaking stresses in Cancer claws (40 - 120 MN md 2) exceeded those reported for the carapace of shore crabs (Carcinus) and swimming crabs (Scylla), but were similar to published values for the claws of stone crabs (Menippe). Cuticular breaking strength increased towards {{the tip of the}} pollex (fixed finger), correlated with visible changes in the claw cuticle, but decreased with increasing claw size. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> of the pollex varied within and among Cancer spe-cies and ranged from 2 to 7. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> increased with increasing claw size (Kmanus length’. (j), due to propor-tionally thicker cuticle (Kmanus length’. 3 ’i- 0. 078) and proportionally lower maximum biting forces (Emanus lengthl. 49 % 0. 0 S 2). Why larger crabs have proportionally lower biting forces remains an important unsolved problem. The higher <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> of larger claws appear adaptive, however, since costs of failure and unpredictability of cu-ticle strength increase with increasing size. Patterns of in-traspecific size-dependence offer an attractive test of whether <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> vary adaptively. A brief review of the literature suggests that positive size-dependence often sig-nals adaptive variation in <b>safety</b> <b>factors,</b> whereas negativ...|$|R

25|$|Yielded {{structures}} {{have a lower}} stiffness, {{leading to}} increased deflections and decreased buckling strength. The structure will be permanently deformed when the load is removed, and may have residual stresses. Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state. Highly optimized structures, such as airplane beams and components, rely on yielding as a fail-safe failure mode. No <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is therefore needed when comparing limit loads (the highest loads expected during normal operation) to yield criteria.|$|E

40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> of enzymes and {{transporters}} {{are defined}} as the ratio of Vmax (maximal reaction rates at high substrate concentrations) to the reaction rate under actual physiological conditions. Although corresponding <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> have been measured for macroscopic biological structures and for human-engineered structures, <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> have been little studied at the molecular level. Some evolutionary considerations suggest that <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> should be modestly in excess of 1. 0 (“enough but not too much”) and should tend to be similar for the various steps of a pathway consisting {{of two or more}} elements arranged in series. Hence we used a preparation of intact mouse small intestine to measure Vmax values (capacities) of brush-border sucrase (yielding glucose plus fructose) and of the brush-border glucose transporter, for comparison {{with each other and with}} dietary sucrose loads. Load was manipulated by varying dietary sucrose level or by studying lactating mice with increased energy requirements. Capacities both of sucrase and the glucose transporter increased with sucrose load (i. e., both proteins are inducible) and remained approximately matched to each other except on a carbohydrate-free diet. Their <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> decreased from ca. 2. 7 at low load to 1. 0 at high load. Thus, neither sucrase nor the glucose transporter is the rate-limiting step for sucrose digestion; both steps are equally limiting. The modest <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> and matched capacities must be genetically programmed through natural selection, with benefits of excess capacities being balanced against costs of biosynthetic energy and limited membrane space...|$|R
