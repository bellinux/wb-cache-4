But the shift to an anti-inflationary monetary policy was also the effect of the intellectual revolution that had taken place.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{document}} forgery {{is becoming}} a real issue. A large amount of documents that contain critical information as <b>payment</b> <b>slips,</b> invoices or contracts, are constantly subject to fraudster manipulation {{because of the lack}} of security regarding this kind of document. Previously, a system to detect fraudulent documents based on its intrinsic features has been presented. It was especially designed to retrieve copy-move forgery and imperfection due to fraudster manipulation. However, when a set of characters is not present in the original document, copy-move forgery is not feasible. Hence, the fraudster will use a text toolbox to add or modify information in the document by imitating the font or he will cut and paste characters from another document where the font properties are similar. This often results in font type errors. Thus, a clue to detect document forgery consists of finding characters, words or sentences in a document with font properties different from their surroundings. To this end, we present in this paper an automatic forgery detection method based on document font features. Using the Conditional Random Field a measurement of probability that a character belongs to a specific font is made by comparing the character font features to a knowledge database. Then, the character is classified as a genuine or a fake one by comparing its probability to belong to a certain font type with those of the neighboring characters...|$|R

40|$|Twice a day, {{dairy farmers}} in the Kheda {{district}} of Gujarat, India, visit one of the district´s 600 village dairy cooperative societies to sell their milk at a one-stop dairy shop - an innovative IT-supported milk collection system, comprising a weighing scale, a fat-content testing device and a mechanism to calculate the amount payable. In a typical transaction, the farmer pours the milk into a steel trough, the milk is weighed, and a sample is taken to check the fat content. The farmer then inserts a plastic identity card, or smart card, with a unique code into a reader that is connected to a computer. The PC calculates and prints outs a <b>payment</b> <b>slip,</b> which the farmer presents to the cashier for payment. The whole process takes just a few minutes. The one-stop shop approach is an initiative of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to meet the growing national demand for milk, {{one of the main}} sources of protein and calcium for the largely vegetarian population. The NDDB has launched a programme to double the amount of milk collected in the next six years, and to improve the production, processing and marketing of milk and milk products. The computerized system has successfully replaced the inaccurate and inefficient traditional methods of milk collection, where the fat content testing and payment were separate processes. In most cases, it took hours to calculate fat content, and farmers were only paid every ten days. In contrast, the one-stop dairy shop enables accurate and immediate payment, and saves time for everyone involved - the farmers, the cooperative societies, and the state. The net result has been a dramatic increase in efficiency and productivity. There are now 2500 one-stop shops, which receive milk from 400, 000 farmers daily. With about 70, 000 village cooperative societies throughout India, the potential to improve the performance of the dairy sector nationwide is truly staggering. The system has already brought many benefits, including the elimination of fraud, improved financial accounting and thus greater transparency, as well as generating employment in rural areas. DISK The automation of the milk collection process is only the first step in changing the dairy cooperative societies into full-fledged information and marketing hubs for farming communities. The next step is {{the development and implementation of}} the Dairy Information Services Kiosk (DISK), a system that will offer additional information services for the members of the dairy cooperative societies. Developed by the Centre for eGovernance at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (CEG-IIMA) and the AMUL dairy cooperative in Kaira, DISK builds on the existing PC-based milk collection and billing systems and includes a wide range of software and multimedia applications. DISK will enable dairy farmers to receive <b>payment</b> <b>slips</b> containing information on the quality of their milk, the health status of their dairy cattle, and the availability of services such as artificial insemination, veterinary advice, cattle feed suppliers, etc. The CEG-IIMA has also developed a [URL] Dairy Portal, an online interface between the cooperative societies and village farmers. This pilot website contains technical information and multimedia content in Gujarati and English for farmers, extension workers and researchers on modern dairying and related practices. The portal could also include an e-banking module, enabling the milk payments to be made directly into a farmer´s bank account, access to insurance and loan facilities, price information and an online livestock market. The above features were implemented in an experiment which was partially successful. Further work is needed on the development of the portal and on selling the concept to the dairy cooperative societies. mailto:ramarao@iimahd. ernet. in Professor T. P.

40|$|Two new {{enforcement}} instruments As of January 2009, Dutch municipalities {{can make}} use of two new instruments for out-of-court settlements of public order violations: the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’ and the ‘bestuurlijke boete overlast’. These instruments give local law enforcers the authority to issue an penalty for minor punishable offences such as stray dogs, dog droppings, household waste dumps or violation of other local bylaws. In {{the case of the}} ‘bestuurlijke boete’ the municipality is responsible for the administrative process. In the case of the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’, the municipality sends the written charge (‘proces-verbaal’) to the Central Fine Collection Agency (‘Centraal Justitieel Incassobureau or CJIB) after which the CJIB sends a copy of the charge with a giro <b>payment</b> <b>slip</b> to the accused. If the accused refuses to pay the penalty, the case is submitted to the public prosecutor for further judgement. After that, the case can be brought to court. If the fine is paid, the case will not be evaluated by the public prosecutor. Evaluation Three years after the introduction of both instruments, this evaluation has been conducted. To what extent have both instruments been implemented by municipalities? What are the results of the instruments and of the financial compensatory allowance scheme? To answer these questions, DSP-groep has conducted research from November 2011 to April 2012 for the Scientific Research and Documentation Center (WODC) of the Ministry of Security and Justice. The legal framework and the legal and political reasoning resulting in the introduction of both instruments has been studied by Prof. Mr. Dr. Arthur Hartmann of Erasmus University, Rotterdam. DSP-groep conducted the rest of the research: a survey among Dutch municipalities in which 301 municipalities participated (72 % response), in-depth interviews with 23 representatives of six municipalities and representatives of the CJIB, the Central Processing Unit of the Public Prosecution Service (CVOM) and the Ministries of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, DSP-groep has performed a quantitative analysis on a database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ issued between early 2009 and February 2012 (over 50. 000 cases). The CVOM has analysed all cases that have been evaluated by the Public Prosecution Service and cantonal judges. An independent committee has supervised the progress and quality of the research.

Health care accounts for a large and growing share of economic activity in the United States, nearly doubling as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in the period between 1980 and 2011, from 9. 2 percent to 17. 9 percent. Growth in spending slowed somewhat in 2010 and 2011. Though the causes of this slowdown are debated, the economic downturn beginning in 2008 has likely had an effect on health care spending, since fewer people have insurance and those with insurance may delay care because of cost concerns. The level of and growth in health care spending significantly affect federal and state budgets since government payers directly sponsor nearly half of all health care spending.
