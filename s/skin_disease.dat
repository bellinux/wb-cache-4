5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> of the pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages {{are thought to}} occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> encountered in general practice represents {{a substantial part}} of morbidity in children. Only limited information is available about the frequency of specific <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> We aimed to compare incidence rates of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in children in general practice between 1987 and 2001. Methods We used data on all children aged 0 – 17 years derived from two consecutive surveys performed in Dutch general practice in 1987 and 2001. Both surveys concerned a longitudinal registration of GP consultations over 12 months. Each disease episode was coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care. Incidence rates of separate <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> were calculated by dividing all new episodes for each distinct ICPC code by the average study population at risk. Data were stratified for socio-demographic characteristics. Results The incidence rate of all <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> combined in general practice decreased between 1987 and 2001. Among infants the incidence rate increased. Girls presented more <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> to the GP. In {{the southern part of the}} Netherlands children consulted their GP more often for <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> compared to the northern part. Children of non-Western immigrants presented relatively more <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> to the GP. In general practice incidence rates of specific <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> such as impetigo, dermatophytosis and atopic dermatitis increased in 2001, whereas warts, contact dermatitis and skin injuries decreased. Conclusion The overall incidence rate of all <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> combined in general practice decreased whereas the incidence rates of bacterial, mycotic and atopic <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> increased. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{symptoms}} of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> {{have been shown}} to negatively affect patients' wellbeing. Although insight into physical symptoms accompanying <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> is relevant for the management and treatment of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> the prevalence of physical symptoms among patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> is a rather unexplored territory. OBJECTIVES: The goal {{of the present study was}} to examine the prevalence of physical {{symptoms of}} itch, pain and fatigue in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: On the basis of a systematic morbidity registration system in primary care, questionnaires were sent to 826 patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Eventually, questionnaires from 492 patients were suitable for our analyses. RESULTS: Results indicated that patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> particularly experience symptoms of itch and fatigue. Approximately 50 % of all patients report experiencing these symptoms and about 25 % experience these symptoms as relatively severe. Pain was relatively less frequently reported by 23 % of all patients, and was on average somewhat less intense. The physical symptoms showed relatively strong correlations with disease-related quality of life and self-reported disease severity. In contrast, only moderate correlations were found with comorbidity and demographic variables, which suggests that the physical symptoms of itch, pain and fatigue are consequences of the <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Itch and fatigue and, to a somewhat lesser extent, pain have a high prevalence among patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Clinicians should be encouraged to carefully assess itch, pain and fatigue in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> and where appropriate focus treatment to these symptoms...|$|R

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable <b>skin</b> <b>disease,</b> was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved in the actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E
5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially infectious and allergic <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> encountered in general practice represents {{a substantial part}} of the morbidity in children. Only limited information is available about the epidemiology of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in children in general practice and many questions in this field are still unanswered. In this thesis, after a general overview of all skin related morbidity in children in general practice, we will focus on the changes in the incidence and management of infectious <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> during the past decades. Moreover, we aim to identify determinants that are associated with the incidence of infectious <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in children encountered in general practice in order to provide tools for improvement of general practice care and prevention of infectious <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> and their complications. We performed an observational study comparing data of the two Dutch national surveys. The setting of the research was general practice as, in the Netherlands, the majority of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> were diagnosed and treated by general practitioners. In chapter 2 we compared incidence rates of all <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> presented by children aged 0 – 17 years in general practice between 1987 and 2001...|$|R
40|$|Chronic <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are known}} to be common among the general population. Nevertheless, little {{research}} {{attention has been paid to}} patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in the general population, and consequently, little is known about the impact of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> on daily life within this population. General definitions of health encompass different dimensions of disease outcome divided in disease severity, accompanying physical symptoms, and psychosocial well-being. These dimensions of disease outcome influence the impact of a disease on daily life. Additionally, it is generally assumed that disease outcome interacts with psychological factors. So far, research on disease outcome in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> has primarily focused on <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> most frequently encountered on dermatological wards, such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, leaving unaddressed many types of skin conditions and patients not seen on dermatological wards. Moreover, studies usually examine disease outcome at times when patients contact their health care provider, which is presumably when symptoms are worse, which might in turn lead to biased conclusions about the general impact of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> on patients in daily life. Finally, few attempts have been made to investigate psychological factors associated with disease outcome in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Consequently, the role of specific psychological factors in the maintenance and exacerbation of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> is unclear. The present thesis examines <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> both in general practice and on dermatological wards. First, the impact of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> on general practice patients was investigated (chapter 2. 1, 2. 2 and 2. 3) with emphasis on disease outcome according to general models of health. Then, this thesis evaluates the influence of psychological factors on disease outcome in patients with chronic <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> seen on dermatological wards. After a general review (chapter 3. 1), this thesis particularly emphasizes on patients with psoriasis (chapter 3. 2 and 3. 3...|$|R

5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to get close to the wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare <b>skin</b> <b>disease.</b> They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were threefold: to determine the prevalence of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> among primary school children in the UAE; to assess the ability of the primary health care physicians (PCPs) to diagnose skin diseases; and to plan a dermatological education program for children of the UAE. An epidemiological survey included the clinical examination of selected school children by two quantified dermatologists and the relationships between the prevalence of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> and a range of hygiene and socioeconomic factors were examined. 1536 Local schoolchildren aged 6 - 9 years were included. The prevalence of common <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in the children was 19 %. The most common <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> included: dermatitis (8. 1 %), viral diseases (3. 8 %), and pigmentation disorders (1. 7 %). Selected <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> showed significant associations with a range of socioeconomic and hygiene factors on multivariate analyses. Physicians were better at correctly diagnosing common <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> compared with the less frequent, or rare <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Finally, PCPs with specific training in dermatology showed more ability to diagnose a range of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> compared with those with no relevant training. Based on the results of this study, an improvement in socioeconomic and personal hygiene conditions along with the initiation of pertinent educational programs for children, patients and teachers may reduce the prevalence of some skin disorders. Important aspects of such dermatological health care programs are proposed. In addition, specific dermatological training for PCPs should be considered to increase their ability to diagnose and manage common <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in children.
