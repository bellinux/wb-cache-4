These can then {{be used as a}} rationale for restricting safeguard measures to non-discrimination. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRelationship banking {{is treated}} {{as one of the}} most {{important}} factors determining finance accessibility, especially in case of small and medium-sized businesses. The paper focuses on theoretical and methodological reasoning of changes in relationship banking in light of changing economic conditions and use of IT as communication channel. Thus the problem researched is twofold: the scope and importance of soft information valuation and acceptability of communication channels in developing banking relationships. As the result, the conception of relationship banking maintenance was developed with valuation of business perceptions to IT usage, trust, partnership level and satisfaction with relationships from one side and, from other side, valuation of finance institution's use of IT, <b>policy,</b> <b>standards</b> and <b>conditions</b> applied for maintaining relationships...|$|R

Running code refers to multiple independent, interoperable implementations of an open standard. With running code, users have choice in their adoption of a software product and consequently economic and technological benefits. We urge governments to incorporate a “running code ” requirement when adopting an open <b>standards</b> <b>policy.</b> Content...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper proposes random age, {{periodic}} {{and block}} replacement policies {{which are made}} at random variable times, and optimal policies that minimize their expected cost rates are discussed analytically and computed numerically. We compare such random replacements with their <b>standard</b> <b>policies</b> that are made at constant times. Comparison results show that when costs for random and constant replacements are the same, the <b>standard</b> <b>policies</b> are better than the random ones. Furthermore, it is computed numerically that if how much the random replacement cost is lower than that for the constant one, then the standard and random replacements have the same optimal cost rates. That is, the modied random replacement costs and their optimal times are discussed and computed when the random replacements {{would be better than}} the <b>standard</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{the author}} devised {{a collection of}} ontologies to model the generic structure and characteristics of the APPEL policy description language [18] utilised within the ACCENT policy system [1]. Two ontologies, namely genpol. owl and wizpol. owl, were defined using OWL (Web Ontology Language [10]) to describe the generic aspects of the policy language and aspects of how the policy wizard (user interface) uses the language. These generic ontologies are explained in CSM- 169 [3], while an ontology modelling a domain-specific implementation of the policy language for call control is described in CSM- 170 [4]. This document describes how these ontologies have been extended to define the structure of resolution policies, in addition to <b>standard</b> domain <b>policies.</b> A resolution policy has a similar structural composition to a <b>standard</b> <b>policy,</b> but places restrictions {{on the characteristics of}} its components. While a <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> is used to define how events within the domain are handled, a resolution policy is defined purposely to resolve run-time conflicts between <b>standard</b> domain <b>policies.</b> Conflict arises between a pair of <b>standard</b> domain <b>policies</b> whose actions clash if executed simultaneously. A resolution policy specifies the action to be taken when such conflict occurs. This report distinguishes between a <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> and a resolution policy in APPEL, outlining the ontology description for each and highlighting subtle differences in their form.

40|$|Acupuncture as a {{therapeutic}} modality offers multiple applications. Its effectiveness coupled with its general acceptance by conventional {{health care professionals}} makes {{it one of the}} first complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities to be incorporated in an integrative approach to care. However, few centers that offer acupuncture have written <b>standard</b> <b>policies</b> to regulate its use. This lack of <b>standard</b> <b>policies</b> may impede provision of quality care, serve as a barrier to cross-institutional data collection and clinical application of that data, and may put health care professionals and institutions at risk when credentialing or malpractice liability has not been clearly addressed. Here we present a policy for acupuncture, created by a diverse group of health care professionals at the University of Michigan Health System. It may function as a generalizable template for <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> development by institutions incorporating acupuncture...|$|R
