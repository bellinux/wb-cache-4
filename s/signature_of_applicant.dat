But these days, because of tremendous realization and growth in the field of hacking it is not safe to rely on internet to store all the information. So in order to overcome this problem we are proposing an efficient algorithm for secured bank authentication. The algorithm mainly deals with Image Processing and Visual Cryptography. In this paper, <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>applicant</b> is processed in such a way that, signature is taken as input and is divided into different number of shares depending upon the banks scheme. One share is preserved in the bank database and all other shares are given to the applicant. The applicant need to provide his shares during every transaction and those shares are over lapped with the already existing bank shares and a check for authentication will be done by using correlation technique. If a higher correlation coefficient is achieved, then the authentication is succeeded. I...|$|R

The empirical analysis is carried out on a rich micro data set on Dutch employer recruitment behaviour. Our empirical analysis reveals that the economic conditions prevailing on the labour market influence employer search activity at the extensive margin. In particular, we see that in tight (slack) labour markets characterised by excess demand (supply) of labour, the flow <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> is smaller (larger). Employers react to the shortage (excess) <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> by using more (less) often advertisements. This recruitment channel appears to trigger a significantly larger flow <b>of</b> <b>applicants.</b> recruitment · labour demand...|$|R

Methodology: A descriptive study based on the records <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> for dentistry programs in universities using the PSU test for their admissions from 2012 to 2014. Results: The analysis included 14 universities and 18 programs (campuses). Ten were private and 8 traditional.

The University of Talca was the only that showed {{an increase in the}} number <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> per quota. There was a difference of more than 100 points in the average scores for selection between the universities. The traditional universities and those in the capital city presented higher scores.

40|$|Interviewers' {{questioning}} {{behavior and}} predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> ratings varies considerably in unstructured interviews. A model hypothesizing {{a relationship between}} these variables is tested in this study. The model proposes {{that the relationship between}} interviewer questioning behavior and evaluation validity is mediated by the diagnosticity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> information that is collected during the interview. The process and content of three interviewers' questioning of 149 candidates for an entry-level correctional officer position was examined. Although the complete information gathering model was not supported, a robust relationship between questioning behavior and information diagnosticity emerged. Furthermore, the validity <b>of</b> individual interviewers' <b>applicant</b> evaluations varied considerably. These results reinforce the existence of differences in interviewers' questioning behavior and differences in the quality <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> information they gather. Because differences in questioning behavior correspond to differences in the predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> ratings, both these variables should be monitored at the individual interviewer level...|$|R
