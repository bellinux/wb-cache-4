5|$|NY286 {{begins at}} the ramp {{connecting}} NY590 southbound to Browncroft Boulevard just inside the Rochester city limits. It heads east through residential surroundings as a four-lane highway, proceeding through the remainder of NY590 exit7 as it enters the northernmost portion {{of the town of}} Brighton. East of NY590, NY286 widens to become a divided highway. It passes into Penfield upon crossing Irondequoit Creek and curves southeast as it straddles the northern boundary of Ellison Park. During this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> intersects with Old Browncroft Boulevard, the pre-divided highway alignment of Browncroft Boulevard which is now discontinuous near its midpoint.|$|E
5|$|Upon exiting Lackawanna County, Spring Brook enters Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It {{receives}} the tributary Monument Creek {{from the left}} and turns north-northwest for a few miles, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 502. On this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> leaves behind the hills that it flows through, crosses Pennsylvania Route 502, and exits Luzerne County. Upon exiting Luzerne County, the stream enters Moosic, Lackawanna County and continues flowing north-northwest and {{receives the}} tributary Covey Swamp Creek from the right. The stream then turns west-southwest for a short distance before turning south and then west, crossing Interstate 81. It then turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing US Route 11 before reaching its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the county}} line from Caledonia is the Wheatland hamlet of Mumford, where NY36 crosses over the Rochester and Southern Railroad—which the highway has loosely paralleled since Dansville—and Oatka Creek prior to meeting the {{southern}} terminus of NY383. While the railroad, the creek, and NY383 all head east to Scottsville, NY36 continues {{to the north}} on Riga–Mumford Road, passing through isolated areas of the towns of Wheatland and Riga. Along this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> passes over the New York State Thruway (I-90) a short distance south of the Wheatland–Riga town line. The route continues into the hamlet of Riga, where it intersects and briefly overlaps with NY33A westward along Chili–Riga Center Road. At Churchville–Riga Road, NY36 leaves NY33A to resume its northward trek toward the village of Churchville.|$|E
50|$|After cross-linking, {{the sheet}} is <b>stretched</b> by feeding <b>it</b> into {{a machine that}} heats <b>it</b> up, <b>stretches</b> <b>it</b> and cools it down. Because the sheet has been cross-linked, after <b>stretching,</b> <b>it</b> will want to recover to its {{original}} length when re-heated.|$|R

5|$|Harveys Creek {{begins in}} Harveys Lake in the {{community}} of Harveys Lake. The creek flows southwest and soon enters Lake Township. A short distance downstream, it picks up the tributary Bear Hollow Creek and turns south for several miles. The creek receives the tributary Paint Spring Run during this <b>stretch.</b> <b>It</b> eventually enters Lehman Township and turns southeast, crossing Pennsylvania Route 118. Slightly more than a mile (two kilometers) downstream, the creek turns south again. It eventually enters Jackson Township, where it crosses Pennsylvania Route 29 and picks up the tributary Pikes Creek. It then turns southeast and enters a valley, where it flows roughly parallel to Pennsylvania Route 29 for a number of miles. The creek enters Plymouth Township and soon afterwards turns abruptly southwest. Several miles downstream it enters the community of West Nanticoke. Here, it crosses U.S. Route 11 and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this <b>stretch.</b> <b>It</b> typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|The film's opening was {{considered}} a hit taking into account how the story was not based on a popular existing source, and the film itself was void of the franchise's main character, Harry Potter. It was the top choice among moviegoers, representing 47% of the weekend's total $157.6 million tickets sales. On its second Friday, it had a gradual drop of 37% ($18.5 million) from the week before, the second best Friday drop for any Harry Potter film, behind The Philosopher's Stone. This was {{in part due to}} Black Friday, the most lucrative day of the Thanksgiving Day <b>stretch.</b> <b>It</b> ended up grossing $45.1 million in its second weekend (a drop of just 39.4%), finishing 2nd at the box office behind newcomer Moana.|$|E

5|$|The parkway {{begins at}} the old Fort Erie, south of the Peace Bridge, where it is known as Lakeshore Road and connects with the Queen Elizabeth Way and the former Highway 3. East of the Mather Circle, the road becomes known as Niagara Parkway and {{proceeds}} north through downtown Fort Erie, beneath the International Railway Bridge. It gradually curves to the east opposite the southern shore of Grand Island. Houses line the southern side of the parkway along this section. The road curves back northward as it crosses the Black Creek and passes through a sparsely populated <b>stretch.</b> <b>It</b> passes the Willoughby Historical Museum followed by the Legends on the Niagara Golf Course. Shortly thereafter, it enters Niagara Falls and meets the Welland River. Traffic is diverted west to cross the river at Portage Road, where it then resumes on the Niagara Parkway at King's Bridge Park.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{his strong}} finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring {{training}} assured of {{a spot in}} the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation {{for the first time in}} five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4–1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6–12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right rotator cuff tendinitis, which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the <b>stretch.</b> <b>It</b> was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had been shut down for the remainder of the season after receiving a second opinion on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10–13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Duncormick {{is popular}} with pedestrians, equestrians and cyclists, who enjoy the scenery, a village with a church, canal, {{thatched}} buildings, old bridges, and river, surrounded by green fields. Fishing {{in both the}} nearby river and ocean, is a popular local pastime. The golden sands of Ballyteigue Bay and Cullenstown are close by and Ballyteigue Burrow is a nature reserve and {{a good place for}} bird watching. (See popular walk below) It is the best protected sand dune system in the south east, rich in wild flowers and butterflies and covers a 9km coastal <b>stretch.</b> <b>It</b> was established as a national nature reserve in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Just {{north of}} the bridge, the Niagara Scenic Parkway {{approaches}} {{the edge of the}} Niagara Escarpment. Here, it is possible to see for several miles in any direction. Looking north, the remainder of the Niagara River can be seen, as can its mouth at Lake Ontario. The parkway descends the escarpment and meets NY18F and NY104 just east of the village of Lewiston. North of Lewiston, the Parkway follows a largely north–south routing as it passes through largely rural sections of the towns of Lewiston and Porter. During this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> has an exit to Pletcher Road, which links the parkway to Joseph Davis State Park.|$|E

25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties that glass and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or <b>stretch</b> <b>it.</b> Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} the Thruway between Montezuma and the Rochester area is one of mostly rural nature, with the highway passing through remote, open fields, {{and for the most}} part {{avoiding}} highly populated areas. Along this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> connects to two cities, both located well to the south of the Thruway: Geneva by way of exit42 for NY14 and Canandaigua by way of exit43 via NY21. The next exit along the highway, exit44 for NY332, also serves Canandaigua; the junction is the primary exit for Canandaigua-bound travelers from the Rochester area. Here, the Thruway temporarily widens from four to six lanes as it continues generally westward to meet I-490 at exit45 near Victor. Like in the vicinity of Schenectady and Utica, an auxiliary route of I-90—here I-490—directly serves a city (Rochester) while the Thruway bypasses it.|$|E
500|$|As US-412 leaves town, {{it passes}} south of Boiling Springs State Park, running {{parallel}} to SH-34C and SH-50B, {{both of which}} serve the park. Along this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> crosses the Beaver River for {{the third and final}} time, though this time it has since become the North Canadian River. SH-50 forms a concurrency with US-412 for [...] before splitting off again in Mooreland. The highway passes just south of Curtis as it continues east out of Woodward County.|$|E

500|$|East of Flagstaff, I-40 heads {{towards the}} east-southeast {{direction}} {{as it goes}} through the town of Winslow. It continues towards this direction until it reaches Holbrook, where it curves towards the northeast. Along this <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> passes through Petrified Forest National Park and continues to the northeast, passing through Chambers, and enters the Navajo Indian Reservation. [...] The highway still continues to the northeast to the New Mexico border southwest of Gallup, New Mexico as it continues on towards Albuquerque.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{preferred}} the term [...] "philosophical", Balzac's novel {{is based upon}} a fantastic premise. The skin grants a world of possibility to Valentin, and he uses it to satisfy many desires. Pressured into a duel, for example, he explains how he need neither avoid his opponent's gunshot nor aim his own weapon; the outcome is inevitable. He fires without care, and kills the other man instantly. Elsewhere, the supernatural qualities of the skin are demonstrated when it resists the efforts of a chemist and a physicist to <b>stretch</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring to support their second studio album, Dude Ranch. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion. The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997. [...] "When we did our longest tour <b>stretch,</b> <b>it</b> was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge.
