However saponins are very poorly absorbed by the body and usually pass straight through, and in any case they can be destroyed by thorough cooking. The Miwok people roasted and ate the bulbs as a winter food. In February 1847 Patrick Breen of the ill-fated Donner Party recorded that a Native American gave the starving settler some [...] "roots resembling Onions in shape that taste some like a <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoe,</b> all full of little tough fibres." [...] Breen's son later called the roots [...] "California soap-root"—almost certainly C. pomeridianum.|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} {{process for}} bioethanol production from starch-based materials includes {{the conversion of}} starch into fermentable sugars which generally takes place in two enzymatic steps: liquefaction using thermal-stable alpha-amylase and saccharification by addition of amyloglucosidase (AMG). Most studies of starch hydrolysis use enzymes, temperature conditions and reaction times which have been done for grains, such corn. The starch of sweet potatoes is considered more complex than cereal starches, making it more challenging to hydrolyze into fermentable sugars. Besides, the digestibility of starch by enzymes varies among different cultivars (Duvernay et al. 2013; Moorthy 2002; Srichuwong et al. 2005). Yet {{there is still a}} need to establish a more defined biologically based approach to <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoe</b> starch conversion and evaluate the enzymes and processing conditions suitable for effective fermentable sugar production (Duvernay et al. 2013). The sweet potatoes used in this article has biomass yields of 10  t/ha (dry basis), higher value than cultivated varieties for human consumption which presented an average yield of up to 4.7  t/ha in Uruguay ([URL] No experimental information is available on the response of this variety of <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoe</b> to enzymatic saccharification and fermentation, including the use of high solid to liquid ratios.|$|E
