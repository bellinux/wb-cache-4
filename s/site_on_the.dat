40|$|Neutralizing {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{directed against}} five antigenic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spike (S) S 1 glycopolypeptide of {{avian infectious bronchitis}} virus (IBV) were used to select neutralization-resistant variants of the virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of such variants with the sequence of the IBV parent strain, we located five antigenic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> amino acid sequence of the S 1 glycopolypeptide. The variants had mutations within three regions corresponding to amino acid residues 24 to 61, 132 to 149 and 291 to 398 of the S 1 glycopolypeptide. The location of three overlapping antigenic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> IBV spike protein {{was similar to the}} location of antigenic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spike protein of other coronaviruses...|$|R

5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one <b>site</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Potomac River near Georgetown; and another <b>site</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a <b>site</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E

5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction <b>site.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologic records {{indicate}} that dogs {{were present in}} the Society Islands from the period of initial settlement up to the point of European contact. Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another <b>site</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same island.|$|E

5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped at a <b>site</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{south side of the}} Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of the soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site of a cold, clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E

However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more common {{at the lower end}} of the gorge. There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the {{executive}} committee of the Berlin city council proposed a <b>site</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the river Spree, roughly corresponding to the current location of the Berlin Finance Department and {{the offices of the}} Social Association of Germany. The proposal was rejected by the full city council because it would overshadow the city hall. Further proposals were put on hold for several years. After discussing many locations, in 1898, chief of construction Ludwig Hoffmann became involved and the council agreed on Molkenmarkt. The 32 built-up parcels of land on the site were bought up and cleared.|$|E
