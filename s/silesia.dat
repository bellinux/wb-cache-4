5|$|German-Polish Accord on East <b>Silesia</b> (also called Geneva Convention), {{concluded}} 15 May 1922. The treaty {{dealt with}} the constitutional and legal future of Upper <b>Silesia</b> which partly became Polish territory after the Upper <b>Silesia</b> plebiscite of 20 March 1921.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakdown}} of the Bohemian Revolt the residents of <b>Silesia,</b> including the Polish gentry in Upper <b>Silesia,</b> were subjected to severe repressions and Counter-Reformational activities, including forced expulsions of thousands of Silesians, many of whom ended up in Poland. Later during the war years the province was repeatedly ravaged in the course of military campaigns crossing its territory, and at one point a Protestant leader, Piast Duke John Christian of Brieg, appealed to Władysław IV Vasa for assuming supremacy over <b>Silesia.</b> King Władysław, although a tolerant ruler including in matters of religion, was like his father disinclined to involve the Commonwealth in the Thirty Years' War. He ended up getting as fiefs from the Emperor the duchies of Opole and Racibórz in 1646, twenty years later reclaimed by the Empire. The Peace of Westphalia allowed the Habsburgs to do as they pleased in <b>Silesia,</b> already completely ruined by the war, which had resulted in intense persecution of Protestants, including the Polish Lower <b>Silesia</b> communities, forced to emigrate or subjected to Germanization.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Dmowski {{laid out}} {{a plan for the}} borders of a re-created Polish state; it would include Greater Poland, Pomerania with Gdańsk, Upper <b>Silesia,</b> south strip of East Prussia and Cieszyn <b>Silesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the mid-19th}} century {{members of the local}} Slav {{population}} did not identify themselves as members of larger ethnolinguistic entities. In Cieszyn <b>Silesia</b> (as in all West Slavic borderlands) various territorial identities pre-dated ethnic and national identity. Consciousness of membership within a greater Polish or Czech nation spread slowly in <b>Silesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a 36-year-old on 16 December 1762 in Berlin, {{he married}} the widowed Eleanor of Paczensky and Tenczin, born Freiin von Seherr-Thoß (12 January 1739 {{on the estate}} at Schönfeld, Kr. Schweidnitz, Lower <b>Silesia,</b> died 23 February 1799 in Berlin), the {{daughter}} of the Junker Karl Heinrich von Seherr-Thoss, lord on the estates Schönfeld and Ludwigsdorf, and the Anna Elisabeth von Zedlitz and Leipe. Eleonore, a wealthy heiress, brought to the marriage fourteen properties in Lower <b>Silesia</b> near Breslau and Hirschberg.|$|E
5|$|Casimir, who {{formally}} gave up {{his rights}} to several Silesian principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the House of Luxembourg (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of <b>Silesia</b> from the Gniezno Archdiocese by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to <b>Silesia</b> legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was another group living in the area, the Ślązakowcy, who claimed a distinct Silesian national identity. This group enjoyed popular support throughout the whole of Cieszyn <b>Silesia</b> although its strongest supporters were among the Protestants in {{eastern part of the}} Cieszyn <b>Silesia</b> (now part of Poland) and not in Zaolzie itself.|$|E
5|$|The Allied powers {{referred}} {{the problem}} of Upper <b>Silesia</b> to the League after they {{had been unable to}} resolve the territorial dispute. After the First World War, Poland laid claim to Upper <b>Silesia,</b> which had been part of Prussia. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper <b>Silesia</b> to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 percent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The term Zaolzie {{denotes the}} {{territory}} of the former districts of Český Těšín and Fryštát, in which the Polish population formed a majority according to the 1910 Austrian census. It makes up {{the eastern part of the}} Czech portion of Cieszyn <b>Silesia.</b> However, Polish historian Józef Szymeczek notes that the term is often mistakenly used for the whole Czech part of Cieszyn <b>Silesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Seven Years' War {{concluded}} with the Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763), Seydlitz became inspector {{general of the}} cavalry in <b>Silesia,</b> where eleven regiments were permanently stationed and where Frederick sent all his most promising officers to be trained. In 1767, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to general of cavalry.|$|E
5|$|After {{this part}} of Poland was annexed by Nazi Germany, Oświęcim (Auschwitz) was located {{administratively}} in Germany, Province of Upper <b>Silesia,</b> Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz, Landkreis Bielitz. It was first suggested as a site for a concentration camp for Polish prisoners by SS-Oberführer Arpad Wigand, an aide to Higher SS and Police Leader for <b>Silesia,</b> Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. Bach-Zelewski had been searching for a site to house prisoners in the <b>Silesia</b> region, as the local prisons were filled to capacity. Richard Glücks, head of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate, sent former Sachsenhausen concentration camp commandant Walter Eisfeld to inspect the site, which already held sixteen dilapidated one-story buildings that had once served as an Austrian and later Polish Army barracks and a camp for transient workers. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), approved the site in April 1940, intending to use the facility to house political prisoners. SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel) Rudolf Höss oversaw {{the development of the}} camp and served as the first commandant. SS-Obersturmführer (senior lieutenant) Josef Kramer was appointed Höss's deputy. Auschwitz I, the original camp, became the administrative center for the whole complex.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Klenau {{commanded}} a corps in Italy, {{known as the}} Korps Klenau. After the war ended again in 1815, Klenau was appointed commanding general in Moravia and <b>Silesia.</b> He held this office until his death on 6 October 1819 at Brno, in the modern-day Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in <b>Silesia</b> and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of <b>Silesia,</b> and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a world power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E
5|$|Francis Stephen {{was elected}} Holy Roman Emperor on 13 September 1745. Prussia {{recognised}} Francis as emperor, and Maria Theresa once again recognised {{the loss of}} <b>Silesia</b> by the Treaty of Dresden in December 1745, ending the Second Silesian War. The wider war dragged on for another three years, with fighting in northern Italy and the Austrian Netherlands; however, the core Habsburg domains of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia remained in Maria Theresa's possession. The Treaty of Aachen, which concluded the eight-year conflict, recognised Prussia's possession of <b>Silesia,</b> and Maria Theresa ceded the Duchy of Parma to Philip of Spain. France had successfully conquered the Austrian Netherlands, but Louis XV, wishing to prevent potential future wars with Austria, returned them to Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Strachwitz and {{his family}} moved from their palace in Groß Stein to their manor in Alt Siedel, because of {{personal}} differences with his father, who remained in Groß Stein. Between 1924 and 1933 Strachwitz founded two dairy cooperatives which many local farmers joined. In parallel he studied a few semesters of forestry. He used his knowledge to influence the Silesian forest owners to sell their wood to the paper mills. He continued to use his influence in Upper <b>Silesia</b> to modernize forestry and farming. His ambitions were aided by his presidency of the Forstausschuss (Forestry Committee) of Upper <b>Silesia</b> and his membership in the Landwirtschaftskammer (Chamber of Agriculture). Strachwitz completely took over his father's estate in 1929, first as the General Manager and then as owner, with full responsibility. This made Strachwitz {{one of the most}} wealthy land and forest owners in <b>Silesia.</b> Along with the palace in Groß Stein he owned a lime kiln and quarry in Klein Stein—present-day Kamionek—and Groß Stein, a distillery in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the Knights were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary to buy Neumark for 500,000 guldens. Negotiations fell apart {{as the title}} to the land was contested by several dukes. The Neumark purchase was closed with Jobst of Moravia only in 1402. During July 1392, the Knights agreed to pay Władysław Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the Dobrzyń Land, which had been contested among Piast dukes since 1377. Opolczyk, the ruler of Opole in <b>Silesia,</b> {{had little interest in}} the volatile regions to his north. In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Roman Empire, <b>Silesia,</b> and Hungary, but it was rejected. These purchases by the Knights threatened Poland's northern borders.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen also {{remarks that}} there is a myth about the {{uniqueness}} of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar institutions of self-governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places, such as in Hungary and various German provinces (<b>Silesia,</b> Prussia, Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{increasingly}} {{threatened by the}} growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th and 16th centuries. Moscow indeed took over many of Lithuania's eastern possessions in military campaigns of 1471, 1492, and 1500. Grand Duke Alexander of Lithuania was elected King of Poland in 1501, {{after the death of}} John Albert. In 1506, he was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I Stary) in both Poland and Lithuania as political realities were drawing the two states closer together. Prior to his accession to the Polish throne, Sigismund had been a Duke of <b>Silesia</b> by the authority of his brother Vladislas II of Bohemia, but like other Jagiellon rulers before him, he did not pursue the claim of the Polish Crown to <b>Silesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 22July 1813 he was {{appointed}} governor of the fortress of Theresienstadt and shortly after that Commanding General in Moravia and <b>Silesia.</b> He then became commander of II Corps; the First Division held the village of Nollendorf, in the French defeat at the Battle of Kulm (now Chlumec) on 29–30 August 1813.|$|E
5|$|The Sokół {{movement}} {{was active in}} Cieszyn <b>Silesia</b> even before World War I. After 1920 division of the region, Sokół became active in Czechoslovakia. At {{the beginning of the}} 1930s it associated 11 local branches and about 1,500 members. After World War II, it hasn’t renewed its activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Slavic settlers {{from the}} east reached southeastern Poland {{in the second half}} of the 5th century, specifically the San River basin, then the upper Vistula regions, including the Kraków area and Nowy Sącz Valley. Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz and Lublin in Masovia and Upper <b>Silesia.</b> Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower <b>Silesia.</b> In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the end of this century, or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached Western Pomerania. According to the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, the Slavs captured in Constantinople in 592 named the Baltic Sea coastal area as the place from which they originated.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} Army Group Vistula, {{under the command}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, {{attempted}} a counter-attack, but this had failed by 24 February. The Red Army then drove on to Pomerania, clearing the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into <b>Silesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in 1404, Władysław held {{talks at}} Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, who offered to return <b>Silesia</b> to Poland if Władysław {{supported}} {{him in his}} power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire. Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.|$|E
5|$|Although the Seven Years' War was {{a global}} conflict, {{it took on}} a {{specific}} intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave FrederickII of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of <b>Silesia.</b> Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as reacquiring <b>Silesia.</b> In 1754, escalating tensions between Great Britain and France in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Recognizing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia's growing power, the Empress put aside the old rivalry with France {{to form a new}} coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king's territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his and Frederick's relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of <b>Silesia</b> that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{was elected}} king of the Commonwealth, Władysław fought in many campaigns, seeking {{personal}} glory. After his final campaign against Russians in 1617–1618 (the end of Dymitriads), in 1619 he went to <b>Silesia,</b> looking {{for an opportunity to}} aid the Habsburgs in their struggle against the Czech Hussites in the Thirty Years' War. That opportunity never came, but from that point onward, Władysław had a good relationship with George William, Elector of Brandenburg.|$|E
5|$|By August 1941 Operation Barbarossa, the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, had been underway for two months, and after completing his A/B flight training at Markersdorf Waldmann {{was transferred to the}} Jagdfliegerschule 6 (6th Fighter Pilot School) at Lachen-Speyerdorf near Neustadt an der Weinstraße. He completed the final phase of his fighter pilot training in Gleiwitz, Upper <b>Silesia,</b> from 3 June to 17 August 1942, before transferring to the front.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{visit of}} the {{commander}} of the Panzerjagdverbände (tank-hunting detachment) of Army Group Vistula, Oberst Ernst-Wilhelm Freiherr Gedult von Jungenfeld, all of the Panzerjagdverbände were to be centralized under Strachwitz' command. In April the Panzerjagdeinheiten (tank-hunting units) of Army Group Centre were all put under his command, this included Panzerjagdverbände A, B and C (Wehrkreis VIII), the Heeres-Panzerjagdbrigaden 1 and 3, two Volkssturm-Panzerjagdbrigaden and the Panzerjäger-Brigade Niederschlesien (Lower <b>Silesia)</b> and Free Ukrainians. Strachwitz deployed his men in small combat groups, sometimes operating behind Allied lines, which lured Soviet tanks into traps and attacked them with Panzerfausts. Combat reached its peak in April 1945, and some of his men were credited with more than ten enemy tanks destroyed each. The German front line of Army Group Centre at the time was in mid-Silesia along the Zobten, and via Schweidnitz and Jauer to Lauban. The main Soviet thrust was towards Berlin and Dresden, threatening the German troops in <b>Silesia</b> with encirclement. Strachwitz and his men fought under the command of Schörner until the German capitulation on 8 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian <b>Silesia,</b> and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up <b>Silesia,</b> gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing <b>Silesia</b> to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E
5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third Silesian War and sparked the wider Seven Years' War. Empress Maria Theresa and Kaunitz wished {{to exit the}} war with possession of <b>Silesia.</b> Austria was aligned with France and Russia, Great Britain with Prussia and Portugal. Giving Austria huge subsidies came back to haunt France. It could not bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E
5|$|Gazan's {{division}} {{fought in}} the French victory over Prussia at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October 1806). At Ostrolenka (16 February 1807), Gazan's troops took three guns and two Russian colors. Otherwise, his troops stayed in their winter quarters. After the new peace treaty, Gazan's troops were sent to <b>Silesia</b> to restore order. In 1808, he was named Comte de la Peyriére.|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. They {{were able to}} bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and <b>Silesia.</b> Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
5|$|In 1320, {{the kingdom}} was {{restored}} under Władysław I the Elbow-high, then strengthened and expanded {{by his son}} Casimir III the Great. The western provinces of <b>Silesia</b> and Pomerania were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of {{two members of the}} Capetian House of Anjou between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful kingdom of Poland that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944, the Frank {{women were}} {{scheduled}} to join a transport to the Liebau labour camp in Upper <b>Silesia.</b> Bloeme Evers-Emden {{was scheduled to be}} on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Leuthen, {{fought on}} 5 December 1757, Frederick the Great's Prussian army used {{maneuver}} and terrain to decisively defeat {{a much larger}} Austrian force commanded by Prince Charles of Lorraine and Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, thus ensuring Prussian control of <b>Silesia</b> during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years' War).|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture {{settlements}} were still relatively dense {{in the first}} half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This is also the case in <b>Silesia</b> - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably <b>Silesia</b> and Lusatia. Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are actually quite numerous, including many cult coin deposit sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). That's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere).|$|E
