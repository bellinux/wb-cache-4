40|$|Abstract. Sub-zero {{processing}} is an add-on step of {{heat treatment}} that includes cooling down, holding at low temperature and re-heating up to room temperature. The {{aim of this}} process is to improve some mechanical properties of high-carbon steels. In this research, the Cr-V ledeburitic steel Vanadis 6 produced by powder metallurgy was used. As-received material as well as that after heat treatment contains various types of carbides, which are different in terms of both the nature and the origin. During the austenitizing, a part of the carbides (eutectoid, secondary) undergo dissolution in the austenite while other carbides (eutectic, secondary) remain in the material undissolved. The application of <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatment</b> leads to increase in the volume fraction of small globular carbides, with a size below 0. 3 μm. The volume fraction of secondary carbides was found to be constant, irrespectively to the use of sub-zero processing, but it decreases with increase of the austenitizing temperature. The nature of the carbides was found to be practically unaffected by the <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatment</b> and it can be described as follows: The eutectic carbides are the vanadium rich MC-phase and the secondary ones are the M 7 C 3. Regarding the nature of small globular particles, their nature is not doubtless because the electron diffraction fixed them as alloyed cementite but the EDX analysis revealed very high chromium content in the particles...|$|E
40|$|The study {{reported}} in this paper concerned development of such microstructure of high-chromium (24 % Cr) cast iron which could secure high abrasive wear resistance of die inserts used to fabricate stampings from refractory materials. It was found that by increasing the cast iron cooling rate {{as a result of}} thermal interaction with the chill, it is possible to obtain fine carbide precipitates with diversified morphology, rich in Cr and Fe, containing Mo and Si. The matrix in the regions of thermal interaction with the chill was enriched in Cr and Mo, but depleted of Fe and Si. The <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatment</b> process was developed to secure presence of hardening products in the matrix. The obtained structure of high-chromium cast iron has made the inserts more resistant to abrasive wear compared to tool steels after hear treatment used earlier...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the Vanadis 6 steel, processed without/with an application of <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatment,</b> with alumina (hard counterface), 100 Cr 6 -ball bearing steel (counterface of an intermediate hardness) and CuSn 6 (soft counterface) has been examined. Obtained results infer that the wear performance against alumina is the best for no-SZT material quenched from higher austenitizing temperature (highest hardness). In dry sliding against 100 Cr 6 ball bearing steel, the best wear resistance has been achieved for the material after SZT at - 196 o C/ 10 h. The {{interaction of}} Vanadis 6 steel with CuSn 6 results in a considerable counterpart material transfer to the samples of Vanadis 6 -steel whereas {{the extent of the}} transfer is rather independent on both the austenitizing temperature and the SZT parameters, within the range of parameters used for the investigations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} sub-zero cooling on {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties {{of a low}} alloyed austempered ductile iron has been investigated. Austempering of samples was performed at 325 ! and 400 ℃ after austenitizing at 875 ℃ and 950 ℃. The <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatments</b> were carried out by cooling down the samples to - 30 ℃, - 70 ℃ and - 196 ℃. The changes in volume fraction of austenite and mechanical properties were determined after cooling to each temperature. The austenite volume fraction of samples which were austenitized at 875 ℃ and austempered at 325 ℃ remained unchanged, whilst it reduced in samples austenitized at 950 ℃ and 875 ℃ for austempering temperature of 400 ℃. In these specimens, some austenite transformed to martensite after subzero cooling. Mechanical property measurements showed {{a slight increase in}} strength and hardness and decrease in elongation and toughness due to this transformation behavior...|$|R
40|$|This study {{employed}} H- 1 NMR spectroscopy {{to assay}} the metabolome {{of the high}} Arctic freeze-tolerant dipteran larvae, Heleomyza borealis, after recovery from exposure {{to a range of}} <b>sub-zero</b> temperature <b>treatments.</b> Our data demonstrate the resilience of freeze tolerance in individuals of this permanently freeze-tolerant species that were acclimated to summer temperatures (5 degrees C) : recovery of homeostasis after 48 h was not significantly disturbed by 2 h exposures to - 3, - 12, or - 20 degrees C. Evidence of homeostatic perturbation to cryo-stress - both in terms of changes in specific metabolite concentrations as well as systemic changes in metabolism determined using multivariate pattern recognition techniques - was expressed almost entirely at a temperature coincident with the significant onset of mortality (- 25 degrees C) and considerably below the minimum winter temperatures of its over-wintering habitat (c. - 12 degrees C) ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{mechanical}} spectroscopy of cold work tool steel subjected to <b>sub-zero</b> cryogenic soaking <b>treatment</b> {{to reveal the}} carbon segregation and the subsequent carbides refinement. The maximum of Snoek-Köster (SK) peak height was obtained in the sample subjected to soaking 1 h at − 130 °C cryogenic treatment. The SK peak height is reduced with prolonging the soaking time. The results indicate that {{an increase in the}} height of SK peak is connected with an increase in dislocation density and the number of segregated carbon atoms in the vicinity of dislocations or twin planes after martensite transformation at − 130 °C which is confirmed by corresponding TEM and atom probe tomography measurement. Hence, it is suggested that the isothermal martensite, formed during the cryogenic soaking treatment decreases (APT) the height of SK peak...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{temperatures}} in midwinter and late-spring frosts cause severe damages to strawberry plants cultivated in temperate climate regions. Despite {{the seriousness of}} the problem, the plant mechanism of defense against cold stress has not been fully elucidated yet, especially in its molecular aspect. The presented investigations were conducted on the cold-susceptible cultivar ‘Elsanta’ and the cold-tolerant cultivar ‘Selvik’. Expression profiles of three genes (CBF 4, COR 47 and F 3 H) were determined at three time-points: 0, 6 and 12 weeks after <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatment</b> at - 12 °C. The CBF 4 gene was very strongly up-regulated in ‘Selvik’ plants and the highest value of the transcript level was detected just after the treatment (time - point 0). The F 3 H transcript in the treated ‘Selvik’ plants reached the level 4 times higher than in control plants in the 12 th week after treatment (time-point 3). In ‘Elsanta’ plants, the CBF 4 and COR 47 genes were slightly up-regulated (time-point 2), while the F 3 H gene showed stability of expression. High positive correlation between the transcript level of COR 47 and transcript level of CBF 4 genes was observed for both cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{austenitising}} and tempering {{practice on the}} microstructure and mechanical properties of two martensitic stainless steels was examined {{with the aim of}} supplying heat treatment guidelines to the consumer or fabricator that, if followed, would result in a martensitic structure with minimal retained austenite, evenly dispersed carbides and a hardness of between 610 HV and 740 HV (hardness on the Vickers scale) after quenching and tempering. The steels examined {{during the course of this}} examination conform in composition to medium-carbon AISI type 420 martensitic stainless steel, except for the addition of 0. 13 % vanadium and 0. 62 % molybdenum to one of the alloys. The effect of various austenitising and tempering heat treatments was examined. Steel samples were austenitised at temperatures between 1000 °C and 1200 °C, followed by quenching in oil. The as-quenched microstructures were found to range from almost fully martensitic structures to martensite with up to 35 % retained austenite after quenching, with varying amounts of carbide precipitates. The influence of tempering, double tempering, and <b>sub-zero</b> <b>treatment</b> was investigated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to characterise the as-quenched microstructures, and X-ray diffraction analysis was employed to identify the carbide present in the as-quenched structures and to quantify the retained austenite contents. Hardness tests were performed to determine the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties. As-quenched hardness values ranged from 700 HV to 270 HV, depending on the amount of retained austenite. Thermodynamic predictions (using the CALPHAD™ model) were used to explain these microstructures based on the solubility of the carbide particles in the matrix at various austenitising temperatures. The carbide particles were found to be mainly in the form of M 7 C 3 at elevated temperatures, transforming to M 23 C 6 on cooling. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

5000|$|Throughout the Malibu series, several {{concepts}} are raised that, while not always {{part of the}} game's official storyline, are, in fact, part of the [...] "what if" [...] hyperextension of the game. For example, it is revealed (just {{as it was in}} MKII) that Mileena was specifically designed by Shang Tsung, through sorcery, for Kahn as an imperfect clone of Kitana. However, despite being created artificially, Mileena considers herself to be [...] "Shao Kahn's true daughter" [...] and refers to herself in this way throughout the series, even after she learns the truth. Kung Lao and Kitana share a love relationship instead of the more canonic relationship between Kitana and Liu Kang in the later games. Johnny Cage and Sonya also have a relationship in the series, and, while the concept is highly supported by the game's storyline, there has been no official confirmation that it exists within the games. Raiden does not appear to take an active part in the second Mortal Kombat tournament. This idea would be used again during the Mortal Kombat film and the retconned story of MKII in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. Sonya, who absolutely hated Kano and did all she could to ensure his capture—if not his death—becomes fully focused on aiding her friends and Raiden, and even shares a rivalry with Mileena, who tries to kill her on many occasions. Scorpion wants to kill not only Sub-Zero in revenge for killing him, but also his family and his clan; which was not his original intention. <b>Sub-Zero's</b> <b>treatment</b> in the Malibu comics is particularly interesting. In the games, the original Sub-Zero had been killed early on (prior to Mortal Kombat II), turning into the wraith Noob Saibot, and substituted by his younger brother. However, the older Sub-Zero is portrayed prominently throughout the entire run of the comic book series; while the younger brother makes only a small appearance in the last page of the Tournament Edition II issue. In the series, the older Sub-Zero has the traits of both himself and his brother. For instance, in the beginning, he is loyal to the Lin Kuei and always speaks highly of his clan; yet later in the story he becomes more humane and, instead of being a ruthless assassin, he assists Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, and their friends. He is portrayed as heroic (in contrast to the original Sub-Zero's soul being tainted in the games), while Scorpion is made to look purely evil (as opposed to his neutral alignment in the games). On the other hand, Noob Saibot is not mentioned or featured in any of the comics except in a special Baraka issue, where he shows up in a small role as a completely separate character (at the time, his identity as the original Sub-Zero was yet to be established in the games). The final issue sees the new Sub-Zero rise to avenge the death of his brother—which largely brings things closer to the game.|$|R
