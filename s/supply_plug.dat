40|$|ArborGen’s nursery, {{located in}} Tokoroa, {{supplies}} approximately 6 million seedlings {{per year to}} the forestry industry (figure 1). The vast majority of seedlings are Pine Radiata but they also <b>supply</b> <b>Plug</b> Plus and Douglas fir. In peak season, they plant up to 120, 000 seedlings per day that each require a straight vertical hole of certain depth and spacing, (depending on seedling type). For example the most common seedling, Radiata pine, requires holes of approximately 10 mm diameter x 40 mm deep (figure 2). The process of making the holes is called dibbling. Dibbling {{has become a major}} problem that has resulted in an estimated 400, 000 rejections per year. An investigation of the dibbling process identified the following problems: • Existing human dibbling methods too slow and unreliable • Machine methods produce low quality holes that lead to mis-planted seedlings • Lack of flexibility of existing, methods with regard to hole size and spacing • Current methods compact the soil hindering root growth so hole drilling is preferred • Currently, dibbling must be done on the day of planting due to the deterioration of the bed surfac...|$|E

50|$|One {{other problem}} can {{happen with the}} wattage rating of the power supply. There are 2 Dell power {{supplies}} that were used for different Inspiron models which have the same plug assembly and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9. Some models (for example the Inspiron 1100) shipped with a PA-9. If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system might not boot at times. In such cases, it will light the battery light {{for a few seconds}} when the <b>supply</b> is <b>plugged</b> in. This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal. Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a volt meter while the <b>supply</b> is <b>plugged</b> into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.|$|R
5000|$|Size - Power <b>supplies</b> which <b>plug</b> {{into the}} mains {{directly}} without using a plug on a cable (true wall warts) are bulkier than bare plugs; {{sometimes they are}} too large to plug into power sockets with restricted space, or into adjacent sockets on power strips (due {{to the fact that}} they can block other plugs also).|$|R
50|$|The design {{philosophy}} is that higher voltages should be <b>supplied</b> via larger <b>plugs</b> to prevent equipment damage. A larger plug {{will not go}} into a smaller jack.|$|R

5000|$|Console case modding {{started in}} the late 1980s when the NES and Sega Genesis, were released; many {{customers}} simply put pictures or stickers on them until the PlayStation was released. Many case modders started to change hardware, for example by altering them to play copied games (known as 'chipping' the games console). The most common modification for the PlayStation was the 'chipping' process (mentioned above). When the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 were released, many chipped them, styled them, and added additional cooling; some {{went as far as}} changing the hardware itself. When the Xbox and Xbox 360 were released, many modders personally customized them further, using neon lights, transparent cases, fans, and PC hard drives (as opposed to Xbox-branded drives). Many modders found that altering the interior of Xbox 360s was difficult due to absence of a power cable (normally in a PC, this cord attaches the hard disk drive to its motherboard). Despite shortcomings, modders also found a way to power neon lighting and other powered equipment by using the DVD-ROM power supply; however, due to insufficient power to the hard disk drive, it often caused freezing during disk access. Another common method for internal case modding uses the power outlet for the internal fan by splitting the cord with a [...] "Y" [...] connector. However, the most up to date modders will use power points under where the PSU (power <b>supply)</b> <b>plugs</b> in, which doesn't diminish any (or very little) power from the console.|$|R
25|$|In 1922, {{two former}} Tufts {{engineering}} college roommates Laurence K. Marshall and Vannevar Bush, along with scientist Charles G. Smith, founded the American Appliance Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its focus, which was originally on new refrigeration technology, soon shifted to electronics. The company's first product was a gaseous (helium) rectifier {{that was based}} on Charles Smith's earlier astronomical research of the star Zeta Puppis. The electron tube was christened with the name Raytheon ("light of/from the gods") and was used in a battery eliminator, a type of radio-receiver power <b>supply</b> that <b>plugged</b> into the power grid in place of large batteries. This made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive, short-lived batteries.|$|R
50|$|Some {{incandescent}} or LED-based strings use a {{power supply}} transformer with lamps connected in parallel.

Power <b>supplies</b> with integrated <b>plugs</b> may make the set difficult to connect in certain places.|$|R
25|$|The first {{electric}} instrument amplifiers {{were not}} intended for electric guitars, but were portable PA systems.

5000|$|The term [...] "TV game" [...] {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to any number of self-contained, {{portable}} game systems operating on either batteries or an electronic power <b>supply</b> which <b>plugs</b> directly into a TV or VCR. The game software is built directly into the unit, which is typically designed to look like a toy or classic game console/controller with the addition of two AV ports. These systems usually contain either highly specialized games or activities, or a collection of classic games. Thus, it could be viewed as a video game console without interchangeable game software. As the game software is integrated into the game unit and almost never designed to be changed by the user, these game systems are typically sold by retailers as electronic toys or collectibles rather than game consoles. Most units sell for prices typically under $50 US.|$|R

50|$|Power is {{generally}} <b>supplied</b> by a <b>plug</b> to a receptacle. Cables {{are available with}} one in-line receptacle fanning out {{to a number of}} plugs, so that many devices may be supplied by one supply. As the use of a plug implies a cable, even a short stub, some power supplies carry panel-mounted receptacles instead to avoid this cable, i.e. the normal convention of power from plug to receptacle is reversed. Cables for such cases are available with a plug at each end, although cables or adapters with two receptacles are not widely available.|$|R

This paper describes a technique, the Contactless Energy Transfer System (CETS), by which electrical energy may be transmitted, without electrical connection or physical contact, through non-magnetic media of low conductivity. CETS, which has been used to transfer up to 5 kW across a 10 mm gap, employs high-frequency magnetic coupling and enables plug-in power connections to be made in wet or hazardous environmental conditions without the risk of electric shock, short-circuiting or sparking. Energy may be transmitted without the necessity for accurately manufactured "plug and socket" mechanisms and may be transmitted from source to load even when there is relative motion. Load-source voltage matching may be made inherent to the system...|$|R
50|$|AC-33, {{launched}} on 20 February 1975, was carrying an Intelsat-4 communications satellite when the flight went awry around the two-minute mark. During booster engine separation, a swivel lanyard designed {{to pull out}} an electrical <b>plug</b> <b>supplying</b> power to the booster section failed to detach, causing a voltage spike that reset the Atlas's guidance computer. Control of the booster started to fail and Range Safety sent the destruct signal at around 403 seconds into launch. Investigation showed that the lanyard was not only inadequately designed, it was an off-the-shelf component designed for marine equipment and not rockets or aircraft. Atlas vehicles had been flying with them for years without anyone noticing or considering this potential failure mode. Fortunately, the backup Intelsat was launched successfully on AC-35 the following May.|$|R
50|$|A laptop's {{battery is}} charged using an {{external}} power <b>supply</b> which is <b>plugged</b> into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically {{in the range of}} 7.2—24 volts. The power supply is usually external, and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about 400 g to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a smart battery, a rechargeable battery pack with a built-in battery management system (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and SoH (State of Health) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.|$|R
40|$|An ED-tether {{mission to}} Jupiter is presented. A bare tether {{carrying}} cathodic devices {{at both ends}} but no power supply, and using no propellant, could move 'freely' among Jupiter's 4 great moons. The tour scheme would have current naturally driven throughout by the motional electric field, the Lorentz force switching direction with current around a 'drag' radius of 160, 00 kms, where {{the speed of the}} jovian ionosphere equals the speed of a spacecraft in circular orbit. With plasma density and magnetic field decreasing rapidly with distance from Jupiter, drag/thrust would only be operated in the inner plasmasphere, current being near shut off conveniently in orbit by disconnecting cathodes or plugging in a very large resistance; the tether could serve as its own power <b>supply</b> by <b>plugging</b> in an electric load where convenient, with just some reduction in thrust or drag. The periapsis of the spacecraft in a heliocentric transfer orbit from Earth would lie inside the drag sphere; with tether deployed and current on around periapsis, magnetic drag allows Jupiter to capture the spacecraft into an elliptic orbit of high eccentricity. Current would be on at succesive perijove passes and off elsewhere, reducing the eccentricity by lowering the apoapsis progressively to allow visits of the giant moons. In a second phase, current is on around apoapsis outside the drag sphere, rising the periapsis until the full orbit lies outside that sphere. In a third phase, current is on at periapsis, increasing the eccentricity until a last push makes the orbit hyperbolic to escape Jupiter. Dynamical issues such as low gravity-gradient at Jupiter and tether orientation in elliptic orbits of high eccentricity are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{energy policy}} {{approach}} is {{carrying out a}} long-time renewal process of the electric and in general energy framework. The energy spent in commercial, residential, and institutional buildings is a great amount (in EU is estimated about 40 % of total energy consumption and about 90 % in high-density urban areas) [1]. The general encouragement of the rational use of energy, also for residential users, introduced the new approach of the nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) by the European energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD) [3]. NZEB means a building that has a very high energy performance, as determined in accordance with Annex I of Directive [3]. The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, favoring energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby. Let us note that the major appliances (both white and brown goods) and other electric loads not fixed (equipment <b>supplied</b> by <b>plugs)</b> are not {{taken into account in}} the NZEB qualification. The EPBD requires all new buildings to be NZEBs by the end of 2020 (public buildings must be NZEBs by 2018). A building may reach the NZEB qualification through a complex of efficient technical building systems (TBSs), building automation control system (BACS), and renewable sources, besides a very high energy performance given by envelope insulation and other passive measures [4]. The TBSs that must be provided vary with the type of building, but will generally include a building electric service and power distribution system to serve the loads, a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, a domestic hot water (DHW) system, electronic safety and security systems, and a communication system (ICT). The extremely low amount of energy that NZEBs require (energy spent ES 2) comes mostly from renewable local sources (energy generated ERES) like: photovoltaic (PV), ground-source heat pumps (GSHP) or thermal solar systems...|$|R
40|$|Automotive Resources, Inc. (ARI) has {{developed}} a new device for igniting fuel in engines-the SmartPlug. TM SmartPlug is a self-contained ignition system that may be retrofitted to existing spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines. The SmartPlug needs as little as six watts of power for warm-up, and requires no electricity at all when the engine is running. Unlike traditional spark plugs, once the SmartPlug ignites the engine, and the engine heats up, the power <b>supply</b> for the <b>plug</b> is no longer necessary. In the utility industry, SmartPlugs {{can be used in}} tractors, portable generators, compressors, and pumps. In addition to general-purpose applications, such as lawn mowers and chainsaws, SmartPlugs can also be used in the recreational, marine, aviation, and automotive industries. Unlike traditional ignition systems, the SmartPlug system requires no distributor, coil points, or moving parts. SmartPlugs are non-fouling, with a faster and cleaner burn than traditional spark plugs. They prevent detonation and are not sensitive to moisture, allowing them to be used on a variety of engines. Other advantages include no electrical noise, no high voltage, exceptionally high altitude capabilities, and better cold-start statistics than those of standard spark ignition systems. Future applications for the SmartPlug are being evaluated by manufacturers in the snowmobile industry...|$|R

40|$|Enabling the {{widespread}} deployment of PEVs requires significant charging infrastructure. The difficulty {{and cost of}} PEV charger installation {{has resulted in a}} persistent shortage of plug points for charging. WINSmartEVTM is a novel network system of PEV charging stations that connects multiple PEVs to a given circuit by sharing the energy resource. By significantly increasing the number of plugs per circuit, and thereby decreasing the cost per plug point installation, an increase in access to charging for PEVs is achieved. An incremental {{increase in the number of}} plugs per circuit causes an incremental decrease in the amount of energy that a user can receive during a given charging session. Dividing a circuit is a zero sum game between the number of plugs per circuit and fulfilling the users’ needs and expectations. By focusing a charge scheduling system on the users’ needs, it is possible to maximize any combination of users’ needs and expectations, and number of plugs per circuit. A scheduling system was created that maximizes the number of PEVs that can be adequately charged from a given circuit by accounting for both users’ needs and expectations. Objective formulation was created to quantify users’ needs and expectations using multi-objective optimization. The formulation quantified 8 user needs and expectations functions categorized by 2 independent variables. Six needs were quantified as SOC based utility functions and 2 expectations were quantified as time based utility functions. The energy allocation scheduling problem was solved using the model predictive control method. The utility functions were fit to a state space model. However, the SOC utility function and feedback functions are non-linear so a closed form solution was not attempted. The scheduling system was simulated in Matlab and compared to the default charging algorithms. The system was validated using data from 3 separate energy sharing chargers that divide energy between 4 plugs each, over an 8 months period. The results show that this scheduling system significantly shifts to the right the graph of BEVs leaving with insufficiency charge for a given number of plugs on a circuit. Therefore, for any given number of plugs the circuit is sharing, a BEV user is significantly less likely to leave with insufficient charge. Furthermore, the likelihood of BEVs leaving with insufficient charge can be kept the same while significantly increasing the number of <b>plugs</b> <b>supplied</b> from the circuit...|$|R
