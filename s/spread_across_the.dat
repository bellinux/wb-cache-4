5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and <b>spread</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country, killing large numbers of rabbits.

Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E

Aided by above-average water vapor levels and the aforementioned upper-level trough, scattered thunderstorms developed across the region on September14. Two major incidents of flash flooding resulted in 21deaths in Utah, the deadliest flash flood event in the state's history. The previous deadliest event was on August13, 1923, when seven people died near Farmington. Flash floods occur annually in Washington County, Utah, {{with an average of}} one to two flash flood days per year since 1950.|$|E

Remnant moisture from the system <b>spread</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, washing out roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.|$|E
