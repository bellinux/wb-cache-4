2500|$|Having {{failed to}} secure finance from the Mines Royal Company, Wood wanted to {{incorporate}} the [...] "Company of Ironmasters of Great Britain", with a capital of £1,000,000, but it was feared this {{would prove to be}} a vehicle for <b>stockjobbing.</b> [...] This led to an investigation by the Privy Council, at which point William Wood died. [...] The government provided £500 to build furnaces by the high road to Chelsea, so that the promoters could demonstrate the process. [...] Wood, two of his sons, William and Charles, his son-in-law William Buckland, and Kingsmill Eyre were the petitioners in this. [...] A trial of the process in the presence of John Hanbury, Sir James Lowther, and the Earl of Hay took place in November 1731. [...] The iron produced was then tried by blacksmiths in the presence of Privy Council clerks. [...] The smiths gave the opinion that the iron required more work than common redshort iron and when cold was weaker. [...] This adverse report was the end of efforts to have a company chartered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{have much}} {{pleasure}} in proposing Mr. Allinson," [...] said Murray. [...] "I {{should like to}} mention that I remained a shareholder in this Company because I preferred his bare word to the strong recommendations of experienced <b>stockjobbing</b> friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|Remains {{to be seen}} if England {{has still}} honesty and public spirit enough to work this old-new California as it should be worked. I will answer for its success if the workers will avoid over-exclusiveness, undue jealousy and rivalry, <b>stockjobbing,</b> and the rings of 'guinea-pigs' and 'guinea-worms.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{need not}} tell you, sir, that this griping want, this dismal poverty, this {{additional}} woe, must {{be put to}} the accursed stocks, which have desolated our country more effectually than England. <b>Stockjobbing</b> was a kind of traffic we were utterly unacquainted with. We went late to the South Sea market, and bore a great share in the losses of it, without having tasted any of its profits.|$|E
60|$|The Abbe Dubois {{entered into}} the mysteries of <b>stockjobbing</b> with all the zeal of an apostle, and enriched himself by the spoils of the credulous; and he {{continually}} drew large sums from Law, as considerations for his political influence. Faithless to his country, {{in the course of}} his gambling speculations he transferred to England a great amount of specie, which had been paid into the royal treasury; thus contributing to the subsequent dearth of the precious metals.|$|E
60|$|The cabals of coal traders {{have for}} many years jockeyed us {{in the price of}} coals; they have raised and fell them at pleasure, and made mere <b>stockjobbing</b> work of it; but never so much as in his late majesty's reign; on a great impress for seamen, they, in less than a fortnight, raised the price of coals from twenty-three shillings to almost fifty. What a pinch must this be on the poor, who live only from hand to mouth, and buy their coals, poor souls! some by the half peck.|$|E
5000|$|In London, Archibald Grant became {{involved}} in share speculation, possibly from {{the collapse of the}} South Sea Bubble. He was elected to the Committee (Board of directors) of the Charitable Corporation in October 1725. [...] He was in debt from earlier <b>stockjobbing</b> to George Robinson (a stockjobber). [...] In October 1727, he joined a Partnership of Five to engage in speculation in the Company's shares. This was managed by Robinson, the other three partners being William Burroughs (another director), William Squire (an Assistant), and John Thomson (the Company's warehouse keeper).|$|E
50|$|A {{little while}} after Thomson became warehousekeeper, {{several of those}} {{involved}} in the management of the Corporation started speculating in shares on a very large scale. This seems to have begun because Grant owed money to Thomson, and both he and Burroughs had debts to Robinson from earlier <b>stockjobbing.</b> The Partnership of Five consisted of Sir Alexander Grant, William Burroughs, William Squire, George Robinson, and John Thomson. In October 1727, they began to buy the Corporation's shares, this all being handled by Robinson who was a stockbroker in Exchange Alley. They then heard of lead mines in Scotland belonging to Sir Robert Sutton and others, whose sale they proposed to the York Buildings Company. They bought shares in it, and those shares rose in value.|$|E

5000|$|For a time Burke's <b>stockjobbing</b> {{transactions}} prospered. In 1769, however, a crash came, {{and he was}} ruined. With William Markham, his old schoolmaster, he {{had been}} on terms of friendship. About the time of his disaster, however, their intimacy ceased, and in 1771 Markham, then bishop of Chester, in a letter addressed to Edmund Burke, accused him of saying something in, as it seems, a private conversation with himself which rendered him liable to [...] "a criminal prosecution in a matter of state." [...] This accusation was part of an attack made by the bishop on Edmund Burke, who in the draft of his reply speaks warmly of his kinsman's character, and of the kindness he had shown him in introducing him to Lord Rockingham, in the resignation of his office, and on other occasions. Burke's relationship to his cousin gained him admission to the club in Gerrard Street, and accordingly he appears in Oliver Goldsmith's [...] "Retaliation". Among the various stories told about the occasion of this poem, it is said that the notices Goldsmith first wrote of the Burkes were so severe, that Hugh Boyd persuaded the poet to alter them and entirely rewrite the character of William, for he was sure that if the Burkes saw what was originally written of them the peace of the club would be disturbed.|$|E

The main object of this diploma thesis is to analyse warrants. In {{first part of}} the thesis is theoretical background of warrants, pricing models, etc. Second part is mainly focused on investment strategies and <b>stockjobbing.</b> In the last part is comparsion to other financial products and also practical investment introduction are included...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of the}} reforms, {{which the}} Russian {{government}} began implementing in 1992 {{with the approval of}} the Supreme Soviet, is to create a social underpinning for the new authority in Russia. The present Russian leadership considers private entrepreneurs to be this underpinning. The nation's public property is being pilfered at a feverish pace. Attempts to depict this <b>stockjobbing</b> as people's privatization failed because workers are receiving only the lesser part of the wealth and almost no power at all in the economy. Large private fortunes are being amassed in a short time at the cost of the lowering of the workers' living standard and the deterioration of their general socio-economic situation, even in comparison to what it was under the totalitarian regime. ...|$|E
