50|$|Interior {{design was}} spartan and around 1900 third-class {{passengers}} sat on bare boards five abreast, second-class passengers on cushions also five abreast, while first-class passengers sat four abreast and enjoyed more legroom. In 1899 James Holden produced {{the first six}} passengers sat abreast carriages in a 13-carriage, third-class only train (each carriage was 27 feet long and 9 feet wide and had five compartments). This set, which also included such modern features as <b>slam</b> <b>lock</b> doors and gas tail lamps became the model for future suburban carriage design.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll be eat up alive!" [...] shrieked one lady. [...] "Come, Bess!" [...] And {{she took}} her little girl {{by the hand and}} ran for home, <b>slamming</b> and <b>locking</b> the door after her.|$|R
6000|$|Pausing {{at length}} above the {{imposing}} {{structure of the}} Hotel Anglais, Rob noticed {{at one of the}} upper floors an open window, before which was a small iron balcony. Alighting upon this he proceeded to enter, without hesitation, the open window. He heard a shriek and a cry of [...] "AU VOLEUR!" [...] and caught sight of a woman's figure as she dashed into an adjoining room, <b>slamming</b> and <b>locking</b> the door behind her.|$|R
6000|$|RAINA. Don't {{leave my}} mother, Louka, whilst the {{soldiers}} are here. (Louka glances at Raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain; then purses her lips secretively, laughs to herself, and goes out. Raina follows her to the door, shuts it behind her with a <b>slam,</b> and <b>locks</b> it violently. The man immediately steps {{out from behind the}} curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way.) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{struck out}} past him {{again with a}} quick {{feminine}} throwing-out of her arms from the elbows down, as if freeing herself from some imaginary bonds, and dashing into her chamber, <b>slammed</b> and <b>locked</b> the door. Colonel Starbottle, although no coward, stood in superstitious fear of an angry woman, and, recoiling as she swept by, lost his unsteady foothold and rolled helplessly on the sofa. Here, after one or two unsuccessful attempts to regain his foothold, he remained, uttering {{from time to time}} profane but not entirely coherent or intelligible protests, until at last he succumbed to the exhausting quality of his emotions, and the narcotic quantity of his potations.|$|R
60|$|He {{turns to}} run when {{a grasp of}} iron falls upon his arm, holding it like a vice. He could have screamed with the pain, and the sword which he held falls out of his nerveless fingers. The next moment he feels himself dragged by that same iron grasp {{through the open door}} into the hut, and hears the door <b>slammed</b> to and <b>locked</b> behind him.|$|R
5|$|Francis, {{having heard}} Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They <b>slam</b> and <b>lock</b> the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|R
50|$|After {{an intense}} confrontation, Coraline quickly escapes into the {{corridor}} and <b>slams</b> and <b>locks</b> the door shut onto the Beldam's hand, severing it. Her parents return to the real world, who appear to {{have no memory of}} what just happened. That night, the ghosts, who passed onto the afterlife with their real eyes, warn her {{to get rid of the}} button key to prevent the Beldam from accessing the real world. As Coraline prepares to drop it down the well, the Beldam's severed hand violently ambushes her and tries to drag her back to the Other World. Wybie saves Coraline by crushing the hand with a rock, throwing its remains and the key into the well and sealing it shut.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{out of what}} {{appeared}} to be a sort of market-place, they were driven, rather than conducted, to a whitewashed building, into which they entered through a low strong door, studded with large iron-headed nails. As they entered a dark passage, the door was <b>slammed</b> and <b>locked</b> behind them. At first, owing to their sudden entrance out of intensely bright day, they seemed to be in profound darkness, but when they became accustomed to the dim light, they found that they were in the presence of several powerful men, who carried long Eastern-like pistols in their girdles, and curved naked swords in their hands. These stood like statues against the wall of the small room, silently awaiting the orders of one whose dress betokened him of superior rank, and who was engaged in writing with a reed in Persian characters. A tall, very black-skinned negro stood beside this officer.|$|R
50|$|Telekinesis - Carrie's most known psionic {{ability is}} that she can easily control, rearrange, assemble, manipulate, throw and move {{multiple}} objects and people at once by strongly focusing her mind and boundless energy on the voluntary action or to channel her telekinesis through her emotions or impulse. Additionally, the 1976 movie and book implies that Carrie must see with her eyes what she manipulates; the 2013 movie shows Carrie using her hands to manipulate her telekinetic strength. In the 2013 movie: While heading {{out the door to}} prom, Carrie forced Margaret to freeze and telekinetically forced her mouth shut as she pushed her into the prayer closet and then <b>slammed</b> and <b>locked</b> the door. She was also able to telekinetically levitate herself as shown after she finished her attack while she flew off the stage. The level of telekinesis Carrie displayed in all incarnations seemed to be tied to her rage; the angrier she became, the more feats of telekinesis she was able to achieve.|$|R
5000|$|Sutekh knocks down Torch {{with his}} powers. Six-Shooter shoots Sutekh as Sutekh runs off. Jennings {{attempts}} to retreat, then he encounters Pinhead and Jester and he changes his mind. Jester heads to Rick's room as Pinhead sees Sutekh/Totem {{go through a}} door. Pinhead pounds on the door as Sutekh/Totem jumps on Pinhead and dominates him until Blade pulls him off and stabs him as he takes off flying. Rick {{goes back to his}} room and runs into Suzie; the door <b>slams</b> and <b>locks</b> them in. Rick gets on his computer and tries to figure out who the source is on the [...] "Life Force Rick" [...] and [...] "Help Me!" [...] messages, and the source turns out to be Lauren, telling Rick to activate The Decapitron. Jennings enters the room and tries to convince Rick to get his puppets and for them to leave. Jester enters the room and leads Rick to where the Decapitron is hidden.|$|R
50|$|On {{coaching}} stock trains fitted with central door <b>locking</b> (<b>slam</b> door), {{there is no}} ‘local door’ except on the train's Guard's van. Local instructions allow the Guard to operate train doors from any location {{it is safe to}} do so, or where regulations require them to do so. Once it is required, the Guard can lock all doors without requiring closing their door, as the locking bolt does not activate until the door is closed. Coaching stock trains with power doors, like the Mark 4 used on the East Coast Main Line, have local door switches at all door control panel locations.|$|R
50|$|Overcoming a nurse, and {{dressing}} in her clothes, a madman escapes from the Casa de la Loco Sanitarium. The Thief (Billy Zane) {{then goes on}} a crime spree that nets him a gun, a car, a fortune in stolen cash, and one dead loan office manager. As he escapes the murder scene, he comes upon a forbidden cemetery as a burial, replete with bagpipe music and a bizarre ceremony employing tuning forks and strange icons, is taking place. As the undertaker, the caretaker, and an odd assortment of mourners leave the service, The Thief peers into the coffin, thinking {{it is a good}} place to hide his briefcase of ill-gotten gains. As he strikes the tuning fork that is buried with the robe-draped skeleton, bagpipe music fills the air and throws him into convulsions. The coffin lid <b>slams</b> shut, <b>locking</b> his money inside, and The Thief is thrown into an open grave, knocking himself unconscious. When he awakens, he sets off to track down everyone present at the funeral in an attempt to find his cash, killing anyone who gets in his way.|$|R
5000|$|At home, So-yeon {{starts to}} have nightmares {{of a young}} girl with cat-like eyes. Later, she accompanies her friend Bo-hee to a {{run-down}} animal shelter, where she is going to adopt a cat. Bo-hee chooses a cat nicknamed [...] "Dimwit" [...] by the shelter staff. Alone in the cat room, So-yeon panics when the door suddenly <b>slams</b> shut and <b>locks.</b> She becomes disorientated and coughs up white hairballs, but Bo-hee soon comes for her. At the police station, Jun-seok and his fellow officers watch CCTV footage of the woman who died in the elevator. She is seen staggering and collapsing, and it's concluded that she died of a panic attack.|$|R
60|$|He started. There was a smash from below. He hesitated {{and went}} downstairs again. Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the {{splintering}} of wood. He heard a smash and the destructive clang {{of the iron}} fastenings of the shutters. He turned the key and opened the kitchen door. As he did so, the shutters, split and splintering, came flying inward. He stood aghast. The window frame, save for one crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of glass remained in the frame. The shutters had been driven in with an axe, and now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished. He saw the revolver lying on the path outside, and then the little weapon sprang into the air. He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too late, and a splinter {{from the edge of}} the closing door flashed over his head. He <b>slammed</b> and <b>locked</b> the door, and as he stood outside he heard Griffin shouting and laughing. Then the blows of the axe with its splitting and smashing consequences, were resumed.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there was}} someone rapping at the door. It was my {{landlord}} with threats and inquiries, an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy slippers. I had been tormenting a cat in the night, he was sure--the old woman's tongue had been busy. He insisted on knowing all about it. The laws in this country against vivisection were very severe--he might be liable. I denied the cat. Then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house, he said. That was true, certainly. He edged round me into the room, peering about over his German-silver spectacles, and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret. I tried to keep {{between him and the}} concentrating apparatus I had arranged, and that only made him more curious. What was I doing? Why was I always alone and secretive? Was it legal? Was it dangerous? I paid nothing but the usual rent. His had always been a most respectable house--in a disreputable neighbourhood. Suddenly my temper gave way. I told him to get out. He began to protest, to jabber of his right of entry. In a moment I had him by the collar; something ripped, and he went spinning out into his own passage. I <b>slammed</b> and <b>locked</b> the door and sat down quivering.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the alarm}} could be raised, Arief's squad had jumped {{the fence and}} {{overpowered}} the sleepy guards in the sentry box and guard room. Others entered from {{around the side of}} the house and covered it from the rear. About fifteen soldiers broke into the house. Both Nasution and his wife were bothered by mosquitoes and were awake. Neither heard the guards being overpowered but Mrs Nasution heard a door being forced. She got out of bed to check and on opening the bedroom door, she saw a Cakrabirawa (presidential bodyguard) soldier with a gun ready to shoot. She slammed the door shut and yelled a warning to her husband. Nasution wanted to take a look himself and when he opened the door, the soldier shot at him. He flung himself to the floor and his wife <b>slammed</b> and <b>locked</b> the door. The men on the other side began to smash the door down and fired a volley of shots into the bedroom. Mrs. Nasution pushed her husband out through another door and down a corridor to a side entrance to the house. He dashed across his garden to the wall separating his garden and that of neighbouring Iraqi ambassador. He was spotted by soldiers who fired off a volley of shots but missed. Scaling the wall, Nasution, broke his ankle as he fell into the ambassador's garden to hide. He was not pursued.|$|R
5000|$|Guessing {{that the}} only way to {{neutralize}} the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door <b>slams</b> shut and <b>locks</b> itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The Tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and there is the sound of someone (presumably Higgins) falling, either in a faint or dead. Amidst the dark screen, Dr. Chapin's voice says to the audience, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning. If any of you are not convinced that you have a Tingler of your own, the next time you are frightened in the dark... don't scream," [...] and the film ends.|$|R
50|$|Jacob, {{rather than}} resting, is busy {{designing}} {{a model for}} a new neighborhood. At dinner, Andrea asks Rusty to go get the phone book from the living room, which usually only takes a minute or two. However, when Rusty (who was talking the whole time) gets back into the living room, three hours have passed. Lisa lets Andrea have her room for the night and she sleeps {{on the couch in the}} living room. But the loud ticking from the clock keeps Lisa awake all night. Finally, near 3:00 am, she asks Andrea if she can sleep with her. Andrea says yes and tells Lisa to get her pillow from the living room. But when Lisa gets her pillow, the living room doors <b>slam</b> shut and <b>lock.</b> In Andrea's room, she hears the door open and something gets in bed with her. She finds the other side of the bed drenched in black slime. She turns the light on, but it's not there. Andrea goes downstairs and unlocks the living room doors, letting Lisa out. She suspects that Rusty may have locked them, but he tells her he went for a walk.|$|R
5000|$|The Maestro (Michael Jackson) {{lives alone}} in a creepy-looking mansion {{on top of a}} hill, {{overlooking}} the town of [...] "Normal Valley", who occasionally entertains the local children with scary magic tricks. One of the children tells his mother, who alerts the Mayor (also Michael Jackson). He in turn organizes the townspeople to go to the Maestro's mansion and force him out of town. When they arrive at the mansion, it is guarded by a large gate and by the haunting look of the mansion, have second thoughts about entering. The children assure the parents that the Maestro has done nothing wrong, and ask that they leave him alone. But the mayor says that he's weird and cannot be in their town. The front gate opens, frightening the townspeople, who {{make their way to the}} front door, which also opens by itself. They make their way into the house, and once they are all inside, the front door <b>slams</b> shut and <b>locks</b> itself. Two more large doors swing open revealing a large, darkened dance hall. Hesitantly, the townspeople make their way to the dance hall, where they are greeted by Maestro himself. The Mayor angrily confronts him, calling him [...] "strange", [...] "weird", and a [...] "freak", and telling him that he's not welcome in their town. Maestro defends himself, and in response the Mayor threatens him to leave. Maestro replies by scaring the townspeople. The frightened townspeople run for the doors, which Maestro shuts with his magical powers and saying they are his guests.|$|R
5000|$|The next scene {{begins as}} Jasper {{arrives at the}} (obviously) haunted house. He enters and yells for the Deacon, but instead the door <b>slams</b> shut and <b>locks</b> behind him. Trapped and frightened, Jasper walks forward into the room (with a gag where his shadow walks back), and Professor Scarecrow and Blackbird scare Jasper into leaving the pie on a table by the staircase; Jasper then hides in an old piano. It {{seems as if the}} plan worked, but when Professor Scarecrow gets in an {{argument}} with Blackbird about sharing the pie, the pie itself is taken by a ghost. Professor Scarecrow then accuses Blackbird of taking the pie, but the argument ends when they find that it was a ghost who took it. Frightened, Professor Scarecrow and Blackbird hide in the piano with Jasper after the pie is eaten and the invisible ghost tosses back the pan ("There ya' are, boys. Get you a refund on the tin.") The ghost walks across to the piano and gets ready to play it. ("Nothin' like a little music after dinner," [...] says the ghost.) The three characters whisper that they cannot see him, and there's a swing boogie-woogie piece played(possibly influenced by Thanks for the Boogie Ride) and every inanimate object begins to dance, from the grandfather clock to the bookshelf to the pie pan. Meanwhile, the piano keys hit the main characters as the music plays. The ghost's vigorous playing sends the trio out of the piano, out through the roof of the haunted house, and they hit a billboard.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship, with Edge {{defending}} the title in their New Year's Revolution rematch. Cena entered {{the ring on}} a large steel catwalk-like scaffold that had been lowered from the ceiling. Before Cena's entrance, fireworks started throughout the arena. Cena had the match in control in the beginning but later on {{he was forced to}} retreat to the floor on multiple occasions. Finally, Cena had enough and followed him, but Edge used Lita as a decoy. Edge speared Cena into the steel ring steps and following a baseball slide which threw Cena into the crowd. Edge remained in control and set Cena on the top rope but was subsequently pushed down. Cena went for a top rope splash but Edge moved away. Cena would make a comeback and try an FU but failed. Cena made a comeback during the conclusion of the match. He went for a Five Knuckle Shuffle but was distracted when Lita jumped on the apron to draw Cena's attention. Edge recovered as Cena and Lita argued, but when Edge charged, Cena sidestepped and Edge ran into Lita. Cena took advantage of the situation and quickly executed an FU on Edge and then put him into an STFU. Edge couldn't escape so he submitted making Cena the new WWE Champion.The main event was between Kurt Angle and Mark Henry for the World Heavyweight Championship. Angle defended the title in this match against Henry. The match marked the first time that two former Olympians battled for a world title in history. Angle began the match in trying to put Henry down but instead Henry dumped him to the floor, where Angle was beaten by former manager Daivari. Henry controlled Angle using his power but Angle managed to apply the ankle lock. After Henry kicked out after an Angle <b>Slam,</b> Angle <b>locked</b> in an ankle lock once more. Daivari distracted the referee and when Henry broke the hold again, he sent Angle crashing into the referee. At that point, Kurt got a chair. Daivari tried to stop him but Angle hit Daivari with the chair. When Angle tried to use the chair, Henry blocked the attempt and tossed Angle to the mat. As Henry advanced though, Angle low blowed Henry, which was followed by two chair shots. Angle went for the pin but Henry kicked out. Angle untied one of the turnbuckle pads on the middle rope. Angle ended up in that corner, but as Henry charged, Angle sidestepped and tripped him into the exposed steel. Angle rolled up Henry to retain the World Heavyweight Championship but as Angle celebrated, there was all darkness and The Undertaker's music played. Undertaker made his return to WWE television, in his first appearance since Armageddon, entering on a horse-drawn chariot. He intimidated Angle and then the ropes went down and the ring collapsed.|$|R
