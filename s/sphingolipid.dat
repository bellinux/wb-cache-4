5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{discovery}} of post-translational circular permutations and {{the suggestion of}} a possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, it was not until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. Saposins are a class of proteins involved in <b>sphingolipid</b> catabolism and antigen presentation of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. <b>Sphingolipid</b> biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E

Citing Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, Wade argues that Ashkenazi Jews were historically forced into intellectually demanding occupations by their European hosts, and these selective pressures favoured genes that raised their intelligence. The consequence of this, however, {{was an increase in}} <b>sphingolipid</b> diseases. The final chapter, Evolution, gives a summary of human evolution from its origins to the present, and declares that it is unlikely that it will ever cease. Wade speculates where evolution will lead humans in the future, suggesting further skeletal gracilisation, increases in intelligence, adaptations to the changing climate, and even the possibility of speciation.|$|E

These processes not only involve those <b>sphingolipids</b> that accumulate {{as a result of a}} variety of inherited lysosomal storage disorders, but, in addition, <b>sphingolipids</b> associated with long-chain base metabolism. This article reviews the chemical properties, pathways, regulated metabolism, and signaling function of <b>sphingolipids.</b> In addition, the potential roles of <b>sphingolipids</b> in renal-specific processes are considered.

5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a <b>sphingolipid</b> derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group. However, in order for this reaction to be carried out, a <b>sphingolipid</b> activator protein such as saposin B must be present. Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A can then hydrolyze the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sphingolipids</b> are {{normally}} necessary for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, but mutant strains that bypass {{the need for}} <b>sphingolipids</b> have been identified. Such bypass mutants fail to grow under stressful conditions, including low pH (pH 4. 1), when they lack <b>sphingolipids.</b> To begin to understand why <b>sphingolipids</b> seem to be necessary for coping with low-pH stress, we screened a genomic library and selected a suppressor gene, CWP 2 (cell wall protein 2), that when present in multiple copies partially compensates {{for the lack of}} <b>sphingolipids</b> and enhances survival at low pH. To explain these results, we present evidence that <b>sphingolipids</b> are required for a normal rate of transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins, including Cwp 2 and Gas 1 /Gpg 1, from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. The effect of <b>sphingolipids</b> is specific for transport of GPI-anchored proteins because no effect on the rate of transport of carboxypeptidase Y, a non-GPI-anchored protein, was observed. Since the Gasl protein accumulated in the ER with a GPI anchor in cells lacking <b>sphingolipids,</b> we conclude that <b>sphingolipids</b> are not necessary for anchor attachment. Therefore, <b>sphingolipids</b> must be necessary for a step in formation of COPII vesicles or for their transport to the Golgi apparatus.

MethodsA cohort of participants including 48 healthy persons, 103 chronic HBV-infected patients containing chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and HBV-related cirrhosis were included. High performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was performed to detect serum <b>sphingolipids.</b> The serological indicators were detected and quantified. The valid liver biopsy specimens were acquired from twenty five CHB. ResultsTwenty four serum <b>sphingolipids</b> were detected. There were eighteen <b>sphingolipids</b> showing {{significant differences between the}} healthy control and chronic HBV infection groups. In patients with chronic HBV infection, fourteen <b>sphingolipids</b> differed significantly between CHB and HBV-related cirrhosis. Among <b>sphingolipids</b> with a significant difference in both HBV infection vs healthy control and CHB vs cirrhosis, seven <b>sphingolipids</b> were independently related to the presence of cirrhosis. SM(d 18 : 1 / 24 : 0), a sphingomyelin (SM) compound, was found to have a negative correlation with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} lipid {{requirements}} of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine- 1 -phosphotransferase for the inositol-containing <b>sphingolipids</b> from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were characterized {{in terms of}} concentration and specificity. The effects of combinations of lipids, especially phosphatidylinositol and the inositol-containing <b>sphingolipids,</b> were also tested on the transferase.

The inositol-containing <b>sphingolipids,</b> phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine did not stimulate {{the activity of the}} transferase. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in combination with phosphatidylinositol had no effect on the transferase activity; however, the inositol-containing <b>sphingolipids</b> markedly inhibited the stimulation of the transferase by phosphatidylinositol.

Moreover, diverse metabolic intermediates of <b>sphingolipids</b> are known to play key roles both in proinflammatory and in anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effect of dietary <b>sphingolipids</b> on inflammation is a complicated field {{that needs to be}} further assessed. Our study evaluated the effects of orally administered maize glucosylceramide (GluCer), one of the most conventional dietary <b>sphingolipids,</b> on inflammation using the 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene-treated BALB/c murine model. Oral administration of GluCer inhibited ear swelling and leukocyte infiltration to the inflammatory site, suggesting that dietary GluCer has anti-inflammatory properties.
