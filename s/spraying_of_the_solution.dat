Para tanto,o experimento foi instalado em casa de vegetação do Departamento de Botânica, Instituto de Biociências, da Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, SP. Os tratamentos consistiram na pulverização da solução de 100 mg L- 1 de ácido giberélico (GA 3); 100 mg L- 1 de benzilaminopurina (BAP); 100 mg L- 1 de ácido 2 -cloroetil-fosfônico (ethephon); Stimulate® a 2 % (90 mg L- 1 de cinetina, 50 mg L- 1 de ácido giberélico e 50 mg L- 1 de ácido indolilbutírico) e água (testemunha). As aplicações foram {{realizadas}} em três épocas, aos 15, 25 e 35 dias após o transplante (d. a. t.) e o crescimento foi avaliado em cinco épocas de coletas a intervalos de 21 dias, sendo a primeira realizada aos 47 (d. a. t.). Foram determinados os parâmetros fisiológicos da análise de crescimento: razão de área foliar (RAF), área foliar específica (AFE), taxa assimilatória líquida (TAL) e taxa de crescimento relativo (TCR). Os resultados mostram que os reguladores de crescimento vegetal influenciaram os parâmetros fisiológicos da análise de crescimento. As plantas tratadas com BAP apresentaram maiores valores de RAF aos 47 d. a. t., já as plantas tratadas com GA 3, a TAL apresentou aumento até o 131 d. a. t. A TCR é decrescente para todos os tratamentos com reguladores de crescimento vegetal testados e a testemunha. The {{objective of}} this study was to estimate the effects of different plant regulators on the index growth analysis application of sage plants. An experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with controlled temperature and relative humidity, at the Departmento de Botânica, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments containing three replicates. Treatments consisted of the <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> of 100 mg L- 1 of gibberellic acid (GA 3); 100 mg L- 1 of benzylaminopurine (BAP); 100 mg L- 1 of 2 -chloroethyl phosphonic acid (ethephon); Stimulate® at 2 % (90 mg L- 1 of kinetin, 50 mg L- 1 of gibberellic acid and 50 mg L- 1 of indolylbutyric acid) and water (control). Applications of plant growth regulators were performed in 3 times, at 15, 25, and 35 days after transplanting, and growth was evaluated in five successive harvests at 21 -day intervals, performed at 47, 68, 89, 110, and 131 days after transplanting. The following growth index were determined: leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA), net assimilation rate (NAR), and relative growth rate (RGR). These results suggest that the plant growth regulators influence the index growth analysis. The plants treated with BAP presented increase values of LAR to the 47 days after transplanting. The plants treated with GA 3 to NAR presented increase until the 131 days after transplanting. The RGR is decreasing for all the treatments with vegetal regulators tested and the control...|$|E
40|$|PVDF, Poly(vinylidene fluoride), is a polymer {{that has}} been studied for over four decades due to its good {{electromechanical}} properties, stability, and durability in various environments. Currently, PVDF is the only commercially available piezoelectric polymer. PVDF is a polymorph, which indicates the presence of several crystalline phases such as α, β, γ, and δ-phase. Oriented β-phase PVDF exhibits ferroelectric properties and displays the largest piezoelectricity amongst the four phases, which makes it the most desirable phase. Preparing oriented β-phase PVDF is a multi-step process, which is cost intensive, due to the time, labor and energy utilized. The main goal of this work is to prepare oriented β-phase PVDF using the electrospraying technique in a one step process. During the electrospraying process a polymer jet is ejected. This jet disintegrates into droplets due to overwhelming surface tension, resulting in a sprayed coating on the collector substrate. Because of the combination of jet ejection and the high voltage applied between the needle tip and the substrate, the droplets can be stretched and the polymer chains can be oriented. Both the stretching and the high electric field are required for the transformation of α-phase to the oriented β-phase. This study proposes that by using the electrospraying technique {{it is possible to}} transform the α-phase to the β-phase in a one step process starting from solution. This research focuses on the processing and characterization of electrosprayed PVDF as well as electrosprayed PVDF/carbon nanotubes (PVDF/CNT) nanocomposites. The specific tasks are to determine the changes to the PVDF phases due to the electrospraying technique, and to determine the changes in the PVDF morphology due to the addition of carbon nanotubes to the polymer matrix. PVDF with two different molecular weights were electrosprayed using different solvents and parameters. Initial observations after electrospraying were that, high boiling point solvents resulted in the <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> and forming films, whereas a low boiling point volatile solvent such as acetone resulted in the spinning of the solution thus forming non-woven fiber mats. The thermal and electrical properties of the electrosprayed PVDF and PVDF/CNT composites are measured using several characterization techniques, including Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), Dielectric spectroscopy, Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). MDSC results show that electrosprayed PVDF has a lower melting point temperature than that of PVDF commercially available pellets. In addition, electrosprayed PVDF/CNT nanocomposites show a linear increase in the percentage of crystallinity with the increase of CNT concentration in the composite. Dielectric spectroscopy results indicate that by increasing the CNT concentration in the composite, the dielectric constant and the polymer conductivity increase. From the four characterizing techniques used, two of them, FT-IR and XRD, show {{that it is possible to}} transform α-phase to β-phase PVDF in a one-step process using electrospraying. The other two techniques, TSC and dielectric spectroscopy, show α-phase for the electrosprayed samples without CNT, and some β-phase formation with samples electrosprayed with CNT. These last two techniques; TSC and dielectric spectroscopy have results that differ from the FT-IR and XRD techniques. This contradiction may be a result of the small amounts of β-phase in the sample, which cannot be detected using these techniques. Another reason may be due to the difference in the probing levels between these techniques. XRD and FT-IR probe at the molecular level, whereas TSC and dielectric probe at a much larger scale, which may make it hard to detect small amounts of β-phase...|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} sample preparation. One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} electrospray ionization (EESI). This method involves having an electrospray of solvent directed at an angle against a different <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample <b>solution,</b> produced by a separate nebulizer. This method requires no sample preparation in that <b>the</b> electrospray <b>of</b> solvent extracts <b>the</b> sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which involves directing an electrospray at a surface with the sample deposited on top <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> sample is ionized in the electrospray as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that no sample preparation is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative matrix effects experienced by ESI {{due to the fact}} that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix on the ionization process.|$|R

40|$|O uso de substÃncias naturais para {{manejo de}} pragas da agricultura Ã uma opÃÃo economicamente viÃvel e traz benefÃcios tanto ao homem como ao ambiente, devido a sua baixa persistÃncia e toxicidade. Dessa forma, o objetivo do trabalho em questÃo foi verificar o potencial inseticida de extratos e Ãleos essenciais de funcho (Foeniculum vulgare), erva doce (Pimpinella anisum), cravo-da-Ãndia (Caryophillus aromaticus) e dos preparados homeopÃticos para o controle de Brevicoryne brassicae em couve (Brassica oleracea var. acephala). Os tratamentos utilizados foram os extratos de funcho, erva-doce e cravo-da-Ãndia a 10 %; Ãleos de funcho, erva-doce e cravo-daÃndia a 1 %; preparados homeopÃticos de pulgÃo CH 05 e CH 06 e controle com Ãgua destilada. Realizaram-se testes de mortalidade sobre ninfas e adultos de pulgÃo em condiÃÃes de laboratÃrio, com trÃs repetiÃÃes, cada uma constituÃda por uma folha de couve mantida no {{interior}} de uma placa de Petri contendo algodÃo umedecido. Em cada placa, foram liberadas dez ninfas e pulverizado 1 mL das respectivas caldas. As placas foram cobertas com filme plÃstico perfurado e incubadas com fotoperÃodo de 12 horas a 25 ÂC. AvaliaÃÃes foram realizadas apÃs 1, 12, 24, 48 e 72 h. ApÃs anÃlise em condiÃÃes de laboratÃrio, realizaram-se testes na cultura, em vasos, somente com os tratamentos extrato de cravo-da-Ãndia a 10 % e Ãleo de funcho a 1 %, pois os mesmos apresentaram-se significativos. Realizou-se, ainda, anÃlise sensorial das couves tratadas com o extrato de cravo a 10 % e Ãleo de funcho a 1 %. A anÃlise dos dados ocorreu por anÃlise de variÃncia e comparaÃÃo de mÃdias por Tukey, a 5 % de significÃncia. Nos testes realizados em laboratÃrio, verificou-se que, o Ãleo de funcho a 1 % apresentou a melhor mortalidade sobre as ninfas de pulgÃo, ou seja, 70 %, Ãs 72 h, seguido do extrato de cravo a 10 %, com 37 % de mortalidade. Quanto Ã sobrevivÃncia de adultos de pulgÃo, verificou-se que o Ãleo de funcho a 1 %, extrato de funcho a 10 % e o extrato de cravo a 10 % apresentaram os menores Ãndices de sobrevivÃncia, ou seja, 46 %, 53 % e 53 %, respectivamente. No teste de mortalidade realizado na cultura, observou-se a efetividade do extrato de cravo a 10 % e do Ãleo de funcho a 1 %, em que os mesmos obtiveram 6 % e 8 % de sobrevivÃncia de adultos de pulgÃes, respectivamente. A anÃlise sensorial das couves nÃo indicou diferenÃa significativa entre as mesmas, a 5 % de significÃncia. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> natural substances for pest management in agriculture is, economically, {{a viable option}} and has benefits for both human-beings and environment, due to its low persistence and toxicity. Thus, this trial aimed at determining <b>the</b> insecticidal potential <b>of</b> extracts and essential oils of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), sweet herb (Pimpinella anisum), clove (Caryophillus aromaticus) and of homeopathic preparations from CH 05 and CH 06 aphid on <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> Brevicoryne brassicae in cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. acephala). The treatments were: fennel extracts, sweet herb and cloves at 10 %; fennel oils, sweet herb and cloves at 1 %; homeopathic preparations with CH 05 and CH 06 aphid; control with distilled water. The mortality tests were done concerning nymphs and adults of aphids in laboratory, with three replications, each one consisting of a cabbage leaf kept inside a Petri dish containing moistened cotton. On each plate, ten nymphs were released added with a 1 mL <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respective <b>solutions.</b> <b>The</b> plates were covered with a perforated plastic film and incubated with a 12 hour photoperiod at 25 Â C. Evaluations were performed after 1, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. After analysis in the laboratory, some tests were done with the culture, in pots, only with the Indian cloves extracts at 10 % and fennel oil at 1 % treatments, since they were significant. There was, moreover, <b>the</b> sensorial analysis <b>of</b> cabbage, treated with clove extract at 10 % and fennel oil at 1 %. Data analysis was performed by analysis of variance and averages comparison by Tukey, at 5 % of significance. In lab tests, it was found out that fennel oil at 1 % showed <b>the</b> best rate <b>of</b> mortality on aphid nymphs, which means 70 %, at 72 h, followed by clove extract at 10 % with 37 % of mortality. It was registered for survival of adults aphids that the fennel oil at 1 %, fennel extract at 10 % and clove extract at 10 % had the lowest survival rates, as: 46 %, 53 % and 53 %, respectively.
