40|$|Introduction: Transplantation of {{germ cells}} restores the male fertility. Nevertheless, {{a lot of}} {{questions}} remain incompletely resolved. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate in vitro colonization efficiency of germ cells and sperm production capacity of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> before and after culture by sperm number assay in epididymis of recipient mice. Materials and Methods: We developed a Sertoli cell feeder in a co-culture system with <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> and the cells were co-cultured for 2 months. The cells were isolated from mouse neonates. Colony assay was performed during culture using light microscopy. The transplanted cells were traced using BrdU incorporation. Sperm parameters were assessed 2 months after transplantation. Results: Our findings showed that <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> created colonies during culture. Transplantation of fresh <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml did not show significant differences. However, after transplantation of 2 × 105 cells/ml cultured for 2 weeks, the number of epididymal sperms in recipients increased significantly in groups with more fresh cells. Conclusion: Epididymal sperm number in recipient mice can be increased by enrichment of type A <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> using an in vitro co-culture system. Other important factors include the source of donor cells and the number of transplanted cells...|$|R

Among various stem <b>cells,</b> <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> {{have a unique}} characteristic in which neighboring cells can be connected by intercellular bridges. However, the roles of intercellular bridges for stem cell self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation remain to be elucidated. Here, we show not only the characteristics of testis-expressed gene 14 (TEX 14) null <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> lacking intercellular bridges but also a trial application of genetic correction of a mutation in <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> {{as a model for}} future gene therapy. In TEX 14 null testes, some genes important for undifferentiated spermatogonia as well as some differentiation-related genes were activated. TEX 14 null <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells,</b> surprisingly, could form chain-like structures even though they do not form stable intercellular bridges. TEX 14 null <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> in culture possessed both characteristics of undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonia.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofiber on the proliferation of frozen-thawed bovine <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> in vitro. Materials and Methods: The isolated <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> from the prepubertal bull were frozen-thawed and cultured in two groups: the control group (C) including the <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> and the treatment group (T) including the <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> seeded onto PLLA. The cells in both groups were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5 fetal bovine serum and 40 ng/ml glial cell line-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF) for 2 weeks.

Primary cultures, initiated from testes, {{were treated with}} G 418 to eliminate the somatic cells and select for the piwil 1 :neo expressing spermatogonia. Addition of dorsomorphin, a Bmp type I receptor inhibitor, prolonged spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) survival in culture and enhanced germline transmission of the SSCs following transplantation into recipient larvae. In contrast, dorsomorphin inhibited the growth and survival of zebrafish female germline stem cells (FGSCs) in culture. In the presence of dorsomorphin, the spermatogonia continued to express the germ-cell markers dazl, dnd, nanos 3, vasa and piwil 1 and the spermatogonial markers plzf and sox 17 {{for at least six}} weeks in culture. Transplantation experiments revealed that 6 week-old <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cell</b> cultures maintained in the presence of dorsomorphin were able to successfully colonize the gonad in 18 % of recipient larvae and produce functional gametes in the resulting adult chimeric fish. Germline transmission was not successful when the spermatogonia were cultured 6 weeks in the absence of dorsomorphin before transplantation. The results indicate that Bmp signaling is detrimental to SSCs but required for the survival of zebrafish FGSCs in culture. Manipulation of Bmp signaling could provide a strategy to optimize culture conditions of germline stem cells from other species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To isolate and {{characterization}} of human <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> from stem spermatogonium. Methods The disassociation of <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> (SSCs) were performed using enzymatic digestion of type I collagenase and trypsin. The SSCs were isolated by using Percoll density gradient centrifugation, followed by differential surface-attachment method. Octamer- 4 (OCT 4) -positive SSC cells were further identified using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry technques. The {{purity of the}} human SSCs was also determined, and a co-culture system for SSCs and Sertoli cells was established. Results The cell viability was 91. 07 % for the suspension of human <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> dissociated using a two-step enzymatic digestion process. The cells isolated from Percoll density gradient coupled with differential surface-attachement purification were OCT 4 positive, indicating the <b>cells</b> were human <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells.</b> The purity of isolated human <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> was 86. 7 % as assessed by flow cytometry.

Three weeks after cultivation, the Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> were transplanted, via rete testis, {{into the other}} testis of the same mouse, which had been irradiated with 14 Gy. The mice were transplanted with: fresh cells (control 1), fresh cells co-cultured with Sertoli cells (control 2), the frozen-thawed cells (experimental 1) and frozen-thawed cells co-cultured with Sertoli cells (experimental 2). The morphological changes between different transplanted testes groups were compared in 8 weeks after transplantation.

With the exception of iron, laboratory irradiation experiments (with mice) revealed a similar pattern of spermatogonial loss proportional to the radiation dose at levels less than 0. 1 Gy.

40|$|The p 53 protein {{appeared}} {{to be involved in}} both <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and radiation response. During normal spermatogenesis in the mouse, spermatogonia do not express p 53, as analyzed by immunohistochemistry. However, after a dose of 4 Gy of X-rays, a distinct p 53 staining was present in spermatogonia, suggesting that, in contrast to other reports, p 53 does have a role in spermatogonia. To determine the possible role of p 53 in spermatogonia, histological analysis was performed in testes of both p 53 knock out C 57 BL/ 6 and FvB mice. The results indicate that p 53 {{is an important factor in}} normal <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cell</b> production as well as in the regulation of apoptosis after DNA damage. First, p 53 knock out mouse testes contained about 50 % higher numbers of A 1 spermatogonia, indicating that the production of differentiating type spermatogonia by the undifferentiated spermatogonia is enhanced in these mice. Second, 10 days after a dose of 5 Gy of X-rays, in the p 53 knock out testes, increased numbers of giant sized spermatogonial stem cells were found, indicating disturbance of the apoptotic process in these cells. Third, in the p 53 knock out testis, the differentiating A 2 -B spermatogonia are more radioresistant compared to their wild-type controls, indicating that p 53 is partly indispensable in the removal of lethally irradiated differentiating type spermatogonia. In accordance with our immunohistochemical data, Western analysis showed that levels of p 53 are increased in total adult testis lysates after irradiation. These data show that p 53 is important in the regulation of cell production during normal spermatogenesis either by regulation of cell proliferation or, more likely, by regulating the apoptotic process in spermatogonia. Furthermore, after irradiation, p 53 is important in the removal of lethally damaged spermatogoni...|$|E

40|$|Because {{chromosomal}} homologues segregate {{from one}} another during meiosis, spermatids are genetically different.

Selection of both mouse and rat testis cells with anti-CD 9 antibody re-sulted in 5 - to 7 -fold enrichment of <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> from intact testis cells, indicating that CD 9 is commonly ex-pressed on <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> of both species. Therefore, CD 9 {{may be involved in}} the common machinery in stem cells of many self-renewing tissues, and the identification of a com-mon surface antigen on <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> of different species has important implications {{for the development of a}} technique to enrich stem cells from other mammalian species. developmental biology, gametogenesis, Sertoli cells, spermato-genesis, testi...|$|R
40|$|The {{transplantation}} of {{germ cells}} into adult recipient gonads {{is a tool}} with wide applications in animal breeding and conservation of valuable and/or endangered species; it also provides a means for basic studies involving germ cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation. Here we describe {{the establishment of a}} working model for xenogeneic germ cell transplantation (GCT) in sexually competent fish. <b>Spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from juveniles of one species, the pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis (Atherinopsidae), were surgically transplanted into the gonads of sexually mature Patagonian pejerrey O. hatcheri, which have been partially depleted of endogenous GCs by a combination of Busulfan (40 mg/kg) and high water temperature (25 °C) treatments. The observation of the donor cells' behavior showed that transplanted <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> were able to recolonize the recipients' gonads and resume spermatogenesis within 6 months from the GCT. The presence of donor-derived gametes was confirmed by PCR in 20 % of the surrogate O. hatcheri fathers at 6 months and crosses with O. bonariensis mothers produced hybrids and pure O. bonariensis, with donor-derived germline transmission rates of 1. 2 – 13. 3 %. These findings indicate that transplantation of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> into sexually competent fish can shorten considerably the production time of donor-derived gametes and offspring and could {{play a vital role in}} germline conservation and propagation of valued and/or endangered fish species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In most mammals, the testis {{is always}} {{maintained}} {{at a lower}} temperature than in the abdomen, and exposure of the testis to body temperature causes degeneration of germ cells. In this research, the effect of heat exposure on sperm parameters and microstructure of mouse testis were investigated. Cryptorchida mouse were induced by exposure to abdominal heat. Immature mice were anesthetized and a small incision {{was made in the}} abdominal skin, then fat pad at the upper end of testis was sutured to peritoneum. Weight of testis, spermatogenic cell numbers, as well as epididymal sperm parameters were measured. The results showed that spermatogenesis was arrested and testicular weights and epididymal sperm parameters were significantly reduced in the bilateral undescended testis compared with unilateral undescended testis and the control mice. However, complete depletion of seminiferous tubules and absence of germ cells was not found in the animals. In general, high temperature caused a decreased in all analyzed parameters except <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cell</b> number probably due to the apoptosis and these changes significantly increase in bilateral groups compared with unilateral groups. We believe that the present model is a suitable for treatment of cryptorchidism and further biological research on spermatogenesis...|$|E

In this study, testis biopsies of patients with maturation arrest of spermatogenesis during a one year ago were first minced mechanically into small pieces and then Spermatogonial Stem Cells (SSCs) and Sertoli cells isolated by the two- step enzymatic digestion, were plated and grown on DSA-Lectin coated dishes in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10 % fetal calf serum. Transplantation of human spermatogonial cells into mouse recipient testis was performed on day 7 (before colony formation) and 2 weeks after culturing (colony formation). The effects of different concentrations of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cell</b> on quantity of transplantation and percent of colonized seminiferous tubules were assayed during 8 weeks after transplantation. The result showed that SSCs can be observed on the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules in place of spermatogonial stem cells and proliferation occurs about 4 weeks after transplantation. The difference in donor cells concentration had more effect on colonization of mouse recipient testis (p< 0. 05). It will be an alternative approach for the repopulation of infertile seminiferous tubules and preservation of fertility, in the future...|$|E
40|$|Spermatogenesis is a complex, highly organized, very {{efficient}} {{process that is}} based upon the capacity of stem cell spermatogonia simultaneously to undergo self-renewal and to provide progeny that differentiate into mature spermatozoa. We report here that testis-derived cells transplanted into the testis of an infertile mouse will colonize seminiferous tubules and initiate spermatogenesis in > 70 % of recipients. Testis-derived cells from newborn mice were less effective in colonizing recipient testes than cells from 5 - to 15 - or 21 - to 28 -day-old mice. Increasing the number of Sertoli cells in the donor cell population did not increase the efficiency of colonization. Unmodified embryonic stem cells were not able to substitute for testis-derived cells in colonizing testes but instead formed tumors in syngeneic as well as nonsyngeneic hosts. Finally, with recipients that maintained endogenous spermatogenesis, testis cell transplantation yielded mice in which up to 80 % of progeny were sired by donor-derived spermatozoa. The technique of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation should provide a means to generate germline modifications in a variety of species following development of spermatogonial culture techniques and should have additional applications in biology, medicine, and agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cell</b> initiates and {{maintains}} spermatogenesis in the testis. To perform this role, the stem cell must self replicate {{as well as}} produce daughter cells that can expand and differentiate to form spermatozoa. Despite the central importance of the <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cell</b> to male reproduction, {{little is known about}} its morphological or biochemical characteristics. This results, in part, from the fact that <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> are an extremely rare cell population in the testis, and techniques for their enrichment are just beginning to be established. In this investigation, we used a multiparameter selection strategy, combining the in vivo cryptorchid testis model with in vitro fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cryptorchid testis cells were fractionated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis based on light-scattering properties and expression of the cell surface molecules α 6 -integrin, αv-integrin, and the c-kit receptor. Two important observations emerged from these analyses. First, <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells</b> from the adult cryptorchid testis express little or no c-kit. Second, the most effective enrichment strategy, in this study, selected cells with low side scatter light-scattering properties, positive staining for α 6 -integrin, and negative or low αv-integrin expression, and resulted in a 166 -fold enrichment of <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Identification of these characteristics will allow further purification of these valuable cells and facilitate the investigation of molecular mechanisms governing <b>spermatogonial</b> stem <b>cell</b> self renewal and hierarchical differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the survival and proliferation ofspermatogonial stem cells from cryptorchid mouse testis in co-culture system over a 3 weeks period. Materials and Methods: Sertoli and <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated from bilateral cryptorchidmouse model testes. Isolated <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>cells</b> were co-cultured with Sertoli cells in minimalessential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS) for three weeks. Theidentity of the cells was confirmed through immunocytochemistry against Oct- 4 and Vimentin. Results: Best results were achieved from the co-culture system spermatogonia which continued toproliferate, and eventually, type A spermatogonia colonies were found. Most of the cells in thesecolonies were Oct- 4 positive. Conclusion: Bilateral cryptorchid surgery model is a good model for enrichment of spermatogonialstem cells (SSCs). These cells can be used for molecular characterization, genetic manipulation andrestoration of male fertility...|$|R
