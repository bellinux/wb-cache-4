50|$|Another Chinese {{workforce}} {{took time}} away from their regular vineyard work to excavate a labyrinth of wine-aging caves beneath the Beringer Vineyards near St. Helena, California. These caves exceeded 1,200 ft (365 m) long, 17 ft (5 m) wide and 7 ft (2 m) high. The workers used pick-axes and shovels - and on occasion, chisel <b>steel,</b> double <b>jacks</b> and black powder - to break the soft rock. They worked by candlelight, and removed the excavated material in wicker baskets. At least 12 wine storage caves were constructed by these methods.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{construction}} for basement walls typically {{falls into}} one of two categories: they will be made of poured-in-place concrete using concrete forms with a concrete pump, or they will use concrete masonry units (block walls). Rock may also be used, but is less common. In monolithic architecture, {{large parts of the}} building are made of concrete; in insulating concrete form construction, the concrete walls may be hidden with an exterior finish or siding. Inside the structure, a single Lally column, <b>steel</b> basement <b>jack,</b> wooden column or support post may hold up the floor above in a small basement. A series of these supports may be necessary for large basements; many basements have the support columns exposed.|$|R

After the miss, Harris mockingly patted Gerela on his helmet and thanked him for [...] "helping Dallas out," [...] but was immediately thrown to the ground by <b>Steeler</b> linebacker <b>Jack</b> Lambert.

The Steelers won this game, 21-17, after safety Glen Edwards intercepted a Staubach pass {{in the end zone}} to seal the victory. The hostility was evident in the third quarter when Steelers kicker Roy Gerela missed his second field goal, a 33-yard attempt. After the miss, Cowboys safety Cliff Harris mockingly patted Gerela on his helmet and thanked him for [...] "helping Dallas out", but was {{immediately}} shoved to the ground by <b>Steeler</b> linebacker <b>Jack</b> Lambert.

5000|$|After a {{shortage}} of goals {{in the second half}} of the 1991-92 season cost United the league title, Ferguson was intent on signing a new striker. His key target was the Southampton striker Alan Shearer, but he lost out to a newly promoted Blackburn Rovers side now managed by Kenny Dalglish, who had managed Liverpool to three league titles and was now backed by the millions of <b>steel</b> baron <b>Jack</b> Walker in the quest to bring similar success to the resurgent Lancashire club. Ferguson then switched his attention to Dion Dublin, the 23-year-old striker who had excelled in the lower divisions with Cambridge United. A week before the new Premier League season began, Dublin completed a £1 million move to Old Trafford to become United's only close season signing.|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} order and method took {{the place of}} general confusion. Bows, <b>steel</b> caps, and <b>jacks</b> were caught up from the grass.

50|$|Following {{a series}} of non-fiction books, Gale {{published}} his first novel, the well received Four Days in June, about the Battle of Waterloo, in 2006.

50|$|During {{this time}} Rovers {{experienced}} {{something of a}} revolution. During his first caretaker spell, they were a struggling Second Division club who had not tasted top flight football for some 20 years. Five years later, during his second caretaker spell, they had just {{been taken over by}} local <b>steel</b> baron <b>Jack</b> Walker and were a wealthy, ambitious side building for a challenge for promotion to the new FA Premier League - which was ultimately achieved {{at the end of the}} season under new manager Kenny Dalglish. By the time of his third caretaker spell five years later, barely 18 months had passed since their Premier League title triumph - the club's first top division title since 1914. His fourth spell came in 1999 after Rovers' shock relegation from the top-flight; while Parkes hoped to secure promotion and the manager's position on a full-time basis, this in fact proved to be his least successful stint as caretaker, and he was replaced by Graeme Souness in March 2000 with the club looking in danger of a second successive relegation. However, Parkes still remained at the club as Souness's assistant.|$|R

50|$|Jacks {{moved to}} a {{shipyard}} in Sunderland, and then became manager of Sunderland and Seaham Engine Works and Foundry.
