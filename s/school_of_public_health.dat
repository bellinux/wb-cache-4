40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the history <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and their contribution to the health of populations. Problems of definition and the diversity <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> make such assessment difficult.

40|$|There {{is a broad}} {{consensus}} {{on the need for}} high-quality <b>public</b> <b>health</b> education and research to tackle the world’s many <b>public</b> <b>health</b> challenges. <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> education and research are delivered by a variety of institutions operating very different models, which collectively can be called <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> Given the importance of education and research to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> systems, it is surprising how little research has been done to assess the role <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> in contributing to population health. In particular, it is notable there has been very little research on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the different models <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> that have evolved over the last 100 years. Thus, a historical perspective is crucial. To date most historical work has focused on US <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> Although the evidence is patchy, a global overview of the history <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> identifies three important themes: capacity building, multidisciplinarity and balancing teaching and research.

40|$|The {{international}} non-governmental {{community has}} {{played a major role}} in developing <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and continues to do so. Nearly a century ago, seminal investments of the Rockefeller Foundation played a pivotal role in developing <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> in North America and several abroad. Today, involvement of non-governmental organizations in continuing development <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> is needed, as many countries throughout the world continue to battle the burden of disease with insufficient numbers and quality <b>of</b> trained <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers. In this paper we discuss in particular the roles of the Open Society Institute working together with the Association <b>of</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> in the European Region to foster the development <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> in formerly socialist countries. We describe the development process in three example countries (Ukraine, Lithuania, and Macedonia), along with the difficulties they have faced. Government support and accreditation processes are needed to sustain the efforts to launch new <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and to ensure their quality. The lessons learned in these initiatives are relevant to future development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> education to provide the workforce required to address needs <b>of</b> professional <b>public</b> <b>health</b> in the 21 st century...|$|R

5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University.

5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health,</b> strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health.</b> In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E
