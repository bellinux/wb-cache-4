This feature enables the charging air to enter the combustion chamber and allows evacuation later of the products of combustion to the expander cylinders and pistons.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{program for the}} simulation of elastic wave propagation and scattering in three-dimensional (3 -D) cylindrical coordinates based on the first-order velocity-stress finite-difference scheme on staggered grids. Both Liao's and Lindman's absorbing boundary conditions are implemented for the exterior boundaries to efficiently truncate the computation domain for elongated 3 -D well logging problems. Symmetric and anti-symmetric boundaries in azimuthal and axial directions are also implemented in the code to further {{reduce the size of}} the problem. Included {{for the first time with}} this code are very large and complex geometrical structures such as the whole <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> housing of a sonic well-logging tool which typically involves hundreds of millions of unknowns. The calculation for such a large problem only takes a couple of days on a four- processor SGI Power Challenge machine. Different types of <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> models are studied for sonic logging tools. Simulation results show that different slotted sleeves vary widely in delaying and attenuating the pipe waves which travel along the tool housing. A new <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> structure with three horizontal slot sections for every vertical slot period is proposed for better performance. A dipole source is found to produce much cleaner waveforms than a monopole source. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Overend et al [68] {{designed}} a viscometer {{to measure the}} viscosity of slurries that {{have a tendency to}} settle. This viscometer consists of a rotating ribbed rotor surrounded by a stationary slotted sleeve; this system is then placed eccentrically within an inclined rotating bowl. It, is claimed that this overcomes most of the difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate measurements for these types of mixtures. If the mixture being sheared within the annulus does not represent the true composition of the slurry being, tested then the results are expected to be inaccurate. The presence of sediment {{at the bottom of the}} rotor or the formation of large masses of particles within the flow domain will affect the accuracy of the measurements obtained. This dissertation studies the amount of flow through the <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the region, or regions, of low shear rate within the flow domain. Assuming that end-effects are unimportant and that the slurries can be replaced by a single-phase fluid, three two-dimensional models are proposed. These models are designed to capture the large-slot construction of the sleeve and the, approximate, non-Newtonian behaviour of the slurries. The first two models solve analytically (using a regular perturbation scheme) and numerically (using a finite volume method) the moderate-and large-Reynolds-number flow, and the third model uses a finite volume method to study the flow patterns developed by pseudoplastic fluids. The results show that the mixing of the slurry is expected to be enhanced by moving the concentric system (i. e., the rotor and the <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve)</b> close to the rotating bowl and using low to moderate speeds for the rotor and bowl. In addition, when the cylinders rotate in the same directions, two (counter-rotating) eddies are present within the flow domain; whereas, only one eddy (rotating counter-clockwise) is ++present when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions. The presence of eddies in the former situation inhibits the flow through the sleeve; while, for moderate rotorspeeds, the flow through the sleeve is enhanced in the latter. When the slurry assumed pseudoplastic, we observe a region of low shear rate located near the dividing streamline present within the flow field. The distribution of shear rate within the flow field is shown to be affected by factors such as the rate of diffusion of the apparent viscosity and the value of the power law index. Therefore, this study suggests that for certain types of slurries, concentrations of particles exist within the domain and that the mixing of slurries can be impeded by the presence of eddies within the main flow field...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{wireless}} {{evaluation of the}} dielectric permittivity of liquids is presented. The use of a thin-film, <b>slotted</b> waveguide <b>sleeve</b> around a standard unplasticised polyvinyl chloride pipe is proposed. Wireless interrogation of the slot with a plane wave excites a resonant mode whose frequency {{is dependent on the}} dielectric permittivity within the pipe. The proposed method allows for measurements to be taken in situ with no need for samples. The device has good potential for very low-cost monitoring applications, which may require real-time, continuous assessmen...|$|R
50|$|As the {{component}} to be wound {{has to be}} presented only in the winding position and otherwise {{does not need to}} perform any movement during the winding process, also very bulky and massive products can be manufactured. One example is the rotors of electric motors (rotor winding technology, special form of the successive winding method): The wire is held by a clip fixed to the machine during {{the component}} change. Since the rotors often consist of heavy, punch-packed metal sheets, the flyer winding technology is of particular advantage in this regard. Since the flyer cannot be directly guided in case of the rotor winding technology, the wire is guided across polished guiding blocks into the corresponding groove or <b>slot.</b> Special wiring <b>sleeves</b> ensure the correct wire position at the terminals of the Commutators.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 2012, PE M420 is a [...] "quarter-size" [...] blade: {{where most}} servers are 'half-size', {{allowing}} 16 blades per M1000e enclosure, {{with the new}} M420 up to 32 blade servers can be installed in a single chassis. Implementing the M420 has some consequences for the system: many people have reserved 16 IP addresses per chassis to support the [...] "automatic IP address assignment" [...] for the iDRAC management card in a blade, but {{as it is now}} possible to run 32 blades per chassis people might need to change their management IP assignment for the iDRAC. To support the M420 server one needs to run CMC firmware 4.1 or later and one needs a full-size [...] "sleeve" [...] that holds up to four M420 blades. It also has consequences for the [...] "normal" [...] I/O NIC assignment: most (half-size) blades have two LOMs (LAN On Motherboard): one connecting to the switch in the A1 fabric, the other to the A2 fabric. And the same applies to the Mezzanine cards B and C. All available I/O modules (except for the PCM6348, MXL an MIOA) have 16 internal ports: one for each half-size blade. As an M420 has two 10 Gb LOM NICs, a fully loaded chassis would require 2 × 32 internal switch ports for LOM and the same for Mezzanine. An M420 server only supports a single Mezzanine card (Mezzanine B) whereas all half-height and full-height systems support two Mezzanine cards.To support all on-board NICs one would need to deploy a 32-slot Ethernet switch such as the MXL or Force10 I/O Aggregator. But for the Mezzanine card it is different: the connections from Mezzanine B on the PE M420 are [...] "load-balanced" [...] between the B and C-fabric of the M1000e: the Mezzanine card in [...] "slot A" [...] (top <b>slot</b> in the <b>sleeve)</b> connects to Fabric C while [...] "slot B" [...] (the second slot from the top) connects to fabric B, and that is then repeated for C and D <b>slots</b> in the <b>sleeve.</b>|$|R
40|$|In Nature, {{most of all}} Metals evolve as stable ores of {{chemical}} compounds like oxides, sulphides or carbonates. Lot of energy is required to refine and make them useful for some means for every Industry. Corrosion on metals can reverse an unnatural process back to a lower state of energy, easily as simple. It eats away metal in outdoor furniture and automotive bodies, leaving the surface with bad appearance {{and if it is}} not treated at right time, eventually it will lead to failure. Corrosion causes rusting the cookware and tarnishing of silver parts. Of greater importance, corrosion takes place on Steel bars in reinforced concrete result in failure of highway section, damage to big buildings, even collapse of towers that may take lives of many and leads to significant loss of resources. Hence, Corrosion prevention would be an important step for any industry, especially oil and gas Industry where corrosion is a serious ageing mechanism which impacts the equipment of Subsea, Surface, refineries and process plants. The present study is on localised corrosion happen in Safety Joint, inner sleeve and most design feasible corrosion monitoring equipment based on cost measures has been identified. Different types of Corrosion monitoring equipment’s for offline and online monitoring are discussed and GE RADAR Inspection with use of Ultrasound inspection technology has been identified as most feasible equipment. Equipment tool head can pass through safety joint bore during scheduled inspection intervals and which could take photographs of <b>slots</b> of inner <b>sleeve</b> where there is continuous flow of sand particles, due to accumulated sand on pressure chamber of safety joint which would create a threat of corrosion or erosion corrosion. Second feasible solution for corrosion monitoring would be real time installed corrosion monitoring device called Clamp on Corrosion Monitoring equipment, considering the investment Cost (Development and Installation Cost) of clamp on corrosion monitoring equipment, changing the material of to corrosion resistant alloy with required strength (Alloy 718) would be more effective solution for Safety Joint Inner Sleeve...|$|R
