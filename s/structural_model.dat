40|$|A {{structural}} view is a base {{view for}} describing software architectures. A structural view typically comprises several <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> that highlight particular {{aspects of the}} software. From our experience, managing the dependencies between <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> is a challenging, yet crucial task for maintaining consistency of an architectural description. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} composition of <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> and managing dependencies between models in such a composition. We formally define three basic relations between <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> and a composition operator that enables integration of several <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> based on these relations. We elaborate on several information preserving properties of the composition operator, including traceability, consistency, and completeness. The relations and composition operator have been integrated in the xADL language and the AchStudio tool.

25|$|The Balto-Slavic {{languages}} {{are most often}} divided into Baltic and Slavic groups. However, in the 1960's Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov made the following conclusions {{about the relationship between}} the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> {{is a result of the}} Baltic languages <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> transformation. This model is supported by glottochronologic studies by V. V. Kromer, although both of the most recent computer-generated family trees have a Baltic node parallel to the Slavic node.

40|$|Experimental {{conditions}} or {{the presence of}} interacting components can lead to variations in the <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> of macromolecules. However, the role of these factors in conformational selection is often omitted by in silico methods to extract dynamic information from protein <b>structural</b> <b>models.</b> Structures of small peptides, considered building blocks for larger macromolecular <b>structural</b> <b>models,</b> can substantially differ {{in the context of}} a larger protein. This limitation is more evident in the case of modeling large multi-subunit macromolecular complexes using structures of the individual protein components. Here we report an analysis of variations in <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> of proteins with high sequence similarity. These models were analyzed for sequence features of the protein, the role of scaffolding segments including interacting proteins or affinity tags and the chemical components in the experimental conditions. Conformational features in these <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> could be rationalized by conformational selection events, perhaps induced by experimental conditions. This analysis was performed on a non-redundant dataset of protein structures from different SCOP classes.

40|$|The {{structural}} approach offers an integrated framework {{to deal with}} yield spreads and default probability simultaneously. However, <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> perform poorly in predicting corporate bond spreads. It is unclear whether this poor performance is caused by characteristics of individual models, missing factors, or different calibration procedures. This study evaluates the performance of four <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> by incorporating two important factors, personal taxes and the liquidity factor, and calibrating these models to data. To ensure our results are not contingent on the calibration method, we further apply the maximum likelihood estimation method to a large sample of individual bonds.

40|$|Much of {{epidemiology}} and clinical medicine {{is focused on}} the estimation of treatments or interventions administered over time. In such settings of longitudinal treatment, time-dependent confounding is often an important source of bias. Marginal <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> are a powerful tool for estimating the causal effect of a treatment using observational data, particularly when time-dependent confounding is present. Recent statistical work presented a generalization of marginal <b>structural</b> <b>models,</b> called history-adjusted marginal <b>structural</b> <b>models.</b> Unlike standard marginal <b>structural</b> <b>models,</b> history-adjusted marginal <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> can be used to estimate modification of treatment effects by time-varying covariates. Estimation of time-dependent causal effect modification is frequently of great practical relevance. For example, clinical researchers are often interested in how the prognostic significance of a biomarker for treatment response can change over time. This article provides a practical introduction to the implementation and interpretation of history-adjusted marginal <b>structural</b> <b>models.</b> The method is illustrated using a clinical question drawn from the treatment of HIV infection. Observational cohort data from San Francisco, California, collected between 2000 and 2004, are used to estimate the effect of time until switching antiretroviral therapy regimen among patients receiving a non-suppressive regimen, and how this effect differs depending on CD 4 T cell count...|$|R

[...] These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds.
