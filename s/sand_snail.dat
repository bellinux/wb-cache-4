50|$|The Ichetucknee siltsnail, {{also known}} as the <b>sand</b> grain <b>snail,</b> {{scientific}} name Floridobia mica, is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod in the family Hydrobiidae. This species is endemic to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The shark eye (like all moon snails) is predatory, feeding {{mainly on}} {{bivalves}} {{buried in the}} <b>sand.</b> This <b>snail</b> drills a neat [...] "countersunk" [...] circular hole through the shell of its prey species, and then feeds on the soft tissue within.|$|R
40|$|The aquicolous {{organism}} {{samples were}} shelled, stirred and mixed respectively. The dried samples were dried deeper, rubbed and sifted out. The treated sample was extracted by acetone thrice in ultrasonic bath, then mixed the three extracted solutions. Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 {{was used to}} remove water in extract solution and NZ was used to concentrate the solution. The concentrated solution was transferred to Florisil column and the mixture of acetic ester and alkyl (1 / 5, v/v) was used to elute it. At last, the treated samples were analyzed qualitatively by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EI/MS), and they were quantified by internal standard method. The conditions of pretreatment such as the selection of the extractant, the sorbent, the sorbent activation method and the eluent were optimized. The problem of controlling analysis blank was discussed. The linear correlation coefficient was higher than 0. 9999, the limit of detection was lower than 3. 7 g/L, the recovery values were in the range of 64. 1 % to 124 % and the relative standard deviation of the method was lower than 16. 4 %. This method was successfully applied to analyze seventeen kinds of phthalates of environmental incretion simultaneously in three kinds of fish(saury, snakehead, curcian), two kinds of seashell (<b>sand</b> <b>snail,</b> oyster), one shellfish (prawn), one cephalopod (octopus), two kinds of plant (kelp, seaweed) and two dried food(dried kelp, dried whitebait). Dimethyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate were determined in all samples. Diethyl phthalate and Di(2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate were determined in many samples. It showed that these five kinds of phthalates had polluted the water in a certain extent...|$|E
50|$|Cone snails {{are found}} in all {{tropical}} and subtropical seas, from the intertidal zone to deeper areas, living on sand or among rocks or coral reefs. When living on <b>sand,</b> these <b>snails</b> bury themselves with only the siphon protruding from the surface. Many tropical cone snails live in or near coral reefs. Some species are found under rocks in the lower intertidal and shallow subtidal zones.|$|R
5000|$|Boyd {{was born}} in Darvel, Ayrshire, the son of Thomas Boyd, master builder and Jeanie Morton. He was educated at Kilmarnock Academy. [...] He then {{attended}} the University of Glasgow where he began a course in engineering before switching to zoology. As an undergraduate he studied <b>sand</b> dune <b>snails</b> {{on the island of}} Tiree in the Inner Hebrides, subsequently undertaking a doctoral study on the earthworms of the machair and further ecological research.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} ancient {{sand dunes}} that have been fossilized and {{hollowed}} out by winds, producing wind caves. Marine fossils such as <b>sand</b> dollars and <b>snails</b> can be found, but {{it is illegal to}} remove any fossils.|$|R
40|$|Many marine {{gastropods}} {{face the}} challenge of adhering to substrates under adverse flow conditions. Some species live on both solid and sedimentary substrates, although how these substrate generalists resist detachment from materials with fundamentally different mechanical properties is not well studied. We used field observations and flow tank experiments to compare the capabilities and tactics of Haminoea vesicula, an opisthobranch gastropod, when exposed to destabilizing flow on its native sand and eelgrass. Velocities of outgoing and incoming spring tides in the tidal creeks and over and within eelgrass beds where H. vesicula live at False Bay, San Juan Island, WA ranged from 1 to 30 cm/s. In a flow tank, snails’ resistance to current depended on substrate and orientation. On eelgrass, snails moving into flow maintained their position at velocities exceeding 40 cm/s, but were more vulnerable when facing away or sideways to flow (falling off at mean velocities of 25 and 32 cm/s respectively). In the latter orientation, snails would often rotate into flow by hooking onto the leading edge of eelgrass with the anterior edge of the cephalic shield. In this position, snails resisted flows exceeding 40 cm/s. Snails crawling on sediment and exposed to turbulent flow drew sediment-encrusted mucus sheets dorsally, completely ensheathing their bodies. “Sheeting” significantly increased snails’ effective weight and ability to resist flow. On <b>sand,</b> <b>snails</b> ensheathed in sediment were least stable in the sideways orientation compared to those facing into or away from flow (mean velocities of 13 vs. 20 and 23 cm/s). Experiments on sandpaper indicated that snails were destabilized on sediment due to failure of adhesion of the sedimentary layers beneath them rather than their attachment to the sand...|$|R
50|$|Formulations made of {{neem oil}} also find wide usage as a {{biopesticide}} for organic farming, as it repels {{a wide variety}} of pests including the mealy bug, beet armyworm, aphids, the cabbage worm, thrips, whiteflies, mites, fungus gnats, beetles, moth larvae, mushroom flies, leafminers, caterpillars, locust, nematodes and the Japanese beetle. Neem oil is not known to be harmful to mammals, birds, earthworms or some beneficial insects such as butterflies, honeybees and ladybirds (ladybugs in US English) if it is not concentrated directly into their area of habitat or on their food source. It {{can be used as a}} household pesticide for ant, bedbug, cockroach, housefly, <b>sand</b> fly, <b>snail,</b> termite and mosquitoes both as repellent and larvicide. Neem oil also controls black spot, powdery mildew, anthracnose and rust fungi.|$|R
40|$|Illinoian {{sand and}} gravel, Sangamonian paleosol, Altonian and Farmdalian loesses, and Woodfordian sediments (laminated sand, silt, clay, and till) occur in {{superposition}} at the George Rackle and Sons Gravel Pit, {{situated in the}} valley of Mill Creek, Garfield Heights, Ohio. A molluscan fauna consisting of 17 species of terrestrial snails was identified from three studied sections of the Farmdalian loess. Ten species, Deroceras laeve, Discus cronkhitei, Gastrocopta armifera, Helicodiscus parallelus, Nesovitrea electrina, Punctum minutissimum, Strobilops sp., Triodopsis algonquinensis, Vertigo elatior, and V. gouldi hannai, are new to the Farmdalian loess of this area. Ten of the loess species do not occur {{at all of the}} sampled sections. These variations in the composition of the molluscan fauna, together with a consideration of the color and the structure of the Farmdalian loess examined at four sections within this pit, suggest that the deposition may have been interrupted by erosion, or a period of non-deposition, or both, and that it is probably steeply time-transgressive. Colluviation {{toward the end of the}} Farmdalian Substage is suggested by a contorted two- to six-inch zone containing broken, angular clasts of clay, pebbles, <b>sand,</b> and terrestrial <b>snails,</b> all contained in a silt (loess) matrix, that occurs locally near the top of the Farmdalian loess. The lower 6 feet of the overlying Woodfordian laminated sequence consists of intercalated layers of sand, silt, and clay, with scattered rock, shell, and plant fragments. This unit contained 12 species of terrestrial snails, all of which also occur in the Farmdalian loess. The terrestrial nature of the fauna, the similarity of the Woodfordian and Farmdalian snail assemblages, the total absence of pollen or of any aquatic organisms, and the presence of scattered clay-blebs, sand-sized quartz grains, and pebbles all suggest that the lower part of the Woodfordian sediments may have been derived locally from older units (Farmdalian loess, Sangamonian paleosol, and Illinoian sand and gravel). These materials were probably transported by some mass-wasting process and redeposited subaerially in topographic lows as slopewash, or as colluvium, or both. Layered modern sediments now accumulating in small, shallow depressions on the floors of abandoned borrow-pits in the area appear to simulate on a small scale the features observed in the basal Woodfordian sediments.
