5|$|The game {{features}} two weapons {{new to the}} Metroid series: the tri-splitting Spazer Laser Beam, and the Plasma Beam, which {{passes through}} enemies when shot. Samus can only equip one beam at a time; however, she can switch between them by returning to where they are first found. Metroid II features the Space Jump, a new suit enhancement that allows Samus to jump infinitely and access otherwise unreachable areas. The game also sees the return of Samus' Morph Ball, a mode in which she curls up into a ball to travel through small tunnels. In addition, the game {{is the first in}} the series to feature the Spider Ball and <b>Spring</b> <b>Ball.</b> The Spider Ball allows Samus to climb most walls or ceilings, giving her freedom to explore both the surfaces and ceilings of caverns, and the <b>Spring</b> <b>Ball</b> gives Samus the ability to jump while curled up into a ball in the Morph Ball form.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the <b>Spring</b> <b>Ball</b> adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Sulphur <b>Springs</b> <b>Ball</b> Park, as it {{was first}} known, was located in an area {{referred}} to by early settlers as French Lick Springs.

By 1870, the baseball grounds were referred to as Athletic Park.|$|R

500|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy is a {{video game}} compilation, which covers Metroid Prime (2002) and its sequels, [...] (2004) and [...] (2007), all {{contained}} on a single disc. The games are accessible via a new, unified start menu designed differently {{from any of the}} previous editions of the included games. The menu also allows independent access to the Echoes multiplayer mode, the extras menu, and other settings. The updated Wii versions of Prime and Echoes, which were released separately in Japan as part of the New Play Control! series, utilize the same Wii Remote control scheme introduced in Corruption. The <b>Spring</b> <b>Ball</b> ability featured in Corruption is also implemented in the first two games. Other updates include shorter load times, upgraded textures, bloom lighting, and 16:9 widescreen capabilities; however, the heads-up display is always displayed at the original aspect ratio, causing it to be stretched horizontally when in widescreen mode.|$|E
2500|$|Ali was not {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Democratic party but changed parties after listening to Representative Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). Ali was [...] "so enamored of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions that he changed his party affiliation from Green to Democratic." [...] Ali soon became [...] "the first elected President of the District 39 Democratic Club". Ali's political activity first gained media attention when he [...] "was the Legislative District 39 Coordinator for the Howard Dean presidential campaign in 2003 and early 2004." [...] After Dean failed to win the primary, Ali supported the John Kerry and John Edwards presidential ticket. During that election season, Ali became a full-time campaign volunteer for Rep. Chris Van Hollen, because of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions and his stance on the Iraq War. During Van Hollen's 2004 reelection campaign, Ali said [...] "I'm really motivated against this war and have never felt so animated before. I thought, 'What is the most head-turning thing I could possibly do?'" [...] and he [...] "bought 500 bumper stickers at a buck apiece and applied more than 400 to the car". It was noted that the family's other car was kept [...] "very pristine" [...] as [...] "That's the one his wife drives." [...] Later that year he was Co-Chair of the Montgomery County Democratic <b>Spring</b> <b>Ball.</b> Also in 2004, Ali, {{a member of the}} Montgomery County Muslim Council, helped plan [...] "the first Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship" [...] with [...] "congregations Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Adat Shalom in Bethesda, Bethesda Jewish Congregation and Fabrangen Cheder" [...] to [...] "clean up a historic Underground Railroad stop in Germantown". Ali hoped the event would [...] "allow people to start lasting friendships and show the ability of these groups to come together for a common good." [...] In 2005, Ali's political activities expanded when he helped form the [...] "Longdraft Road Coalition", an organization opposing the expansion of this [...] "quiet, residential two-lane road to a bustling four-lane byway." [...] Ali became [...] "co-chairman of the 180-person plus group" [...] whose efforts were largely viewed as successful. In September 2005, Ali also co-organized [...] "The 2nd annual Montgomery County Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship". In 2005, Ali was a campaign supporter of Jun Choi, the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Edison, New Jersey, which Choi won.|$|E

5000|$|Developed by Bosch in 1975 for hammer drills, the SDS System uses an SDS Shank {{which is}} a {{cylindrical}} shank with indentations to be held by the chuck. [...] A tool is inserted into the chuck by pressing in, and is locked in place until a separate lock release is used. The rotary force is supplied through wedges that fit into two or three open grooves. The hammer action actually moves the bit up and down within the chuck since the bit is free to move a short distance. Two <b>sprung</b> <b>balls</b> fit into closed grooves, allowing movement whilst retaining the bit. SDS relies on a tool having the same shank diameter as the chuck; there are three standard sizes: ...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} spread the fun {{throughout}} the year, a number of colleges have broken with tradition to hold balls at different times, normally either in the winter {{at the end of}} Michaelmas term, i.e. the beginning of December, or in spring at the end of Lent term. Selwyn is the only college to hold a yearly winter ball, known as the Snowball; in 2008 Selwyn also held a May Ball to celebrate its 125th Birthday and will do so again in 2015. Fitzwilliam holds winter balls every two years, the most recent being December 2014.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of laboratory}} reared Zimbabwean Amblyomma hebraeum and A. variegatum ticks to infection with geographically distinct Cowdria ruminantium strains was investigated by feeding both species simultaneously on individual sheep infected {{with one of}} the four strains (Crystal <b>Springs</b> [Zimbabwe], <b>Ball</b> 3 [South Africa], Gardel [Guadeloupe] and Nigeria [Nigeria]). A. hebraeum ticks demonstrated a high susceptibility to infection with all four C. ruminantium strains. In comparison, A. variegatum were less susceptible to infection with the Crystal <b>Springs</b> and <b>Ball</b> 3 strains (P < 0. 001), but showed a similar susceptibility to the Gardel and Nigeria strains. The differences in susceptibility of A. variegatum to infection with the four strains of C. ruminantium correlated with the origin of these strains. The consistently higher susceptibility of A. hebraeum ticks to infection with geographically different C. ruminantium strains may be one explanation for the observation that heartwater is a more serious problem where A. hebraeum is the vector of the disease...|$|R
