50|$|The <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> is a slow-moving {{animal and}} feeds mainly on ants, eating between 700 and 5,000 a day. Sometimes, it also feeds on other insects, such as {{termites}} and small coccinellid beetles. The <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> defecates once a day. Some of those feces contain a large quantity of exoskeleton fragments of insects, indicating the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> does not possess either chitinase or chitobiase, digestive enzymes found in insectivorous bats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>anteaters</b> {{are found}} from Oaxaca and {{southern}} Veracruz in Mexico, through Central America (except El Salvador), and south to Ecuador, and northern Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. A smaller, isolated population {{is also found}} in the northern Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil, and there are also <b>silky</b> <b>anteaters</b> on the island of Trinidad. They inhabit a range of different forest types, including semideciduous, tropical evergreen, and mangrove forests, from sea level to 1500 m.|$|R
50|$|Many {{arboreal}} species, such as tree porcupines, chameleons, <b>silky</b> <b>anteaters,</b> spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails {{to grasp}} branches. In the spider monkey and crested gecko, {{the tip of}} the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provide increased friction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>anteaters</b> are nocturnal and arboreal, {{found in}} lowland rainforests with {{continuous}} canopy, {{where they can}} move to different places without the need to descend from trees. They can occur at fairly high densities of 0.77 individuals/ha, for example, in some areas. Females have smaller home ranges than males.|$|R

50|$|Isla Damas, or Damas Island, {{is a small}} (6 km²) {{island in}} Costa Rica in the {{vicinity}} of Quepos. It is particularly noted for its estuaries lined with mangroves. Fauna on the island include white-faced monkeys, sloths, green iguanas, crocodiles, spectacled caimans, boas, crab-eating raccoons and <b>silky</b> <b>anteaters,</b> as well as crabs and numerous bird species, such as: heron, pelicans. Boat and kayak tours through the island's estuaries are popular excursions with tourists staying in Quepos, Manuel Antonio National Park, or Jacó.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>anteaters</b> are the {{smallest}} living anteaters, and have proportionately shorter faces and larger crania than other species. Adults {{have a total}} length ranging from 36 to 45 cm, including a tail 17 to 24 cm long, and weigh from 175 to 400 g. They have dense and soft fur, which ranges from grey to yellowish in colour, with a silvery sheen. Many subspecies have darker, often brownish, streaks, and paler underparts or limbs. The eyes are black, and the soles of the feet are red.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>anteaters</b> and {{northern}} tamanduas extend their ranges {{as far north}} as southeastern Mexico, while giant anteaters can be found {{as far north as}} Central America. Southern tamanduas range south to Uruguay (giant anteaters did also until their recent extirpation there) and the ranges of all species except the northern tamandua overlap in eastern Brazil. Anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent, during most of the Cenozoic Era. Once the Isthmus of Panama formed about three million years ago, however, anteaters invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|R

5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, <b>silky</b> <b>anteaters,</b> spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|R
50|$|The <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> (Cyclopes didactylus) is {{a native}} of the hottest parts of South and Central America, and {{about the size of a}} cat, of a general {{yellowish}} color, and exclusively arboreal in its habits.|$|E
50|$|Anteaters {{are common}} in lowland and middle {{elevation}} throughout Costa Rica. The most commonly seen of Costa Rica's three anteaters species is the northern tamandua. The giant anteater is huge and endangered. The other anteater is the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater.</b>|$|E
50|$|When threatened, the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> {{like other}} anteaters, defends itself by {{standing}} {{on its hind}} legs and holding its fore feet close to its face so it can strike any animal that tries to get close with its sharp claws.|$|E
50|$|Extant {{species are}} the giant {{anteater}} Myrmecophaga tridactyla, about 1.8 m long including the tail; the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> Cyclopes didactylus, about 35 cm long; the southern tamandua or collared anteater Tamandua tetradactyla, about 1.2 m long; {{and the northern}} tamandua Tamandua mexicana of similar dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> or pygmy anteater, (Cyclopes didactylus) is {{a species}} of anteaters from Central and South America, the only living species in the genus Cyclopes and the family Cyclopedidae. A single extinct cyclopedid genus, Palaeomyrmidon, known from the Miocene of Argentina, may be ancestral to the living species.|$|E
50|$|The {{fossil record}} for anteaters is {{generally}} sparse. Some known fossils include the Pliocene genus Palaeomyrmidon, {{a close relative}} to the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> Protamandua, the sister taxon to the clade that includes the giant anteater and the tamanduas from the Miocene, and Neotamandua, a sister taxon to Myrmecophaga. Protamandua was larger than the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> but smaller than a tamandua, while Neotamandua was larger, falling somewhere between a tamandua and a giant anteater. Protamandua {{did not appear to}} have feet specialized for terrestrial or arboreal locomotion, but it may have had a prehensile tail. Neotamandua, though, is unlikely to have had a prehensile tail and its feet were intermediate in form between those of the tamanduas and the giant anteater. The species Neotamandua borealis was suggested to be an ancestor of the latter.|$|E
50|$|Anteater {{habitats}} include dry tropical forests, rainforests, grasslands, and savannas. The <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> (Cyclopes didactylus) is specialized to an arboreal environment, but {{the more}} opportunistic tamanduas find their food both {{on the ground and}} in trees, typically in dry forests near streams and lakes. The almost entirely terrestrial giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) lives in savannas.|$|E

50|$|Some authors {{suggest the}} <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> usually dwells in silk cotton trees (genus Ceiba). Because of its {{resemblance}} to the seed pod fibers of these trees, it can use the trees as camouflage and avoid attacks of predators such as hawks and, especially, harpy eagles. During the day, they typically sleep {{curled up in a}} ball. Although they are rarely seen in the forest, they can be found more easily when they are foraging on lianas at night.|$|E

5000|$|Austrian {{researchers}} {{studying the}} mammals of Piedras Blancas NP in 2003 and 2004 {{compiled a list}} of 96 species sighted or caught in camera traps. The 14 species of carnivores include raccoons, coati, kinkajou, olingo, skunks, grison, tayra and five species of cats (jaguar, ocelot, margay, jaguarundi and puma). It is, however, highly unlikely that tourists will encounter a wildcat as they are elusive and nocturnal. Two-toed sloths are rare in the Esquinas forest but {{can be found in the}} coastal areas around Golfito. Around 20 years ago, the giant anteater was seen for the last time by local hunters, but it is extinct today.

5000|$|The giant {{anteater}} got its binomial name from Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name, Myrmecophaga, and specific name, tridactyla, are both Greek, meaning [...] "anteater" [...] and [...] "three fingers", respectively. Myrmecophaga jubata {{was used as}} a synonym. Three subspecies have been tentatively proposed: M. t. tridactyla (ranging from Venezuela and the Guianas to northern Argentina), M. t. centralis (native to Central America, northwestern Colombia, and northern Ecuador), and M. t. artata (native to northeastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela). The {{giant anteater}} is grouped with the semiarboreal northern and southern tamanduas in the family Myrmecophagidae. Together with the family Cyclopedidae, whose only extant member is the arboreal <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> the two families comprise the suborder Vermilingua.Anteaters and sloths belong to order Pilosa and share superorder Xenarthra with the Cingulata (whose only extant members are armadillos). The two orders of Xenarthra split 66 million years ago (Mya) during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 Mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. The Cyclopes lineage emerged around 30 Mya in the Oligocene epoch, while the Myrmecophaga and Tamandua lineages split 10 Mya in the Late Miocene subepoch. During most of the Cenozoic era, anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent. Following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 Mya, anteaters of all three extant genera invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|E
50|$|Trinidad and Tobago is home {{to about}} 99 species of {{terrestrial}} mammals. About 65 of the mammalian species in the islands are bats (including cave roosting, tree and cavity roosting bats and even foliage-tent-making bats; all with widely differing diets from nectar and fruit, to insects, small vertebrates such as fish, frogs, small birds and rodents and even those that consume vertebrate blood). The next most diverse group of mammals in the islands are the rodents. The largest of these rodents are the lowland paca, the Brazilian porcupine, and the red-rumped agouti (of these, only the agouti remains extant on Tobago). One squirrel (the red-tailed squirrel) and several native rats and mice {{are also part of}} the rodent fauna. A few species of opossums including the common opossum may be found on both islands. Two anteaters, the southern tamandua and the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater</b> are found in Trinidad (but not in Tobago). The nine-banded armadillo can still be found on both islands. Native mammals of the order Carnivora include the ocelot, the tayra, the Neotropical river otter and the crab-eating raccoon (all four being found on Trinidad, with only the raccoon still extant on Tobago). The small Asian mongoose was introduced to Trinidad (but not to Tobago) during the later part of the 19th century and is now naturalized. The two native hoofed-mammals still found in Trinidad include the red brocket deer and the collared peccary (in Tobago, the deer is thought to be extirpated and the peccary is now fairly rare). The red howler monkey and the white-fronted capuchin are Trinidad's two native non-human primate species. The tufted capuchin monkey was introduced to the northwestern peninsula of Trinidad during World War II and is now naturalized there. No monkeys remain extant on Tobago.

40|$|Abstract Cyclopes didactylus, {{commonly}} called <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> {{is the smallest}} and least studied of the anteaters. It is an arboreal species occurring in rainforests, ranging from southern Mexico to Central and South America, with an apparently disjoint distribution between Amazon and Atlantic rainforests in Brazil. Although seven subspecies are recognized, {{little is known about}} its geographical variation. Thus, to evaluate the population dynamics and evolutionary history of the South American <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> we analyzed 1542 bp sequences of the mitochondrial control region (CR), COI and Cyt-b genes of 32 individuals. Haplotype network, AMOVA and molecular dating analyses were performed and identified seven geographic clusters. The split of lineages separating Cyclopedidae (Cyclopes) and Myrmecophagidae (Myrmecophaga and Tamandua genera) was estimated around 41 million years ago (mya), and the intraspecific lineage diversification of C. didactylus began in the Miocene around 13. 5 mya, likely in southwestern Amazonia. Tectonic and climatic events that took place in South America during the Tertiary and Quaternary seem to have influenced the evolutionary history of the species at different levels. This is the first study to investigate the population dynamics and phylogeography of the <b>silky</b> <b>anteater,</b> which contributes to a better comprehension of the biogeography of South America...|$|E
