40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the eighties wage {{inflation}} has slowed down in Austria. The wage setting process during this period was heavily influenced by economic factors that affected only some enterprises or sectors. In contrast to other countries the wage leadership of the sectors concerned (nationalized industries, public sector) was so strong that the difficulties they experienced (or {{in the case of the}} public sector the attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit) also dampened wage growth in other sectors. A comparison of the increase in contractual wages and in earning across some major industries reveals that this pressure on wages was transmitted to other sectors in an even intensified form.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of {{monetary}} policy on the Israeli economy, and in particular on unemployment and the evolution of prices, for the period between 1990 and 1999, using the SVAR methodology. The four endogenous variables are the unemployment rate in deviations from its trend, the inflation rate, the Bank of Israel nominal interest rate and local-currency depreciation. We posit two models. In the first the identification restrictions imply that aggregate supply does not respond immediately to changes in aggregate demand, while in the second the aggregate supply response to demand shocks has been designed to have the maximum effect. The impulse response function analysis in both models indicates that an unexpected tightening of monetary policy is followed by a relatively fast <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> the <b>inflation</b> rate and a rise in the unemployment rate. This result differs from the findings in other empirical work concerning relatively large closed economies in which prices respond with a delay to policy changes, lagging behind the output response. The analysis of the actual structural shocks during the period surveyed indicates that supply shocks are the main reason why unemployment deviates from its longterm level. The contribution of monetary policy shocks to the evolution of unemployment between 1993 and 1994 and after 1997 {{in the context of the}} second model is in line with existing appraisals of monetary policy, according to which it was loose in the first sub-period and tighter in the second one.

40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{studying}} the preconditions for introduction, the main problems and prospects for implementation of the inflation targeting regime in Ukraine. In 2014, the country got into a crisis that affected at once the currency market, the banking system and the real sector, resulting in devaluations, bank failures, decreasing GDP, growing prices. One of {{the responses to the}} financial challenges was the transition to inflationary targeting, which led to a <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation</b> in 2016 - 2017. Goals of an inflation targeting are both price growth and international reserves. Achieving these goals implies a policy of «expensive money», exclusive smoothing by interventions of excessive fluctuations, lack of fiscal dominance, prudent fiscal policies, and elimination of quasi-fiscal imbalances. The risks of current monetary policy are the slow implementation of reforms, which can stop external lending, «pre-election» increases in social spending, debt burden growth, and the escalation of hostilities in the east of the country. Further actions by the State should include: minimization of monetary emissions, further reduction of the interest rate, providing the positive level of rates by the National Bank of Ukraine in terms of inflation, increased use of compulsory reservation of the funds involved, restriction of sales of domestic bonds and the NBU certificates to banks...|$|E
40|$|The <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation</b> {{which had}} {{characterized}} {{the whole of}} 1995 continued into 1996. In {{the first quarter of}} 1996 the rate of inflation was only 1. 7 percent, following 1. 9 percent {{in the fourth quarter of}} 1995; in the second quarter of 1996, the rate of price increase slowed to 1. 6 percent. With these inflation rates, Austria again joined those countries which exhibit a high degree of price stability. Nonetheless, inflation in West Germany, an important benchmark for monetary stability in Austria, was still slightly lower than in Austria. Lower inflation rates for food and for manufactured products were more than offset by higher inflation rates for rents, service prices, public charges, and energy. At the beginning of 1995 Austria adopted the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and liberalized agriculture and the food industry. As a result, agricultural producer prices dropped sharply. At the level of consumer prices, prices of dairy products and of grain products reacted promptly and rather strongly in the course of the year 1995; in the first half of 1996, this adjustment process decelerated considerably. The reaction of other food prices to the liberalization of the food market was rather sluggish, however. Overall, as a price survey by the Chamber of Labor indicates, many food prices (net of VAT) are still considerably higher than in Germany. For manufactured goods, the integration effects on prices were even more drawn out. It was only in the second half of 1995 that price increases in Austria fell below comparable figures for Germany. In the first half of 1996 this adjustment process, accelerated, however. The rates of increase of service prices, though on a downward trend, still exceed those in West Germany. If the development of prices in West Germany is used as a standard against which to measure the effects of membership in the EU, the price effects of the EU can be estimated at about ½ percentage point in the first half of 1995 and at ¾ percentage point in the second half of 1995. A price effect of about ½ percentage point can be calculated for the first half of 1996. While in 1995 much of the integration effect was due to lower food prices, most of the contribution in 1996 came from lower prices of manufactured goods.

40|$|Austria's {{accession}} to the EU has intensified competitive pressure {{at all levels}} of production and distribution. Where price reductions are based on cost reductions considerable lags must be expected. One important exception are foods prices. At the beginning of 1995 Austria adopted the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. As a result, agricultural producer prices dropped sharply; by the end of 1995, more than half of these reductions have been passed on to consumer prices. In other segments, the integration effects on prices were more drawn out. Even though prices of many manufactured goods are higher in Austria than in West Germany, inflation in this area hardly slowed down {{during the first half of}} 1995 and exceeded the inflation rate in West Germany. It was only towards the end of the year that price increases fell below comparable figures for Germany. No clear signs of a deceleration have emerged yet for service prices. If the development of prices in West Germany is used as a standard against which to measure the effects of membership in the EU, the price effect can be estimated at almost ½ percentage point in the first half of 1995 and at ¾ percentage point in the second half of 1995. Much of this effect is due to lower food prices. The analysis of the movement of consumer prices according to the CPI can be complemented by the analysis of a survey of consumer prices conducted by the Chamber of Labor in the fall of 1994, before Austria's entry into the EU, and the spring of 1995 in Vienna and Berlin. In many market segments prices are higher in Vienna than in Berlin, but the averages mask a great deal of variation in price differentials. Prices in Vienna tended to adjust to prices in Berlin in a systematic way: the higher the initial price differential, the larger the adjustment. This price equalization feature was most pronounced for food prices. At the level of consumer prices, Austria seems to have the reputation of being a high-price country where market segmentation strategies can be successfully employed. The expectations of sharp price reductions in the wake of EU membership as well as a great number of price comparisons with other countries seem to have boosted the competitive spirit and may have made Austrian consumers more price-conscious. This change is likely to have contributed to the eventual <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation.</b> Well informed consumers are essential to the functioning of the market, but where the markets are distorted by oligopolistic structures competition policies are called for. Austria needs to strengthen competition by adopting legislation that has been standard in many EU countries.

40|$|The {{cyclical}} forces {{driving the}} economy are getting stronger. Exports and output in manufacturing post high gains, {{and an increasing}} number of enterprises is viewing the economic situation with optimism. Most economic indicators suggest that the present upturn is proceeding at a faster pace than the recovery after the recession of 1982 - 83. The main problem areas continue to be the tourism sector, the high level of unemployment, the federal budget, and the current account. The improvement in the global economy is having a positive impact on the Austrian economy. In the U. S. the upswing is still going strong; in Europe, the economic climate has improved markedly and the German economy is being boosted by foreign orders. All these impulses have buoyed Austria's sales abroad. In the first half of 1994, the export sector managed to expand exports by 7 percent compared to the same period in 1993. The manufacturing sector raised production by 4 ½ percent to satisfy domestic and foreign demand. According to the most recent WIFO survey of July, the business climate has shown further improvement. In the basic goods industries, in the chemical industry, and in the engineering industries production increases are expected. Only the traditional consumer goods industries forecast stagnation in output. Capacity utilization has increased further in recent months. The highest utilization rates are reported by the basic goods sector and the construction materials industries. The sanguine expectations on the part of manufacturing firms and the increase in foreign orders suggest that the pickup in economic activity might gain in breadth and pace. The construction sector continues to be a mainstay of economic activity. In May, the value of new construction exceeded last year's level by 9 percent. The sectors posting the highest gains continue to be residential construction and civil engineering. Consumer price inflation is slowing down. The annual rate of inflation, slightly higher than 3 percent {{at the beginning of the}} year, fell to 2. 8 percent in July. Food prices and prices of travel and lodging contributed most to the <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation.</b> Unlike in earlier upturns, the labor market reacted promptly to the current upswing. Employment in manufacturing stabilized in the spring; this marks the first time since 1990 that the number of jobs in manufacturing (seasonally adjusted) is not decreasing. In August, total employment surpassed last year's level by 17. 000 (+½ percent). Unemployment dropped by 10. 000 persons. At the present time, tourism is one of the weakest sectors of the economy. There has been no sign of a recovery at all. Overnight stays by foreign tourists plunged in the early summer, a belated consequence of the European recession, of the devaluation in competitor countries, and of cheaper air travel.

40|$|Real GDP in {{the industrialized}} {{countries}} is projected to expand by 2 ¾ percent in both 1995 and 1996. Recovery in Europe is set to continue at a healthy pace without gaining further momentum. Overall output growth {{is unlikely to be}} strong enough as to make substantial inroads into the generally high level of unemployment. High interest rates and fiscal retrenchment dampen activity in the countries with weaker currencies; in the strong-currency area, the recent exchange rate shifts constitute a severe test for these countries' external competitiveness. The international business cycle recovery, which became firmly established in 1994, continues. GDP growth in 1995 is projected at 3 percent for both the U. S. and OECD Europe. The U. S. economy has entered a period of slowing activity, caused by endogenous cyclical factors as well as monetary restriction, and the further course of the cycle is not quite clear. The persistent weakness of the dollar vis-à-vis the DM and the yen has been accompanied by exchange rate turbulence within Europe. The block of hard currencies which has emerged since 1992, has appreciated by some 10 percent in real-effective terms against the weaker currencies. Nevertheless, the rate of economic growth is virtually identical for both groups of countries. It is true that the sizeable devaluations have largely contributed towards pulling the weak-currency countries out of the 1992 - 93 recession and that growth continues to be export-driven to a higher degree than in the hard-currency area. However, domestic demand is considerably dampened by high interest rates and the restrictive stance of fiscal policy. The largely productivity-enhancing export growth and weak domestic demand leave little scope for employment gains. Relatively stronger is the performance of domestic demand in the hard-currency countries, thereby partly offsetting the effects of appreciation on activity. Employment, having fallen markedly less than in the weak-currency countries during the recession, increased steadily, if only moderately, in the early upswing, due to firm domestic demand. Price cuts for imports and the <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> domestic <b>inflation</b> contribute towards greater price stability in the hard-currency countries. In the weak-currency area inflationary tendencies, which have so far been reined back by the effects of the past recession, are now becoming increasingly apparent.
