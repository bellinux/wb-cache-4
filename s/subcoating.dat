40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce {{production}} costs, a simple, direct compression delayed release formulation consisting of pantoprazole was investigated. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor belongs to group of benzimidazole. It is very efficient for the treatment of gastric and duodenum ulcers. Even in solid state pantoprazole is sensitive to heat, humidity, light and especially to substances containing an acidic group. For such types of drugs, enteric coating added to the formulation tends to avoid the stomach's acidic exposure, delivering them instead to a basic pH environment where they do not degrade, and give their desired action. <b>Subcoating</b> is desirable to protect the enteric coating. Opadry and Acryl-EZE systems have been utilized for <b>subcoating</b> and enteric coating respectively. Delayed-release tablets with good physical, mechanical and technological properties were obtained with use of different combinations of diluents, binders, superdisintegrants and lubricants. A comparative kinetic study of the present tablets and commercial tablets was established. The value for the similarity factor (f 2 = 71. 6) suggested that the dissolution profile of the present two delayed-release oral dosage forms are similar. Hixon–Crowell (erosion) kinetic profiles were achieved...|$|E

The polymeric composition ratio of Eudragit E 100 and ethyl cellulose and amount of <b>subcoating</b> were optimized using a two-level factorial design method. Drug-release characteristics in terms of dissolution efficiency and controlled-release duration were evaluated in various dissolution media, such as simulated colonic fluid in {{the presence or absence}} of CTNase. Microflora activation and a stepwise mechanism for drug release were postulated. Consequently, the optimized DL-CDDS showed drug release in a controlled manner by inhibiting drug release in the stomach and intestine, but releasing the drug gradually in the colon (approximately 40 % at 10 hours and 92 % at 24 hours in CTNase-supplemented simulated colonic fluid), indicating its feasibility as a novel platform for CDD.

40|$|ABSTRACT − The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a stable enteric coated {{diclofenac}} sodium (DFS) tablets using Aqua-Polish E without using a subcoat. DFS uncoated tablets were manufactured through the non direct compression process. AquaPolish E white aqueous coating dispersion was used as enteric coating material. This film forming polymer is a mixture of selected polymethacrylic/ethylacrylate copolymers. The stability of the obtained enteric coated tablets was evaluated according to ICH guidelines. No signs of disintegration or cracking was observed when they placed in 0. 1 N HCl solution (pH 1. 2), but they were completely disintegrated within 10 minutes when they placed in buffered solution at pH 6. 8. Dis-solution test was also conducted by placing tablets in 0. 1 N HCl for 2 hours and then 1 hour in phosphate buffer at pH 6. 8. Less than 0. 9 % of drug was released in the acidic phase and up to 97 % in the basic medium. These findings suggest that aqueous enteric coating with AquaPolish E system is an easy and economical approach for preparing stable DFS enteric coat without the use of a <b>subcoating</b> layer. Key words − Enteric coating, <b>Subcoating,</b> AquaPolish E, Diclofenac, dispersion.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study a {{mathematical}} model for an aqueous film coating process in a production size coating pan was developed which would allow the effects of process variables and their interactions with the coating process to be identified and subsequently predicted with mathematical certainty. Because excess water accumulation in the tablet bed can be undesirable and effective water removal is critical to an efficient process, the dependent varaible selected in the study was water removal efficiency. The independent variables considered in the study were coating solution spray rate, inlet air temperature, exhaust airflow, pan rotational speed and total tablet surface area. ^ In order to establish the appropriate operating conditions for the coating pan it was necessary to evaluate the mixing action of the baffled pan and the various spray gun configurations available for use in the unit. This included the study of spray patterns and determination of the optimal spray rates for uniform tablet coverage. Tablet surface area was also determined to be a critical parameter which had a significant effect on the drying air flowing through the tablet bed. The results from the studies indicate that the model developed could predict water removal efficiency with a satisfactory degree of assurance. Graphical analysis indicated interactions between pan speed and air temperature, and pan speed and airflow. ^ In the second part of this research, a standard production sugar coating suspension which had been applied manually was modified to allow for spray application in an automated tablet sugar coating process. Ingredients which may have contributed to microbiological growth were eliminated. A mathematical model was developed which predicted the viscosity of the <b>subcoat</b> suspensions containing different concentrations of selected coating ingredients. A <b>subcoat</b> suspension formula was selected and the effect of the addition of various synthetic polymers on the strength and disintegration rate of coated tablets was evaluated. The results indicated that the new <b>subcoat</b> suspension containing synthetic polymers provided a sugar coat that was as physically strong as the standard production formula but disintegrated more rapidly from the tablet. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of maltodextrin DE 1 - 5 from cassava starch as a <b>subcoating</b> material of noni fruit dry extract sugar coating tablets. Maltodextrin were obtained by hydrolysis of cassava starch with Liquezyme EX � (α-amylase enzyme from NOVO) at 95 � 3 �C for 2. 5 - 4 min. Noni fruit dry extract was used in core tablets. The core tablets were prepared by wet granulation, then all of the tablets were coated with materials that composed of sucrose, maltodextrin, PEG 6000, CaCO 3, TiO 2 and distilled water. Core tablets and coated tablets were evaluated in accordance with Indonesian Pharmacopoeia or other pharmaceutical references. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of scopoletine as chemical marker in core and coated tablet has been conducted.

40|$|Aspirin {{is apt to}} hydrolyze. In {{order to}} improve its stability, a new method has been {{developed}} involving the application of hot-melt sub- and outercoating combined with enteric aqueous coating. The main aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of these factors on the stability of ASA and understand how they work. Satisfactory storage stability were obtained when the aspirin tablet core coated with Eudragit L 30 D 55 film was combined with glycerin monostearate (GMS) as an outercoat. Hygroscopicity testing indicated that the moisture penetrating into the tablet may result in a significant change in the physical properties of the coating film observed by scanning electron microscopy. Investigation of the compatibility between the drug and film excipients shows that the talc and methacrylic acid had a significant catalytic effect on ASA. A hypothesis was proposed that the hydrolysis of ASA enteric coated tablets (ASA-ECT) was mostly concentrated in the internal film and the interfaces between the film and tablet core. In conclusion, hot-melt coating technology is an alternative to <b>subcoating</b> or outercoating. Also, GMS sub-coating was a better choice for forming a stable barrier between the tablet core and the polymer coating layer, and increases the structure and chemical stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the technique for preparation of coated valproic acid and sodium valproate sustained-release matrix tablets. Different diluents were tested and selected as the effective absorbent for oily valproic acid. Effect of the amount of absorbent and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose on drug release from valproic acid-sodium valproate matrix tablets prepared with wet granulation technique was evaluated in pH change system. Colloidal silicon dioxide effectively adsorbed liquid valproic acid during wet granulation and granule preparation. The amounts of colloidal silicon dioxide and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose employed in tablet formulations affected drug release from the tablets. The drug release was prominently sustained for over 12 h using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose-based hydrophilic matrix system. The mechanism of drug release through the matrix polymer was a diffusion control. The drug release profile of the developed matrix tablet was similar to Depakine Chrono &# 894;, providing the values of similarity factor (f 2) and difference factor (f 1) of 85. 56 and 2. 37, respectively. Eudragit &# 894; L 30 D- 55 was used as effective <b>subcoating</b> material for core matrix tablets before over coating with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose film with organic base solvent.

Considerable diversity was observed {{for all the}} characters studied. Diversity was more among states than within states. Variation among the seasons was also considerable. Days to flowering ranged from 42 to 129 days during postrainy and 33 to 180 days {{during the rainy season}} indicating their day length sensitivity. Plant height ranged from 65 to 330 cm during postrainy and 75 to 655 cm during rainy season. Panicle length ranged from 5 cm to 52 cm and panicle width from 1 to 51 cm. Erect and compact panicles are more frequent although all possible panicle shapes and compactness were found. In general, sorghums from India produce medium to large, lustrous grains in which the <b>subcoat</b> (testa) is absent. All the 5 basic and 10 intermediate sorghum races were found in India though durra or half-durra predominate. Racial diversity is maximal in the state of Andhra Pradesh followed by Maharashatra state.

40|$|There is an {{impetus to}} provide {{appropriate}} sustained release oral delivery vehicles to protect biofunctional peptide loads from gastric degradation in vivo. This study describes {{the generation of}} a high load capacity pellet formulation for sustained release of a freely water-soluble dairy-derived hydrolysate, FHI- 2571. The activity of this novel peptidic ghrelin receptor agonist is reported using in vitro calcium mobilization assays. Conventional extrusion spheronization was then used to prepare peptide-loaded pellets which were subsequently coated with ethylcellulose (EC) film coats using a fluid bed coating system in bottom spray (Wurster) mode. Aqueous-based EC coating dispersions produced mechanically brittle coats which fractured due to osmotic pressure build-up within pellets in simulated media. In contrast, an ethanolic-based EC coating solution provided robust, near zero-order release in both USP Type 1 and Type 4 dissolution studies. Interestingly, the functionality of aqueous-based EC film coats was restored by first layering pellets with a methacrylic acid copolymer (MA) <b>subcoat,</b> thereby hindering pellet core swelling in acidic media. Broadband Acoustic Resonance Dissolution Spectroscopy (BARDS) was utilised as a complementary technique to confirm the results seen in USP dissolution studies. Retention of activity of the ghrelinergic peptide hydrolysate in the final encapsulated product was confirmed as being greater than 80 %. The described pellet formulation is amenable to oral dosing in small animal studies {{in order to assess}} in vivo efficacy of the whey-derived ghrelinergic hydrolysate. In more general terms, it is also suitable as a delivery vehicle for peptide-based bioactives to special population groups e. g paediatric and geriatric...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{present study was}} to develop pharmaceutically elegant and stable enteric coated tabletformulation for highly unstable drug in acidic environment using pH dependent polymers. Omeprazoleis a specific and non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme H+/K+-ATPase. It is unstable in conditions oflow pH and required protection from the effects of gastric acid when given orally so it is formulated inthe form of enteric coated dosage forms. The core tablets were prepared by direct compression methodusing different concentration of crospovidone as a super disintegrant. Formulations showing lessdisintegration time were first <b>subcoated</b> with HPMC 15 cps upto 3 % weight gain, followed by entericcoating with Eudragit L 100, Eudragit L 100 - 55 and Cellulose acetate phthalate. Pre and postcompression evaluation of core and coated tablets were carried out. In vitro drug release studies wereconducted in acidic and basic media to determine the appropriate coating ratio. All batches entericcoated with 8 % weight gain of three polymers showed stable coating in 0. 1 N HCl for 2 hours. Formulated batch F 11 with 7 % weight gain of Eudragit L 100 - 55 showed stable coating in 0. 1 N HCland had shown complete drug release in phosphate buffer pH 6. 8. The prepared enteric coated tabletsexhibited good physical and chemical stability, when subjected to accelerated stability studies. Further,when compared to marketed formulation (OPT tablet 20 mg Omeprazole), the prepared enteric coatedtablets showed excellent similarities with marketed product (with respect to drug content, disintegrationtime and drug release) thereby establishing bioequivalence with marketed product...|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: Although {{the effect}} of {{experimental}} surface modifications on various properties (e. g., fatigue, wear) on coated files have been tested in the past, there is no report for the coating quality of commercially available TiN coated files. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the surface and cross section of TiN coated endodontic files. Materials and methods: TiN coated nickel–titanium endodontic files (EasyShape) were surface and cross-sectionally analyzed via scanning electron microscopy backscattered electron imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis in spot, area, and line scan modes. Results: Surface imaging revealed parallel oblong regions with higher mean atomic contrast, a finding attributed to increased Ni content. Cross-sectional analysis showed that the coating’s average total thickness was 0. 31  μm and consisted of a thin layered film. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of Ti, Ni, N, and O in the coating, whereas only Ni and Ti were identified in the bulk of the file. Ti and O showed their peak compositions at the bulk/coating and coating/surface interfaces, respectively, whereas N displayed a rather constant content within the coated region. The N and O contents started increasing inner to the coating/bulk interface, denoting possible diffusion of both elements to the <b>subcoating</b> region. Conclusion: Surface and bulk characterization showed no uncoated areas of the files tested. Apart from Ti, Ni, and N, oxygen was also identified within the coating region...|$|E

Major adverse reactions associated with Ibuprofen are related to GIT and include peptic and mucosal ulcers, dyspepsia, severe gastric pain and bleeding, that results in excessive treatment failure. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop enteric coated ibuprofen tablets in order to avoid gastric mucosal irritation, diffusion of drug across mucosal lining and to let active ingredient be absorbed easily in small intestine. The formulation was developed and manufactured through the direct compression process, the simplest, easiest and most economical method of manufacturing. Enteric coating was done using an Opadry white <b>subcoating</b> and an aqueous coating dispersion of Acryl-Eze. Enteric coated formulation was subjected to disintegration and dissolution tests by placing in 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid for 2 h and then 1 h in phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. 8. About 0. 04 % of drug was released in the acidic phase and 99. 05 % in the basic medium. These results reflect that ibuprofen can be successfully enteric coated in order to prevent its release in the stomach and facilitate rapid release of the drug in the duodenum, due to the presence of superdisintegrant. Formulating this enteric coated tablets could increase patient compliance by decreasing adverse drug reactions (ADR S) associated with Ibuprofen therapy...|$|E
