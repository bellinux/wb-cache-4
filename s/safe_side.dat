25|$|To {{be on the}} <b>safe</b> <b>side,</b> a pill-activated {{inflation}} {{device is}} preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is {{more sensitive to the}} presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to an on-campus University Police Department staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with 43 full-time sworn police officers and 22 U-Park security officers, UWM provides a safety escort service called SAFE (Safety Awareness For Everyone), a shuttle van service called BOSS (Be On the <b>Safe</b> <b>Side),</b> and an emergency alert notification system. BOSS operates from 6 pm to until 2am Sunday thru Thursday and until 4am on the weekends during {{the spring and fall}} semesters. Summer hours are 7pm–12am, 7 days a week. Their van service will even drop people off right at their front door if they live in their area of service. This service is funded through students segregated fees.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, two Harriers flew on {{missions}} from Tromsø, named Red 1 and Red 2. The {{first was}} the two-seat Harrier serial number XW925 with Wing Commander Peter Squire as pilot and Norwegian Major Bjørnar Vollstad. The aircraft left Tromsø at 14:27, nearly an hour after the crash. They flew to a gunnery range near Setermoen, followed by Red 2, a Harrier GR.3. The shooting range was enveloped in a blizzard, but Squire chose to carry out the practice. Red 1 was subject to an air burst; Squire did not register any damage, but chose to return to Tromsø and asked for a priority landing to be on the <b>safe</b> <b>side.</b> The pilot of Red 2 believed his weapons were not secured and chose to carry out a priority landing at Bardufoss Air Station, located nearby.|$|E

500|$|... "Because of You" [...] is a piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and 39 seconds. It is set in common time and has a {{moderate}} tempo of 69 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of F minor, and then modulated to the key of G minor, with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from Ab3 to Eb5. Tony Heywood of MusicOMH noted that the song's piano arrangement is reminiscent of Tori Amos. Lyrically, [...] "Because of You" [...] is a fiery ode to Clarkson's father, and begins with Clarkson singing [...] "oohs" [...] over a somber piano which creates a [...] "wintry tone." [...] As the song launches into the chorus, the roaring guitar is evident, and the lyrics, [...] "Because of you I never stray {{too far from the}} sidewalk / Because of you I learned to play on the <b>safe</b> <b>side</b> so I don’t get hurt," [...] were deemed as [...] "touching" [...] by Dave Donelly of Sputnikmusic.|$|E

40|$|Elastic-plastic {{stresses}} {{have been}} derived for a cylinder under internal pressure using Seth's transition theory. The effect of non-homogeneity has been discu ssed numerically and depicted graphically.

40|$|AbstractA hollow {{thick-walled}} cylinder made of functionally {{graded material}} subjected to twist has been analyzed. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide the guidance to design the torsion of thick-walled cylinder made of {{functionally graded material}} so that collapse of cylinder due to external pressure can be avoided. The concept of transition theory based on the concept of Lebesgue strain measure has been used to simplify the constitutive equations. Results have been analyzed theoretically and discussed numerically. From the discussion, we can conclude that highly non-homogeneous cylinder is on the <b>safer</b> <b>side</b> of the design as compared to lesser non-homogeneous cylinder. This is because of the reason that percentage increase in pressure required for initial yielding to become fully plastic is very high for non-homogeneous cylinder whose non-homogeneity increases radially as compared to lesser non-homogeneous cylinder. Also, non-homogeneous cylinder whose thickness is very high is on the <b>safer</b> <b>side</b> of the design as compared to less thick-walled cylinders because percentage increase in pressure required for initial yielding to become fully plastic is very high for highly thick-walled cylinders as compared to other cases...|$|R
2500|$|Like any wild animal, moose are {{unpredictable}} {{and should be}} given a respectful amount of space. They are most likely to attack if annoyed or harassed, or if their [...] "personal space" [...] has been encroached upon. A moose that has been harassed may vent its anger on anyone in the vicinity, and they often do not make distinctions between their tormentors and innocent passers-by. Moose are very limber animals with highly flexible joints and sharp, pointed hooves, and are capable of kicking with both front and back legs. Unlike other large, hooved mammals, such as horses, moose can kick in all directions including sideways. Therefore, there is no <b>safe</b> <b>side</b> from which to approach. However, moose often give warning signs prior to attacking, displaying their aggression by means of body language. The maintaining of eye contact is usually the first sign of aggression, while laid-back ears or a lowered head is a definite sign of agitation. If the hairs {{on the back of the}} moose's neck and shoulders (hackles) stand up, a charge is usually imminent. The Anchorage Visitor Centers warn tourists that [...] "...a moose with its hackles raised is a thing to fear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Archduke Charles {{wished to}} prevent the army of Moreau from joining with his {{colleague}} Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. The Austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the Danube but the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle was following too closely. By attacking Moreau, the archduke hoped to push the French back in order {{to prevent the}}ir two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the Danube safely. Also, he wanted to lure Moreau into crossing the Danube and separating himself from Jourdan. Moreau's army was extended across a front [...] wide. Charles drew up plans to attack on 11 August. He sent one column to cross to the north bank of the Danube at Günzburg to get behind the French right flank. His troops were ready to move at midnight, but heavy rains slowed several of his assault columns. On the 10th Saint-Cyr with Taponier's division, drove the Austrians in his front out of the village of Eglingen. Urged on by Moreau, Saint-Cyr balked because he believed that the enemy were in strength nearby. Before anything more could be done, the heavy rain began and made it impossible to fire the cannons on both sides. Moreau refused to let his subordinate withdraw to a more defensible position or to order Duhesme's division to move closer. The only concession Moreau would make was to send up one regiment of Carabiniers to patrol in front of Taponier. To be on the <b>safe</b> <b>side,</b> Saint-Cyr stationed Lecourbe and one demi brigade at Dischingen where there was a bridge over the Egau River. Meanwhile, Duhesme stayed well to the south at Medlingen in the Danube valley.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, President Kibaki {{has been}} a weak leader who {{suppressed}} his conscience to survive dangers of one-party dictatorship. To get along Kibaki has never taken risks of leadership {{that are associated with}} leaders like Dedan Kimathi, Jomo Kenyatta, Mahatma Gandhi or Nelson Mandela who sacrificed greatly for the cause of freedom, justice and country. With a dwarfish conscience, Kibaki allowed the man in him to die and never did anything truly memorable ... when Kenyans wanted Kibaki to lead them against the tyranny of Kanu, he turned them down and stuck with dictatorship. Consequently, many Kenyans called him [...] "General Kiguoya" [...] or [...] "General Coward. ... Kibaki's politics was characterised by an attitude of taking extreme caution or [...] "sitting on the fence" [...] over risky questions. He only took sides when the <b>safe</b> <b>side</b> was clear. While some called this cowardice, Kibaki's admirers called it wisdom that won him the highest office in the land winning the favour of whole communities and elites. It {{remains to be seen whether}} this [...] "wisdom" [...] will win him lasting legacy as well. In judging his legacy, I will say Kibaki and his ilk committed grave errors that saddled Kenya with her terrible calamities of dictatorship or impunity, poverty and underdevelopment ... in judging Kibaki, posterity will not forget that, when Kenyans were risking jail, detention, exile and even death to end Kanu one party dictatorship, he called every second liberator [...] "mad man of the market that was trying to fell a fig tree with a razor blade. ... Kibaki has been praised as a brilliant economist. But his 'Kibakinomics' have kept Kenya poor and backward when other Third World countries were industrialising and joining the First World. 'Kibakinomics' has given leaders and elites freedom to grab and rob, enriched a few, impoverished millions and has afflicted thousands in his Central province backyard with jiggers. Same 'Kibakinomics' has allowed the country to lose Sh367 billion annually to corruption that has flourished under Kibaki's watch. 'Kibakinomics' even hired Mackinsey Ltd to dream Vision 2030 for Kenya! In the meantime, foreign companies have had a field day minting trillions in Kenya...unbeknown to most people, Kibaki entrenched ethnic rule and encouraged his ministers to turn their ministries into dens of ethnicity. Accordingly, the Kibaki government shared public funds and top jobs ethnically, to communities according to their political loyalty and numerical strength. Those who did not fit into clear ethnic definitions ... were simply left out of the cabinet and other political appointments.|$|E
