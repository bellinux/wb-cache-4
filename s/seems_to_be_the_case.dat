5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San José {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting {{that took place in the}} city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E

25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.|$|E
25|$|Leaping and {{arboreal}} insects {{seems like}} a good explanation for this evolutionary process for several reasons. Because early winged insects were lacking the sophisticated wing folding mechanism of neopterous insects, they must {{have lived in the}} open and not been able to hide or search for food under leaves, in cracks, under rocks and other such confined spaces. In these old forests there weren't many open places where insects with huge structures on their back could have lived without experiencing huge disadvantages. If insects got their wings on land and not in water, which clearly <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the tree canopies would be the most obvious place where such gliding structures could have emerged, in a time when the air was a new territory.|$|E

2500|$|... "As a final {{observation}} {{it should}} be noted that because many of the scientific discoveries and theories referred to in the Bahá'í Writings were yet unknown to the contemporaries of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá, They obviously could not have used the technical terms applied for their description nowadays. Instead, They had to make use of and sometimes redefine already existing concepts and terms (e.g. the ether concept or the idea of the four elements of ancient Greek philosophy) in a way that they would accurately explain what They had in mind. On a superficial level, this might give the impression that the Central Figures of the Faith did not actually formulate any new ideas about physical reality. [...] When we study Their Writings more closely, however, we come to realise that this only <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> because Their references to such topics were purposely made in such a way that they would neither offend Their addressees who believed in certain (erroneous) contemporary scientific concepts, nor make use of a terminology that had not yet been developed by contemporary scientists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among other {{arguments}} {{made by the}} defenders of the new calendar for their view, are those {{made on the basis}} of truth (notwithstanding that the detractors of that calendar make the claim that the Old Style date, , is the true celebration of Christ's Nativity). Arguments from truth can take two forms: (1) If a calendar is a system for reckoning time based on the motions of astronomical bodies—specifically the movements of Sun and Moon, in the case of the church calendar—and if precision or accuracy is understood as one aspect of truth, then a calendar that is more accurate and precise with respect to the motions of those bodies must be regarded as truer than one which is less precise. In this regard, some of those who champion the old calendar as truth (rather than for pastoral reasons, as <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the national churches that adhere to it) may appear, to those following the new calendar, as the defenders of a fiction. (2) Some defenders of the new calendar argue that the celebration, in any way or form, of two feasts of Christ's Nativity within the same liturgical year is not possible, since according to the faith there is only one celebration of that feast in a given year. On this basis, they argue that those who prefer to observe a [...] "secular" [...] feast of the Nativity on [...] and a [...] "religious" [...] one on , err in respect of the truth that there is but one feast of the Nativity each year.|$|E
2500|$|Hegel {{made the}} {{distinction}} between civil society and state in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right. In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term [...] "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" [...] though it is now referred to as Zivilgesellschaft in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the dialectical relationship that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community {{of the state and}} the micro-community of the family. Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the political left and right. On the left, it became the foundation for Karl Marx's civil society as an economic base; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between political society and civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville. In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of [...] "lesser" [...] and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.|$|E

2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... what <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, {{rather than trying to}} look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?"

2500|$|The Guideline invoked by the University to deny {{third-party}} contractor {{payments on}} behalf of Wide Awake effects a sweeping restriction on student thought and student inquiry {{in the context of}} University sponsored publications. [...] The prohibition on funding {{on behalf of}} publications that [...] "primarily promote or manifest a particular belief in or about a deity or an ultimate reality", in its ordinary and commonplace meaning, has a vast potential reach. [...] The term [...] "promotes" [...] as used here would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in a deity or ultimate reality. [...] And the term [...] "manifests" [...] would bring within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable as resting upon a premise that presupposes the extistence of a deity or ultimate reality. [...] Were the prohibition applied with much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical students such as Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. [...] And if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, those student journalistic efforts that primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity and no ultimate reality, then undergraduates named Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some of their major essays excluded from student publications. [...] If any manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the writing, as <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> it is indeed difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy. [...] Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point out their (necessary) imperfections.|$|E

60|$|I {{believe it}} is well ascertained that the bladder of the frog acts as a {{reservoir}} for the moisture necessary to its existence: such <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the tortoise. For some time after {{a visit to the}} springs, their urinary bladders are distended with fluid, which is said gradually to decrease in volume, and to become less pure. The inhabitants, when walking in the lower district, and overcome with thirst, often take advantage of this circumstance, and drink the contents of the bladder if full: in one I saw killed, the fluid was quite limpid, and had only a very slightly bitter taste. The inhabitants, however, always first drink the water in the pericardium, which is described as being best.|$|E
60|$|Such propositions are {{important}} to logic, because all inference depends upon them. If I have told you that if it rains I shall bring my umbrella, and if you {{see that there is}} a steady downpour, you can infer that I shall bring my umbrella. There can be no inference except where propositions are connected in some such way, so that from the truth or falsehood of the one something follows as to the truth or falsehood of the other. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that we can sometimes know molecular propositions, as in the above instance of the umbrella, when we do not know whether the component atomic propositions are true or false.
