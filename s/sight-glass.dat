The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a <b>sight-glass</b> at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|E

25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} steam supply. The first, a displacement lubricator, mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a sealed container of oil. Water from the condensed steam displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with <b>sight-glasses</b> to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked {{from one of the}} crossheads. In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} present paper was {{presenting}} chosen results of investigations on polymer flow during mould cavity filling phase of injection process. Advancement in the simulation software make possible to model more phenomena occurring during polymer flow in injection molding process. Design/methodology/approach: The results of computer simulations of injection process have been {{compared with the}} results of video recording for the plastic flow during filling phase. For the simulating investigations a professional computer software Moldflow Plastics Insight ver. 6. 1. has been employed. A specialized injection mould which enables observation and registration of the plastic flow during processing has been employed. The mould enables direct monitoring of the course of phenomena inside the mould cavity in two planes. To record the flow, a digital video camera has been employed. As an example the issue of stream flow (jeting) have been described. Findings: The results of the investigations enabled documenting of specific phenomena which occur during plastics or their composites injection process. The registered video sequences have been compared {{with the results of}} numerical calculations and then it was estimated to what degree the computer simulation of injection process may be useful in practice. Research limitations/implications: The camera enabled to register the flows with the rate of 25 fps. This reduced the scope of the investigations, since at higher plastic flow speeds the registered image became less clear. The investigations were performed on a wide scale, however, only chosen results have been presented. Practical implications: Deep understanding of the phenomena which occur during filling the injection mould may lead to more effective design of the processing tools and shortening of the time for implementation and production time. Originality/value: The transparent <b>sight-glasses</b> have been used, made of a material called Zerodur® which is characterized by the coefficient of thermal expansion close to zero...|$|R
50|$|Lubrication of {{the first}} {{high-speed}} engines, such as the Ideal (an open-crank horizontal engine), were lubricated by a development of the oil cup systems previously widespread on medium-speed stationary engines. Oil cups and multi-point lubricators could oil shaft bearings well enough and a single <b>sight-glass</b> could be observed by even the most careless engine driver or oiler. The difficulty was that on high-speed engines, oilers {{could no longer be}} mounted on moving parts, such as the crosshead or connecting rod. Any oil reservoir here would be churned around by the movement and such a necessarily small reserve might also be inadequate incapacity for an engine doing so much work in a small space. More care was thus given to the thoroughness of oiling, and moving parts such as the crankpin were fed by drillings through the crankshaft from oil supplies that were rotating but not moving, such as the main bearings. Centrifugal force was also used to distribute the oil. It was usual that high-speed engines would have only one or two lubricators, so that engine tending was a simpler task and less prone to breakdowns from simple carelessness and running a lubricator dry.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{model of}} a {{two-seater}} roadster style car, possibly based on the look and style of a Mercer Raceabout from the early 20th century. The model first appeared in late 1976 and was designed by Steve Malins with input from George Morris. The first versions were finished in red and white with black upholstery (still available), newer versions have recently appeared in green/brass or burgundy/brass finishes. A silver 4-seater limousine based on the Roadster is also a popular model appearing in the 1980s. The boiler cover forms the 'bonnet' of the car with the <b>sight-glass</b> for checking the water level being the 'radiator grille'. Early versions sported the traditional overflow plug, which was replaced by the sight glass in 1978 to conform with the new Euro Toy Regulations. The earliest Roadsters were meths fired, appearing in late 1976. From about 1977 all models used a steel pan type solid fuel burner, although the older steel pan meths burners still fitted. The oscillating-cylinder engine is mounted externally on the left-hand side of the model and incorporates a simple forward and reverse lever like that used on the SE2a and MEC1 stationary engines. The unit drives a small solid flywheel mounted externally on the right-hand side via a shaft. Again a distinguishing feature of early models is the 'split-drive' with final drive on the left hand side as opposed to later (and current) models were the drive is all on the right. This shaft drives the rear axle by a power band. This arrangement allows a slightly higher road speed than the SW1 wagon but much slower than the TE1 traction engine (which was ridiculously too fast). This chassis and layout is used on other mobiles in the Mamod ranges such as the LB1 London bus, FE1 fire engine, SA1L limousine as well as the DV1/2 vans. The early wheels are in the style of wooden carriage wheels (as found on cars of the period - these were known as artillery wheels), with solid rubber tyres. Later models used a redesigned wheel which was based upon the design used for the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Details such as running boards, spare wheel and carriage lamps are also fitted.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the {{performed}} investigations was a multi-aspect analyzes of the blow moulding process in a mould which takes two-stage nature {{of the process and}} the occurrence of uncontrolled phenomena which influence the shape, size and quality of the products into consideration. Design/methodology/approach: The value for the Barus number for different dimensions of the nozzle gap and the distribution of the temperature field during blow moulding process have been determined; the product thickness profile has been defined; phenomena which occur during blowing stage have been registered. The investigations have been performed by means of the blow moulding machine of UFP- 05 type by IPTS – Metalchem Toruń using the designed and prepared blow mould with the <b>sight-glass</b> made of polycarbonate. Findings: The performed investigations enabled the insight study of uncontrolled phenomena which occur during each individual stage of the process and they showed the dependencies between these phenomena and the process parameters. Moreover, the detailed analyses enabled to determine the influence of these parameters on the physical features and dimensions of the finished goods. Research limitations/implications: The continuation of the investigations with use of extended blow mould design equipped in polycarbonate <b>sight-glass</b> which enabled the determination of the influence of the structure and mould cavity dimensions on the finished product wall thickness seems to be justified. It would be also useful to design the station for the precise non-touch measurements of Barus effect which enabled, except the measurements of the external diameter, the measurements of the finished product wall thickness. Originality/value: The complex analysis of the blow moulding process was possible thanks to innovative and original approach to the experimental tests which enables e. g. the optical registration of the phenomena which occur during blow moulding process...|$|E
