The nozzles to which this process was applied are the surge nozzle (September 2007), <b>safety</b> nozzles, <b>relief</b> nozzle and spray line nozzle (April 2010). L-SIP can be applied without inner surface cooling because the high power laser beam can generate the sufficient temperature difference without such cooling.
