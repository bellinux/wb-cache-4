40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the synthesis of a series of novel pyridine containing ligands and their copper co-ordination chemistry. The aim was to design ligands which would produce copper complexes which model the active sites within certain copper-containing Nitrite Reductase enzymes. The first chapter reviews previous work in this area and details the promising nature of pyridine-containing ligands. The remainder of this thesis {{is concerned with}} the synthesis and characterisation of some novel pyridine-containing ligands and their copper chemistry. The synthetic routes developed during this work enabled tris(pyrid- 2 -yl) methylamine ligands to be produced and studied which were tripodal in form but which had a primary amine group at the cap which could be further elaborated. Additional substituents were also placed on the pyridine rings to investigate their impact on the chemistry of their copper complexes. These ligands showed a variety, counter ion dependent chemistry. The structures of number of the copper complexes formed during these studies have been determined by X-ray crystallography. These showed the ligand system to exhibit various modes of co-ordination. The exploitation of the synthetic approaches developed to these tripyridyl tripodal ligands has enabled the basic ligand to be elaborated to incorporate thiol, protected thiol and/or thioether groups. As part of this study the X-ray crystal structure of a copper complex from an N sub 2 S sub 2 ligand was determined. The synthesis of more <b>sophisticated</b> <b>ligand</b> systems which have both N sub 3 and N sub 2 S sub 2 donor sets within the same molecule have also been investigated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for better cancer treatments, cis-platin {{complexes}} {{is one of the}} most widely used and researched. In search of better ligands the lack of solubility is a common problem, because the newer, more <b>sophisticated</b> <b>ligands</b> are becoming larger and more complex. Poor bioavailability and distribution in the body follows, even though improved selectivity towards cancer cells is achieved in vitro. Therefore improvements may be made by employing water soluble ligands that can bind metal ions. An oxalamidato ligand with a pyridine moiety was predicted to show the desired water solubility due to the pyridine moiety and polar coordination site. The project was designed to see if the ligand would participate in a all or nothing reaction filling both cavities or if it could be controlled so only one cavity would coordinate with a metal ion. Synthesis with both ligands showed various results and analysis of spectroscopical data and interpertation of them showed that the oxalamidato ligands can coordinate with one or two metal ions and the nature o...|$|R

The following years saw {{development of more}} <b>sophisticated</b> phosphine <b>ligands</b> that allowed extension to a larger variety of amines and aryl groups. Aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates eventually became suitable substrates, and reactions run with weaker bases at room temperature were developed. These advances are detailed in the Scope section below, and the extension to more complex systems remains an active area of research.|$|R
40|$|Efficient electrocatalytic {{reduction}} of small molecules such as CO 2, N 2, and even protons relies upon the precise delivery of electrons and protons to an active site. The coordination of these reactions can involve <b>sophisticated</b> <b>ligands</b> controlling the coordination spheres around a reactive center. The incorporation of a pendant base for proton shuttling {{is one way}} to achieve such control. In order to explore the reactivities of a class of complexes, Ni(P 2 N 2), versatile syntheses are required. Seven 1, 5 -diaza- 3, 7 -diphosphacyclooctane (P 2 N 2) ligands with alkyl- and carbonyl- substituted phosphines have been synthesized via two versatile methods that allows for improved control of the phosphine substituent. The methyl-, ethyl-, benzyl-, 3 -propanoic acid, 3 -propanamide, and ethyl 3 -propanoate-phosphino- substituted phosphine P 2 N 2 ligands (PMe 2 NPh 2, PEt 2 NPh 2, PBn 2 NPh 2, PPA 2 NPh 2, PAmide 2 NPh 2, PEtE 2 NPh 2, PEtE 2 NPhOMe 2) were synthesized and characterized by 31 P{ 1 H} NMR, 1 H NMR, and elemental analysis, and their corresponding [Ni(PR 2 NPh 2) 2](BF 4) 2 complexes were synthesized and characterized by 31 P{ 1 H} NMR, 1 H NMR, and electrochemistry, and their corresponding Ni(PR 2 NR’ 2) X 2 (X= Cl-, BF 4 -, CF 3 SO 3 -, PF 6 -) complexes have been synthesized and characterized by 31 P{ 1 H} NMR, 1 H NMR, X-ray crystallography, and elemental analysisThe nickel complexes of P 2 N 2 ligands synthesized and characterized by these new methods were investigated for hydrogen evolution and formate oxidation electrocatalysis. The newly synthesized complexes with alkyl- and carbonyl- phosphine substituents rapidly evolve hydrogen and oxidize formate more slowly than previously synthesized cyclohexyl- and phenyl- substituted phosphine ligands, due to a more negative reduction potential leading to a decrease in the driving force of formate oxidation and increase for hydrogen evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of two-photon absorption (2 PA) materials is a classical research field and has recently attracted increasing interest. It has generated {{a demand for}} new dyes with high 2 PA cross-sections. In this short review, we briefly cover the structure- 2 PA property relationships of organic fluorophores, organic-inorganic nanohybrids and metal complexes explored by our group. (1) The two-photon absorption cross-section (δ) of organic fluorophores increases with the extent of charge transfer, which is important to optimize the core, donor-acceptor pair, and conjugation-bridge to obtain a large δ value. Among the various cores, triphenylamine {{appears to be an}} efficient core. Lengthening of the conjugation with styryl groups in the D-π-D quadrupoles and D-π-A dipoles increased δ over a long wavelength range than when vinylene groups were used. Large values of δ were observed for extended conjugation length and moderate donor-acceptors in the near-IR wavelengths. The δ value of the three-arm octupole is larger than that of the individual arm, if the core has electron accepting groups that allow significant electronic coupling between the arms; (2) Optical functional organic/inorganic hybrid materials usually show high thermal stability and excellent optical activity; therefore the design of functional organic molecules to build functional organic-inorganic hybrids and optimize the 2 PA properties are significant. Advances {{have been made in the}} design of organic-inorganic nanohybrid materials of different sizes and shapes for 2 PA property, which provide useful examples to illustrate the new features of the 2 PA response in comparison to the more thoroughly investigated donor-acceptor based organic compounds and inorganic components; (3) Metal complexes are of particular interest for the design of new materials with large 2 PA ability. They offer a wide range of metals with different ligands, which can give rise to tunable electronic and 2 PA properties. The metal ions, including transition metals and lanthanides, can serve as an important part of the structure to control the intramolecular charge-transfer process that drives the 2 PA process. As templates, transition metal ions can assemble simple to more <b>sophisticated</b> <b>ligands</b> in a variety of multipolar arrangements resulting in interesting and tailorable electronic and optical properties, depending on the nature of the metal center and the energetics of the metal-ligand interactions, such as intraligand charge-transfer (ILCT) and metal-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) processes. Lanthanide complexes are attractive for a number of reasons: (i) their visible emissions are quite long-lived; (ii) their absorption and emission can be tuned with the aid of appropriate photoactive ligands; (iii) the accessible energy-transfer path between the photo-active ligands and the lanthanide ion can facilitate efficient lanthanide-based 2 PA properties. Thus, the above materials with excellent 2 PA properties should be applied in two-photon applications, especially two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) and related emission-based applications. Furthermore, the progress of research into the use of those new 2 PA materials with moderate 2 PA cross section in the near-infrared region, good Materials 2017, 10, 223 2 of 37 biocompatibility, and enhanced two-photon excited fluorescence for two-photon bio-imaging is summarized. In addition, several possible future directions in this field are also discussed (146 references) ...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{quantum dots}} (CQDs) are {{potentially}} low-cost, solution-processable semiconductors which are endowed, through their nanoscale dimensions, with strong absorption, band gap tunability, high dielectric constants and enhanced stability. CQDs are contenders as a standalone PV technology {{as well as}} a potential back layer for augmenting established photovoltaic (PV) technologies, such as Si. However, owing to their small size (ca. few nanometers), CQDs are prone to surface trap states that inhibit charge transport and threaten their otherwise wonderful optoelectronic properties. Surface traps have also, indirectly, impeded scalable and industry-compatible fabrication of these solar cells, as all of the reports, to date, have relied on spin-coating with <b>sophisticated</b> and tedious <b>ligand</b> exchange schemes, some of which need to be performed in low humidity environments. In this thesis, we posit that an in-depth understanding of the process-structure-property-performance relationship in CQDs can usher in fresh insights into the nature and origin of surface traps, lead to novel ways to mitigate them, and finally help achieve scalable fabrication. To this end, we probe the CQD surfaces and their interactions with process solvents, linkers, and ambient environment employing a suite of spectroscopic techniques. These fundamental insights help us develop facile chemical and physical protocols to mitigate surface traps such as solvent engineering, remote molecular doping, and oxygen doping, directly leading to better-performing solar cells. Our efforts finally culminate in the realization of > 10...|$|R
