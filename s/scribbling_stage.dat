40|$|Although the <b>scribbling</b> <b>stage</b> {{of drawing}} has been {{historically}} regarded as meaningless and transitional, {{a sort of}} prelude to the actual drawing phase of childhood, recent studies have begun to re-evaluate this important moment of a child's development and find meaning in what was once considered mere motor activity and nothing more. The present study analyzes scribbling in all its subphases and discovers a clear intention behind young children's gestures. From expressing the dynamic qualities of an object and the child's relationship with it, to gradually reducing itself to a simple contour of a content no more alive on the paper, {{but only in the}} child's own imagination, we trace the evolution of the line as a tool that toddlers use to communicate feelings and intentions to the world that surrounds them. We will provide a selected number of graphical examples that are representative of our theory. These drawings (13 in total) were extracted from a much wider sample derived from our studies on children's graphical-pictorial abilities, conducted on children aged 0 to 3 years in various Italian nurseries. Our results appear to indicate that scribbling evolves through a series of stages, and that early graphical activity in children is sparked and maintained by their relationship with their caregivers and the desire to communicate with them...|$|E

40|$|Achieving Competence in childrens {{productive}} {{written language}} (PWL) in playgroup and kindergarten indicates {{the existence of}} language acquisition, based on the 8 principles (differentiation, symbolization, integration, imitation, variation, inventarization-collection, repetition, generating). This acquisition process is categorized into 8 <b>stages</b> (<b>scribble,</b> linear repetitive, like-letter, random letter, early spellings, phonetic, transitional, conventional). The majority of subjects make handwriting which covers the forms of leaning-corrupted-interpolated-like-letter form, mirrored, and shadowed form. Childrens PWL acquisition is related to children engagement in written language activities, social interaction, and exposure...|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{a disease}} caused by {{transformation}} of cells by the activation or over-expression of oncogenes such as Ras and c-myc, {{and the loss of}} tumour suppressor genes such as E-cadherin and <b>scribble.</b> The initial <b>stage</b> of tumourigenesis is the transformation of a single cell in an otherwise normal epithelium. What occurs at this stage is largely unknown - do the transformed cells and normal cells co-exist or is there an antagonism between them? This thesis examines the fate of epithelial cells that lose the tumour suppressor scribble when in an otherwise normal epithelium. The fate of scribble knockout clones has been studied in Drosophila melanogaster larval imaginal discs. It has been observed that scribble knockout clones are removed from the larval tissues by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) dependent apoptosis. It is though that this is an innate tumour suppressive mechanism. It is therefore of great interest and importance to understand if a similar phenomenon can be seen in mammalian cells. Scribble knockdown Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells die only when surrounded by normal MDCK cells. Dead scribble short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) cells are apically extruded from the epithelium after cell death and exhibit classical apoptotic markers such as cytoplasmic condensation, caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Extrusion of dead scribble knockout cells occurs after initiation of apoptosis as blocking myosin activation results in many dead scribble knockout cells staying in the epithelial monolayer. Prior to cell death they maintain normal cell-cell adhesion with their normal MDCK neighbours and activate the stress induced protein kinase p 38, but not c-­‐Jun N­‐- terminal kinase (JNK) ...|$|R
