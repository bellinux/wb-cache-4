So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

The live titles, you have to put something like that. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame. Sutherland described the film production as [...] "exciting" [...] because, [...] "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not going to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show." ...|$|E
500|$|On a state {{television}} show, Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Al-Hassan said that fiftypolice officers had been injured, including two with serious sword wounds and that [...] "one protester drove over police resulting in injuries including cutting-off fingers of a policeman {{before we could}} catch him." [...] He also denied policemen prevented ambulances from reaching Pearl Roundabout or attacked any paramedics, but instead: [...] "What happened is that protesters stole an ambulance car, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> checking on every ambulance that reaches the roundabout." [...] One doctor working at SMC's ER supported the government's account, accusing protesters of attacking the Under-Secretary-of-State for Health, taking control of all hospital entrances and stealing an ambulance.|$|E

500|$|The ANAK Society {{explained}} {{its name}} as originating from {{a passage in}} the Book of Numbers, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible. The passage, attributed to , reads, [...] "And there were the Nephilin, the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: {{and we were in}} our own sight as grasshoppers, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in their sight." [...] Anak was a biblical figure said to be the forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 Blue Print, the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook, to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Just Good Old Rock and Roll is {{much more}} {{straightforward}} than past works, consisting of funk-influenced hard rock, although [...] "So Many People to Tell" [...] and [...] "Silver Passion Mine" [...] also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound. As Whetstone explains, [...] "We were fairly naive in terms of guidance; we had none, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> experimenting {{with a lot of}} musical styles. If you listen to the album, you'll hear a lot of diversity, feel and tempo changes...That was our learning curve." [...] In early 1970, Whetstone and Wade departed the band and moved to Canada where they formed Stallion Thumbrock. Morgan and Kincaid constructed another line-up of The Electric Prunes that included Michael Kearns, Clay Groomer, Huey Plumeigh, and Galen Pugh; however, by mid-1970 the band dissolved.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working on our second issue by the time I saw it. It {{was going to be a}} matter of somehow trying to restage the entire first issue, because it was a very similar coma opening. I made a decision—which I pretty much regret at this point—I said, 'You know what? It's so different , I will probably never hear anything about this.' And I was wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their early}} years the {{perceived}} stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed as 'silverhighchair', 'not Soundgarden but ' or 'Nirvana in Pyjamas' by the Australian media. The latter is a sarcastic conflated {{reference to the}} band's youth and the popular Australian children's TV series Bananas in Pyjamas. McFarlane stated [...] "Freak Show and tracks like 'Freak' were firmly in Nirvana territory {{with a hint of}} Led Zeppelin's Eastern mysticism". Gillies noted that the band were inspired by the Seattle Sound, as well as The Beatles and The Doors, and were highly impressionable in their youth. Johns admitted that [...] "We were always influenced a lot by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin it just so happened that we weren't very good at playing that style of music. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> put in the whole grunge category because it was such a garage-y, heavy music term." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on October 2, 1995, at CTS Studios in London. It took almost {{four months to}} record all the songs, which involved creating the music first and then the lyrics. Parker declared {{the first day of}} recording as [...] "Black Monday", and recalled it as a worrisome and nervous day. He said, [...] "All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all very apprehensive." [...] The cast was also nervous; Banderas found the experience [...] "scary", while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, the American {{musician}} and bandleader Brian Wilson's {{growing interest in}} the aesthetics of recording and his admiration for both record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the Beatles' album Rubber Soul resulted in the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds LP, which demonstrated his production expertise and his mastery of composition and arrangement. The author Thomas MacFarlane credits the release with influencing many musicians of the time, with McCartney in particular singing its praises and drawing inspiration to [...] "expand {{the focus of the}} Beatles' work with sounds and textures not usually associated with popular music". McCartney thought that his constant playing of the album made it difficult for Lennon to [...] "escape the influence", adding: [...] "It's very cleverly done... <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> inspired by it and nicked a few ideas." [...] Martin stated: [...] "Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have happened... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron sketched Jack's nude {{portrait}} of Rose for a scene which he feels has {{the backdrop of}} repression. [...] "You {{know what it means}} for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E
500|$|Assistant manager Harry Redknapp {{was also}} now taking {{a bigger role}} in the {{transfer}} of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position, the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie, made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club—on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and {{walked away from the}} club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, [...] "If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in a no-win situation. We're sad that Bill is going, and it's a big blow but it's time to move on and we have appointed a great manager." ...|$|E

Short instrumental versions of songs by The Cure, Pantera and Slayer were also played by Tomo Miličević, Shannon Leto and Tim Kelleher. The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly was a pretty big deal. So many of our favorite bands did 'Unplugged' and still do it, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> really thrilled to be asked." ...|$|E

Later, the song went on to receive two Grammy nominations at the 38th ceremony for Best R Song—for Austin's composition—and for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, eventually winning the latter. [...] "We were in shock! We just put out music so that people could find a connection with what were saying, so we didn't know exactly how people would feel about anything," [...] Thomas says as she recalls TLC's winning moment. [...] "So when you {{get that kind of}} recognition, it says so much. The Grammys is like the Oscars of music, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just beyond happy to get one."

O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut.
