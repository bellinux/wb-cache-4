500|$|When Nixon {{resigned}} on August 9, 1974, Ford {{assumed the}} presidency, {{making him the}} only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office. Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: [...] "I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to confirm me as your president with your prayers."

2500|$|... "I {{keep talking}} to him, I ask him {{questions}} {{and he looks}} at his watch," [...] Millen said. [...] "I said, 'You got some place you need to be?' And he goes, 'Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> him another question, {{he looks at his}} watch and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{for spring}} flowers to bloom,found {{no place for}} my nest in the garden ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} think of any retort to this, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> if Mrs. Strickland had children.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} no little Em'ly to be seen, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Mr. Peggotty where she was.|$|R
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I {{care who}} hears me now? You have made caution unnecessary," [...] she responded, sharply. [...] "All {{the world knows}} us now! and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you again, {{what are you doing}} here?" ...|$|E
60|$|SHITE I {{will not}} tell you his name, but his grave lies in the green field beyond that tall pine tree. He cannot enter to the gates of Paradise, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to pray.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her {{who were}} {{the men who had}} sat at the long table. She became rather stiff and curt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Torrington says <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{particularly}} who he was, and {{she told}} me that his mother was some foreigner of high rank." ...|$|R
60|$|I did not by {{any means}} relish the manner and tone, in which all this was said: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him what {{particular}} service he belonged to.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you wish}} {{me to speak}} in plain words," [...] Barrington said, [...] "I will do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to aid me {{as a man of}} honor in the {{restoration}} of those letters to my wife." ...|$|E
60|$|From you, my dear Basil, the confidant of {{my hopes}} toward Noto, I know I may look for sympathy {{now that my}} {{advances}} have met with such happy issue, however incomplete be my account. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to be my best man in the matter before the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not so," [...] {{answered}} Leo earnestly. [...] "As one man to another, I {{tell you}} it is not <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> no smile of your wife and no acre of your soil. Be wise and help us to be gone, and live on undisturbed in such fashion as may please you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This last remark {{reminded}} me of the reports about the mother's [...] miserly nature, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> a question that made the poor girl reply [...] quickly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, {{the rules}} say {{everyone}} must send in something, and I can't write poetry at all, and Reynolds likes it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him to do}} it.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{saw that}} he was waiting for me to say something; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> if his great work had not cost a vast {{expenditure}} of time and pains.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it not clear," [...] he answered, [...] "why I {{have done}} <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> of you the {{greatest}} boon {{a woman has}} to give. I do not seek to bribe, {{but if you can}} give me the love that will make my life a dream of happiness, then will it not be my duty to see that no shadow of misfortune shall come to you or yours? China stands between Japan and Russia, and I am China." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} a long time, I have a little scheme," [...] he said, [...] "and I have been to Washington to see Watling, to talk over it. Well, he thinks much of you. Fowndes and Ripon are good lawyers, {{but they are not}} smart like you. See Paret, he says, and he can come down and talk to me. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to come here. That is why I say you are wise to get home. Honeymoons can wait--eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friends and Fellow Utensils! Our worthy Commander of the Spoon Brigade, Captain Dipp, has {{captured}} the three prisoners you see before you and brought them here for--for--I don't know what for. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> your advice how to act in this matter, and what fate I should mete out to these captives. Judge Sifter, stand on my right. It is your business to sift this affair to the bottom. High Priest Colender, stand on my left and see that no one testifies falsely in this matter." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the {{question}} myself, {{standing outside the}} door. My mistress thanked me in a faint voice, and begged me to do what I had proposed immediately.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> and was {{informed}} {{they believed that}} the king had let Pereira go on to his own people in payment of the information that he had given him.|$|R
2500|$|There {{was an old}} {{theory that}} maybe Arnold had seen wind {{whipping}} snow along the mountain ridges, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Air Force investigators about this. I got a flat [...] "Impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{wonderful}} {{amount of}} controversial capital {{has been made}} out of my assertion in the note to which I have referred, as an obiter dictum of no consequence to my argument, that if Renan's work[71] were non-extant, the main results of biblical criticism, as {{set forth in the}} works of Strauss, Baur, Reuss, and Volkmar, for example, would not be sensibly affected. I thought I had explained it satisfactorily already, but it seems that my explanation has only exhibited still more of my native perversity, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> for one more chance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know you," [...] she answered. [...] "For myself, I admit it. When I am {{with a man}} who is nice, I {{try that}} I may make him, just a little, no more, but just a little in love with me. It makes things more amusing. It is better for him, and we are not bored. But with you, mon ami, I know very well that I waste my time. And <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you instead this question. Tell me why you have invited me to take luncheon with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now if you {{had stopped}} in the firm and earned the very {{handsome}} competence {{in a small way}} which would have become due to you this week, instead of throwing us over at the last moment for some quixotic reasons of your own, {{it might have been a}} different matter. I do not say it would have been, I say it might have been, and you may remember a proverb about winks and nods and blind horses. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you whether you are inclined to withdraw that resignation of yours and bring up this question again let us say, next Sunday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! Don't cry!' said Miss Betsey. 'You {{were not}} equally matched, child--if any two {{people can be}} equally matched--and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the question. You were an orphan, weren't you?' 'Yes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was an old}} {{theory that}} maybe Arnold had seen wind {{whipping}} snow along the mountain ridges, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Air Force investigators about this. I got a flat [...] "Impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} what Hunky Magee {{thought about his}} own story; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him if he had}} any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon.|$|R
6000|$|Having done <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the {{attention}} of this audience to the question whether I have succeeded in sustaining the charge, and whether Judge Douglas has at all succeeded in rebutting it? You all heard me call upon him to say which of these pieces of evidence was a forgery. Does he say that what I present here as {{a copy of the}} original Toombs bill is a forgery? Does he say that what I present as a copy of the bill reported by himself is a forgery, or what is presented as a transcript from the Globe of the quotations from Bigler's speech is a forgery? Does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries? Does he say this transcript from Trumbull's speech is a forgery? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the latter}} case {{he must have been}} {{provided}} with silent matches, or the noise would have awakened the sleeper. Of one thing you may be sure, Captain Mervyn had not provided himself with silent matches; but even had not the sound of an ordinary match being struck awakened the sleeper, surely the sudden light would have done <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you from your own experience whether, however soundly you might be sleeping, the effect of a candle being lit in your room would not awaken you; therefore I think it safe to assume that in the first place, because no match was found, and in the second place, because had a candle been lit it would assuredly have awakened the sleeper, and we know that she was not awakened, that no candle was lighted in the room.|$|E
6000|$|USE FIRST. And {{the first}} shall be a use of examination. Art thou a professor? Dost thou religiously name {{the name of}} Christ? If <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> dost thou, {{according}} to the exhortation here, 'Depart from iniqnity?' I say, examine thyself about this matter, and be thou faithful in this work, for the deceit in this will fall upon thine own pate. Deceive thyself thou mayest, but beguile God thou shalt not. 'Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.' (Gal. 6:7) Wherefore let no man deceive himself, either in professing while he lives viciously, or in examining whether his profession of this name, and his life, and conversation, do answer one another. What departing from iniquity is, I have already showed in the former part of this book; wherefore I shall not here handle that point farther, only press upon thee the necessity of this exhortation, and {{the danger of the}} not doing of it faithfully. The necessity of it is urged, ...|$|E
6000|$|Her eyelids fell to {{shut out}} his gaze. [...] "Well--after your visit I couldn't find courage to fulfill my promise--and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him to release me--and he did--he was very kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It was {{necessary}} {{for me to see}} her somewhere, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her to come here. Perhaps the Duke has found out and stopped her. Anyhow, call me if she comes." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew that}} he was right, and that I should not try to {{reconcile}} him with Roman history; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for news concerning other ancients with whom he had walked familiar.|$|R
