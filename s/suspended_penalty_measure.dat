40|$|The {{economic}} {{approach to}} optimal criminal <b>penalties</b> <b>measures</b> the welfare effects {{of crime and}} punishment in dollar terms, ignoring differences in the marginal utility of money among people. This paper alternatively proposes using time as the unit of measure in determining optimal criminal <b>penalties,</b> <b>measuring</b> {{the costs and benefits}} of crime in hours or days instead of dollars. The policy implications differ substantially from those in the existing economic literature. Equal prison terms impose similar time costs on all individuals rather than being more costly for those with higher foregone earnings. Equal fines impose the same cost on all individuals in the dollar-based economic models but in a time-denominated system are costlier to those who require more time to earn the money to pay the fines. In principle, one can use either money or time in setting penalties. However, time-based penalties are more consistent with the fundamental and widely held principles of justice on which the U. S. legal system rests. Copyright 1995 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R

Farmers receiving the SFP have the flexibility to produce any commodity on their land except fruit, vegetables and table potatoes. In addition, they are obliged to keep their land in good agricultural and environmental condition (cross-compliance). Farmers have to respect environmental, food safety, phytosanitary and animal welfare standards. This is a <b>penalty</b> <b>measure,</b> if farmers do not respect these standards, their payment will be reduced.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine when there are penalties for both tardy and early arrivals. We point out that if {{attention is paid to}} how these <b>penalties</b> are <b>measured,</b> then a change of scale of measurement might lead to the anomalous situation where a schedule is optimal if these parameters are measured in one way, but not if they are measured in a di#erent way that seems equally acceptable. In particular, we note that if the <b>penalties</b> <b>measure</b> utilities or disutilities, or loss of goodwill or customer satisfaction, then these kinds of anomalies can occur, for instance if we change both unit and zero point in scales <b>measuring</b> these <b>penalties.</b> We investigate situations where problems of these sorts arise for four specific penalty functions under a variety of di#erent assumptions. The results of the paper have implications far beyond the specific scheduling problems we consider, and suggest that considerations of scale of measurement should enter into analysis of conclusions of optimality both in scheduling problems and throughout combinatorial optimization. ...|$|R
40|$|Classification with {{partially}} labeled data requires using a {{large number}} of unlabeled examples (or an estimated marginal P (x)), to further constrain the conditional P (y|x) beyond a few available labeled examples. We formulate a regularization approach to linking the marginal and the conditional in a general way. The regularization <b>penalty</b> <b>measures</b> the information that is implied about the labels over covering regions. No parametric assumptions are required and the approach remains tractable even for continuous marginal densities P (x). We develop algorithms for solving the regularization problem for finite covers, establish a limiting differential equation, and exemplify the behavior of the new regularization approach in simple cases. ...|$|R
5|$|Domenicali insisted {{there were}} no team orders {{and that it was}} Massa who chose to allow Alonso past. Alonso reaffirmed Domenicalli's {{statement}} and admitted he was surprised when Massa slowed and claimed that he felt Massa had a gearbox issue. FIA reporter Lars Osterlind investigated the incident and sent a 160-page report to the World Motor Sport Council which concluded that Alonso should be given a five-second time penalty which would hand the victory to Massa. He also wanted a <b>suspended</b> <b>penalty</b> on the loss of Ferrari's Drivers' and Constructors' points scored in the event. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting held in Paris on 8 September, the tribunal elected to uphold the $100,000 fine imposed on Ferrari, decided that no further action would be taken against the team, and that Formula One's Sporting Working Group would review the rule that prohibited team orders. In December, the FIA announced the rule on team orders would be revoked because it was difficult to enforce. Parallels were made between the race and the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to concede the event's victory to Schumacher on its final lap.|$|R

30|$|Table  1 {{shows the}} RD <b>penalty</b> <b>measured</b> for 15 fps {{sequences}} encoded using two temporal layers and the TR {{of the proposed}} transcoder. Concerning the RD results, we can observe that the drop penalty is negligible for every layer; even for low-complexity sequences (such as the Hall or CoastGuard sequences) the coding efficiency is better {{than that of the}} reference transcoder because the MVs stored are shorter. The TR achieved is − 73.18 % on average, so the time consumed by SVC encoding is greatly reduced by using the MVs generated in the WZ decoding stage. For different WZ GOP lengths, the results are similar since the proposed MV extraction method is similar for every WZ GOP length.|$|R
5000|$|American health payment {{systems are}} {{undergoing}} significant reform efforts, which include compensating emergency physicians through “Pay for Performance” incentives and <b>penalty</b> <b>measures</b> under commercial {{and public health}} programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This payment reform aims to improve quality of care and control costs, despite the differing opinions on the existing {{evidence to show that}} this payment approach is effective in emergency medicine. Initially, these incentives were only targeted toward primary care providers (PCPs), but some would argue emergency medicine is primary care, as no one refers patients to the ED. In one such program, two specific conditions listed were directly tied to patients frequently seen by emergency medical providers: acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia.(See: Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration.) ...|$|R
40|$|When a new (global) {{constraint}} {{is introduced}} in local search, <b>measures</b> for the <b>penalty</b> and variable conflicts of that constraint must be defined, and incremental algorithms for maintaining these measures must be implemented. These are complicated and time-consuming tasks, which clearly reduces {{the productivity of}} the local-search practitioner. We introduce a generic scheme that, from {{a description of a}} constraint in monadic existential second-order logic extended with counting, automatically gives <b>penalty</b> and variable-conflict <b>measures</b> for such a constraint, as well as incremental algorithms for maintaining these measures. We prove that our variable-conflict measure for a variable x is lower-bounded by the maximum penalty decrease that may be achieved by only changing the value of x, as well as upper bounded by the <b>penalty</b> <b>measure.</b> Without these properties, the local search performance may degrade. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by replacing a built-in global constraint by a modelled version, while still obtaining competitive results in terms of runtime and robustness. This is especially attractive when a particular (global) constraint is not built in...|$|R
40|$|Analog {{performance}} of an all-optical ultrafast wavelength converter is measured and {{reported for the}} first time. The wavelength-conversion process is based on nonlinear cross-phase modulation in an optical fiber combined with an optical filter to convert phase modulation to amplitude modulation. The spurious-free dynamic-range (SFDR) of the converter is measured to be 82 dB. Hz(2 / 3). We define a new metric called the SFDR power <b>penalty,</b> which <b>measures</b> the degradation in SFDR relative to baseline the back-to-back analog optical link. The SFDR power <b>penalty</b> was <b>measured</b> to be 5 dB. Hz(2 / 3) and is {{shown to be a}} function of the input optical power.

2500|$|One {{month after}} the initial penalty, in September 2006, it was {{announced}} that the FFA would again be investigating alleged discrepancies regarding the contract of a Sydney FC player. The investigation concluded that Sydney had committed multiple breaches of the player contracting regulations: [...] "an undisclosed payment made to a player, pre-payments from the club to players and payments made by the club to agents of the players", all of which should have been, but were not included in Sydney's declaration of player payments for 2005–06. FFA Management assessed that the severity of the breaches warranted a $259,000 fine for Sydney as well as a penalty of three competition points, but this was again reduced in consideration of Sydney's co-operation with the investigation. Sydney's final penalty was a $129,000 fine along with the deduction of three competition points (including the activation of the one point <b>suspended</b> <b>penalty</b> from the earlier breach), with a suspended automatic one point penalty should Sydney be found to be in breach of contracting regulations in 2006–07 or 2007–08.
