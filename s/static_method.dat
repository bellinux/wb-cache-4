25|$|Local {{functions}} can {{be defined}} {{in the body of}} another method, constructor or property’s getter and setter. Such functions have access to all variables in the enclosing scope, including parent method local variables. They are in scope for the entire method, regardless of whether they’re invoked before or after their declaration. Access modifiers (public, private, protected) cannot be used with local functions. Also they do not support function overloading. It means there cannot be two local functions in the same method with the same name even if the signatures don’t overlap. After a compilation, a local function is transformed into a private <b>static</b> <b>method,</b> but when defined it cannot be marked static.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>static</b> <b>method</b> is to add a solution of the substance in a non-aqueous solvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, to an aqueous buffer mixture. Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as [...] "kinetic solubility". The cloudiness {{is due to the}} fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in Tyndall scattering. In fact the particles are so small that the particle size effect comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Unit {{testing is}} often made more {{difficult}} by the heavy use of classes as namespaces and {{the proliferation of}} <b>static</b> <b>methods</b> to encapsulate configuration code. We have analyzed the use of 120 <b>static</b> <b>methods</b> from 96 projects by categorizing them according to their responsibilities. We find that most <b>static</b> <b>methods</b> support a hodgepodge of mixed responsibilities, held together only by their common need to be globally visible. Tight coupling between instances and their classes breaks encapsulation, and, together with the global visibility of <b>static</b> <b>methods,</b> complicates testing. By making dependency injection a feature of the programming language, we can get rid of <b>static</b> <b>methods</b> altogether. We employ the following semantic changes: (1) Replace every occurrence of a global with an access to an instance variable; (2) Let that instance variable be automatically injected into the object when it is instantiated. We present Seuss, a prototype that implements this change of semantics in Smalltalk. We show how Seuss eliminates the need to use class methods for non-reflective purposes, reduces the need for creational design patterns such as Abstract Factory and simplifies configuration code, particularly for unit tests. ...|$|R

5000|$|Static {{methods are}} meant to be {{relevant}} to all the instances of a class rather than to any specific instance. They are similar to static variables in that sense.

50|$|Considering the {{importance}} of elastic properties for design and engineering applications, a number of experimental techniques are developed and these can be classified into 2 groups; <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>methods.</b> <b>Statics</b> <b>methods</b> (like the four-point bending test and nanoindentation) are based on direct measurements of stresses and strains during mechanical tests. Dynamic methods (like ultrasound spectroscopy and impulse excitation technique) provide an advantage over <b>static</b> <b>methods</b> because the measurements are relatively quick and simple and involve small elastic strains. Therefore, IET is very suitable for porous and brittle materials like ceramics, refractories,… The technique can also be easily modified for high temperature experiments and {{only a small amount}} of material needs to be available.|$|R
