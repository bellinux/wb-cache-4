25|$|However, the Rettungsassistent {{remained}} {{subject to}} discussion, especially regarding length of education, scope of practice, autonomy in emergency situations and differentation to other medical professions, including paygrade. The problems mainly {{were seen in}} the early state exam after just one year in EMS school (the additional internship in EMS wasn't part of examination), the more or less undefined curriculum, the main focus on bare assistance to a physician, the possible <b>side</b> <b>entry</b> for other medical professions and the de facto requirement for students {{to pay for the}} entire education.|$|E
25|$|Education as Rettungsassistent {{was mostly}} offered by privately owned but state {{certified}} EMS schools (Rettungsassistenten-Schule). Mostly {{the students had}} to pay for their own training, rarely a future employer paid. Usual exceptions were firefighters, policemen and members of the armed forces for whom their employer covered the fees. Costs depended on school, they varied around €4000 for a full course. With a pre-existing EMS training, a shortened course was available, for fees of about €2750. <b>Side</b> <b>entry</b> for nurses were possible, omitting several medical topics, remaining fees of about €1800. Public funding and sponsorship were possible in certain cases.|$|E

25|$|Once {{inserted}} into a TEM, the sample {{has to be}} manipulated to locate the region {{of interest to the}} beam, such as in single grain diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of <b>side</b> <b>entry</b> bolders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of movement with specialized holder designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The design criteria of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} is the <b>side</b> <b>entry</b> holder, where the {{specimen}} is placed near {{the tip of}} a long metal (brass or stainless steel) rod, with the specimen placed flat in a small bore. Along the rod are several polymer vacuum rings to allow for the formation of a vacuum seal of sufficient quality, when inserted into the stage. The stage is thus designed to accommodate the rod, placing the sample either in between or near the objective lens, dependent upon the objective design. When inserted into the stage, the <b>side</b> <b>entry</b> holder has its tip contained within the TEM vacuum, and the base is presented to atmosphere, the airlock formed by the vacuum rings.|$|E
2500|$|The first British {{standard}} for domestic three-pin plugs was BS317 Hand-Shield and <b>Side</b> <b>Entry</b> Pattern Three-Pin Wall Plugs and Sockets (Two Pin and Earth Type) published in 1928.

[...] In 1934, BS372 Part II was in turn superseded by the first edition of BS546 Two-Pole and Earthing-Pin Plugs and Socket Outlets. [...] BS546:1934 clause 2 specifies interchangeability with BS372 Part II which includes the same four plug and socket sizes.

2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} common to British mains {{plugs and sockets}} intended for domestic use. [...] The brass pins appear relatively solid and large compared to others. British Standards for plugs (with the exception of BS4573) have always specified <b>side</b> <b>entry</b> flex (entry in other types is usually parallel to the axes of the pins). [...] Since 1934, the contacts of a socket have been specified {{in terms of the}} pins of the plug, rather than by specifying the contact dimensions. [...] The pins of both round pin and rectangular pin plugs are arranged in a triangular fashion, the earth pin being the larger and longer pin at the apex. Earthed sockets are designed to be incompatible with two-pin plugs. [...] Both BS546 and BS1363 sockets, when viewed from the front with the earth uppermost, have the line aperture at the lower right.|$|E
