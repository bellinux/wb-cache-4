The kinetic experiments showed a high dependence of the rates on <b>solvent</b> ionizing <b>power,</b> with the fastest reactions in the fluorinated alcohols and their mixtures with water or ethanol and the slowest in the poorly ionizing ethanol.

Experimental factors including <b>solvent,</b> microwave <b>power,</b> and irradiation time at four-levels were studied in 16 trials by OAD(16) (4 (4)). The significance of these factors was investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and percent contribution (PC). Solvent is statistically demonstrated a chief factor; microwave power and irradiation time are secondary factors. Under the optimum condition, calibration curve of AM is linear over a range from 0. 01 to 100 ng mL(- 1) with correlation coefficient 0. 9988, and MA from 0. 1 to 1000 ng mL- 1 with correlation coefficient 0. 9951. The limit of detection (LOD) is 1. 20 pg mL(- 1) for AM and 13. 04 pg mL(- 1) for MA.

The traditional Grunwald-Winstein scale of <b>solvent</b> ionizing <b>power</b> (Y) has proved to be inadequate due to contributions from nucleophilic assistance to solvolysis of t-butyl chloride, the standard substrate. As structural features of both the 1 - and 2 -adamantyl systems preclude not only the intervention of nucleophilic participation, but also the possibility of rate-determining elimination, the solvolyses of adamantyl derivatives much better reflect the true ionizing power of a particular solvent system. Recent studies have also shown that a single scale of <b>solvent</b> ionizing <b>power</b> is inadequate to correlate the specific rates of solvolysis of a number of leaving groups. Y X scales of <b>solvent</b> ionizing <b>power</b> based on the solvolyses of adamantyl derivatives have been reported for seven anionic leaving groups. In this dissertation, three additional Y X scales are defined. A Y ONO 2 scale is defined by the specific rates of solvolysis of 1 -adamantyl nitrate at 50. 0 ∘C. Constant integrated first-order rate coefficients are observed in all solvents except 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol, where an autocatalytic mechanism is proposed to operate. It is found that Y ONO 2 values correlate much better with Y OTs values, based on 2 -adamantyl p-toluenesulfonate, than with Y OClO 3 values, based on 2 -adamantyl perchlorate. Distributions of products from the solvolysis of 1 -adamantyl nitrate in ethanol/water mixtures are also examined. The specific rates of solvolysis of 2 -adamantyl 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanesulfonate and 2 -adamantyl pentafluorobenzenesulfonate are used for the definition of, respectively, Y OTr and Y PFBS values. These sulfonates solvolyze at rates intermediate to those of the corresponding p-toluenesulfonate and trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTS < OTr < PFBS < OTf), thus providing a bridge in the 105 - to 106 -fold nucleofugality gap between the two latter leaving groups. Y OTr and Y PFBS values are correlated against Y OTs values and against Y OTf values. The results of these correlations suggest that the sensitivities of the rates of solvolysis of these sulfonates to the effects of specific electrophilic solvation decline as the ability of the particular sulfonate to disperse a developing negative charge internally increases...|$|R
