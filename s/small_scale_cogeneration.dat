After the description of the actual normative for energy efficiency regarding cogeneration plants, the objective of the present paper is to provide useful material in order to complete the regulatory actions in this field.

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} is <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> power <b>cogeneration</b> within an integrated energy network, that provides system wide and environmental benefits. Network benefits include enhancements to reliability, reduction of peak power requirements, improved power quality and enhanced resilience. Environmental benefits include better land use for transmission and distribution, and reduced ecological impact. Deploying distributed generation affects the power {{loss in the}} system and has an associated cost. Therefore, optimization of the penetration level of the distributed generation should consider both goals of minimizing total power loss and minimizing total operational costs. In this study, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework based on particle filtering to evaluate the effects of adding distributed generation to a networked system in terms of power loss and operational costs, simultaneously. The proposed framework has been demonstrated on the IEEE- 30 bus system yielding to minimal power losses of 2. 075 MW and minimal costs of $ 547. 51 per hour. ...|$|R

Combined heat and power (CHP) or cogeneration has several advantages {{in the context of}} the smart grid, which include the efficient use of primary energy and the reduction of electrical losses through transmission. However, the role of the gas network is often overlooked in this context. Therefore, this work presents an analysis of the impact of a massive implementation of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> (micro) <b>cogeneration</b> units on the gas demand at distribution level. This work shows that using generic information in the simulations overestimates the impact of CHP. Furthermore, the importance of the thermal storage tank capacity on the impact on the gas demand is shown. Larger storage tanks lead to lower gas demand peaks and hence a lower impact on the gas distribution network. It is also shown that the use of an economically led controller leads to similar results compared to classical heat led control. Finally, it results that a low sell back tariff for electricity increases the impact of cogeneration on the gas demand peak. status: publishe...|$|R

These {{systems can be}} integrated to industrial and agricultural activities where biomass residues are generated and can be converted into electricity and thermal energy by combustion or gasification. The legislations of many European countries such as Italy concerning renewable energy and energy efficiency along the taxation schemes have raised the incentives for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>cogeneration</b> plants. Consequently, there is a clear economic interest of the companies in this sector and there is also a scientific interest towards demonstration of their energetic efficiency, environmental performance and reliability. Among the suggested technologies for the biomass conversion into energy, downdraft gasification (using air as gasification agent), coupled with internal combustion engines, has the advantage of high electric efficiency (∼ 25 %) and low tar generation, making easier the gas cleaning process necessary for its use into engines. In the present work, the results of a measurement campaign performed on a commercial scale 350 kWth downdraft woodchips gasification plant, coupled with an SI internal combustion engine (ICE), are presented and discussed. The main goals of this first experimental campaign have been to verify the stability of gasifier and engine operation, operability of the plant and to determine its energy efficiency.

In particular in the European Union a remarkable contribution to energy consumption and CO 2 emissions is concentrated in residential and commercial sector.

40|$|Cogeneration from biomass {{and waste}} showed {{significant}} {{evolution in the}} last years. Actually, some energy conversion technologies fuelled by biomass and biogas are particularly suitable for distributed generation, namely Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC). However, <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> cogenerative plants based on ORC in the power range of some MWel present low conversion efficiency and high costs of operation. For this reason, the current research aiming to overcome these limitations is oriented to innovative configurations and applications of the ORC technology, such as, for instance, the direct coupling of the ORC line with the biomass boiler, without any intermediate heating fluid, or the realization of regenerative J&B/ORC combined cycles.

5000|$|The {{heat engine}} version is a <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> example of <b>cogeneration</b> schemes {{which have been}} used with large {{electric}} power plants. The purpose of cogeneration is to utilize more of the energy in the fuel. The reason for using such systems is that heat engines, such as steam power plants which generate the electric power needed for modern life by burning fuel, are not very efficient. Due to Carnot's theorem, a heat engine cannot be 100% efficient; it cannot convert anywhere near all the heat produced from the fuel it burns into organized forms of energy such as electricity. Therefore, heat engines always produce a surplus of low-temperature waste heat, called [...] "secondary heat" [...] or [...] "low-grade heat". Modern plants are limited to efficiencies of about 33-63% at most, so 37-67% of the energy is exhausted as waste heat. In the past this energy was usually wasted to the environment. Cogeneration systems, built {{in recent years in}} cold-climate countries, utilize the waste heat produced by large power plants for heating by piping hot water from the plant into buildings in the surrounding community.|$|R

The use of wood-chips at cogeneration (CHP) plants brings up {{a range of issues}} that have to be solved simultaneously, not only when owners select the installed electrical and heat capacity, but also during plant operation, in order to secure maximum energy efficiency and loading. Two radically contradictory solutions are possible when choosing the installed capacity of CHP plants: compliance with the base load of the heating system, ensuring operation of the CHP plant for 4000 – 8000 hours/ year and compliance with the optimum heat load of the heating system during the whole year, providing heat to consumers until the moment when heat consumption starts decreasing. A methodology has been developed to enable a comparison of various alternative solutions for the purpose of analysing the efficiency of the use of primary energy resources. The multi-criteria based analysis methodology has been used to implement rating of alternative technological solutions of biomass CHP plants.

Much of this pipeline system is in disrepair and is nearing the end of its useful life, and the boilers which supply it are old and often inefficient. In 1993, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) proposed to SERDP a three-year effort to develop advanced systems of coupled diesel cogenerators and absorption chillers which would be particularly useful in providing a continuation of the services now provided by increasingly antiquated district systems. In mid-February, 1995, BNL learned that all subsequent funding for our program had been canceled. BNL staff continued to develop the Program Plan and to adhere to the requirements of the Execution Plan, but began to look for ways in which the work could be made relevant to Navy and DoD energy needs even without the extensive development plan formerly envisioned. The entire program was therefore re-oriented to look for ways in which <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>cogeneration</b> and absorption chilling technologies, available through procurement rather than development, could provide some solutions to the problem of deteriorated district heating systems. The result is, we believe, a striking new approach to the provision of building services on military bases: in many cases, serious study should be made of the possibility that the old district heating system should be removed or abandoned, and small-scale cogenerators and absorption chillers should be installed in each building. In the remainder of this Summary, we develop the rationale behind this concept and summarize our findings concerning the conditions under which this course of action would be advisable and the economic benefits which will accrue if it is followed.

40|$|Dupont's Marshall Laboratory is an {{automotive}} paint {{research and}} development facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The campus is comprised of several buildings that are served by Trigen-Philadelphia Energy Corporation's district steam loop. In 1996 Dupont management {{announced that it was}} considering moving the facility out of Philadelphia primarily due to the high operating cost compared to where they were considering relocating. The city officials responded by bringing the local electric and gas utilities to the table to negotiate better rates for Dupont. Trigen also requested the opportunity to propose energy savings opportunities, and dedicated a team of engineers to review Dupont's steam system to determine if energy savings could be realized within the steam system infrastructure. As part of a proposal to help Dupont reduce energy costs while continuing to use Trigen's steam, Trigen recommended modifications to increase energy efficiency, reduce steam system maintenance costs and implement <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>cogeneration.</b> These recommendations included reducing the medium pressure steam distribution to low pressure, eliminating the medium pressure to low pressure reducing stations, installing a back pressure steam turbine generator, and preheating the domestic hot water with the condensate. Dupont engineers evaluated these recommended modifications and chose to implement most of them. An analysis of Dupont's past steam consumption revealed that the steam distribution system sizing was acceptable if the steam pressure was reduced from medium to low. After a test of the system and a few modifications, Dupont reduced the steam distribution system to low pressure. Energy efficiency is improved since the heat transfer losses at the low pressure are less than at the medium pressure distribution. Additionally, steam system maintenance will be significantly reduced since 12 pressure reducing stations are eliminated. With the steam pressure reduction now occurring at one location, the opportunity existed to install a backpressure turbine generator adjacent to the primary pressure reducing station. The analysis of Dupont's steam and electric load profiles demonstrated that cost savings could be realized with the installation of 150 kW of self-generation. There were a few obstacles, including meeting the utility's parallel operation requirements, that made this installation challenging. Over two years have passed since the modifications were implemented, and although cost savings are difficult to quantify since process steam use has increased, the comparison of steam consumption to heating degree days shows a reducing trend. Dupont's willingness to tackle energy conservation projects without adversely affecting their process conditions can be an example to other industrial steam users...|$|E

40|$|Gasification is {{considered}} one of the most promising technologies in biomass applications. The higher efficiency compared to boiler power systems, the perspectives in fuel synthesis and its environmental friendly features are some examples of its potential. Biomass gasification has evolved since its first applications, but it has not been possible to reach a solid commercial stage, except during periods of crises and only for some specific applications. Meanwhile, other gasification technologies, fed by fossil fuels, are currently widely used on industrial scales. This thesis aims to analyze the knowledge development and diffusion patterns of the biomass gasification technology since 1970 ’s in Austria, Finland, Germany and Sweden. Additionally, it seeks to identify the factors that strengthen and weaken the learning process. Finally, the concept of learning curve will be used to numerically assess the rate of learning in small scale biomass gasification for electricity generation. The feasibility of various future scenarios will be evaluated in order to know what is the likelihood for the technology to become competitive in the short term. To do so, the historical evolution of biomass gasification in Austria, Finland, Germany and Sweden has been analyzed. These countries have been selected due to the increasing number of ongoing projects and initiatives since 1970. Subsequently, the development of this technology has been encouraged by two historical facts. Initially, the price of fossil fuels grew in 1973 and 1979 enhancing the interest for biomass gasification as a future alternative. Afterwards, the willigness, shown by the mentioned countries, to reduce greenhouse gases emissions following the Kyoto protocol has revived the interest in biomass gasification. However, none of these two events has driven this technology sufficiently to achieve a sustainable commercial status. In addition, small and large scale projects have followed different development processes. In the case of large scale, interest has shifted from electricity generation to biofuel production, primarily due to the failed demonstration projects of the technology coupled with combined cycle for electricity generation. On the other hand, in small scale projects, cogeneration applications have gained interest over heat production. However, there are fewer actors involved in small scale experimentation than in large scale. Once the specific situation of each country has been analyzed, and the main characteristics of the development process have been identified, one of the causes which have hindered the technology to reach the expected commercial stage has been the lack of resources to demonstrate its competitiveness. So far, a significant number of experimentation activities, based on demonstration projects and pilot plants, have proved the future potential of the technology. Nonetheless, the uncertainty, shown by the great majority of actors, about integrating the biomass gasification in their industrial process has hindered the demonstration of its operational feasibility. Following this, further efforts should focus on the creation of incentives for the construction of new plants which integrate this technology in an industrial process already consolidated in the market. An approximation of the number of new plants needed, could be a good indicator of the economical resources required in order to acquire enough experience to make biomass gasification a competitive technology in the short-term. After simulating various future evolutions for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>cogeneration</b> applications, the learning rate obtained through the learning curves model predict that, building roughly forty plants in six years, the technology can be consolidated firmly in the market. Considering the decrease in the number of new plants built since 2002, the expectancies are not really optimistic. Nevertheless, it is not an unachievable objective if incentives are created by all administrative levels...|$|E
40|$|Utilization of {{landfill}} biogas in Latvia {{is based}} on energy production in power station placed close to landfill for different reasons. One {{of the most important}} reasons is financial state support of small scale power stations (4 MWe) from renewable energy resources. Such kind of support prevents both, development of waste sorting and utilization of refuse derived fuel in cement production, and biogas improvement to cover needs transportation sector or to connect to natural gas grid. Paper presents analysis of possibilities to utilize landfill biogas for electricity production in one of Latvia’s landfills. Analysis {{is based on}} selection of criteria and methodology for optimization of biogas utilization for energy production. The objective of the paper is to model optimal parameters of biogas utilization in Latvia’s landfills. Optimization refers to finding the values of decision (or free) variables, which correspond to and provide the maximum or minimum of one or more desired objectives. In this paper criteria and methodology for optimization of biogas utilization for energy production have been selected. Optimization target function includes engineering, greenhouse gas and economical parameters which are applied to foresee potential of landfill biogas utilization. Optimization model for biogas utilization in landfills includes four modules and is based on technological, climate and economical sub models. Economical sub model is based on investment costs, operational and maintenance expenses from one side, and on feed-in tariff, which depends on state energy policy, from the other side. Technological sub model includes different factors of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>cogeneration</b> units, which present installed capacity, operation hours, electricity and thermal energy relation and others. Climate sub model includes emission trading components based on green investment scheme, losses of green house gases and other parameters. Model of power production in landfill shows that feed-in tariff stated as financial support today in Latvia allows to reach economically feasible projects even in case if cogeneration unit is operated in power station regime (generates only electricity). Results show that state policy needs corrections to improve energy efficiency of biogas utilization for energy production. Results of economical optimization show that in case of low biogas quality (4 kWh/m 3) the optimal installed capacity is 2. 2 MW. In case of biogas quality of 5 kWh/m 3, optimal installed capacity is 2. 8 MW, and 3. 4 MW – in case of high biogas quality (6 kWh/m 3). Results of technological optimization show that, the higher the installed capacity, the shorter the operation time of equipment. If assumed that operation time of the equipment could be 5 up to 10 years, then the installed capacity can be 0, 5 MW and higher. Results of the climate sub model show that the higher is installed capacity, the greater the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Besides that, {{it is not possible to}} reach extremum by using two objective functions (heat value of biogas and installed capacity), which have been used in case of economical and technological sub models, and it is necessary to introduce another objective functions. Conclusions of the paper are; 1. The analysis of three optimization sub models: technological, economical and climate presents that target function of optimization depends from the large number of independent variables (multi objective optimization models), however after their analysis only two of the independent parameters have been chosen: quality of biogas is characterized by heat value, whereas technological equipment is characterized by electrical capacity. 2. The economical optimization of biogas utilization in existing landfills shows that maximum value of benefits depends on quality and installed capacity of power station. Lower installed capacity and lower quality of biogas allows to reach lower benefits and savings. Whereas, higher...|$|E

The methodology used involved conducting a literature review of the types of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and mineral processing operations that exist within South Africa. A case study approach was used and a questionnaire was developed to gather information from selected legal <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and processing operations in South Africa. A survey was developed and submitted to experts/specialists in the field of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining in order to use the Pairwise Comparison Decision Making Tool to develop a scientific definition of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining. By comparing the information studied in the literature with the data obtained from visiting two <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> operations (semi-precious gemstones and diamonds) and using engineering management concepts it was found that the recommended improvements that one can make to <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and minerals processing operations in South Africa can essentially be categorised into four critical areas namely: Management, Chemical Analysis, Technology and Skills. These areas are captured in more detail in the Integrated Management Model proposed for <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> Mining and Minerals Processing Operations in South Africa within this dissertation. All aims and objectives set-out for the research conducted were achieved. The recommended improvements if implemented by <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and mineral processing operations in South Africa will result in a safer and healthier working environment, increased productivity, higher production rates and improved profitability...|$|R

Performance of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> Indonesian food enterprises is measured based on the Balanced Scorecard perspective. The total sample is 50 owners of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> Indonesian food enterprises, scattered throughout the regions of Surabaya. Data processing methods that used in this study were factor analysis and structural analysis with GeSCA. The result shows that marketing capability acts as a perfect mediator between entrepreneurial orientation and performance of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> Indonesian food enterprises in Surabaya...|$|R

We treat the case of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> random bombardments at discrete times which is different from our earlier work [16] where we approximated the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> random kicks by a continuous in time random process. In the absence of geophysical effects, the large scale structure emerging out of the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> random forcing {{is the same as the}} case of continuous in time forcing that we studied before...|$|R

In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on improvement of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> fisheries in developing countries. In spite of substantial investments, and the arduous labor of many competent, well-intentioned people, the success rates of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> fisheries development projects have not been encouraging. This paper will discuss two types of project approaches which have been used in <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> fisheries development, with examples of the challenges and problems they have encountered. A description of the Appropriate Technology Adaptive Research, Development, and Extension (ATARDE) approach for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> fisheries will follow, with comments on its potential, and challenges it will have to address...|$|R

40|$|In {{last two}} decades, the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> {{industrial}} sector, due to various reasons, has increasingly received attention from Indonesian policy makers. In the research area, rural <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> industrial activities {{play an important}} role, yet in a varying way. Production factors like labour and capital {{as well as the}} degree of localism are used to illustrate the differences in character. Attention is also paid to the linkages of those <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> industrial units with other units and sectors. Based on the main characteristics and the function of those rural <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> industrial activities, a distinction is made between basic and non-basic activities. A short description is given of the most important government programmes in the sphere of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> industrial development. It is concluded that policy makers have given insufficient attention to the differences within the sector. As a result, most of the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> industrial units are deprived of the programmes which are specifically designed for them...|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} the connectivity between large and <b>small</b> <b>scales</b> in boundary-layer turbulence by formalizing the modulation {{effect of the}} <b>small</b> <b>scales</b> by the large {{in terms of the}} pointwise Hölder condition for the <b>small</b> <b>scales.</b> We re-investigate a previously published dataset from this perspective and are able to characterize the coupling effectively using the (cross-) correlative relations between the large scale velocity and the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> Hölder exponents. The nature of this coupling varies as a function of dimensionless distance from the wall based on inner-scaling, y^+, {{as well as on the}} boundary-layer height, δ. In terms of the fundamental change in the sign of the coupling between large and <b>small</b> <b>scales,</b> the critical height appears to be y^+∼ 1000. Below this height, <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> structures are associated with (and occur earlier than) maxima in the large scale velocity. Above this height, while the lag is similar in magnitude, the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> structures are associated with minima in the large scale velocity. To consider these results further, we introduce a modified quadrant analysis and show that it is the coupling to the large scale low velocity state that is critical for the dynamics...|$|R
