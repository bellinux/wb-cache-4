5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E
5|$|That second column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.|$|E

At any one time, between 70% and 85% of Nakhchivan's population was infected with malaria, and in the region of Norashen (present-day Sharur) almost 100% were struck with the disease. This situation improved dramatically under Soviet rule. Malaria was sharply reduced and trachoma, typhus, and relapsing fever were completely eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The United States Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), {{as amended}} by The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003, defines {{child abuse and neglect}} as, at minimum: any recent act or failure to act {{on the part of a}} parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious {{physical}} or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of <b>serious</b> <b>harm.</b> A child is defined as a person under the age of eighteen. Within the parameters of CAPTA, each state is responsible for individually defining child abuse, neglect, and dependence and outline the care expected of parents and caregivers. In abuse cases, the most abused children are male aged from several months to 10 to 11 years old. The typical abusers are parents, live-in friends, guardians, or baby sitters, and only rarely by a sibling or other child.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{both the}} {{monetary}} hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{as well as the}} debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand, a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.|$|E
25|$|Naultinus are preyed on by {{a number}} of {{invasive}} mammalian species including cats, rodents (3 species of rat and the house mouse) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as stoats and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and weasels may be just as great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the '90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> to native reptile populations. Mice can squeeze into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become torpid and can't defend themselves against attack. This would mean that Naultinus sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, Naultinus are also preyed on by introduced bird species - mynas have been observed plucking Naultinus from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and magpies have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known Naultinus sites in the South Island.|$|E
