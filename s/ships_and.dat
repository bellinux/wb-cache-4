Thus, the concept of networks of three networks, called Baltic Port, <b>Shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ship</b> Traffic <b>and</b> Port Operation Information Critical Infrastructure Network, is introduced. This way, the operation process of network of networks is proposed. To understand this approach, the basic classification and description of interdependencies and interconnections in this network are presented...|$|R
