We present a flat Gauss illumination for the <b>step-and-scan</b> lithographic system in this paper. Through flat Gauss illumination in scanning direction, pulse quantization effect could be reduced effectively. Correspondingly, the uniformity of the reticle and wafer is improved. Compared with the trapezoid illumination, flat Gauss illumination could keep the slit edge fixed, and pulse quantization effect will not be enhanced. Moreover flat Gauss illumination could be obtained directly without defocusing and blocking, which results in high energy efficiency and high throughput of the lithography. A design strategy for flat Gauss illumination is also proposed which offers high uniformity illumination, fixed slope and integral energy of flat Gauss illumination in different coherence factors. The strategy describes a light uniform device which contains first microlens array, second microlens array, one-dimensional Gauss diffuser and a Fourier lens. The device produces flat Gauss illumination directly at the scanning slit. The design and simulation {{results show that the}} uniformity of flat Gauss illumination in two directions satisfy the requirements of lithographic illumination system and the slope. In addition, slit edge of flat Gauss illumination does not change. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} a scanning beam interference lithography (SBIL) system. SBIL is capable of producing large-area linear diffraction gratings that are phase-accurate to the nanometer level. Such gratings may enable new paradigms in fields such as semiconductor pattern placement metrology and grating-based displacement measuring interferometry. With our prototype tool nicknamed "Nanoruler", I have successfully patterned, for the first time, a 400 nm period grating over a 300 mm-diam. wafer, the largest that the tool can currently accommodate. By interfering two small diameter Gaussian laser beams to produce a low-distortion grating image, SBIL produces large gratings by <b>step-and-scanning</b> the photoresist-covered substrate underneath the image. To implement SBIL, two main questions need to be answered: First, how does one lock the interference image to a fast-moving substrate with nanometer accuracy? Secondly, how does one produce an interference image with minimum phase nonlinearities while setting and holding its period to the part-per-million (ppm) level? My thesis work solves the latter problem, which can be further categorized into two parts: period control and wavefront metrology. Period control concerns SBIL's ability to set, stabilize and measure the image grating period. Our goal is to achieve control at the ppm level {{in order to reduce}} any related phase nonlinearity in the exposed grating to subnanometers. A grating beamsplitter is used to stabilize the period. I demonstrate experimental results where the period stabilization is at the 1 ppm level. An automated beam alignment system is built. The system can overlap the beam centroids to around 10 [mu]m and equalize the mean beam angles to better than 2 [mu]rad (0. 4 arcsec), which translates into a period adjustability of 4 ppm at 400 nm. (cont.) Image period is measured in-situ via an interferometric technique. The measurement repeatability is demonstrated at 2. 8 ppm, three-sigma. Modeling shows that such small period measurement error does not accumulate as growing phase nonlinearities in the patterned resist grating; rather, the resist grating has an averaged period that equals the measured period. Any phase nonlinearity is periodic and subnanometer in magnitude. SBIL wavefront metrology refers to the process of mapping the phase of the grating image and adjusting the collimating optics so that minimum image phase nonlinearity can be achieved. The current SBIL wavefront metrology system employs phase shifting interferometry and determines the image nonlinearity through a moire technique. The system has an established measurement repeatability of 3. 2 nm, three-sigma. I am able to minimize the nonlinearity to 12 nm across a 2 mm-diam. image. Modeling shows that despite an image phase nonlinearity at the dozen nanometer level, printed phase error in the resist can be reduced to subnanometers by overlapping scans appropriately. From {{the point of view of}} period control and wavefront metrology, I conclude that SBIL is capable of producing gratings with subnanometer phase nonlinearities. by Carl Gang Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We {{describe}} algorithms for {{the determination}} of fast movement strategies for a <b>step-and-scan</b> wafer stepper, a device that {{is used for the}} photolithographic processing of integrated circuits. The proposed solution strategy consists of two parts. First, we determine the maximum number of congruent rectangular chips that can be packed on a wafer, subject to the restriction that the chips are placed in a rectangular grid. Second, we find fast movement strategies for scanning all chips of a given packing, given the mechanical restrictions of the wafer stepper. The corresponding combinatorial optimization problem is formulated as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show how feasible scan strategies are determined, and how these strategies are improved by local search techniques, such as iterative improvement based on 2 - and 3 -exchanges, and simulated annealing based on 2 -exchanges. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In sub- 100 nm CMOS processes, {{delay and}} leakage power {{reduction}} {{continue to be}} among the most critical design concerns. We propose to exploit the recent availability of fine-grain exposure dose control in the <b>step-and-scan</b> tool to achieve both design-time (placement) and manufacturing-time (yield-aware dose mapping) optimizations of timing yield and leakage power. Our placement and dose map co-optimization can improve both timing yield and leakage power of a given design. We formulate the placement-aware dose map optimization as quadratic and quadratic constraint programs which are solved using efficient quadratic program solvers. In this paper, we mainly focus on the placement-aware dose map optimization problem; in the Appendix, we describe a complementary but less impactful dose map-aware placement optimization based on an efficient cell swapping heuristic. Experimental results show noticeable improvements in minimum cycle time without leakage power increase, or in leakage power reduction without degradation of circuit performance.

40|$|To {{meet the}} uniform dose {{exposure}} in optical lithography, {{it is desirable}} to get uniform illumination and trapezoidal illumination in the scanning direction on the wafer for the <b>step-and-scan</b> lithographic system. A design strategy for trapezoidal illumination is proposed which offers both high uniformity illumination and fixed integral energy of trapezoidal illumination in a different illumination pattern. The strategy describes a light uniform device which contains a microlens array, a microcylindrical array, and a Fourier lens and produces trapezoidal illumination directly at the scanning slit. Compared with the conventional method to obtain the trapezoidal illumination, the strategy in this paper reduces the difficulty of assembly and {{has the advantage of}} simplicity and directness without blocking energy. This method utilizes energy of the lithographic system more effectively, and it improves the throughput of the lithography. The simulation results show that this method not only maintains the uniformity of trapezoidal illumination but also improves the energy utilization. (C) 2015 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|The Engineering Test Stand (ETS) is a {{developmental}} lithography tool designed to demonstrate full-field EUV imaging and provide data for commercial-tool development. In {{the first phase}} of integration, currently in progress, the ETS is configured using {{a developmental}} projection system, while fabrication of an improved projection system proceeds in parallel. The optics in the second projection system have been fabricated to tighter specifications for improved resolution and reduced flare. The projection system is a 4 -mirror, 4 x-reduction, ring-field design having a numeral aperture of 0. 1, which supports 70 nm resolution at a k{sub 1 } of 0. 52.

40|$|Displacement {{measuring}} interferometry {{is based}} on measuring the Doppler frequency shift that a beam of radiation undergoes upon reflection off a mir-ror connected to a moving stage. Usually the velocity of the reflecting stage is very small compared to {{the speed of light}} and is therefore deduced using the classical expression for the Doppler shift. We calculate relativistic cor-rections to the Doppler frequency shift, considering arbitrary stage motion in two dimensions and multiple passes through the moving interferometer arm. Changes in optical path lengths due to the varying stage displacement are explicitly taken into account. For stage velocities on the order of only 1 m/s the resulting corrections to the classically derived stage displacement can amount to nanometers. We discuss model velocity profiles similar to those currently employed in industrial <b>step-and-scan</b> systems for integrated circuit manufacturing, and for recently proposed scanning-beam interference litho-graphy schemes. Expected future increases in stage speed and wafer sizes will necessitate the inclusion of relativistic corrections to the Doppler shift to maintain pattern placement accuracy at the nanometer level.

40|$|In {{this work}} we found optimum {{exposure}} parameters and determined a process window for a 1 X Stepper tool used in MEMS fabrication. Compared to older full-wafer imaging, Stepper lithography has a smaller exposure field that enables to maintain high Depth of Focus (DOF) even at submicron dimensions. Even though its resolution limit {{is far from}} the modern <b>step-and-scan</b> tools used in IC industry today, its higher depth of focus makes it a suitable tool for MEMS, where lithography over severe topography is often mandatory. For the optimization of our Stepper tool, photoresist profiles obtained with different exposure parameters and test masks were analysed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and optical microscope delegated to measurement of Critical Dimensions (CD). Both profiles on top of thermal oxide and on top of bare silicon were investigated. A Swing Curve was constructed to determine photoresist thickness by RPM. Photoresist profiles were analysed with different focus and exposure energies to construct Bossung plots. These Bossung plots were used to determine our process window. Different types of submicron structures were investigated with the optimum parameters found. Optimum photoresist thickness obtained in Swing Curve analysis was 1, 67 μm for planar surfaces. The process window of our Stepper tool is quite large, with DOF of 4 μm. The optimum exposure energy of our Stepper tool was 230 mJ and optimum focus was - 1, 0 μm. The isofocal CD was about 150 nm lower than CD on mask. The resolution limit of our Stepper tools is slightly lower than 1, 0 μm: submicron lines are exposed and defined clearly, but they are sloped and thus quite narrow at top. After final oxide etching, photoresist profiles were almost identical on top of bare silicon and oxide. Our Stepper tool has sufficient resolution and high DOF suitable for MEMS fabrication. The optimal exposure parameters found in this work allow for smaller safety tolerances in chip design and thus more efficient use of silicon area. This allows reducing the size and cost of the MEMS without reducing device performance. In a farther future with more strict resolution requirements, either creative solutions or new kind of lithography tools are needed. Tässä työssä tutkimme 1 X Stepperin optimivalotusparametreja, tarkoituksena määrittää laitteen prosessi-ikkuna. Stepperilitografian koko kiekkoaluetta pienempi valotusalue mahdollistaa paremman fokustason alle mikrometrin dimensioiden rakenteille. Vaikka laitteemme resoluutio ei vastaa moderneja <b>step-and-scan</b> valottimia, on sen tarjoama korkea fokustaso erittäin hyödyllinen topografiaa sisältävissä valmistusprosesseissa, kuten monissa MEMS-tuotteissa. Tutkimme sähköelektronimikroskoopilla (SEM) photoresistiprofiileja eri valotusenergioilla ja testimaskeilla löytääksemme optimaaliset valotusparametrit. Arvioimme optimaalista resistinpaksuutta Swing Curve –kuvaajista. Eri valotusenergioiden ja fokuksien näytteiden SEM:llä tehtyjen profiilimittausten perusteella piirsimme Bossung-kuvaajat, joiden pohjalta arvioimme Stepperin prosessi-ikkunaa. Vertailimme profiileja paljaan piin ja termisen oksidin välillä sekä tutkimme yleisesti alle mikrometrin rakenteiden valotuksen onnistumista. Optimiresistipaksuudeksi tasaiselle pinnalle määritettiin 1, 67 μm. Stepperin prosessi-ikkunan huomattiin olevan varsin suuri, fokustason ollessa 4, 0 μm. Optimivalotusenergiaksi määritettiin 230 mJ ja optimifokukseksi - 1, 0 μm. Stepperin resoluutio oli alle mikrometrin: tätä pienemmät rakenteet valottuivat hyvin, joskin ne olivat varsin kapeita yläosastaan. Resistiprofiilien huomattiin olevan samanlaisia paljaan piin ja oksidin päällä oksidietsausprosessivaiheen jälkeen. Stepperillämme on riittävä fokustaso ja resoluutiokyvykkyys MEMS-tuotantoon. Tämän työn tuloksena saatiin optimivalotusparametrit, jotka mahdollistavat tehokkaamman piirisuunnittelun ja piikiekkopinta-alan käytön. Tämä mahdollistaa MEMS-tuotteiden koon ja hinnan pienentämisen. Kaukaisemmassa tulevaisuudessa kiristyvät resoluutiotarpeet vaativat joko luovia laitekehitysratkaisuja tai uuden, modernimman valotuslaitteen...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{photolithography}} {{are one of}} the key driving {{factors in}} the continuing expansion in capacity and decrease in cost of semiconductors. Extending this trend into the future necessitates the development of next-generation lithography technologies in order to overcome the fundamental challenges of improving critical dimension and overlay control, and lowering the total cost-of-ownership. As feature sizes become smaller and smaller, performance requirements for wafer scanner machines will become more stringent; with regards to motion control, requirements for the wafer stage include sub-nanometer positioning precision under high scan velocities and accelerations. Advanced control algorithms are needed to meet these requirements in the face of disturbances such as vibrations, noise, force ripple and friction, as well as model uncertainty. This dissertation focuses on using the repetitiveness of the stage's motion in the photolithography process to improve control precision. Similar to many manufacturing processes, the <b>step-and-scan</b> motion used to expose a wafer is very repetitive, on a die-to-die and also wafer-to-wafer level. By using data gathered from past runs, the control effort for future runs may be improved, thereby exploiting the repetitiveness of the process to increase control precision. In this research, iterative learning control (ILC) and iterative feedback tuning (IFT) were applied to reduce tracking error of the wafer stage. In ILC, a feedforward control signal for the system is incrementally adjusted to achieve better tracking performance using error signals from previous runs. ILC is an attractive method for high-precision control because of its simplicity and data-based nature. In this research, ILC algorithm design specifically for attenuating high frequency vibrations is investigated. Through careful design of the ILC update law, fast learning convergence and small final error is achieved. One drawback of ILC is that a feedforward signal learned through ILC is only applicable to the training trajectory; learning must be restarted when the trajectory is changed. A method is presented for making ILC results applicable to any trajectory within a class of scan trajectories; this is accomplished by using ILC as a training method for feedforward signal patterns. In IFT, controller parameters are fine-tuned incrementally using only data collected in experimental runs. IFT is applied to tune fixed-structure feedforward, feedback, and force-ripple compensator controllers. The performance of IFT is also compared with ILC in the context of iterative methods for designing feedforward control. All results are verified through computer simulations and experiments done on a wafer stage testbed system...|$|E
