40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} heavily rely on <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> {{for data}} processing and routing within the network {{itself and the}} outside world. Considerably less attention {{has been put on}} the security of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> in comparison with sensor nodes, simply because the <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> are expected to be secure enough not to be attacked or even be compromised. In this research paper we propose, Candidate <b>Base</b> <b>Stations,</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> failure detection, in which the sensor network should be able to automatically and promptly resort to a candidate <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> which takes over the roles of a compromised <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> Our strategy of candidate <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> tries to ensure presence of the same number of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> on the network even after some have been compromised. With candidate <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> security is more guaranteed, our experimental results indicate a greater secure network with this scenario...|$|R
