[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Asenkron motorlar, düşük maliyetleri, uygun boyutları ve çok fazla bakım gerektirmemeleri gibi özellikleri sayesinde en çok tercih edilen elektrik motorlarıdır ve günlük hayatta, endüstriyel birçok çalışma alanında sıkça kullanılmaktadırlar. Bu sebeple bu motorların arıza durumları da, birçok çalışmaya konu olmuştur. Eksen kaçıklığı bu çalışmaların büyük bir kısmını oluşturmaktadır. Eksen kaçıklığı, stator ve rotor arasındaki hava aralığının homojen bir şekilde dağılmadığı durumdur. Statik, dinamik ve bu iki durumu aynı anda ihtiva eden karma eksen kaçıklığı olmak üzere üç farklı tipi mevcuttur. Hava aralığının homojen olmayışı ve asimetrik çalışma durumu, tasarım öncelikleri, üretim süreci ve çalışma koşullarına bağlıdır. Bu hata sonucunda, dengesiz hava aralığı akı yoğunluğu, moment titreşimlerine artış, kayıpların artması ve verimin düşmesi, aşırı ısınma ve gürültü seviyesinde artış gibi sorunlar ortaya çıkacaktır. Sağlıklı ve asimetrik çalışma durumlarının karşılaştırılması amacıyla, hem sağlıklı hem de farklı mertebelerde statik, dinamik ve karma eksen kaçıklığı barındıran {{modeller}} kurulmuş ve sonlu elemanlar yöntemi ile analizler yapılmıştır.

Induction motors are {{the most}} preferred electrical motor because of their low cost, reasonable size and low maintenance. Besides all these advantages, induction motors can be operated under many stresses such as, thermal, electrical, mechanical and environmental impacts. Hence, induction motors are used in many applications of daily life and industry. The failure analysis of these machines has been researched by many years in terms of mechanical, electrical, etc. Eccentricity constitutes {{a significant portion of}} the faults related to induction motors. Eccentricity is the condition of non-uniform air gap that exists between the stator and rotor. There are three types of eccentricity; static eccentricity, dynamic eccentricity and mixed eccentricity that is combination of former two. The stator is centered on first axis and the rotor is centered on second axis. In a healthy machine, first and second axes are coincident. Static eccentricity occurs when second axis is the center of rotation. If the first axis is center of rotation, the dynamic eccentricity occurs at this time. Besides, if the center of rotation can be anywhere between first and second axes, the mixed eccentricity appear to be a problem. The non-uniformity of the air gap of an induction motor depends on design features, manufacturing process and operating conditions. The asymmetric operational conditions of induction motors are connected with bearing fault, stator windings fault, broken rotor, cracked end ring and eccentricity related faults. The causes of the misalignment of the rotor as follows; the rotor center is not being at the center of the <b>stator</b> (<b>bearing</b> fault), the stator bore and rotor face are not perfectly cylindrical, bent rotor shaft, bearing wear or mechanical resonance at critical speed. These faults produce that the differences of characteristics of motor parameters as follows; non-stable air gap voltage and line current, unbalanced air gap flux density, increase in pulsating torque, decrease in average torque, reduction in efficiency (increase in losses), over heating and increase in noise level. In most of the literature, the studies are relevant to which parameters should be monitored for the detection of eccentricity in consideration of analytical calculations. The thesis presents the dynamic model of the induction motor and shows the deviation in the magnetic flux, the current and the torque values. Faulty conditions are investigated for static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity. The air gap flux density and its harmonic components are researched for healthy and asymmetric operational conditions. Therefore, the change in the harmonic components with increasing of eccentricity is analyzed. A 2. 2 kW, 4 pole, 50 Hz, delta connected squirrel cage induction motor is used in this thesis. The finite element method (FEM) is used for the analysis as a numerical method. FEM expresses a physical system in terms of mathematical quantities. Besides, it is a model that could be decomposed into sub-elements and have material properties and applicable boundary conditions. Unknown quantities with finite number are obtained by using known quantities of system. In thesis, the dynamic model of the induction motor is created for healthy and eccentric condition by changing the air gap. After verification of the healthy model respect to the experimental results, the flux density, current and torque characteristics of the eccentric models are examined. The test motor has 3 phase, 4 poles, 36 slots and 28 rotor bars. Firstly, the motor is modeled for the rated operation condition with no eccentricity. The eccentricity is modeled by shifting the rotor position and defining the axes of rotation. The non-uniform air gap is obtained in order to analysis the asymmetric operational conditions. The uniformity of the air gap width is corrupted with eccentricity. Consequently the air gap flux density will be different than the one in the healthy condition. Therefore, the higher air gap flux density values appear in points where air gap width is smaller and lower values appear where air gap width is larger, similarly. The harmonic spectrum is obtained in order to investigate the eccentricity effect on the air gap flux density. When fundamental component is decreasing with eccentricity fault, the high frequency components increase. As the eccentricity increases, the magnitude of the harmonic permeance waves due to eccentricity will increase. The flux density distribution in the air gap is found as the product of the permeance and the magnetomotive force (MMF), so, when the harmonic permeance waves due to eccentricity increases, the magnitude of harmonic components of air gap flux density will also increase as shown in simulation results. Therefore, pulsation of torque increases. The peak values of torque increase with eccentricity about 1 %. Besides, the torque ripple increases 1 ~ 14 % with increasing of eccentricity. In addition, eccentricity is investigated in terms of mechanical parameters such as vibration and noise with using experimental setup. The two different asymmetrical condition and healthy condition of motor are tested. In this way, the vibration level of asymmetric operational conditions increase % 8. 5 compared to the healthy conditon. In conclusion, in this thesis, the dynamic model of the induction motor is modeled with uniform and non-uniform air gaps. The results for the healthy model are verified the rated values of the motor. After the verification of the motor parameters, the motor geometry is redesigned for static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity condition. Changing of the air gap flux density is illustrated for eccentric conditions. The decreasing of fundamental component and the increasing of high frequency components with increasing the percentage of eccentricity are observed. The effects of eccentricity on the air gap flux distribution, current and torque characteristics are investigated with simulation results. Besides, the effects on vibration and noise are observed with test results. Therefore, the monitoring methods of eccentricity are studied in terms of different parameters, for instance; air gap flux density, harmonic components, current, moment and vibration. Yüksek LisansM.

Non-linearities arising from contact and magnetic bearing forces are then included in simulation studies involving rigid and flexible rotors to predict rotor response and evaluate rotor synchronous vibration components. An experimental flexible rotor/magnetic bearing facility is also used to validate the predictions. It is shown that changes in synchronous vibration amplitude and phase induced by contact events causes existing controllers to be ineffective in attenuating rotor displacements.

40|$|It is now common {{practice}} to supplement a magnetic bearing with a touchdown bearing {{to protect the}} rotor and <b>stator</b> components. Rotor/touchdown <b>bearing</b> contact may arise from rotor drop, caused by power loss or emergency shutdown. This paper considers the control options that are viable when the magnetic bearing is still functional should contact arise from intermittent faults or overload conditions. The problem is that bi-stable rotor responses are possible, with and without contact. If rotor contact should become persistent, the desirable course of action is to destabilize the rotor response and induce a return to contact-free levitation. In order to achieve this, {{it is appropriate to}} gain an understanding of the rotor dynamic behavior. This is determined from analytical and simulated results to reveal suitable control actions. These may be applied through the magnetic bearing control system, or by activating the touchdown bearing through a separate control loop. The issue is that standard control action for a contact-free rotor state will not be appropriate for a rotor in persistent contact since the basic plants to be controlled are significantly different. The required control action should be activated only when contact is detected. The results demonstrate that appropriately phased synchronous forcing could destabilize synchronous forward rub responses. Alternatively, small whirl motions of a touchdown bearing could also be beneficial without disturbing the main magnetic bearing control loop...|$|R
40|$|Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) are a {{relatively}} recent innovation in bearing technology. Unlike conventional bearings, which rely on mechanical forces originating from fluid films or physical contact to support bearing loads, AMB systems utilize magnetic fields to levitate and support a shaft in an air-gap within the <b>bearing</b> <b>stator.</b> This design has many benefits over conventional bearings. The potential capabilities that AMB systems offer are allowing this new technology {{to be considered for}} use in state-of-the-art applications. For example, AMB systems are being considered for use in jet engines, submarine propulsion systems, energy storage flywheels, hybrid electric vehicles and a multitude of high performance space applications. Many of the benefits that AMB systems have over conventional bearings makes them ideal for use in these types of vehicular applications. However, these applications present a greater challenge to the AMB system designer because the AMB-rotor system may be subjected to external vibrations originating from the vehicle’s motion and operation. Therefore these AMB systems must be designed to handle the aggregate vibration of both the internal rotor dynamic vibrations and the external vibrations that these applications will produce.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to study and analyze the {{performance}} of a rough hyperbolic slider bearing under the presence of a magnetic fluid lubricant. The magnetic field is oblique to the <b>stator</b> and the <b>bearing</b> surfaces are considered to be transversely rough. The roughness of the bearing surface is characterized by a stochastically random variable with non-zero mean, variance and skewness. The concerned Reynolds equation is stochastically averaged with respect to the random roughness parameters. This stochastically averaged equation is solved with suitable boundary conditions to obtain the expression of pressure distribution, which is then used to calculate the load carrying capacity. Besides, friction is also computed. The results show that the transverse surface roughness affects the performance of the bearing system adversely. It is seen that the load carrying capacity increases while friction decreases due to the magnetic fluid lubricant. It is revealed that the negative effect of transverse roughness can be minimized to certain extent by the positive effect of the magnetization in the case of negatively skew roughness. It is noticed that positively skewed roughness and variance (+ve) decrease the friction. Thus, this article offers some scopes for reducing the friction, increasing the load carrying capacity at the same time. This article may also be prevailed some measures for the extending the life period of the bearing system...|$|R

These turbines run at speed around 50, 000 to 5, 00, 000 rpm. At such a high speed no bearing is feasible to support the load except gas bearing.

40|$|Induction motors {{are widely}} used in industry, and they are {{generally}} considered very reliable. They often have {{a critical role in}} industrial processes, and their failure can lead to significant losses as a result of shutdown times. Typical failures of induction motors can be classified into <b>stator,</b> rotor, and <b>bearing</b> failures. One of the reasons for a bearing damage and eventually a bearing failure is bearing currents. Bearing currents in induction motors can be divided into two main categories; classical bearing currents and inverter-induced bearing currents. A bearing damage caused by bearing currents results, for instance, from electrical discharges that take place through the lubricant film between the raceways of the inner and the outer ring and the rolling elements of a bearing. This phenomenon can be considered similar to the one of electrical discharge machining, where material is removed by a series of rapidly recurring electrical arcing discharges between an electrode and a workpiece. This thesis concentrates on bearing currents with a special reference to bearing current detection in induction motors. A bearing current detection method based on radio frequency impulse reception and detection is studied. The thesis describes how a motor can work as a “spark gap” transmitter and discusses a discharge in a bearing as a source of radio frequency impulse. It is shown that a discharge, occurring due to bearing currents, can be detected at a distance of several meters from the motor. The issues of interference, detection, and location techniques are discussed. The applicability of the method is shown with a series of measurements with a specially constructed test motor and an unmodified frequency-converter-driven motor. The radio frequency method studied provides a nonintrusive method to detect harmful bearing currents in the drive system. If bearing current mitigation techniques are applied, their effectiveness can be immediately verified with the proposed method. The method also gives a tool to estimate the harmfulness of the bearing currents by making it possible to detect and locate individual discharges inside the bearings of electric motors...|$|R
40|$|Rotating {{machines}} serves {{an important}} role in many different applications. Extensive research has been made, manly during the last century, in order to develop these systems and understand the dynamics. The theory of rotordynamics differs in many fundamental aspects from structural dynamics and is therefore usually treated as an own research area. In rotordynamical applications there exist several qualitatively different concepts. For example super- and subcritical machines supported on different types of bearings like ball-, roller- or journal bearings etc. At the early stage of the product development, the problem is often to find a general tool which can be used for dynamical evaluation of these concepts. Many concepts also contain significant nonlinearities which need to be studied separately. One such nonlinearity is a clearance which arises between a fixed support and an axially movable bearing assembly. Another nonlinear effect is the loss of contact which can occur in preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings. The aim is hence to present a method to dynamically evaluate different rotordynamical concepts, describe nonlinear effects due to these contact problems and suggest suitable design parameters. For the concept evaluation a linear model which captured the gyroscopic effect is proposed, while the contact problems are handled with nonlinear models (usually piecewise linear). The governing equations of motion are solved analytically in the linear case but needs to be simulated in the nonlinear cases. However, in some special cases it is possible to find steady state solutions even for the contact problems. Simulations of design spaces, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, contact forces etc. have been used to study the systems. In order to evaluate different concept, design spaces spanned by a requirement variable and three design parameters are plotted. These are four dimensional plots where the variations of the requirement variables are visualised by colours. This is done both for the unbalance response and an impact in order to include both the homogenous and particular solution. In the clearance problem bifurcation diagrams and Poincaré maps indicates that multi-, quasi- or chaotic motions are possible which in many cases include impacts. When stabilising rods are applied the unstable areas (positive maximum Lyapunov exponent) are reduced. In the case with the spherical roller thrust bearings nonperiodic motions are found. The stability shows strong dependency on the amount of preload. A method to dynamically evaluate rotordynamical concepts is suggested. Some especially interesting ranges of the design parameters which give low vibrations are presented. It has further been shown that strong nonlinear dynamics which may lead to failure can be expected in systems with clearance between the <b>stator</b> and <b>bearing</b> assembly. One {{way to get rid of}} such unwanted vibrations is to apply stabilising rods. It is than important to choose the right parameters since otherwise worse conditions may occur. In systems supported by preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings it is important that the preloading is high enough. Otherwise jump phenomenon and nonperiodic motions can arise. An expression of the limit preload of going in or out of full contact has been derived which can be used to choose a suitable preloading. Godkänd; 2003; 20070215 (ysko...|$|R
