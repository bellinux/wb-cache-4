50|$|Threaded Stud - A {{threaded}} stud is a fastener {{consisting of a}} <b>shank</b> <b>portion</b> which is driven into the base material (and is therefore not visible after fastening) and a threaded portion (which remains visible after the fastening). An object is then attached to the threaded portion with a nut. The most common thread sizes are 1/4-20, and 3/8-16.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method used}} to {{decrease}} the stress concentration is by creating the fillet at the sharp edges. It gives smooth flow of stress streamlines. In a threaded component force flow line is bent as it passes from <b>shank</b> <b>portion</b> to threaded portion as a result stress concentration takes place. To reduce this a small undercut is taken between shank and threaded portion.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of any firm control point on the South Bank at the bridge alignment, the river had a {{tendency}} to shift towards the south. To regulate this tendency and to guide the flow of river within the waterway provided, a massive guide bund of 2 km length along with a 1.7 km approach bank was constructed after extensive hydrological studies. The Guide Bund has a 3 m launching apron made with G.I.Wire crates filled with man-size boulders. Its width varies from 78 m at mole head to 54 m in the <b>shank</b> <b>portion.</b> The total volume of work involved 820,000 m3 boulder work and 1.9 million m3-earth work using local river sand.|$|E
5000|$|Legs/hams: Although any cut of pork can be cured, {{technically}} {{speaking only}} the back leg {{is entitled to}} be called a ham. Legs and shoulders, when used fresh, are usually cut bone-in for roasting, or leg steaks can be cut from the bone. Three common cuts of the leg include the rump (upper <b>portion),</b> centre, and <b>shank</b> (lower <b>portion).</b>|$|R
50|$|The beef shank is the <b>shank</b> (or leg) <b>portion</b> of a steer or heifer. In Britain the {{corresponding}} cuts of beef are the shin (the foreshank), and the leg (the hindshank).|$|R
25|$|Commonly {{referred}} {{to parts of}} a fish hook are: its point - the sharp end that penetrates the fish's mouth or flesh; the barb - the projection extending backwards from the point, that secures the fish from unhooking; the eye - {{the end of the}} hook that is connected to the fishing line or lure; the bend and <b>shank</b> - that <b>portion</b> of the hook that connects the point and the eye; and the gap - the distance between the shank and the point. In many cases, hooks are described by using these various parts of the hook. Example: Wide gap, 2X Long Shank, Hollow Point, Turned Down Ring Eye Bait hook.|$|R
50|$|In production, a metal reed is {{inserted}} in {{each end of}} a glass tube {{and the end of}} the tube heated so that it seals around a <b>shank</b> <b>portion</b> on the reed. Green-colored Infrared-absorbing glass is frequently used, so an infrared heat source can concentrate the heat in the small sealing zone of the glass tube. The thermal coefficient of expansion of the glass material and metal parts must be similar to prevent breaking the glass-to-metal seal.The glass used must have a high electrical resistance and must not contain volatile components such as lead oxide and fluorides which can contaminate the contacts during the sealing operation. The leads of the switch must be handled carefully to prevent breaking the glass envelope. The glass envelope can be damaged if the reed switch is subjected to mechanical stress.|$|E

40|$|A CLEAR view of {{the vocal}} cords {{is not always easy}} to obtain, even for an {{experienced}} laryngologist. To demonstrate this to others is sometimes impossible. Anyone who teaches nose and throat work realizes the difficulties of demonstrating the vocal cords to students. To reflect light into the pharynx on to a mirror which has been previously warmed, held against the soft palate, and to get a clear picture of the vocal cords, requires endless practice. Various attachments have been made to place on the head mirror so that a number of students can see the image at the same time, but they are not entirely satisfactory. The examination of the larynx is such a routine procedure today, that we are apt to forget the difficulties of the early pioneers. In the history of laryngology, many sporadic attempts were made to reflect light into these darkened passages, but due to poor illumina-tion, very little progress was made. At the beginning of the last century (1807) Bozzini claimed to be able to inspect the various canals of the body, among them, the larynx. The illumination was supplied by means of a wax candle with a reflector behind it. In 1825, Cagniard de la Tour introduced into the back of his own throat a little mirror, hoping that by the aid of the rays of the sun and a second mirror, to see the epiglottis and even the glottis, but he was only partially successful. Senn, in 1827, tried to use a small mirror in the pharynx to see the parts below. He used no illumination and supposed his failure to be due to the small size of the mirror. In 1829, Benjamin Babbington presented to the Hunterian Society " an oblong piece of looking glass, set in silver wire with a long <b>shank.</b> The reflecting <b>portion</b> was held against the palate, whilst the tongue was held down with a spatula ". Some of the possibilities of such an instrument were appreciated by a London surgeon, who wrote in 1837, " by such a glass as is used by dentists, on a long stalk, previously dipped in hot water...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 5 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, May 1, 2009. Research completed at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, College of EngineeringThe adhesively bonded layered aluminum is used in aircraft structures to avoid knife edge situations when flush head fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. A 3 -D finite element model was used to estimate the location and magnitude of stress concentration under remote tension for aforementioned. The influence of the countersunk depth and adhesive properties on the stress concentration was investigated for a counter sunk angle of 100 º. The stress concentration {{was found to be}} maximum at the countersink edge for Eadh/Eal > 0. 1 whereas it is slightly below the countersink edge in straight <b>shank</b> <b>portion</b> for Eadh/Eal < 0. 1. Stress concentration was found to be minimum when the adhesive is positioned in the countersunk section...|$|E

40|$|A {{metallic}} threaded composite fastener, particularly {{suited for}} high temperature applications, has a body member made of {{high temperature resistant}} composite material with a ceramic coating. The body member has a head portion configured to be installed in a countersunk hole and a <b>shank</b> <b>portion</b> which is noncircular and tapered. One part of the shank may be noncircular and the other part tapered, or {{the two types of}} surface could be combined into a frustum of a noncircular cone. A split collar member made of high strength, high temperature tolerant metal alloy is split into two halves and the interior of the halves are configured to engage the shank. The exterior of the collar has a circumferential groove which receives a lock ring to secure the collar halves to the shank. In the assembled condition torque may be transmitted from the body to the split collar by the engaged noncircular portions to install and remove the fastener assembly into or from a threaded aperture and shear loads in the collar threads are transferred to the shank tapered portion as a combination of radial compression and axial tension loads. Thus, tension loads may be applied to the fastener shank without damaging the ceramic coating...|$|E
40|$|The Center for International Rehabilitation (CIR) has {{programs}} {{all over}} the world to provide people in developing countries with the training and equipment they need to supply prosthetic devices to local landmine victims. CIR has created a monolimb, which is a lower limb prosthesis where the socket and shank are molded from a single piece of thermoplastic material. The monolimb can be fabricated on-site with minimal equipment at a low-cost. The <b>shank</b> <b>portion</b> of the device, which replaces the tibial region of the leg, was investigated through a finite element analysis computer program, COSMOSWorks. The current prosthetic device utilized by CIR uses a hollow, cylindrical shape with a rib on the posterior side as the overall shank design. This study combined varying circular outer diameters and rib lengths to determine which combination of parameters contributed to lower overall von Mises stresses and minimal displacement. Four hollow elliptical cross sectional shapes of different minor and major diameters were also modeled and compared to the results of the circular parameter study. The models were input into COSMOSWorks to perform a static analysis on each of the models and the results were displayed through contour plots. The output for each model was analyzed and compared to determine the maximum stresses and overall stress distributions. The displacement present was examined, paying particular attention to the flexibility across the shank, as the displacement can mimic that of natural ankle movement. The ISO Test Standard 10328, which details the necessary structural testing for lower limb prostheses, was used as the basis for testing. The final results compared the overall stress distributions and displacement of each of the models in COSMOSWorks to determine which shape would best withstand the ISO Test Standard 10328 specified load. The results determined that an increase in diameter and rib length positively influences the von Mises stress results and displacement by decreasing their values throughout the shank...|$|E
