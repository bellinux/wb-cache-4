5000|$|Social ecology is a {{critical}} social theory founded by [...] American anarchist and libertarian socialist author Murray Bookchin. Conceptualized as a critique of current social, political, and anti-ecological trends, it espouses a reconstructive, ecological, communitarian, and ethical approach to society. This version advocates a reconstructive and transformative outlook on social and environmental issues, and promotes a directly democratic, confederal politics. As a body of ideas, social ecology envisions a moral economy that moves beyond scarcity and hierarchy, toward a world that reharmonizes human communities with the natural world, while celebrating diversity, creativity and freedom. Bookchin suggests that the roots of current ecological and social problems {{can be traced to}} hierarchical modes of social organization. Social ecologists claim that the <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> of hierarchy cannot be resisted by individual actions alone such as ethical consumerism but must be addressed by more nuanced ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in radically democratic ideals. The complexity of relationships between people and nature is emphasized, along with the importance of establishing more mutualistic social structures that take account of this.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} efforts to foster global {{economic}} governance have been a longstanding issue of global economic policies, their effectiveness has been questioned by the current crisis.

Based on an analysis of basic <b>systemic</b> <b>issues</b> of global trade and finance, the aim {{of this paper is to}} explore whether the current crisis leads to fostering supranational features in global economic governance. The issue is first studied at the theoretical level the outcomes of which are subsequently applied to recent evolutions in global governance, which seems to be the most appropriate level to face global <b>systemic</b> <b>issues.</b> According to the authors, more supranational features should be reflected namely in a more effective and intensive coordination of macroeconomic policies of systemically important countries in order to keep the global economic system stable. In the conclusion, the authors try to make a specific recommendation for the eventuality that the hypothesis on stronger supranational coordination cannot be fully confirmed.

40|$|Literature on {{the factors}} which {{precipitate}} {{the use of}} seclusion and restraint on mental health consumers is typically confined to their behaviour and/or the behaviour and attitudes of the involved clinical staff. These understandings do not sufficiently take account of workplace cultural factors and political influences within a societal context of prejudice against people with mental illness. The elimination of coercive and restrictive clinical practices is called for by mental health carer forums, national and state level mental health reports and policies, and concerned mental health clinicians. The authors argue this will require radical change by all staff {{in the mental health}} system as violence is a <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> which creates a culture where clinical practices are prone to reinforcing this systemic violence.

There {{was no evidence that}} the gap results from Black Caribbean pupils attending less effective schools. There is also no evidence of differential effectiveness in relation to ethnic group; schools that were strong in facilitating the progress of White British pupils were equally strong in facilitating the progress of Black Caribbean pupils. There was some evidence of differential school effectiveness by pupil prior attainment, gender and poverty, but the absolute size of the effects were small. The results suggest the poor progress of Black Caribbean pupils reflects a <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> rather than the influence of a small number of ‘low quality’ schools...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} mainstream news media texts reporting {{sexual harassment in}} four industrialized countries. The study first identifies the aspects of sexual harassment cases considered newsworthy by asking how the media texts characterize such cases. Second, the study illuminates the discourses evident in these texts, which are theorized as a mode by which understandings of workplace gender (in) equality shape, and are shaped by, individuals, organizations and the community. The analysis reveals that the media most frequently reports "classic" sexual harassment and emphasizes scandalous allegations and overtly sexualized conduct. The hegemony of a discourse of sexual harassment as an individualized problem of inappropriate employee behavior is also evident. By contrast, discourses presenting sexual harassment as a <b>systemic</b> <b>issue,</b> or as symptomatic of broader gender inequality, are less frequent. We argue that these media representations limit opportunities to frame sexual harassment as dynamic, complex, {{and part of the}} practice of gendering in and beyond organizational boundarie...|$|E
40|$|This paper characterises some of {{the main}} issues confronting water-catchment {{managing}} in a climate-changing world and addresses wide-spread concerns about the lack of connectivity between science, policy making and implementation. The paper’s arguments are ‘framed’ within a paradigm of systemic and adaptive governing, regulating, planning and managing understood as a nested systemic hierarchy. It is argued that climate change adaptation is best understood as a coevolutionary dynamic, principally, but not exclusively between human beings and the biophysical world. Two forms of ‘knowledge brokerage’ based on mode 1 (knowledge) and mode 2 (knowing) are distinguished with practical implications. Drawing on extensive research by the authors, eight modalities for enacting ‘knowledge brokerage’ are introduced. The conditions for or against success in employing these modalities are described. Consistent with the views of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4 th Report 2007, it is argued that water managing is a paradigmatic domain for making climate change adaptation ‘real’ and a <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> of global concern at the core of sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|White noise {{occurs in}} the thinking, {{decision}} making and communication of dominant Settler cultures. It inhibits clear reception of messages, somewhat like the indistinct, fuzzy static of an un-tuned radio. As much a <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> as an individual one, it results from assumed privilege and {{lack of knowledge of}} worldviews other than the dominant. Until white noise is acknowledged, development of partnerships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups is likely to be limited by having to continually start at a point of inequality where nonIndigenous gaps in knowledge and understanding remain unrecognised.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to balance a career, marriage, and children? Most academics or aspiring academics ask themselves this question at many points in their career. In their book Do Babies Matter? Gender and Family in the Ivory Tower, Mary Ann Mason, Nicholas Wolfinger, and Marc Goulden review the data to expose the difficulties of maintaining a career and a family. They also provide in the final chapter (Chapter 6) {{suggestions on how to}} make the academy a more family-friendly place. The authors begin with reviewing data on the early years of graduate school and the postdoctoral years, and they carry their discussion through to the retirement years. Throughout this trajectory, the effects of marriage and children on a successful academic career are assessed. Do Babies Matter? gives voice to an issue that is often discussed in secret or apprehensively. Rather than the work–family balance being an issue of time management or nagging self-doubt, the book highlights the larger <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> perpetuated by a faulty system. The authors give a nuanced account of how marriage and children affect genders differentially and fields of study differentially (humanities vs. sciences). They also point ou...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDirect {{gradient}} analyses in spatial genetics provide unique {{opportunities to}} describe the inherent complexity of genetic variation in wildlife species and are the object of many methodological developments. However, multicollinearity among explanatory variables is a <b>systemic</b> <b>issue</b> in multivariate regression analyses {{and is likely to}} cause serious difficulties in properly interpreting results of direct gradient analyses, with the risk of erroneous conclusions, misdirected research and inefficient or counterproductive conservation measures. Using simulated data sets along with linear and logistic regressions on distance matrices, we illustrate how commonality analysis (CA), a detailed variance-partitioning procedure that was recently introduced in the field of ecology, can be used to deal with nonindependence among spatial predictors. By decomposing model fit indices into unique and common (or shared) variance components, CA allows identifying the location and magnitude of multicollinearity, revealing spurious correlations and thus thoroughly improving the interpretation of multivariate regressions. Despite a few nherent limitations, {{especially in the case of}} resistance model optimization, this review highlights the great potential of CA to account for complex multicollinearity patterns in spatial genetics and identifies future applications and lines of research. We strongly urge spatial geneticists to systematically investigate commonalities when performing direct gradient analyses...|$|E
