40|$|The {{design and}} {{generation}} of an optimal expression construct {{is the first}} and essential step in in the characterization of a protein of interest. Besides evaluation and optimization of process parameters (e. g. selection of the best expression host or cell line and optimal induction conditions and time points), {{the design of the}} expression construct itself has a major impact. However, the path to this final expression construct is often not straight forward and includes multiple learning cycles accompanied by design variations and retesting of construct variants, since multiple, functional DNA sequences of the expression vector backbone, either coding or non-coding, can {{have a major impact on}} expression yields. To streamline the generation of defined expression constructs of otherwise difficult to express proteins, the Modular Protein Expression Toolbox (MoPET) has been developed. This cloning platform allows highly efficient DNA assembly of pre-defined, <b>standardized</b> <b>functional</b> DNA <b>modules</b> with a minimal cloning burden. Combining these features with a standardized cloning strategy facilitates the identification of optimized DNA expression constructs in shorter time. The MoPET system currently consists of 53 defined DNA modules divided into eight functional classes and can be flexibly expanded. However, already with the initial set of modules, 792, 000 different constructs can be rationally designed and assembled. Furthermore, this starting set was used to generate small and mid-sized combinatorial expression optimization libraries. Applying this screening approach, variants with up to 60 -fold expression improvement have been identified by MoPET variant library screening...|$|R
40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>modules</b> are {{considered}} the primary building blocks of biomolecular systems. Here we study to what extent <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> behave cohesively across genomes:That is, are <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> also evolutionary modules? We probe this question by analyzing for a large collection of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> the phyletic patterns of their genes across 110 genomes. The majority of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> display limited evolutionary modularity. This result confirms certain comparative genome analyses, but {{is in contrast to}} implicit assumptions in the systems analysis of functional genomics data. We show that this apparent interspecies flexibility in the organization of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> depends more on functional differentiation within orthologous groups of genes, than on noise in the <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> definitions. When filtering out these sources of nonmodularity, even though very few <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> behave perfectly modular in evolution, about half behave at least significantly more modular than a random set of genes. There are substantial differences in the evolutionary modularity between individual <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> as well as between collections of <b>functional</b> <b>modules,</b> partly corresponding to conceptual differences in the <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> definition, which make comparisons between <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> collections biologically difficult to interpret. Analysis within one collection does not suffer from such differences, and we show that within the EcoCyc metabolic pathway database, biosynthetic pathways are evolutionarily more modular than catabolic pathways...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Identification {{of protein}} {{complexes}} and <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks {{is crucial to}} understanding the principles of cellular organization and predicting protein functions. In the past few years, many computational methods have been proposed. However, most of them considered the PPI networks as static graphs and overlooked the dynamics inherent within these networks. Moreover, few of them can distinguish between protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules.</b> Results In this paper, a new framework is proposed to distinguish between protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> by integrating gene expression data into protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. A series of time-sequenced subnetworks (TSNs) is constructed according to {{the time that the}} interactions were activated. The algorithm TSN-PCD was then developed to identify protein complexes from these TSNs. As protein complexes are significantly related to <b>functional</b> <b>modules,</b> a new algorithm DFM-CIN is proposed to discover <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> based on the identified complexes. The experimental results show that the combination of temporal gene expression data with PPI data contributes to identifying protein complexes more precisely. A quantitative comparison based on f-measure reveals that our algorithm TSN-PCD outperforms the other previous protein complex discovery algorithms. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> by using “Biological Process” annotated in GO (Gene Ontology). The validation shows that the identified <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> are statistically significant in terms of “Biological Process”. More importantly, the relationship between protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> are studied. Conclusions The proposed framework based on the integration of PPI data and gene expression data makes it possible to identify protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> more effectively. Moveover, the proposed new framework and algorithms can distinguish between protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules.</b> Our findings suggest that <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> are closely related to protein complexes and a <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> may consist of one or multiple protein complexes.

Results We aimed to detect composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> containing co-transcriptional regulation interaction, and protein-protein interaction, in our pre-constructed integrated network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We computationally extracted 15 composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules,</b> and found structural consistency between co-transcriptional regulation interaction sub-network and protein-protein interaction sub-network that was well correlated with their functional hierarchy. This type of composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> was compact in structure, and was found to participate in essential cell processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and RNA splicing.

40|$|Proteins {{are known}} to {{interact}} with each other to perform specific living organism functions by forming <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> or protein complexes. Many community detection methods have been devised for the discovery of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> or protein complexes in protein interaction networks. One common problem in current agglomerative community detection approaches is that vertices with just one neighbor are often classified as separated clusters, which does not make sense for module or complex identification. In this thesis, we propose a new agglomerative algorithm, FAC-PIN, based on a local premetric of relative vertex-to-vertex clustering value. Our proposed FAC-PIN method is applied to PINs from different species for validating <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> and protein complexes generated from FAC-PIN with experimentally verified <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> and complexes respectively.

The {{molecular}} profiles {{exhibited in}} different cancer types are very different; hence, discovering distinct <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> associated with specific cancer types {{is very important}} to understand the distinct functions associated with them. Protein-protein interaction networks carry vital information about molecular interactions in cellular systems, and identification of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> (subgraphs) in these networks {{is one of the most}} important applications of biological network analysis. Results. In this study, we developed a new graph theory based method to identify distinct <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> from nine different cancer protein-protein interaction networks. The method is composed of three major steps: (i) extracting modules from protein-protein interaction networks using network clustering algorithms; (ii) identifying distinct subgraphs from the derived modules; and (iii) identifying distinct subgraph patterns from distinct subgraphs. The subgraph patterns were evaluated using experimentally determined cancer-specific protein-protein interaction data from the Ingenuity knowledgebase, to identify distinct <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> that are specific to each cancer type.

We define orthologous groups on 34 eukaryotic genomes and measure the extent of cohesive evolution of sets of orthologous groups of which members constitute a known complex or pathway. Within this framework it appears that most <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> evolve flexibly rather than cohesively.

40|$|Abstract Background In the literature, {{there are}} {{fruitful}} algorithmic approaches for identification <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> in protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks. Because of accumulation of large-scale interaction data on multiple organisms and non-recording interaction {{data in the}} existing PPI database, it is still emergent to design novel computational techniques that can be able to correctly and scalably analyze interaction data sets. Indeed {{there are a number}} of large scale biological data sets providing indirect evidence for protein-protein interaction relationships. Results The main aim of this paper is to present a prior knowledge based mining strategy to identify <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> from PPI networks with the aid of Gene Ontology. Higher similarity value in Gene Ontology means that two gene products are more functionally related to each other, so it is better to group such gene products into one <b>functional</b> <b>module.</b> We study (i) to encode the functional pairs into the existing PPI networks; and (ii) to use these functional pairs as pairwise constraints to supervise the existing <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> identification algorithms.

We then apply a threshold-based clustering algorithm to this gene network, and obtain modules for each of which the number of genes is bounded from above by a pre-specified value and the component genes are more strongly functionally related to each other than genes across the predicted modules.

The Mechatronics education aim is to raise this knowledge to the level at which a non-EE graduate can confidently perform the interfacing of mechanical, electrical, electronics, and microcontroller subsystems in an overall design. To address this need, the University of South Carolina has embarked upon an NSF-funded project to enhance the Mechatronics education of non-EE engineering students. Part of this project is the development of a suit of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> that address the teaching of essential interfacing functions.

Therefore, the reference vector units of the conventional SOM are replaced {{by a set of}} neural network modules in the mnSOM. If one employes multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as the <b>functional</b> <b>modules,</b> then the mnSOM becomes an SOM in function space, while RNN-module-mnSOM makes a map of nonlinear dynamical systems.

This is useful information to understand how biological systems work. Therefore, detecting <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> is an important research topic in the post-genome era. One of <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> detecting methods is to find dense regions in Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks.

40|$|Classically, the {{functional}} consequences {{of natural selection}} over genomes have been analyzed as the compound effects of individual genes.

This approach, which assumed independence among genes, {{has not been able to}} identify biological functions significantly enriched in positively selected genes in individual species. Alternatively, pooling related species has enhanced the search for signatures of selection. However, grouping signatures does not allow testing for adaptive differences between species.
