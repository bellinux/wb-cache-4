25|$|To {{investigate}} {{the salience of}} religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some {{studies have shown that}} greater religious attitudes may be <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} Fischer and Born, 2009, {{previous}} knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks {{that would have to}} be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.|$|E

Interestingly, and unlike other ethnic groups, Native Americans appear to have an increasing frequency of coronary heart disease, possibly related to the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes in these communities. Although total and LDL-cholesterol levels are lower than the U.S. average, importance of LDL cholesterol as a contributor to CHD in this group should not be underestimated. Moreover, {{because of the high}} frequency of type 2 diabetes, many Native Americans will have an even lower LDL goal.

This project aimed to assess the effects of socio-demographic and clinical variables on {{quality of life and}} to identify its predictors. In a cross-sectional paper-based study, 50 consecutive non-selected patients attending the teaching hospital completed a disease-specific McMaster quality of life tool. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from patients’ records. The t-test and Mann–Whitney test were used to determine the probability of significant differences between quality of life domains and independent variables. Multiple linear regression was used to determine quality of life predictors. Younger and highly educated patients had higher social scores. Those with shorter disease durations had higher systemic scores. Patients in remission had higher systemic, social, bowel and overall scores. Relapse was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of decreased systemic, social, bowel and overall scores. Long disease duration was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of decreased systemic and overall scores. Younger age at disease onset was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of decreased emotional score. However, high education was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of improved social score. Relapse, long disease duration, low education and young age at disease onset were associated with low quality of life.

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} the relationship between motor performance; attentional, hyperactive, and impulsive symptoms; and social problems. Correlations between parents' versus teachers' ratings of social problems and ADHD symptomatology were also examined. Method: A total of 129 children aged 9 to 12 years were included.

Results: After controlling for ADHD symptomatology, motor skills remained a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of social problems in the teacher model but not in the parent model. After controlling for motor skills, inattentive (not hyperactive-impulsive) symptoms were a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of social problems in the parent model, whereas hyperactive-impulsive (not inattentive) symptoms were a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of social problems in the teacher model.
