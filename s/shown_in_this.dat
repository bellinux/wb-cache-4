5|$|Beginning on January 23, 2015, {{the last}} two episodes of season four were shown in 205 IMAX theaters across the United States; Game of Thrones is the first TV series <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> format. The show earned $686,000 {{at the box office}} on its opening day and $1.5 million during its opening weekend; the week-long release grossed $1,896,092.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the video}} {{has also become}} {{widespread}} {{on the internet and}} was featured in the animal welfare documentary Earthlings, though the method of killing dolphins as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> video is now officially banned. In 2009, a critical documentary on the hunts in Japan titled The Cove was released and shown amongst others at the Sundance Film Festival. Well known are also the images from Iki Island taken in 1979 of a Japanese fisherman stabbing dolphins to death with spears in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{versions}} of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the Making the Video version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance.|$|E

5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E

25|$|Though {{some critics}} have argued against the series being <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> format, {{programme}} makers and commentators defended their decision by saying that Dickens's writings were long, complex, very popular stories told over {{a series of small}} installments, just like a soap-opera and claiming that if he had been alive in 2005 he would have been writing for big signature dramas. Bleak House was indeed originally published in monthly installments, with cliffhangers used to maintain the continuing interest of the readership.|$|E
