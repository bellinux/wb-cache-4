Allen did, however, take <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> lasting from the show: one of the show's chorus girls, Portland Hoffa, who became his wife in 1927 and remained with him until his death.|$|E

The record was praised by several publications as being the band's finest work: Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as their definitive record; a writer for Entertainment Weekly called it their [...] "most potent effort yet", and April Long of NME said it was [...] "by far the best thing Manson has ever set his warped mind to, [...] ultimately inspires <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> potent than fear or hatred—respect." ...|$|E

Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted {{that there may be}} something more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding.

[...] Moore explained {{what he saw as}} the highs and lows: [...] "Brad Anderson turns this...serial-killer hunt...into a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Given...a half-decent tale of horror, guilt, problem-solving and redemption, Anderson couldn't go far wrong," [...] but, Moore states, [...] "It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine puts down the phone and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> generic and far less exciting." [...] The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review: [...] "The semi-fresh thriller, set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles, puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup.

5000|$|Fanfan {{received}} mixed reviews. In {{his review}} in Films de France, James Travers {{found the first}} half of the film [...] "unconvincing and painfully superficial in places," [...] but thought the film improved significantly in the second half: Compelling performances from Vincent Perez and Sophie Marceau transform what looks at first like a routine romantic comedy into <b>something</b> <b>far</b> richer, <b>far</b> <b>more</b> compassionate. The second part of the film also contains some moments of artistic brilliance, notably the Cocteau-esque sequence in which the two lovers attempt to make contact through a mirrored partition. Although there are a few unexplained gaps in the narrative—some more back story about Alexandre might have helped—writer-director Alexandre Jardin succeeds in weaving a tender love story that is both original and hauntingly poetic.|$|R

[...] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times noted, [...] "What left the deepest impression was <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> elemental: Beyoncé's {{ability to make}} self-aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility... ambition seemed in proportion with her fans' expectations; she came by the sense of scale honestly." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as [...] "nothing short of breathtaking, making awesome and repeated use of silhouette, of great white blocks of video screens, of live dancers interacting with video". She praised the singer's [...] "fierce" [...] tireless dancing and concluded, [...] "But for all the hauteur here, in couture and bearing, Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range." [...] Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph found [...] "air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony... of an expensive revue show" [...] in the concert. Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music, McNulty concluded: [...] "Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch, and often blistering in her vocal attack".|$|E
500|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is {{considered}} one of the greatest—and most controversial—of horror films, and a major influence on the genre. In 1999 Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had [...] "set a new standard for slasher films". The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as [...] "cheap, grubby and out of control", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it [...] "both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture". In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it [...] "the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity." [...] According to Bill Nichols, it [...] "achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal". Leonard Wolf praised the film as [...] "...an exquisite work of art" [...] and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.|$|E

Clay, who [...] "felt betrayed by Less Than Zero", uses Imperial Bedrooms to make a stand or a case for himself, though {{ultimately}} [...] "reveals himself to be far worse than the author of Less Than Zero ever began to hint at." [...] Clay still bears similarities to the earlier character in Less Than Zero; according to one reviewer, [...] "not all that much is changed. Clay is a cipher, an empty shell who is only able to approximate interactions and experiences through acts of sadism and exploitation." [...] He is also, in many ways, a new character, because {{the opening of the}} book presents that the Clay of Less Than Zero had merely been [...] "just a writer pretending to be him". When asked why he [...] "changed" [...] Clay from [...] "passive" [...] to [...] "guilty", Ellis explained he felt Clay's inaction in the original novel made him equally as guilty; it had [...] "always bothered" [...] Ellis that Clay didn't do anything to save the little girl being raped in the first novel. The Independent notes [...] "his passivity [...] has hardened into <b>something</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> culpable, and nefarious." [...] According to Ellis, [...] "In LA, over time, the real person you are ultimately comes out." [...] He also speculates [...] "maybe the fear turned him into a monster". Ellis remarks that he finds the developments in Clay [...] "so exciting". One reviewer summarized the character's development, [...] "The nascent narcissist of Less Than Zero... is now left in a [...] "dead end".

Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one's [...] "own nature." [...] The Knowledge includes four meditation procedures: Light, Music, Nectar and Word. The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full." [...] Supporters said there is no conflict between worldly and spiritual riches, and that Rawat did not advise anyone to [...] "abandon the material world", but said it is our attachment to it that is wrong. Press reports listed expensive automobiles such as Rolls-Royces, Mercedes-Benz limousines and sports cars, some of them gifts.

The superiority of the right caused it early to be regarded as the fortunate, lucky, and trusty hand; the inferiority of the left caused it equally to be considered as ill-omened, unlucky, and, in one expressive word, sinister. Hence come innumerable phrases and superstitions. It is the right hand of friendship that we always grasp; it is with our own right hand that we vindicate our honour against sinister suspicions. On the other hand, it is 'over the left' that we believe a doubtful or incredible statement; a left-handed compliment or a left-handed marriage carry their own condemnation with them. On the right hand of the host is the seat of honour; it is to the left that the goats of ecclesiastical controversy are invariably relegated.
