50|$|The {{asynchronous}} <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> <b>protocol</b> is asynchronous on the byte level, but plesiochronous on the bit level. The receiver detects {{the start}} of a byte by detecting a transition that may occur at a random time after the preceding byte. The indefinite wait and lack of external synchronizaton signals makes byte detection asynchronous. Then the receiver samples at predefined intervals to determine the values of the bits in the byte; this is plesiochronous since it depends on the transmitter to transmit at roughly the same rate the receiver expects, without coordination of the rate while the bits are being transmitted.|$|E

Bidirectional functions provide flexibility for <b>serial</b> <b>Communication.</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Communication</b> Ports can operate at half the full clock rate at the processor,at a maximum data rate of n/ 2 Mbps,where n-equals the processor core clock frequency. The most common use of S-PORT is to interconnect two processors in a multiprocessor system. These interface devices can be operated in the synchronous mode. S-PORT can transfer a frame of data with three or thirty two bits per transmission. For serial communications there are different types of cables used such as UARTS, RS 232 cable, I 2 C bus but {{the time required to}} transmit and receive through these cables {{takes a lot of time}} like 11 kbps but these days the the speed is the most important in every aspect.

This technical report documents the design process of a serial transmitter with amplitude, pre-emphasis and programmable impedance coupling, the topology used for this implementation is the segmented self-series terminated transmitters (SSSTT) which manage the functions just described above, it does this efficiently, with low area use and lower power consumption than other conventional structures. The technology used is IBM 180 nm CMOS technology (process IBM cmrf 7 sf) with MOSIS license.
