The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving <b>soil</b> fertility, <b>tilth,</b> and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|R
40|$|Walking {{around on}} a {{perfectly}} manicured golf course, it's easy to forget most of the plant is below ground. It almost {{goes without saying that}} proper soil management is vital in turf management. The best kind of soil structure for plant growth is granular structure, which resembles cookie crumbs and is usually less than 0. 5 centimeter in diameter. One important soil property that can be easily overlooked is <b>soil</b> structure or <b>tilth.</b> <b>Soil</b> structure refers to the spatial arrangement of soil particles. These aggregates form through physical, chemical and biological processes, which will greatly influence soil quality (Brady and Weil, 2008). Good soil structure is a hallmark of healthy soil. If soils are healthy, then healthy turf can follow. An easy way to determine soil structure quality is to collect surface soil between 5 centimeters (cm) and 10 cm deep. Gently toss the soil in {{the palm of your hand}} to break up the soil. Take a representative soil clod and gently try to break it apart. If the clod breaks or fractures along a plane, it means you have some structure. If the clod tears apart, then it's a clear indication you have very poor or no structure...|$|R

50|$|Mycorrhizae are “fungus roots”, a mutualistic {{association}} between a fungus (Myco) such as Aspergillus oryzae and plant roots (rhiza). This provides an interface between plants and soil. The fungus grows into {{the roots of}} crops {{and out into the}} soil, increasing the root system many thousand-fold. The fungus use their enzymes to convert soil nutrients into a form that crops can use and turn plant carbohydrates into soil amendments, “sequestering” carbon. Miles of mycorrhizae {{can be found in a}} single ounce of soil. Mycorrhizal soil inoculation increases soil carbon accumulation by depositing glomalin, which increases soil structure by binding organic matter to mineral particles. Glomalin gives <b>soil</b> its <b>tilth</b> (texture), buoyancy and water absorption ability. Biochar (charcoal) shelters mycorrhizae in myriad, tiny holes. Other mycorrhizaeal impacts include enhanced water uptake, reduced water needs (increased drought resistance), increased pathogen resistance and overall increased plant vigor.|$|R
40|$|Although some soil {{microorganisms}} cause plant diseases, most soil inhabitants are beneficial to crop {{production and the}} environment through processes like the fixing and cycling of nitrogen, biological pest control, formation and maintenance of <b>soil</b> structure (<b>tilth),</b> and degradation of agrochemicals and pollutants. This paper discusses the distribution of these organisms in prairie soils {{and how they are}} affected by soil and crop management practices. The discussion includes soil fauna and microorganisms, and singles out three groups of microorganisms that are particularly important in crop production: arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, dark septate root inhabiting fungi, and rhizobia. The development of healthy diverse faunal and microbial communities in soil can be fostered by using soil management practices or systems like conservation tillage, crop rotation, proper nutrient management and application of organic manures when available.

40|$|Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) is a {{traditional}} medicinal plant in China. This study aimed to investigate the relation between salt tolerance mechanism in honeysuckle and phytodesalination of saline soil through field trial. In April, 2014, honeysuckle plants were transplanted to non-saline and moderate saline plots. Six months later, Na+ concentration, Na+ adsorption ratio and electrical conductance in <b>tilth</b> <b>soil</b> were significantly lowered by honeysuckle in moderate saline plots, suggesting that saline soil was desalinized. Due to the inhibition on plant growth, the estimated phytodesalination capacity by shoot Na+ accumulation was only 8. 71 kg Na+ ha 1, which seemed very limited compared with succulent halophytes. Therefore, soil desalination by honeysuckle should depend on Na+ leaching rather than shoot Na+ accumulation. Respiration rate and Na+ extrusion in roots were elevated by salinity, and they were significantly and positively correlated, indicating the importance of root respiration for resisting Na+ uptake. The elevated root respiration might aid in dissolving calcite by releasing more CO 2 into soil, and consistently, Ca 2 + concentration in <b>tilth</b> <b>soil</b> was remarkably increased by honeysuckle in moderate saline plots in contrast to no significant change in non-saline plots. As a result, Na+ leaching could be facilitated, as Na+ at the exchange site would be efficiently replaced by Ca 2 +. In conclusion, salt-induced elevation of root respiration enhanced salt resistance of honeysuckle by increasing Na+ extrusion and could assist in desalinizing saline soil by improving Na+ leaching.

5000|$|Rototiller: The small {{rototiller}} {{is typically}} propelled forward via a (1-5 horsepower or 0.8-3.5 kilowatts) petrol engine rotating the tines, {{and do not}} have powered wheels, though they may have small transport/level control wheel(s). To keep the machine from moving forward too fast, an adjustable tine is usually fixed just behind the blades so that through friction with deeper un-tilled soil, it acts as a brake, slowing the machine and allowing it to pulverize the soils. The slower a rototiller moves forward, the more <b>soil</b> <b>tilth</b> can be obtained. The operator can control the amount of friction/braking action by raising and lowering the handlebars of the tiller. Rototillers often do not have a reverse as such backwards movement towards the operator could cause serious injury. While operating, the rototiller can be pulled backwards to go over areas that were not pulverized enough, but care must be taken to ensure that the operator does not stumble and pull the rototiller on top of himself. Rototilling is much faster than manual tilling, but notoriously difficult to handle and exhausting work, especially in the heavier and higher horsepower models. If the rototiller's blades catch on unseen subsurface objects, such as tree roots and buried garbage, it can cause the rototiller to abruptly and violently move in any direction.|$|E

40|$|A mulch is any {{material}} {{applied to the}} soil surface for protection or improvement of the area covered. Mulches are frequently applied around plants to modify the soil environment and enhance plant growth. The mulch material may be organic such as bark, wood chips, leaves, pine needles, grass clippings or similar material; or inorganic such as gravel, pebbles, polyethylene film or woven ground cloth. BENEFITS OF MULCHING Mulching has the following beneficial effects upon the soil and plants. Mulches can prevent loss {{of water from the}} soil by evaporation. Moisture moves by capillary action to the surface and evaporates if the soil is not covered by a mulch. Mulches suppress weeds when the mulch material itself is weed-free and applied deeply enough to prevent weed germination or to smother existing small weeds. A more uniform soil temperature can be maintained by mulching. The mulch acts as an insulator that keeps the soil cool under intense sunlight and warm during cold weather. Mulching will prevent crusting of the soil surface, thus improving absorption and percolation of water into the soil and, at the same time, reducing erosion. Organic materials used as a mulch can improve <b>soil</b> structure and <b>tilth.</b> As mulch decays, the material becomes topsoil. Decaying mulch may also add nutrients to the soil. Mulches also add to the beauty of the landscape by providing a cover of uniform color and interesting texture to the surface. Mulched plants will produce roots in the mulch that surrounds them. These roots are produced in addition to the roots that a plant produces in the soil. As a result, mulched plants have more roots than unmulched plants...|$|R
