In order to understand and compare cities' climate targets, {{there is a need for}} a generic and comprehensive framework of key methodological considerations. This paper identifies eight key methodological considerations for the different choices that can be made when setting targets for GHG emissions in a city and arranges them in four categories: temporal scope of target, object for target <b>setting,</b> <b>unit</b> of target, and range of target. To explore how target setting is carried out in practice, the climate targets of eight European cities were analysed. The results showed that these targets cover only a limited part of what could be included. Moreover, the cities showed quite limited awareness of what is, or could be, include in the targets. This makes comparison and benchmarking between cities difficult. QC 20131205 TeleSy - Telecommunicators' work in the sustainable cit...|$|E
40|$|A price-setting {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate whether a proposed governmental subsidy system to reduce sales and production of environmentally harmful products would maintain competition, as required by EU regulations. Dyads of participants {{played the role of}} producers, independently <b>setting</b> <b>unit</b> prices for their products in a sequence of trials with feedback. In experimental conditions a subsidy was paid for unsold units, a system which had previously been found to raise prices and reduce the number of units sold. For half of the dyads in each condition the payoffs were individual, in the other half they were split equally to motivate cooperation. Substantiating that the subsidy did not eliminate competition, the prices were set lower and incomes were lower when the payoffs were individual than when they were split equally. The participants also adjusted their prices to increase their own payoff, taking into account the prices set by the others when the payoffs were individual—which they did not when the payoffs were split equally. The results support the claim that the proposed subsidy system is effective in raising prices so that sales and production of environmentally harmful products can be reduced without eliminating competition. ...|$|E

40|$|To help {{meet our}} nation’s energy needs, {{reprocessing}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} is being considered {{more and more as}} a necessary step in a future nuclear fuel cycle, but incorporating this step into the fuel cycle will require considerable investment. This report presents an evaluation of financing scenarios for reprocessing facilities integrated into the nuclear fuel cycle. A range of options, from fully government owned to fully private owned, was evaluated using a DPL (Dynamic Programming Language) 6. 0 model, which can systematically optimize outcomes based on user-defined criteria (e. g., lowest life-cycle cost, lowest unit cost). Though all business decisions follow similar logic with regard to financing, reprocessing facilities are an exception due to the range of financing options available. The evaluation concludes that lowest unit costs and lifetime costs follow a fully government-owned financing strategy, due to government forgiveness of debt as sunk costs. Other financing arrangements, however, including regulated utility ownership and a hybrid ownership scheme, led to acceptable costs, below the Nuclear Energy Agency published estimates. Overwhelmingly, uncertainty in annual capacity led to the greatest fluctuations in unit costs necessary for recovery of operating and capital expenditures; the ability to determine annual capacity will be a driving factor in <b>setting</b> <b>unit</b> costs. For private ventures, the costs of capital, especially equity interest rates, dominate the balance sheet; the annual operating costs dominate the government case.

40|$|Background. Robotics {{and related}} {{technologies}} are realizing their promise {{to improve the}} delivery of rehabilitation therapy but the mechanism by which they enhance recovery is still unknown. The electromechanical-driven gait orthosis Lokomat has demonstrated its utility for gait rehabilitation after stroke. Aim. To test the efficacy of Lokomat in gait retraining and to investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the recovery process. Design. Case series study. <b>Setting.</b> <b>Unit</b> of Neurorehabilitation of a University Hospital. Population. Fifteen patients with post-stroke hemiparesis. Methods. Patients underwent a six weeks rehabilitative treatment provided by Lokomat. The outcome measures were: Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale (FMMS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 10 metres Walking Test (10 mWT), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), 6 Minute Walking Test (6 MWT). Strength and Motor Unit firing rate of vastus medialis (VM) were analyzed during isometric knee extension through an isokinetic dynamometer and surface EMG recording. Results. An increase of duration and covered distance, a decrease of body weight support and guidance force on the paretic side along the sessions were observed. The FMMS, the BBS, the TUG and the 6 MWT demonstrated a significant improvement after the training. No increase of force was observed whereas a significant increase of firing rate of VM was recorded. Conclusion. The evidence that the improvement of walking ability observed in our study determines a significant increase of firing rate of VM not accompanied by an increase of force could suggest an effect of training on motorneuronal firing rate that thus contributes to improve motor control. Clinical Rehabilitation Impact. Given the current wide use of robotics in gait retraining after stroke, our approach can contribute to clarify the mechanisms underlying its rehabilitative impact so as to incorporate the findings of evidence-based practice into appropriate treatment plans for persons poststroke...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{technology}} and {{taking advantage of}} the opportunities to further development is essential to ensure increased hydrocarbon recovery and barrier security for upstream energy companies. Interwell is a well intervention company operating globally, with main competence in plug and straddle solutions with related setting, pulling and measurement tools. In many of Interwell s product lines, cylindrical members and pipes are being exposed to axial compressive loads in both static and dynamic conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to increase the knowledge on how to facilitate full utilization of the limited design space available for Down Hole Equipment by minimizing the gap between the numerical and the experimental results and to find global safety factors. This study introduces options to supplement the safe design of axially loaded members, focusing mainly on the Setting Chamber Mandrel, a cylindrical member in the Hydrostatic <b>Setting</b> <b>Unit.</b> The Setting Chamber mandrel has to resist compression caused by increasing well pressure while running in hole. The prominence of the failure mode depends on several factors including member slenderness, section slenderness, strength, influence of connections and restrains, geometric imperfections and residual stresses. The members in this study have been characterized into three general types depending on their proneness to buckling; short, intermediate and long. The dividing lines between short, intermediate and long members shall not be considered as accurately defined; furthermore the maximum load-carrying capacity of a member in each category is based upon different types of mechanical failure scenarios. The Setting Chamber Mandrel is classified as intermediate and will fail by both yielding and buckling; i. e. inelastic buckling behavior. Failure of intermediate members could be progressive and unpredictable, and it is common practice to use large safety factors when predicting the buckling strength. A safe design approach has been suggested for predicting the critical load and critical stresses of intermediate members by comparing experimental results to existing literature. The experimental study consists of three experimental tests; TEST 1 : length and diameter, TEST 2 : temperature and TEST 3 : well pressure. The results obtained from the experimental study were compared with NS-EN 1993 - 1 - 1 : 2005, FE-analyses and established linear buckling theory; Euler and J. B. Johnsons equations. Linear elastic eigenvalue buckling analysis and nonlinear static buckling analyses were performed with finite element software package Abaqus 6. 12. In order to understand the buckling behavior of the Setting Chamber Mandrel elastic-plastic material properties was added to the nonlinear large deformation buckling analysis. The results from the analyses were used as a pre-study for the experimental testing and for post-buckling analysis to validate the results to establish the reliability and uncertainties of the numerical methods. Results indicate that NS-EN 1993 - 1 - 1 : 2005 and the nonlinear analysis techniques are suitable to accurately predict the critical buckling load of an axially loaded compression member. The results from the nonlinear static large deformation buckling analysis using elastic-plastic material properties show most agreement with the experimental studies. The partial safety factors in the global safety factor presented in this study are utilized based on anticipated conditions to ensure that build in functionality and constructional integrity of the Setting Chamber Mandrel will not affect the overall integrity of the Hydrostatic <b>Setting</b> <b>Unit.</b> The appropriate global safety factor for intermediate members with similar shape and boundary conditions as the Setting Chamber Mandrel is concluded to be 1. 5 when calculating buckling strength with Interwell s safe design procedure. In order to obtain a high degree of confidence in the design of axially loaded compression members it is recommended to follow the complete methodology provided in this study...|$|E
