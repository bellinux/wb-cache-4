25|$|Multiband {{compressors}} {{are primarily}} an audio mastering tool, but their inclusion in digital audio workstation plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of radio stations commonly use hardware multiband compressors to increase apparent loudness {{without fear of}} overmodulation. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's multiband output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing <b>spectral</b> <b>balance</b> between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development {{of this approach is}} programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the multiband compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current programme block style or the time of day.|$|E
5000|$|Alexandrite, a {{strongly}} pleochroic (trichroic) gem, will exhibit emerald green, red and orange-yellow colors depending on viewing direction in partially polarised light. However, its most distinctive property {{is that it}} also changes color in artificial (tungsten/halogen) light compared to daylight. The color change from red to green is due to strong absorption of light in a narrow yellow portion of the spectrum, while allowing large bands of more blue-green and red wavelengths to be transmitted. Which of these prevails to give the perceived hue depends on the <b>spectral</b> <b>balance</b> of the illumination. Fine-quality alexandrite has a green to bluish-green color in daylight (relatively blue illumination of high color temperature), changing to a red to purplish-red color in incandescent light (relatively yellow illumination). [...] However, fine-color material is extremely rare. Less-desirable stones may have daylight colors of yellowish-green and incandescent colors of brownish red.|$|E

Cross-shore energy flux gradients are estimated from spectra observed with closely spaced pressure sensors. Nonlinear energy exchanges between different wave components in the spectrum are estimated from observed bispectra based on Boussinesq theory for near-resonant triad interactions. Dissipation of wave energy in file poorly understood breaking process is inferred as the residual term in the <b>spectral</b> energy <b>balance.</b> Analysis of the <b>spectral</b> energy <b>balance</b> shows that large decreases in energy flux observed at the dominant wave frequencies as waves break over a sand bar are closely balanced by nonlinear energy transfers to higher frequencies.

At higher frequencies, observed energy flux gradients are small and do not balance the nonlinear transfers of energy to high frequency components of the spectrum.

40|$|There are {{far-reaching}} conceptual {{similarities between}} bi-static surface georadar and post-stack, "zero-offset" seismic reflection data, which {{is expressed in}} largely identical processing flows. One important difference is, however, that standard deconvolution algorithms routinely used to enhance the vertical resolution of seismic data are notoriously problematic or even detrimental to the overall signal quality when applied to surface georadar data. We have explored various options for alleviating this problem and have tested them on a geologically well-constrained surface georadar dataset. Standard stochastic and direct deterministic deconvolution approaches proved to be largely unsatisfactory. While least-squares-type deterministic deconvolution showed some promise, the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating the source wavelet introduced some artificial "ringiness". In contrast, we found <b>spectral</b> <b>balancing</b> approaches to be effective, practical and robust means for enhancing the vertical resolution of surface georadar data, particularly, but not exclusively, in the uppermost part of the georadar section, which is notoriously plagued by the interference of the direct air- and groundwaves. For the data considered in this study, {{it can be argued}} that band-limited spectral blueing may provide somewhat better results than standard band-limited spectral whitening, particularly in the uppermost part of the section affected by the interference of the air- and groundwaves. Interestingly, this finding is consistent with the fact that the amplitude spectrum resulting from least-squares-type deterministic deconvolution is characterized by a systematic enhancement of higher frequencies at the expense of lower frequencies and hence is blue rather than white. It is also consistent with increasing evidence that spectral "blueness" is a seemingly universal, albeit enigmatic, property of the distribution of reflection coefficients in the Earth. Our results therefore indicate that <b>spectral</b> <b>balancing</b> techniques in general and spectral blueing in particular represent simple, yet effective means of enhancing the vertical resolution of surface georadar data and, in many cases, could turn out to be a preferable alternative to standard deconvolution approaches...|$|R

It is also of interest for UWB (Ultra Wide Band) communications. Indeed, in UWB, M-ary pulse shape modulation has been proposed and it can be achieved with orthogonal signals such as PSWFs [18]. However, the spectra of Slepian sequences or PSWFs are slightly shifted upward as the sequence order increases. Instead, spectrally balanced pulses have spectra that better occupy the whole bandwidth, thus being more robust against multipath.

40|$|Introduction The {{concept of}} <b>spectral</b> <b>balance</b> is fairly young within speech research. During {{the past decade}} the {{linguistic}} use of energy enhancement in {{the upper part of}} the speech spectrum has been empirically explored (Sluijter & van Heuven, 1993, 1996; Campbell, 1995; Sluijter, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Stevens, & van Heuven, 1995; Sluijter, van Heuven & Pacilly, 1997; Heldner, 2003). It has been shown that <b>spectral</b> <b>balance</b> may be employed for linguistic purposes at the word or phrase level (often in interaction with other features such as duration or intonational gestures). However, changes in the spectral energy balance may be employed also for non-linguistic or extralinguistic purposes. When utilized over longer stretches of speech, where a whole utterance or even an entire monologue might be characterized by consistent enhancement of the upper parts of the spectrum, this feature would be regarded as being indicative of voice quality rather than having a direct linguistic function. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} (pseudo) inverse {{technique was}} developed to facilitate {{a better understanding of}} the numerical effects of tropical singularities inherent in the <b>spectral</b> linear <b>balance</b> equation (LBE). Depending upon the truncation, various levels of determinancy are manifest.

The over-determined (OD) systems result in a modest response and a large residual in the tropics. The FD and OD systems can be alternatively solved by the iterative method. Differences in the solutions of an UD system exist between the inverse technique and the iterative method owing to the non- uniqueness of the problem.

40|$|The {{topographical}} {{scattering of}} gravity waves is investigated using a <b>spectral</b> energy <b>balance</b> equation {{that accounts for}} first order wave-bottom Bragg scattering. This model represents the bottom topography and surface waves with spectra, and evaluates a Bragg scattering source term that is theoretically valid for small bottom and surface slopes and slowly varying spectral properties. The robustness of the model is tested {{for a variety of}} topographies uniform along one horizontal dimension including nearly sinusoidal, linear ramp and step profiles. Results are compared with reflections computed using an accurate method that applies integral matching along vertical boundaries of a series of steps. For small bottom amplitudes, the source term representation yields accurate reflection estimates even for a localized scatterer. This result is proved for small bottom amplitudes $h$ relative to the mean water depth $H$. Wave reflection by small amplitude bottom topography thus depends primarily on the bottom elevation variance at the Bragg resonance scales, and is insensitive to the detailed shape of the bottom profile.

The model [Internal Wave Dissipation, Energy and Mixing (IDEMIX) ] {{is based on the}} <b>spectral</b> radiation <b>balance</b> of the wave field, reduced by integration over the wavenumber space, which yields a set of balances for energy density variables in physical space. A further simplification results in a single partial differential equation for the total energy density of the wave field.

In the current version of IDEMIX, the wave energy is forced by wind-driven near-inertial motions and baroclinic tides, radiating waves from the respective boundary layers at the surface and the bottom into the ocean interior.
