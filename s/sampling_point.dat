The determination of optimal sampling strategies that effectively utilize available resources to maximize the information content of the collected ocean data is becoming an open problem. The historical sea surface temperature (SST) dataset contains the spatial variability information of SST, and this prior knowledge can be used to optimize the configuration of <b>sampling</b> <b>points.</b> Here, a configuration method of <b>sampling</b> <b>points</b> based on the variability of SST is studied. Firstly, in order to get the spatial variability of SST in the ocean field to be sampled, the historical SST data of the field is analyzed. Then, K-means algorithm is used to cluster the subsampled fields to make the configuration of <b>sampling</b> <b>points</b> more suitable. Finally, to evaluate the sampling performance of the new configuration method of <b>sampling</b> <b>points,</b> the SST field is reconstructed by the method based on compression sensing algorithm. Results show that the proposed optimal configuration method of <b>sampling</b> <b>points</b> significantly outperforms the traditional random <b>sampling</b> <b>points</b> distribution method in terms of reconstruction accuracy.
