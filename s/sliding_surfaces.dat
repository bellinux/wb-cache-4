25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{their success}} with the first {{recorded}} powered flight, the Wright Brothers had patented many of their methods and had sought to enforce their patents through the courts. Most if not all other manufacturers were keen to develop alternative techniques; Pfitzner avoided the Wrights' method of warping the wings to achieve a lift differential between port and starboard wings by using wing extensions (or 'compensators'), described below. In his book “Monoplanes and Biplanes: Their Design, Construction and Operation” (1911), Grover Loening wrote “This aeroplane is a distinct departure from all other monoplanes in the placing of the motor, aviator, and rudders, and in the comparatively simple and efficient method of transverse control by <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces,</b> applied {{here for the first}} time.”. The issue of patent protection was sufficiently in the public eye for The New York Times, in its issue of 16 January 1910, to headline Pfitzner’s design as an “Aeroplane Without Patent Drawbacks". The same article refers to the “Wright suits” and their attempts to “build up their patent fences”; Pfitzner is quoted there as saying that “any one who wants to do so is welcome to use [...] panel invention without cost or fear of injunction”.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose new approaches for on-line tuning of the linear <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> slope in <b>sliding</b> mode controllers. The new approaches are developed for a class of second order systems on new coordinate axes, one of which is the classical <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> and the other one is naturally chosen to be orthogonal to it. The control input of the sliding mode control law is then modied accordingly by applying the Lyapunov stability condition. The adjustment of the linear <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> slope dened in the new coordinate axes is achieved by tuning a new parameter using dierent methods. First, an adaptive <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> with a rotation scheme is constructed by interpreting the classical delta neighbourhood approach. Next, the rotation process is achieved by using a fuzzy tuning mechanism that uses the new coordinates as its input variables and generates an incremental change in the new parameter value as an output. Numerical simulations are performed on a second order nonlinear system model with parameter uncertainties and bounded external disturbance. The two newly proposed on-line tuning approaches are then compared with the rotation mechanism that uses an empirical function dened on the same new coordinate axes. Moreover, the new approaches are compared with classical sliding mode controllers having a constant <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> and the delta neighbourhood approach developed in the classical coordinate axes. Results have shown improved performances of the proposed approaches in terms of a decrease in the reaching and settling times and robustness to disturbances as compared with the classical sliding mode controller.
