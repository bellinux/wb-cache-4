40|$|This study {{investigated}} the association between parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> that fall outside the span of 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. and children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes, {{using data from the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and its Child Supplement on 5, 089 children who were followed from birth to age 13 or 14. With a concern about the potential adverse impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children, previous research tended to paint a negative image of the toll related to parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> However, this study, based on fixed-effect regression models, found that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement may differ by parents who undertake nonstandard schedules, children 2 ̆ 7 s developmental stages, types of nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> and family structure. For early childhood children (age 3 or 4) in two-parent families, maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly varying hours, were associated with better academic outcomes, while paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly rotating shift and varying hours, were associated with lower academic outcomes. However, the positive impact of maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> disappeared for early childhood children in single-parent families. For middle childhood children (age 5 - 10), maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were found to have no impact on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement both in two-parent and single-parent families, whereas paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly evening shift, had a negative effect in two-parent families. For early adolescents (age 11 - 14), both maternal and paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> had no impact. These findings suggest that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes are not uniformly negative or positive, implying that parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> have a dual potential to become a family-unfriendly schedule and {{to be used as a}} family-friendly work option. More sophisticated policy and academic attention should be devoted to addressing key issues with respect to nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> and child development. ...|$|R

Because of the evening work hours, split <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> are contributing to work-family conflicts in the midst of significantly higher female labor force participation. Our purpose is to examine who has a split <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> and why. We focus on full-time working women with full-time working partners, for whom the need to reconcile work and family responsibilities is likely to be more pressing.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the number of cities contemplating and implementing alternative <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly compressed workweeks, often to decrease energy costs for the organization or to decrease transportation and fuel costs for employees.

This research endeavors to fill that gap in our understanding by providing the results of a recent survey of human resources directors in 151 U.

30|$|A {{comparison}} of the effect sizes shows that the effect sizes of sabbaticals and flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on organizational attachment are similar. However, the fact that sabbaticals have a significantly stronger effect on organizational attachment than telecommuting indicates that employees consider telecommuting to be less beneficial than sabbaticals and flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> As mentioned above, and in contrast to flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> telecommuting presents various disadvantages for employees, such as social and professional isolation. Hence, although both practices offer regular flexibility, employees prefer flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> to telecommuting, because flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> provide daily working time flexibility without the significant drawbacks of telecommuting. Employees may also value sabbaticals more than telecommuting because they allow employees to fulfil personal dreams, like a trip around the world, while still having job security as they do not lose their legal rights as employees.|$|R

40|$|A case of {{selection}} and adaptation of weekly <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> is presented. Weekly <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> in two franchises {{of an important}} retail clothing chain have to be established. Working time accounts are used: each week, an employee can owe the company {{a certain number of}} hours or vice versa. Nevertheless, over a certain threshold, the hours have to be paid for by the company and the account balance returns to zero. A minimum and desired level of capacity of employees is contemplated. Hierarchically, the planned capacity must attempt to reach the minimum level; then it must fit a desired level as much as possible. At present, the task of allocation and the final adjustment of schedules is done manually, which is difficult, ineffective and often inaccurate. The procedure proposed is divided into two phases. Firstly, a <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> selected from a list, is assigned to each worker; a mixed linear program, followed by a local optimization process, is used.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Studies in school-age {{children}} have consistently shown a positive association between maternal paid work hours and child obesity. However, there is conflicting {{evidence about the}} impact of maternal <b>work</b> hours <b>scheduled</b> at nonstandard times (for example, evenings, nights or weekends), and no previous examination of paternal <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> and child weight. We examined the associations between maternal, paternal and combined parental paid <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> and overweight/obesity in children at age 9 years. METHODS: Data were analysed from the most recent follow-up of 9 -year-old children (n¼ 434) in an Australian birth cohort study. Children were measured and classified as overweight/obese using the International Obesity Taskforce body mass index cutoff points. Current working conditions of parents were obtained from a structured interview with the primary caregiver. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of parental <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on child overweight/obesity with adjustment for a range of sociodemographic and household factors associated with parental employment and child weight. RESULTS: At 9 years of age, 99 children (22. 8 %) were overweight or obese. When parental <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were examined separately, child overweight/obesity was significantly associated with paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1. 97, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 08 [...] 3. 61).
