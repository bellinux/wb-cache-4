40|$|A 56 -year-old man who {{underwent}} surgical clipping of a cerebral aneurysm via a bifrontal craniotomy in a Jack-knife position complained of bilateral blindness immediately after surgery. Examinations 14 hours later revealed marked bilateral proptosis with eyelid edema and conjunctival chemosis. MRI demonstrated severe bilateral globe tenting with marked orbital tissue edema. Despite emergent lateral canthotomy and cantholysis, {{there was no}} visual recovery. This is a rare case of bilateral irreversible blindness after cerebrovascular surgery caused by orbital compartment syndrome and resulting in severe globe tenting and ocular ischemia. Attention to factors such as direct ocular pressure from <b>skin</b> flaps, <b>congestion</b> from head positioning, and adequate intraoperative eye protection and monitoring may {{reduce the risk of}} this complication or allow faster management when diagnosed.

40|$|A {{survey to}} {{determine}} the pathogenic bacterial strains of an important commercial capture fish, Oreochromis niloticus in an Egyptian fish farm was conducted. One strain presumptively identified as Shewanella putrefaciens was isolated from the fish and identified by a biochemical test, API 20 NE system and 16 S rRNA gene. Intraperitoneal (I. P) challenge by S. putrefaciens revealed its pathogenicity with 50 % mortality. The infected fish showed skin hemorrhage, fin rot and shallow necrotizing ulcers on the <b>skin</b> with <b>congestion</b> and enlargement of the liver, spleen and kidneys. The antibiogram of S. putrefaciens revealed its sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, gentamycin, oxytetracyclin and sulfamethoxazole. Complete resistance to cephazolin and fusidic acid was recorded. Histological changes in the liver of infected O. niloticus included hepatocyte degeneration, fatty vacuolation in liver cells, Kupffer cell increase, hemolysis with infiltration in blood vessels, deposition of hemosiderin associated with the liver blood vessels and necrosis hepatocytes in the fatty liver tissue. The results concluded that the S. putrefaciens {{should be considered as}} an opportunistic pathogen for fish, which had caused fish infections, diseases with septicemia and mortality in O. niloticus...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the first isolation of Tenacibaculum maritimum from tub gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucernus L.), cultured in Italy. After 3 days shipment from one fish farm to our laboratory facilities, {{a group of}} 20 tub gurnard showed eroded mouth, rotten fins and severe skin ulcerative lesions. Mortality reached 90 % {{of the population in}} 9 days. Traditional bacteriological and PCR analysis allowed the identification of the causative agent as T. maritimum. Serological characterization of the isolate demonstrated that it belongs to serotype O 3. Histopathological examination showed severe <b>skin</b> necrosis, dermis <b>congestion</b> associated with eterophilic and macrophagic infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis, using specific polyclonal antiserum against T. maritimum serotype O 3, allowed the visualization of numerous positively stained macrophagic cells. The high mortality observed during the outbreak leads to consider the T. maritimum as a potential risk for the culture of tub gurnard...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to detect Lactococcus garvieae from {{experimentally}} infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, W.) using bacteriological, serological, and histopathological techniques. Rainbow trout were experimentally infected with two Lactococcus garvieae strains (L 1 and L 2) by intraperitonal injection. These strains caused bilateral exophthalmia with periocular hemorrhage, corneal opacification, darkening of the <b>skin,</b> strong internal <b>congestion</b> in the visceral organs, and {{enlargement of the spleen}} in the infected rainbow trout. The two L. garvieae strains were re-isolated from experimentally infected fish groups and identified with standard biochemical methods and API 20 STREP system. The presence of L. garvieae in the tissue of experimentally infected fish was confirmed by Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Technique (IFAT). The humoral antibody response of the infected fish was confirmed by slide agglutination, IFAT, and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Histopathologically, liquefactive necrosis in the liver, spleen, and kidney, epithelial cells hyperplasia, hemorrhages and telangiectasia of the gill filaments, and sub-retinal hemorrhages in the eyes were observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of crush asphyxia typically {{relies on a}} history of chest or abdominal compression with the finding of <b>skin</b> petechiae and <b>congestion.</b> The following three cases of crush asphyxia demonstrate a distinctive pattern of petechiae and congestion associated with close-fitting clothing: Case 1, a 49 -year-old woman who was crushed under a large hay bale; Case 2, a 35 -year-old woman who was crushed between a wall and a car; Case 3, a 49 -year-old woman who was crushed between a crane and {{the side of a}} truck. At autopsy in all three cases there were facial, conjunctival, neck and upper anterior chest petechiae. However, few or no petechiae, and reduced congestion, were observed in areas beneath the victims' brassieres. Deaths in these cases were all due to crush asphyxia, with the pattern of petechiae on the chests of the victims influenced by close-fitting clothing that had compressed cutaneous vasculature. This brassiere 'sign' provided a readily observable and easily recordable sign of crush asphyxia due to chest compression, and illustrated that vascular engorgement is necessary for the development of petechiae in these circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Two {{episodes of}} flexibacteriosis caused by T. maritimum were {{diagnosed}} in wild turbot and farmed tub gurnard in Italy. The two different cases {{occurred in the}} facilities of Universtiy of Camerino during reproduction trials. A group of 10 adult turbot showed haemorrhagic, frayed fins and eroded mouth two weeks after capture from the North Adriatic Sea. The disease was controlled by antibiotic therapy. A group of 20 tub gurnard showed eroded mouth, rotten fins and severe skin ulcerative lesions, after 3 days of transportations from a fish farm to our laboratory facilities. Mortality reached 90 % of the population within 9 days. Traditional bacteriological and PCR analysis of the isolates in the two episodes allowed {{the identification of the}} causative agent as Tenacibaculum maritimum. Serological characterization of the isolates demonstrated that they belonged to serotype O 3. Histopathological examination showed severe <b>skin</b> necrosis, dermis <b>congestion</b> associated with heterophilic and macrophagic infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis of skin tissue, using specific polyclonal antibody against T. maritimum serotype O 3, allowed the visualisation of positive stained macrophages. These cases, which constitute the first descriptions of flexibacterioris in cultured tub gurnard and wild turbot in Italy, leads to consider T. maritimum as a potential risk for the future Italian culture of these two fish species...|$|R
40|$|Hyptis umbrosa (syn. Mesosphaerum sidifolium) (Lamiaceae Family) {{has been}} used to treat several {{conditions}} such as gastrointestinal disorders, <b>skin</b> infections, nasal <b>congestion,</b> fever and cramps. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the chemical composition, analgesic and anti-inflammatory profiles of ethanol extract from leaves of Hyptis umbrosa (EEB). HPLC-DAD was used to determine the fingerprint chromatogram of the extract. Male Swiss mice were orally pretreated with EEB (100, 200 or 400 mg/kg; 60 min before initiating algesic stimulation) and antinociceptive activity was assessed using the acetic acid-induced writhing model, formalin test and hyperalgesia induced by glutamate or capsaicin. Also, peritonitis was induced by the intrathoracic injection of carrageenan to quantify the total number of leukocytes. The presence of phenolic compounds in the extract was confirmed using HPLC-DAD. The treatment with EEB, at all doses, produced a significant analgesic effect against acetic acid-induced antinociceptive activity. In the formalin test, only the 400 -mg/kg-dose of EEB had a significant effect in the first phase. However, all doses tested were able to reverse nociception in the second phase. The effect of all doses of EEB also showed a significant antinociceptive effect in the glutamate and capsaicin tests and inhibited the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity. The present study suggests that the EEB possesses peripheral analgesic action and showed potential in reducing the spreading of the inflammatory processes. Also, it seems to be related with vanilloid and glutamate receptors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Microvascular {{rarefaction}} {{occurs in}} hypertension. We {{carried out a}} 12 -week randomized double-blind crossover trial {{to determine the effect}} of a modest reduction in salt intake on capillary rarefaction in 71 whites, 69 blacks, and 29 Asians with untreated mildly raised blood pressure. Both basal and maximal (during venous <b>congestion)</b> <b>skin</b> capillary density were measured by capillaroscopy at the dorsum and the side of the fingers. In addition, we used orthogonal polarization spectral imaging to measure skin capillary density at the dorsum of the fingers and the hand web. With a reduction in salt intake from 9. 7 to 6. 5 g/day, there was an increase in capillary density (capillaries per millimeter squared) from 10121 to 10623 (basal) and 10822 to 11522 (maximal) at the dorsum, and 10125 to 10726 (basal) and 11026 to 11626 (maximal) {{at the side of the}} fingers (P 0. 001 for all). Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging also showed a significant increase in capillary density both at the dorsum of the fingers and the web. Subgroup analysis showed that most of the changes were significant in all of the ethnic groups. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the change in 24 -hour urinary sodium and the change in capillary density at the side of the fingers. These results demonstrate that a modest reduction in salt intake, as currently recommended, improves both functional and structural capillary rarefactions that occur in hypertension, and a larger reduction in salt intake would have a greater effect. The increase in capillary density may possibly carry additional beneficial effects on target organs. (Hypertension. 2010; 56 : 253 - 259. ...|$|R
40|$|Huge {{quantities}} of treated wastewater (TMWW) and biosolids (sludge) are produced every day {{all over the}} world, which exert a strong pressure on the environment. An important question that is raised is “what to do with them?”. An effort is put by the scientific community to eliminate the concept of “waste” and {{to replace it with}} the concept of “recycling of resources”, by means of effective management, which does not concern only the users, but all the other groups involved in the problem, such as facility administrators, operations, politicians, scientific community and the general population. Sludge concentration data showed that there exist 516 chemicals in biosolids which create a serious health risk. It is pointed out that this risk will be greatly exacerbated by chemical toxins present in the sludge which can predispose skin to infection by pathogens. Consequently, the need for science-based policies are necessary to effectively protect public health. The risk assessment due to sludge, is difficult to evaluate of due to the large number of unknown interactions involved. People living near the sludge application sites may suffer from such abnormalities as: eye, nose, and throat irritation, gastrointestinal abnormalities, as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, including cough, difficulty in breathing, sinus <b>congestion,</b> <b>skin</b> infection and sores. Many problems seem to be related to biosolid and wastewater application in agriculture, which should be solved. A universal one, acknowledged as an “international health crisis” is the resistance of pathogens to antibiotics and to the evolution of multidrug resistance of bacteria”. Certain anthropogenically created environments have been identified as major sources of multidrug resistance bacteria such as in water treatment plants, concentrated animal feeding operations etc. All these, and many other health problems, render the safety of sludge and biosolid and wastewater agricultural reuse, for the time being questionable even though the application is done according to official guidelines. It is therefore necessary that more research work be conducted on the short and long term application effects of sludge on human health, and on the environment so as to successfully address these problems Also,the existing guidelines must be reconsidered {{on the basis of the}} research findings to be attained. It is only then that the application of these inputs to land could be as safe as possible...|$|R
