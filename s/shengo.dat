50|$|The {{presidency}} {{was created in}} its original form by the 1987 Constitution, which established the Communist People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. He was elected to a five-year term by the National <b>Shengo</b> (legislature), with no term limits. He was vested with sweeping executive powers. For instance, when the <b>Shengo</b> was out of session, {{he had the right}} to appoint a number of state officers. Although such appointments required legislative confirmation, in practice this was merely a formality. He was also chairman of the Council of State, which acted for the <b>Shengo</b> when it was out of session. While he, like all other state officers, was nominally responsible to the <b>Shengo,</b> in practice the principles of democratic centralism effectively made him a dictator. The only president under this system was Mengistu Haile-Mariam.|$|E
50|$|Created {{with the}} {{adoption}} of the Ethiopian Constitution of 1995, the Parliament replaced the <b>Shengo</b> as the legislative branch of the Ethiopian government.|$|E
50|$|Following Mengistu's {{overthrow}} in 1991, the <b>Shengo</b> was abolished, and {{a period}} of transition lasted until 1995, when a new legislature was inaugurated under the new constitution.|$|E
5000|$|Under the 1987 Constitution of Ethiopia, the {{military}} {{rule of the}} Derg evolved into the civilian government of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and chapter 8 of the Constitution determined that the state would be subdivided into [...] "autonomous regions" [...] and [...] "administrative regions". Chapter 9 gave to the National <b>Shengo</b> (the legislature) the power to establish the regions. The <b>Shengo</b> established the regions in Proclamation No. 14 of 1987, on 18 September. There were thirty regions, consisting of five autonomous regions, and twenty-five administrative regions. The five autonomous regions were: ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the rule}} of Mengistu Haile Mariam, the place grounds were used as a prison to house many notables of the {{government}} of Emperor Haile Selassie, the Emperor included. Built during this time was the <b>Shengo</b> Hall, accommodating the country's legislature, and the Presidential Office Building.|$|E
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Ethiopia on 14 June 1987 for seats in its <b>Shengo.</b> This was the first election since Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed in the Ethiopian Revolution {{as well as the}} first election under the 1987 constitution, which replaced the Derg regime with the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE).|$|E

5000|$|In 1943, open {{resistance}} {{broke out}} all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, [...] "there is no government; let's organize and govern ourselves." [...] Throughout Enderta awraja including, Mekelle, Didibadergiajen, Hintalo, Saharti, Samre and Wajirat, Raya awraja, Kilete-Awlaelo awraja and Tembien awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were immediately formed. The gerreb sent representatives to a central congress, called the <b>shengo,</b> which elected leadership and established military command system.|$|E
50|$|When {{the monarchy}} was overthrown, {{parliament}} {{was replaced with}} a transitional assembly of 60 select members from government institutions and provinces from 1974 to 1975, after which the government largely operated by decree through the military junta headed by Mengistu Haile Mariam. The period without some semblance of a legislature ended in 1987, when a National <b>Shengo</b> (council) was promulgated under a new constitution drafted by Mengistu and leaders of his party.|$|E
50|$|After {{five years}} of preparation, a socialist state was officially proclaimed in 1984, and the WPE was formed as the country's only legal party. It was a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party modeled on its {{counterparts}} in Europe. The PDRE officially came into existence on 22 February 1987, {{three weeks after the}} national referendum that approved the 1987 constitution, although the Derg remained in power as late as September, long after the 14 June general election that elected the members of the National <b>Shengo</b> (the legislature).|$|E
5000|$|There was a {{slow but}} bloody advance from Sikkim and a {{massacre}} of several hundred Tibetan troops equipped with antiquated [...] "matchlock guns, swords, spears and slingshots" [...] at the crude fortifications they had built below the village of Guru and at nearby Chumik Shenko (or Chumi <b>Shengo),</b> with the Tibetans facing far more deadly weapons including Maxim machine guns and ten-pound cannon for the first time. The British then pushed on to Gyantse which they reached after a couple more unequal skirmishes, on 12 April 1904.|$|E
50|$|The new Ethiopian Constitution, {{adopted by}} a {{referendum}} held on 1 February 1987, provided for a national parliament, the <b>Shengo,</b> as the nominal supreme organ of state power. The date of the general elections was officially announced only two days in advance. In the running for the Shengo's 835 seats were some 2,500 candidates, mostly nominated by the Communist Workers' Party of Ethiopia, the country's only legally permitted party. The WPE won 795 seats, with independents taking the remaining 40 seats. Voter turnout {{was reported to be}} 90.5%.|$|E
5000|$|The Ethiopian Parliament {{building}} {{was built in}} the early 1930s in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Today, the large mosaics of St. George and the Dragon (Ethiopia's Patron Saint) and the two Lions of Judah {{on either side of him}} have been painted over, and the gilding that covered the winged lions on the gates has worn away. Although the Derg used the new <b>Shengo</b> Hall (it was the largest pre-fabricated building in the world when it was built) across the street as its parliament, the present government has moved parliament back into this older building.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Shengo</b> {{hall was}} built by the Derg {{at a cost of}} $18 million. It was {{prefabricated}} in Finland, and, {{at the time of its}} construction, was the largest prefabricated building in the world. [...] It was opened on 9 September 1987 after the promulgation of the new constitution and election of the assembly, to a grand ceremony that counted Presidents Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt as guests. After the fall of the Mengistu government, the Ethiopian Parliament convened its previous chambers, and today the building is used as an occasional meeting place.|$|E
50|$|Actual power, however, {{rested in}} the Workers' Party of Ethiopia, {{defined as the}} leading force of state and society. More specifically, actual power rested with Mengistu, who was not only {{president}} of the country but {{general secretary of the}} WPE. He and the other surviving members of the Derg dominated the WPE's Politburo. In essence, the power structure set up by the constitution was a carbon copy of the power structure in other Communist countries. The party was granted even more power than the government, which acted more or less as a transmission belt for the party. The National <b>Shengo,</b> while nominally vested with great lawmaking powers, actually did little more than rubber-stamp decisions made by the WPE and its Politburo.|$|E
5000|$|In 1943, open {{resistance}} {{broke out}} all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, [...] "there is no government; let's organize and govern ourselves."  Throughout Enderta awraja including, Mekelle, Didibadergiajen, Hintalo, Saharti, Samre and Wajirat, Raya awraja, Kilete-Awlaelo awraja and Tembien awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were immediately formed. The gerreb sent representatives to a central congress, called the <b>shengo,</b> which elected leadership and established military command system. Although the Woyane rebellion of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians however agree that, the Woyane rebellion had involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative. It demonstrated considerable popular participation, and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was unequivocally and specifically directed against the central Shoan Amhara regime of Haile Selassie I, rather than the Tigrayan imperial elite.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{buildings}} include St George's Cathedral (founded in 1896 {{and also}} home to a museum), Holy Trinity Cathedral (once the largest Ethiopian Orthodox Cathedral {{and the location of}} Sylvia Pankhurst's tomb) as well as the burial place of Emperor Haile Selassie and the Imperial family, and those who fought the Italians during the World War II. There is also Menelik's old Imperial palace which remains the official seat of government, and the National Palace formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. Africa Hall is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) which eventually became the African Union. The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built {{on the site of the}} demolished Akaki Prison, on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The Hager Fikir Theatre, the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the <b>Shengo</b> Hall, built by the Derg regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as its new parliament hall. The <b>Shengo</b> Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in Finland before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions. Itegue Taitu Hotel, built in 1898 (Ethiopian Calendar) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.|$|E
5000|$|Known {{before his}} {{elevation}} to the episcopacy as Abba (Father) Ze-Libanos Fanta, {{he was born}} into the minor nobility of Beghemidir Province. He was considered something of a liturgical expert, and served for many years at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa. Abba Ze-Libanos was raised {{to the rank of}} Bishop by Patriarch Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1976 over his home province of Beghemidir (then known as Gondar Province), taking the name Merkorios. Abuna Merkorios served as Archbishop of Gondar until he became Patriarch of Ethiopia in 1988. Abune Merkorios' tenure of Archbishop of Gondar included the period known as the [...] "Red Terror" [...] in Ethiopia, and which was carried out with particular brutality in the town and province of Gondar under the governorship of Melaku Teferra, a particularly notorious member of the Derg. Abuna Merkorios would later face accusations of not only having kept silent during the horrors of the [...] "Red Terror" [...] in Gondar, but of having a particularly close relationship with Governor Melaku. In a sign of the favor of the Derg regime, in 1987 Abune Merkorios was appointed as one of a very small and select group of clergy to serve {{as a member of the}} <b>Shengo,</b> the national parliament set up by the Derg when it proclaimed the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia that year. He remained a member of the parliament until his enthronement as Patriarch These allegations of closeness to the Communist Derg regime helped undermine the Patriarch, when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) came to power.|$|E
