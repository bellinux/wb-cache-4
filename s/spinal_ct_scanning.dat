40|$|Herniation of {{the bladder}} into the {{inguinal}} canal is an uncommon phenomenon, accompanied by complications, {{such as the}} obstruction of {{the neck of the}} bladder caused by prostatic hypertrophy, that increase intra-abdominal pressure, which occurs in one fourth of all inguinal hernia. It is quite difficult to diagnose the involvement of the bladder during the first medical examination of the patient and it might even require a herniorrhaphy. The main objective of the present study is to report an untouchable case of bladder herniation without any specific symptoms which was randomly diagnosed using <b>spinal</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Knowing the possibility of the incidence of such a case can help assess requirements of a surgery and improve readiness to implement useful interventions.

The authors report the first case of an intraradicular lumbar disc herniation without subdural penetration; the disc hernia was lodged between the two radicular dura layers. The patient, a 34 -year-old soldier, was admitted with a 12 -month history of low back pain and episodic left sciatica.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is focused on}} comparative stress strain analysis of a spinal segment with a malleable fixation device and a physiologic spinal segment. In its opening a research study from available sources is carried out. It covers the contemporary state of scientific studies in the given area, anatomy of individual components of the spine, material properties, ways and magnitudes of loadings and also the most common FE model used in similar problems solved. To create a model of geometry of a <b>spinal</b> segment <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of a <b>spinal</b> segment of a 38 -year-old woman are used. Then they are subsequently used in the modeling software SolidWorks to create the model of geometry of two lumbar vertebras L 4 - L 5 and a malleable fixation device. Using the computational system ANSYS Workbench, the complete computational model of the spinal motional segment with a malleable fixation device is compiled, covering models of material, loading and bonds. On {{the basis of the}} computational solution of FEM models for different ways of loading, a stress-strain analysis is performed. To compare obtained results a detailed comparative analysis with the physiological spinal segment, the segment with the degenerated disc and the segment with applied "rigid" fixation device is carried out. Within the stress strain analysis of the spinal segment with malleable fixation device, an analysis of the magnitude of the strain intensity of spongious bone tissue around the implanted transpedicular screw, depending on the cord pretension of the malleable fixation device, is performed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the presence of}} osteolysis around the pedicle screws affects {{the quality of life}} of patients who underwent posterolateral arthrodesis of the lumbosacral spine. Methods: A retrospective study of patients undergoing lumbar posterolateral or lumbosacral arthrodesis due to <b>spinal</b> degenerative disease. <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of the operated segments were performed at intervals of 45, 90, 180, and 360 postoperatively. In these tests, the presence of a peri-implant radiolucent halo was investigated, which was considered present when greater than 1 mm in the coronal section. Concurrently with the completion of <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> the participants completed the questionnaire Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to assess the degree of disability of the patients. Results: A total of 38 patients were evaluated, and 14 (36. 84 %) of them showed some degree of osteolysis around at least one pedicle screw at the end of follow-up. Of the 242 analyzed screws, 27 (11. 15 %) had osteolysis in the CT coronal section, with the majority of these occurrences located at the most distal level segment of the arthrodesis. There was no correlation between the presence of the osteolysis to {{the quality of life of}} patients. The quality of life has significantly improved when comparing the preoperative results with the postoperative results at different times of application of ODI. This improvement in ODI maintains linearity over time. Conclusion: There is no correlation between the presence of peri-implant osteolysis to the quality of life of patients undergoing lumbar or posterolateral lumbosacral arthrodesis in the follow-up period up to 360 days. The quality of life in postoperative has significantly improvement when compared to the preoperative period...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the radiation dose in the thyroid attributable to different <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and {{to estimate the}} thyroid cancer risk in pediatric patients. Methods: The information about pediatric patients who underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was abstracted from the radiology information system in one general hospital between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012. The radiation doses were calculated using the ImPACT Patient Dosimetry Calculator and the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of thyroid cancer incidence was estimated based on the National Academies Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII model. Results: The subjects comprised 922 children, 68 % were males, and received 971 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The range of typical radiation dose to the thyroid {{was estimated to be}} 0. 61 – 0. 92 mGy for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 1. 10 – 2. 45 mGy for head <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and 2. 63 – 5. 76 mGy for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The LAR of thyroid cancer were as follows: for head CT, 1. 1 per 100, 000 for boys and 8. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 0. 4 per 100, 000 for boys and 2. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 2. 2 per 100, 000 for boys and 14. 2 per 100, 000 for girls. The risk of thyroid cancer was substantially higher for girls than for the boys, and from chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was higher than that from head or paransal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Conclusions: Chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> caused higher thyroid dose and the LAR of thyroid cancer incidence, compared with paransal sinus or head <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to protect the thyroid when children underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> especially chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} make a {{retrospective}} analysis of pediatric patients with head traumas that were admitted to one hospital setting and {{to make a}}n analysis of the patients for whom follow-up <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained. METHODS: Pediatric head trauma cases were retrospectively retrieved from the hospital’s electronic database. Patients’ charts, <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and surgical notes were evaluated by one of the authors. Repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> for operated patients were excluded from the total number of repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and thirty-eight pediatric patients were admitted to the clinic due to head traumas. Brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was requested in 863 patients (76 %) in the cohort. Follow-up brain <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained in 102 patients.

METHODS: The Echography in Spondylarthritis French cohort consists of 489 patients with suspected SpA. At baseline, all patients underwent clinical examination, HLA-B typing, and pelvic radiography. Pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> was performed if sacroiliitis on radiography was considered uncertain or if patients presented with buttock pain duration of > 6 months. A set of 100 paired radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was read in a blinded manner by 2 radiologists, and the kappa coefficient {{was used to assess}} their interreader reliability. One of the radiologists read the 173 available pairs of radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> performed at baseline. RESULTS: After training, interreader reliability was moderate for sacroiliitis grading on radiographs (κ = 0. 59), excellent on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 91), and excellent for ascertaining sacroiliitis on both radiographs (κ = 1) and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 96). The first and second readers considered the quality of imaging to be excellent in 66 % and 67 %, respectively, of the radiographs (κ = 0. 88) and in 93 % and 92 %, respectively, of the <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 93). Concordance between radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was low for sacroiliitis grading (κ = 0. 08) or ascertainment (κ = 0. 16).

If spine surgeons can create the optimal surgical pathway before surgery and then merge the pre-planned pathway onto the real patient <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in the operating room, the result will be efficiency and better time management for the spine surgeon. Our objective was to analyze the feasibility of merging computed tomography (CT) preplanned with sacroiliac fusion iliosacral screw trajectories with the original <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Methods: Twenty-seven patients were identified from the institutional Faculty Group Practice who had undergone <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in the pelvic region. The pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were transferred to Medtronic’s StealthStation®, which allowed for analysis in coronal, sagittal, and axial sections. Three trajectories were mapped out, representing three working pathways for fixation. The position of the trajectories was localized by measuring their distance from anatomic landmarks. The <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> with the planned trajectories was merged with the original <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> The same measurements made pre-merge were performed post-merge to check for the accuracy of the merging process. Results: Post-merge measurements were nearly identical to pre-merge measurements, with a maximum difference of ± 0. 1 mm. No significant differences existed between pre-merge and post-merge measurements for any of the trajectories Conclusion: The merging of preplanned trajectory <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> with intraoperative <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> is a highly accurate technique...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate whether surgeons can predict the usefulness of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> to facilitate choice of treatment plan and/or pre-operative planning for DRF. Four surgeons evaluated 51 patients with displaced DRF. The choice of treatment (operative or nonoperative) was based on conventional radiographs. Subsequently, the surgeons were asked whether they would have requested an additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> to determine this treatment choice, and also whether they required a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for pre-operative planning. After 4  weeks, the additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was provided and the cases were assessed again. Based on these data, we calculated the number needed to scan (NNS) and number needed to harm (NNH) for two decision models. Model 1 : Only provide a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> if the surgeon requested one based on their judgment of the X-rays. Model 2 : <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> for all displaced intra-articular DRF. For choice of treatment, the NNS was lower for model 1 than for model 2 (2.6 vs. 4.3) and the NNH is higher for model 1 (3.1 vs. 1.3). For pre-operative planning, the NNS (1.3 vs. 1.4) and NNH (3.7 vs. 3.4) were comparable for both models.

We aimed to explore demand for <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in a busy general hospital with particular interest {{in the period of}} transition from paediatric to adult medical care. METHODS: We used an observational epidemiological study based in a teaching hospital. Data were obtained on numbers and rates of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> from 2009 to 2015. The main outcome was age-stratified rates of receiving a <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> RESULTS: There were a total of 262, 221 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> There was a large step change in the rate of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> over the period of transition from paediatric to adult medical care. Individuals aged 10 - 15 years experienced 6. 7 <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> per 1000 clinical episodes, while those aged 19 - 24 years experienced 19. 8 <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> per 1000 clinical episodes (p< 0. 001).
