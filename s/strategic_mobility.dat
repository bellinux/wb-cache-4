25|$|India is {{currently}} re-organising its mechanised forces to achieve <b>strategic</b> <b>mobility</b> and high-volume firepower for rapid thrusts into enemy territory. India proposes to progressively induct {{as many as}} 248 Arjun MBT and to develop and induct the Arjun MK-II variant, 1,657 Russian-origin T-90S main-battle tanks (MBTs). The army is procuring 2,000 pieces of night vision devices for T-72 tanks for Rs 10billion; 1,200 pieces for T-90 tanks for Rs 9.60billion and 1,780 pieces for infantry combat vehicles for Rs 8.60billion. It is also acquiring 700 TISAS (thermal imaging stand alone systems) and 418 TIFACS (thermal fire control systems) for its T-72 fleet {{at a cost of}} around $230 million. 300 Israeli TISAS were installed as part of several T-72 upgrade phases, followed by 3,860 image intensifier-based night-vision devices. 310 Russian produced T-90S Main Battle Tanks were also fitted with French Catherine TI cameras.|$|E
25|$|Against US {{forces the}} record is more mixed. There {{were a number of}} successes {{particularly}} in ambushes, sapper attacks and various other engagements. When entrenched in strong positions, they were able to exact a price on attacking American troops, before withdrawing to cross-border sanctuaries to fight another day. VC/NVA operations however were sometimes marked by very heavy casualties. Typical of these were the Tet attacks and the border battles that saw heavy losses against superior US air, ground and naval firepower. American <b>strategic</b> <b>mobility,</b> using airpower and helicopters also took a heavy toll and blunted several communist initiatives, most notably at the Ia Drang, Tet and other places. In general during the war, US forces caused far more casualties to the VC/NVA than the other way round. However, the communist forces were usually able to replenish their forces. Expansion of the battle-space over a wide area, and attrition over time however, the linchpin of their protracted war strategy, kept their forces intact until this formidable opponent withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} was to mount the guns, still on their carriages, on rail cars to increase their <b>strategic</b> <b>mobility.</b> The gun's firing platform (Bettungslafette) {{was used as a}} model for the mount on the rail car. A metal ring was fixed to the surface of the car on which the wheels rested. At the center of this ring was a large pivot pin from which tension rods extended to the carriage's trail which rested against a circular section of rail. The gun was traversed by means of a gear that engaged pins on the outside of the rail. The trail rested on two spring-supported rollers, which would compress during firing and allow the shock of recoil to be transmitted to the floor of the car. To prevent damage to the trucks during firing cast-steel wedges were placed on the railroad ties under matching wedges on the car and the car was moved up on them. Some sources quote its maximum elevation as 47.5°, but Miller says that the sight on the gun itself was only calibrated to 45°. If more traverse was needed the gun's original firing platform was carried on a separate car and the gun could be dismounted to use it.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 December Gort {{recommended}} to the Chiefs of Staff that Britain {{would need to}} help France defend Holland and Belgium and that for that purpose the British Army needed complete equipment for four Regular army infantry divisions and two mobile armoured divisions, with the Territorial army armed with training equipment and then war equipment for four divisions. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, replied that Britain's continental commitment {{might not be a}} limited liability. Gort replied: [...] "Lord Kitchener had clearly pointed out that no great country can wage a “little” war". He also attacked as a fallacy the theory of <b>strategic</b> <b>mobility</b> by the use of seapower because in modern war land transport was faster and cheaper than transport by sea. The experience of David Lloyd George's 1917 Alexandretta project [...] "proved that [...] invariably led to vast commitments out of all proportion to the value of the object attained". If a purely defensive position was taken the Maginot Line would be broken and that the British Army (with anti-aircraft defence) was only getting £277million out of a total £2,000million spent on defence.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{mobility}} {{planning is}} an important policy issue for municipalities nowadays. In order to achieve a more sustainable transport system, municipalities a) need to coordinate their policies within the government system and b) involve external actors to get input and knowledge and increase public acceptability of policy measures. This thesis therefore researched the involvement of governmental and non-governmental actors in <b>strategic</b> urban <b>mobility</b> plans. This research is a comparative case-study between Malmö (Sweden) and Utrecht (the Netherlands) and uses the New Institutional Approach. Main conclusions were that governmental stakeholder involvement practices are quite similar in both countries: they both strive for policy coordination in urban mobility planning. In terms of non-governmental stakeholder involvement, Dutch municipalities involve non-governmental stakeholders more and earlier on in the process than municipalities in Sweden.

40|$|Purpose. The current rapid {{social and}} {{economic}} developments show mobility {{as the most important}} factor of economic growth, social and cultural progress. Mobile technology has undergone a sea change over the past ten years. The evolution of mobility is about creating better ways to change the world. It will increasingly shape our lives and thinking in ways we cannot fully anticipate. Mobile revolution is a global reality which creates new opportunities and challenges for all companies in the world. Methodology. Proposed methodological approach is based on a comprehensive assessment of the <b>strategic</b> impact of <b>mobility</b> on the organization as a major tool to improve competitiveness and efficiency of the company. During the research have been used both qualitative and quantitative methods. As a result, the article provides bridges between the field of mobility, organization science, information systems, and certain aspects of philosophy. Findings. This research provides a glimpse into the fast-evolving world of mobile technology and maybe even faster evolving world of organizations. The research is designed to understand the <b>strategic</b> impact of <b>mobility</b> on organizations, and evaluate the benefits of integration of these new technologies into the company. The research comprised of an extensive literature review, observation of existing practices, and semi-structured interviews geared toward understanding the <b>strategic</b> impact of <b>mobility</b> on organization and its employees. Originality. The research findings suggest three main strategic implications of mobility: (1) improve working process; (2) increase internal communication and knowledge sharing; and (3) enhance sales and marketing effectiveness. Practical value. The use of mobile technology and it impact on organizational change and strategy, stability and development of competitive advantage allow the company to ensure the effectiveness of its business. Mobility can dramatically transform the company by finding their feet in almost every sector and it has a profound impact on both customers as well as employees. Mobility solutions are growing across business portfolios of company and driving by the need to increase productivity. They improve decision making, with increased near real-time access through mobile channels that help to improve internal employee interaction, customer collaboration, network building and information sharing...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{strategic}} management often assumes stability of the industry and focuses on the static relationship between strategy and performance. However, firms pursuing a long term competitive advantage need to recognize the changing nature of their firm, competitors, and industry. Instability may more closely characterize the industry setting for competition over time. To date, few studies have investigated industry changes acknowledging periods of stability and instability and the corresponding implication for strategy and performance. ^ This study investigates the changing nature of strategy and performance of firms in the US domestic airline industry from 1969 - 1988. The industry was chosen for its periodic instability and experience with the exogenous shock of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. After identifying stable and unstable periods through quantitative and qualitative analyses, hypotheses focusing on changes in <b>strategic</b> repositioning, <b>mobility</b> barriers, and performance were tested. ^ Major findings suggest that increased strategic repositioning is associated with industry instability. However, just prior to the exogenous shock strategic repositioning accelerated to levels greater than any period after deregulation. Further, <b>strategic</b> viability and <b>mobility</b> barriers demonstrated a curvilinear relationship. Strategic groups that moved incrementally against industry-wide mobility barriers realized the greatest viability. In contrast, groups that either moved significantly or minimally showed the least viability. During the deregulated period, higher performance was associated with the more strategically stable positions. Under regulation, performance did not vary with strategic stability or instability. ^ Implications for strategy researchers and managers converge on the need to recognize the past and present effect and future implications of the industry context on the evolving competitive patterns. Mobility barriers should be examined for their potential impact on facilitating (low mobility barriers) or inhibiting (high <b>mobility</b> barriers) <b>strategic</b> repositioning. Future research could investigate other industries experiencing periodic stability and instability (domestically and internationally). In addition, managers could be studied to identify the actions associated with their interpretation of industry dynamics and strategic change. ...|$|R

This report investigates whether transportation policies should include mobility management objectives, such as targets to reduce vehicle travel and encourage use of alternative modes. Such objectives are justified on several grounds. Mobility management objectives provide guidance to help individual short-term decisions support <b>strategic,</b> long-term goals. <b>Mobility</b> management can provide numerous benefits. Many mobility management strategies are market and planning reforms that increase transport system efficiency and equity. Mobility management objectives help shift planning practices to better prepare for future demands.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedProjecting a credible land combat {{power to a}} potential conflict area {{in a timely manner}} requires rapid <b>strategic</b> sealift <b>mobility</b> with high capacity. A highly deployable, light, yet sufficiently lethal force capable of deterrence or sustaining combat is necessary to accomplish this objective. The Army's initial steps towards transformation seek to establish that ability. This transformation requires having lighter forces with quicker deployment times, thereby turning the Army from the Legacy Force, made up of both well-equipped heavy war fighting forces which are difficult to deploy strategically, and rapidly responding light forces which lack staying power against heavy mechanized forces, into an Interim Force of Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT). The SBCT combines the capacity for rapid deployment with survivability and tactical mobility. The Army's objective is to deploy the Stryker Brigade Combat Team, a brigade-sized force equipped with medium weight armored vehicles, anywhere in the world within 96 hours (Vick, 2002). This thesis determines the mix of sealift assets best suited for different scenarios that differ by distance and port accessibility as well as analyzes the implications of these findings on Army deployment doctrine. This is accomplished in two ways. First, two specific scenarios are used to develop the initial requirements and best mix of assets for SBCT deployment based on a fictional Kosovo campaign. Additionally, a preliminary analysis is conducted of the three feasible configuration options. The options are (1) TSVs only, (2) LMSRs only or (3) a combination of the two. These three options are compared using fixed cargo requirements and their performance versus cost is analyzed based on the Kosovo campaign distances.
