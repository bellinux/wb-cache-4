40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an architecture pattern for information systems that require complex search capabilities. The pattern includes means to generically describe <b>search</b> <b>requests,</b> {{a service that}} interprets <b>search</b> <b>requests</b> and executes them on data sources, and strategies for transmitting results back to the requesting clients. - 1 -Context A typical information system retrieves and manipulates business data in many different ways. <b>Search</b> <b>requests</b> to fetch business data are often created and executed in the middle tier of a three-tier system architecture; sometimes they are dynamically created in a client application. These are a few examples (see Fig. 1) : Business logic has {{to be applied to}} a set of business objects. The objects have to be found and retrieved before they can be modified. A client application provides a search dialog that lets users dynamically compose complex <b>search</b> <b>requests.</b> An application server executes the queries on a data source and returns the results to the client application, where they are shown.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in the use of knowledge discovery applications requires end users to write complex database <b>search</b> <b>requests</b> to retrieve information. Such users are not only expected to grasp the structural complexity of complex databases but also the semantic relationships between data stored in databases. In order to overcome such difficulties, researchers have been focusing on knowledge representation and interactive query generation through ontologies, with particular emphasis on improving the interface between data and <b>search</b> <b>requests</b> in order to bring the result sets closer to users research requirements. This paper discusses ontology-based information retrieval approaches and techniques by taking into consideration the aspects of ontology modelling, processing and the translation of ontological knowledge into database <b>search</b> <b>requests.</b> It also extensively compares the existing ontology-to-database transformation and mapping approaches in terms of loss of data and semantics, structural mapping and domain knowledge applicability. The research outcomes, recommendations and future challenges presented in this paper can bridge the gap between ontology and relational models to generate precise <b>search</b> <b>requests</b> using ontologies. Moreover, the comparison presented between various ontology-based information retrieval, database-to-ontology transformations and ontology-to-database mappings approaches provides a reference for enhancing the searching capabilities of massively loaded information management systems...|$|R

50|$|When LDAP servers {{are in a}} {{replicated}} topology, LDAP clients {{should consider}} using the post-read control to verify updates instead of a search after an update.

50|$|If a <b>search</b> <b>request</b> {{turns up}} a result, the node {{that has the}} result {{contacts}} the searcher. In the classic gnutella protocol, response messages were sent back along the route the query came through, as the query itself did not contain identifying information of the node. This scheme was later revised, so that search results now are delivered over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) directly to the node that initiated the search, usually an ultrapeer of the node. Thus, in the current protocol, the queries carry the IP address and port number of either node. This lowers the amount of traffic routed through the gnutella network, making it significantly more scalable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture pattern for information systems that involve complex searches. It is targeted to system architects that need a flexible solution for handling <b>search</b> <b>requests</b> from clients with different needs. It includes means to generically describe <b>search</b> <b>requests,</b> {{a service that}} is interpreting and executing <b>search</b> <b>requests,</b> and strategies for transmitting results back to the requesting clients. Context A typical information system handles {{a lot of business}} data. Processing the data often requires powerful and flexible means for searching. These are a few examples (see figure 1) : Business logic has to be applied to a set of business objects. The objects have to be found and retrieved before they can be modified. A client application contains a search dialog by means of which users may create arbitrary queries. An application server has to execute the queries on a data source and return the results to the client application where they are shown. A reporting tool has to find and process data from different sources. Each report is statically defined but may take user input in form of parameters. Creating the reports may involve operations that are not directly supported by the underlying data source. <b>Search</b> <b>requests</b> are typically formulated within the middle tier of a three-tier system architecture, sometimes they are dynamically created in a client application. Problem An information system needs complex search capabilities. It may be possible to manually write native query statements, execute those queries, evaluate the results, and send the results back to the requesting client. This approach has severe drawbacks if any of the following constraints exists: Dynamics- <b>search</b> <b>requests</b> cannot be statically defined at compile-time...|$|R
