While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling communist parties around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of one-party states (whatever their ideology), dominant parties in democratic systems (whatever their ideology), and social democratic parties.|$|E
5|$|Details on {{the retreat}} of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} {{than in most}} other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of Communism {{there has been a}} large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E

40|$|Collapse {{models are}} {{modifications}} of quantum theory where the wave function {{is treated as}} physically real and <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of <b>the</b> wave function is a physical process. This appears to introduce a time reversal asymmetry into the dynamics of <b>the</b> wave function <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapses</b> affect only <b>the</b> future state. This paper challenges this conclusion, showing that in three different examples of time asymmetries associated with <b>collapse</b> models, if <b>the</b> physically real part of the model {{can be reduced to}} the locations in space and time about which collapses occur, then such a model works both forward and backward in time, in each case satisfying the Born rule. Despite the apparent asymmetry of <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> process, these models in fact have time reversal symmetry. Any physically observed time asymmetries that arise in such models are due to the asymmetric imposition of initial or final time boundary conditions, rather than from an inherent asymmetry in the dynamical law. This is the standard explanation of time asymmetric behaviour resulting from time symmetric laws. Comment: 26 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
