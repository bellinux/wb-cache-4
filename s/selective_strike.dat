2500|$|A whipsaw strike (also {{called a}} <b>selective</b> <b>strike)</b> is a strike by a trade union against {{only one or}} a few {{employers}} in an industry or a multi-employer association at a time. The strike is often of a short duration, and usually recurs during the labor dispute or contract negotiations—hence the name [...] "whipsaw".|$|E
5000|$|Hobet miners were {{involved}} in the United Mine Workers' (UMW) <b>selective</b> <b>strike</b> in 1993, which included workers from five states. At the time, just 30% of mining was union protected, and miners struggled to maintain their power. Hobet's union ultimately accepted lower wages in exchange for an [...] "exceptional" [...] health plan. Another major UMW protest took place in 2015, at the Patriot Coal headquarters. Workers objected to the bankrupted Patriot's intentions to sell its assets to Blackhawk Mining, canceling contracts, benefits, and retiree pensions in the process. Patriot Coal claimed the miners would probably have job opportunities at Blackhawk, or with the conservation group, Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund, that is panning to restore former Hobet mine lands—but that was not guaranteed.|$|E
50|$|Miss Esterman was {{a senior}} legal {{assistant}} in Islington LBC. NALGO ballotted members for a strike, to increase the London weighting. Of those who voted, 49% were in favour of selected strikes, and 48% were against, and 3% did not answer. It got the employer to agree but was vetoed by government under its counter-inflation policy. The union in Islington was instructed to do <b>selective</b> <b>strikes,</b> where 64% voted in favour. This was to boycott the elections in May 1974. Miss Esterman refused {{to comply with the}} instruction and was disciplined according to NALGO’s rules. She sought an interlocutory injunction to prevent expulsion.|$|R
50|$|Hoffa {{achieved}} {{his goal}} of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement, the National Master Freight Agreement, in 1964. Hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement, which authorized <b>selective</b> <b>strikes</b> against particular employers, to police the agreement or, if Hoffa thought that it served the union's interest, to drive marginal employers out of the industry. The union won substantial gains for its members, fostering a nostalgic image of the Hoffa era as the golden age for Teamster drivers. Hoffa also succeeded where Tobin had failed, concentrating power at the international level, dominating the conferences which Beck and Dobbs had helped build.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of his}} deficit {{reduction}} plan, Obama announced that the growth of security spending would be reduced by four percent from previously planned increases, by holding the spending increases below the rate of inflation. A great deal of this cost containment (in money {{and the loss of}} American servicemen) came from replacing massive land invasions with <b>selective</b> drone <b>strikes</b> or special operations missions that have resulted in the deaths of top terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden.|$|R
40|$|How should trial experts {{approach}} {{cases of}} racial profiling? As a British philosopher, albeit {{one who has}} {{lived and worked in}} the States, all I can offer are some suggestions and some questions to help readers make the most of their expertise. These are motivated by two concerns. First, from a British perspective, American jury selection is alien {{to our understanding of the}} ideal that people are tried by ‘a jury of their peers’. In particular, the American practice of <b>selective</b> <b>strikes</b> raises the worry that you cannot consistently ask jurors to evaluate the use of race-based expectations by police when the jury selection process, itself, is shaped by the idea that race is a good predictor of people’s beliefs and behaviour. The second concern is an extension and generalisation of the first, and exemplifies the problems posed by racial profiling: what does it mean to treat people as equals in a world where people are disadvantaged because of their race? I will take these concerns in reverse order, briefly say something about them, and then suggest some approaches to racial profiling that, I hope, will be of practical, as well as theoretical, use...|$|R
5000|$|Lewis was {{appointed}} {{a member of}} the Labor Advisory Board and the National Labor Board of the National Recovery Administration in 1933 and used it to raise wages of miners and reduce competition. He gambled on a massive membership drive and won, as he piggybacked on FDR's popularity: [...] "The President wants you to join the UMW!" [...] Coal miners represented many ethnic groups, and Lewis shrewdly realized that they shared a faith in Roosevelt; he was careful not to antagonize any of the ethnic groups, and he appealed to African American members as well. He secured the passage of the Guffey Coal Act in 1935 and then the Guffey-Vinson Act in 1937 when the 1935 act was declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, both of them favorable to miners. Lewis had long had the idea that the highly competitive bituminous coal industry, with its sharp ups and downs and cut-throat competition, could be stabilized by a powerful union that set a standard wage scale and could keep recalcitrant owners in line with <b>selective</b> <b>strikes.</b> The acts made that possible, and coal entered a golden era. At all times, Lewis rejected socialism and promoted competitive capitalism.|$|R
50|$|The Politburo debates {{the nuclear}} option intensely. Eventually, {{it was decided}} that any use of nuclear weapons would inevitably {{escalate}} to a full strategic exchange which would leave the USSR so damaged as to make victory not worth while. Variant C was therefore chosen, augmented with some <b>selective</b> chemical <b>strikes</b> occurring where they might prove to be most effective, with the understanding that if the advance of Warsaw Pact forces was halted by Western resistance (led by NATO), nuclear weapons could be used to regain the initiative on the battlefield.|$|R
40|$|Fake News" {{have pushed}} up {{the agenda of}} discussions among journalists and are {{beginning}} to dominate debate about the future direction of journalism and its current ailments. Clearly, fake news is not only about alternative facts, {{but in some ways}} about how the media industry has been adjusting to new technologies and digital reality. It is also about how the democratising effect of the internet and horizontal news distribution is being exploited and reverted back to information dominance models by powerful interests at the time of geopolitical clashes. From {{the point of view of}} journalism, it is perhaps about applying journalistic principles and news values to alternative narratives in order to produce mental short-cuts required in the digital reality increasingly accepting only Twitter-length messages. But ultimately, the fake news phenomenon is about fast disappearing editorial processes - one of the most expensive manifestations of genuine journalism for which big media conglomerates and media-related companies no longer want to pay. In an ideological fight or a political conflict a hoax or a spoof story provides a convenient shortcut: rather than argue out your point of view against the arguments of the opponent, you demolish their narrative with carpet bombing or <b>selective</b> <b>strikes</b> of well crafted fake news. Brexit, US presidential election, and the Ukraine conflict have provided ample evidence that the culture of producing “alternative facts” is gaining the upper hand once the watchful eye of the media has been deprived of the power of the editorial lenses...|$|R
5000|$|When {{railroad}} craft unions {{merged into}} the UTU {{they expected to}} increase their bargaining power on issues like restoring train crews to pre-1960s levels and maintaining crew and passenger safety {{in the face of}} increasingly automated systems. [...] But, the industry’s continued financial decline, and especially the 1970 collapse of the Penn Central, undermined union strategies: While the UTU helped organize the Congress of Railway Unions, in 1969, to lobby for protective legislation and coordinate collective-bargaining efforts, and called a series of <b>selective</b> <b>strikes</b> to protest the findings of a Presidential Mediation board in 1971, railroad executives and the federal government were working to streamline the industry and cut costs, particularly labor costs. In order to preserve passenger service, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak (created in 1970) eliminated unprofitable lines, and some 16,000 jobs according to the UTU. In order to preserve freight rail service in the financially shaky Northeastern market, the Consolidated Rail Corporation or Conrail (established in 1973) took over the remnants of seven bankrupted railroads. In the process, thousands of miles of unprofitable track were abandoned and railroads were permitted to change rates and service obligations more easily than in the past, a trend that continued after the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. According to the CATO Institute, the Staggers Act “marked the most significant change in rail policy since the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887” since it eliminated most common-carrier obligations, granted increased commercial freedom, and generally deregulated the railroad industry.|$|R
40|$|Mating {{behaviours}} {{and reproductive}} decisions are of key importance to evolutionary fitness. However, {{it is often}} difficult to measure and compare the fitness of different individuals, especially in long-lived species, and for behaviours that are subject to multiple <b>selective</b> forces. A <b>striking</b> exception though is the field of sex-allocation research, which is a triumphant success of evolutionary theory (Charnov 1982). The reason for this success is that, following Fisher (1958), the fitness consequences of different sex ratios can be readily predicted and tested analytically. These predictions are very amenable to empirical testing and provide a platform to measure the precision of adaptation, which is crucial for understanding the nature of evolutionary change.

40|$|This international, multidisciplinary, {{workshop}} was {{hosted by}} cii – the Centre for International Intervention - at the University of Surrey and {{was sponsored by}} the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University. The workshop’s objective was to explore how new <b>selective</b> precision <b>strike</b> capabilities available to military and intelligence forces are shaping approaches to international intervention. It aimed to be a forum for dialogue between different academic disciplines, as well as between academia and policy-makers/practitioners. Hence papers were encouraged that addressed the subject from behavioural, ethical, legal and politico/military perspectives – or a combination of these perspectives. A further aim was to explore these issues from the viewpoint of those {{on the receiving end of}} international intervention as well as those who carry it out. As the workshop took shape, it became apparent that the principal focus would be on the increasing offensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or “drones”, a topic of increasing public debate as well as policy relevance.

40|$|The work {{emphasizes}} {{the suitability of}} Coded orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (COFDM) which is a technique of modulation for 3 G transceiver systems. The performance of a COFDM system may be affected due to the main factors which were measured comprising of channel noise, multipath delay spread, distortion of the signal (clipping) {&} requirement of timing. Using MATLAB to access the performance of COFDM the computer simulations is performed [18]. In the 3 rd generation mobile phone system CDMA modulation techniques is mainly proposed for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). For the comparison between the two techniques to be established Code Division Multiple Access was used. It was observed and found on examination that a very high tolerance to channel noise, peak power clipping, multipath delay spread as was provided by COFDM [12]. On observation total immunity to multipath delay spread was found in COFDM and provided less reflection time {{as compared to the}} guard interval used in COFDM signal. We are aware that multipath signal would provide strengthening to the received signal. Corresponding to multipath reflection of 30 km, delay spread up to 100 μsec could be borne.

40|$|Histone H 1 has {{sometimes}} been reported to undergo quantitative and/or qualitative changes during germination of seeds, but the overall picture on this topic is far from clear. A re-examination of this problem seemed therefore of interest. The H 1 content from root tips of ungerminated pea embryos (with nuclei in a completely quiescent state) have been {{compared with that of}} seedlings germinated for 48 and 96 h (with nuclei actively involved in transcription and replication). As well as conventional analysis by gel electrophoresis, which seemed to indicate a <b>striking</b> <b>selective</b> decrease of H 1 content as germination proceeded, a completely different approach was used: biparametric analysis with flow cytometry, utilizing the indirect immunofluorescence of nuclei previously treated with a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against pea H 1. This proved to be a powerful approach and the results ruled out the possibility of a true depletion of H 1 during germination events. Data from SDS electrophoresis of whole nuclear proteins and Northern blot analysis of the H 1 b cDNA during maturation and germination of pea seeds supported this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} characterised by selective degeneration of motoneurones. Familial ALS is an age-dependent autosomal dominant disorder in which mutations in the homodimeric enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) {{is linked to the}} disease. An animal model for this disease is a transgenic mouse expressing the mutated human SOD 1 G 93 A gene. Recent electrophysiological data emphasised that the <b>striking</b> <b>selective</b> vulnerability of motoneurones might be due to their differential calcium buffering capacities. Therefore we have investigated, using immunohistochemistry, the expression of different calcium binding proteins in brainstem and spinal cord from normal and SOD 1 mutated mice. Among the 13 calcium-binding proteins screened, only one, S 100 A 6, a homodimeric calcium-binding protein able to bind four Zn 2 +, appeared to be highly expressed in the SOD 1 mutated mice. In brainstem, reactive astrocytes, but not motoneurones, from several regions, including nerve 12 root, were highly S 100 A 6 -positive. Hypoglossal nucleus was negative for S 100 A 6. In dorsal root, reactive astrocytes from both white matter and anterior horn were highly reactive.

40|$|SummaryParkinson’s disease (PD) is {{a common}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder that displays both sporadic and inherited forms [1]. Exposure to several common environmental toxins acting through oxidative stress {{has been shown to}} be associated with PD [2]. One recently identified inherited PD gene, DJ- 1, may have a role in protection from oxidative stress [3 – 10], thus potentially linking a genetic cause with critical environmental risk factors. To develop an animal model that would allow integrative study of genetic and environmental influences, we have generated Drosophila lacking DJ- 1 function. Fly DJ- 1 homologs exhibit differential expression: DJ- 1 β is ubiquitous, while DJ- 1 α is predominantly expressed in the male germline. DJ- 1 α and DJ- 1 β double knockout flies are viable, fertile, and have a normal lifespan; however, they display a <b>striking</b> <b>selective</b> sensitivity to those environmental agents, including paraquat and rotenone, linked to PD in humans. This sensitivity results primarily from loss of DJ- 1 β protein, which also becomes modified upon oxidative stress. These studies demonstrate that fly DJ- 1 activity is selectively involved in protection from environmental oxidative insult in vivo and that the DJ- 1 β protein is biochemically responsive to oxidative stress. Study of these flies will provide insight into the critical interplay of genetics and environment in PD...|$|R

40|$|Specific {{fractionation}} of immunologically {{competent cells}} derived from normal or immune animals {{was achieved by}} filtration through antigen-coated bead columns. This selective retention of the relevant reactive cells could be shown to produce a cell population, which after passage through the column would behave like a suspension rendered immunologically tolerant by "classical" means. The immunologically specific elimination of potential antibody-forming capacity of the filtered cells could be shown to affect the IgM and the IgG system to a similar extent. Analysis of the binding characteristics of the membrane antibodies responsible for this <b>selective</b> retention indicate <b>striking</b> similarities {{to those of the}} humoral antibodies produced against the antigen. Thus, the surface receptor could distinguish isolated haptenic groups on a "foreign" carrier background and the receptor of the hapten-reactive cells in the present system (high-rate antibody-forming cells against NIP) failed to combine with carrier specific determinants in analogy with the binding behavior of the serum anti-hapten antibodies. The binding of anti-hapten reactive cells to bead-attached haptens could be specifically inhibited by the presence of free hapten in the columnar fluid during cellular filtration. The results strongly suggest that the potential humoral antibody-forming cell has preformed receptors on its outer surface with binding characteristics, indicating similarity, if not identity, to those of the eventual product of the cell, the humoral antibody...|$|R
40|$|Population {{structure}} {{can provide}} novel {{insight into the}} human past, and recognizing and correcting for such stratification is a practical concern in gene mapping by many association methodologies. We investigate these patterns, primarily through principal component (PC) analysis of whole genome SNP polymorphism, in 2099 individuals from populations of Northern European origin (Ireland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and HapMap European-American). The major trends (PC 1 and PC 2) demonstrate an ability to detect geographic substructure, even over a small area like the British Isles, and this information can then be applied to finely dissect the ancestry of the European-Australian and European-American samples. They simultaneously point {{to the importance of}} considering population stratification in what might be considered a small homogeneous region. There is evidence from F(ST) -based analysis of genic and nongenic SNPs that differential positive selection has operated across these populations despite their short divergence time and relatively similar geographic and environmental range. The pressure appears to have been focused on genes involved in immunity, perhaps reflecting response to infectious disease epidemic. Such an event may explain a <b>striking</b> <b>selective</b> sweep centered on the rs 2508049 -G allele, close to the HLA-G gene on chromosome 6. Evidence of the sweep extends over a 8 -Mb/ 3. 5 -cM region. Overall, the results illustrate the power of dense genotype and sample data to explore regional population variation, the events that have crafted it, and their implications in both explaining disease prevalence and mapping these genes by association...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} {{of a specific}} autoantibody response with distinct disease phenotypes is observed in both autoimmune diseases and cancer. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, {{it is likely that}} unique properties of disease-specific autoantigens expressed in the relevant target cells play a role. It has recently been observed that the majority of autoantigens targeted across the spectrum of systemic autoimmune diseases (but not nonautoantigens) are selectively cleaved by the cytotoxic lymphocyte granule protease granzyme B (GB), generating unique fragments not observed during other forms of cell death. Although susceptibility of a molecule to cleavage by GB strongly predicts autoantigen status, the significance of this association is unclear. We used hepatocellular carcinoma and the hepatocellular carcinoma autoantigen, nucleophosmin/B 23, as a model system to define the unique features of disease-specific autoantigens in the relevant disease microenvironment. These studies revealed a <b>striking,</b> <b>selective</b> susceptibility of B 23 to cleavage by GB in extracts of neoplastic liver. The increased sensitivity of tumor B 23 to proteolysis by GB was accompanied by slightly increased mobility on SDS/PAGE, altered subcellular localization, enrichment of an SDS-stable oligomeric form of B 23, and recognition by a conformation-specific antibody detecting a B 23 epitope ending at the GB cleavage site. In vitro studies demonstrated that this unique B 23 conformation and resultant increased susceptibility to cleavage by GB arise when B 23 translation is initiated at methionine- 7. We propose that unique features of autoantigens in the disease-relevant microenvironment may regulate susceptibility to cleavage by GB and their selection by the specific autoimmune response...|$|R
40|$|LettersDomestic {{animals are}} {{excellent}} models for genetic studies of phenotypic evolution. They have evolved genetic adaptations {{to a new}} environment, the farm, and {{have been subjected to}} strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44. 5 -fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor. We report more than 7, 000, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1, 300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most <b>striking</b> <b>selective</b> sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlapped genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. We found little evidence that selection for loss-of-function mutations had a prominent role in chicken domestication, but we detected two deletions in coding sequences that we suggest are functionally important. This study has direct application to animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research...|$|R
40|$|To {{navigate}} complex acoustic environments, listeners adapt neural {{processes to}} focus on behaviorally relevant sounds in the acoustic foreground while minimizing the impact of distractors in the background, an ability referred to as top-down <b>selective</b> attention. Particularly <b>striking</b> examples of attention-driven plasticity {{have been reported in}} primary auditory cortex via dynamic reshaping of spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs). By enhancing the neural response to features of the foreground while suppressing those to the background, STRFs can act as adaptive contrast matched filters that directly contribute to an improved cognitive segregation between behaviorally relevant and irrelevant sounds. In this study, we propose a novel discriminative framework for modeling attention-driven plasticity of STRFs in primary auditory cortex. The model describes a general strategy for cortical plasticity via an optimization that maximizes discriminability between the foreground and distractors while maintaining a degree of stability in the cortical representation. The first instantiation of the model describes a form of feature-based attention and yields STRF adaptation patterns consistent with a contrast matched filter previously reported in neurophysiological studies. An extension of the model captures a form of object-based attention, where top-down signals act on an abstracted representation of the sensory input characterized in the modulation domain. The object-based model makes explicit predictions in line with limited neurophysiological data currently available but can be readily evaluated experimentally. Finally, we draw parallels between the model and anatomical circuits reported to be engaged during active attention. The proposed model strongly suggests an interpretation of attention-driven plasticity as a discriminative adaptation operating at the level of sensory cortex, in line with similar strategies previously described across different sensory modalities...|$|R
