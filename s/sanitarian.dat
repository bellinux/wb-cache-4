500|$|During the 1939 offseason, Pearson {{was nearly}} killed while hunting with William Rudolph, a 15-year-old high school {{baseball}} player from Fresno. [...] Rudolph accidentally fired his shotgun {{at the same}} time as Pearson. [...] The shot penetrated Pearson's cap and knocked it from his head. [...] Pearson, who escaped uninjured, described the incident as [...] "the thrill of [...] life." [...] In 1942, during a leave of absence away from baseball to recover from injury, Pearson worked at the Fresno Air National Guard Base as a firefighter. [...] After his Major League career ended, he planned on switching to a career in boxing, but returned to Fresno State College and graduated with a degree in chemistry. He became the chief <b>sanitarian</b> of Madera County. [...] He unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Fresno County Board of Supervisors in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, the functionalistic style made itself {{apparent}} in Östersund's outskirts, which were growing. In the 1940s, {{the city was}} made more car-friendly and the city was first and foremost planned for cars. Later the <b>sanitarian</b> issues was brought up, {{which resulted in the}} construction of a sewage treatment works and the waste water was no longer flushed directly into Storsjön. Östersund was also affected by the Million Programme, though to a lesser extent than other cities. During the same period older buildings such as Hotell Grand (to make room for Storsjöteatern), Cellfängelset (a jail located at the beginning of Prästgatan), Flickskolan (the girl school next to the city hall, where the current county library is located) and Västra stationen (at Badhusparken) were torn down. The local media described it all as e.g. [...] "demolishing madness". When the Good Templar house was threatened in order to widen Rådhusgatan the city's inhabitants had had enough and the building was saved.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1862, Henry Whitney Bellows, {{president}} of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, wrote the following to Colonel Hoffman after visiting the camp: [...] "Sir, the amount of standing water, unpoliced grounds, of foul sinks, of unventilated and crowded barracks, of general disorder, of soil reeking miasmatic accretions, of rotten bones and emptying of camp kettles, is enough to drive a <b>sanitarian</b> to despair. I hope that no thought will be entertained of mending matters. The absolute abandonment of the spot {{seems to be the}} only judicious course. I do not believe that any amount of drainage would purge that soil loaded with accumulated filth or those barracks fetid with two stories of vermin and animal exhalations. Nothing but fire can cleanse them."Hoffman already had requested improvements in the camp, but he kept the report secret because {{he did not want to}} take a position contrary to that taken by any superior, such as Quartermaster General Meigs. Not only prisoners suffered. One of Colonel Tucker's sons, who served with him at the camp, became ill and died in {{the summer of}} 1862.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{baseline}} data about the presence of HACCP and prerequisite programs in chain and independent restaurants from the perspective of <b>sanitarians</b> who inspect restaurants and to determine how those programs have changed over the past five years. A three-part written questionnaire was distributed to all Iowa and Kansas sanitarians; 36 Iowa <b>sanitarians</b> (35 %) and 18 Kansas <b>sanitarians</b> (41 %) responded. The prerequisite program most often lacking in independent restaurants was a system of standardized recipes with critical control points (4 %). <b>Sanitarians</b> noted little improvement in prerequisite programs over the past five years. Employee knowledge, time, and manager knowledge are identified as the top three barriers to implementing prerequisite and HACCP programs. Results indicate that important food safety practices need to be implemented in Iowa and Kansas restaurants. <b>Sanitarians</b> play an important role in improving food safety practices in restaurants and if more time were available to conduct inspections, <b>sanitarians</b> could provide referrals and resources specific to the needs of the operations to support food safety improvements...|$|R

60|$|It is {{just these}} {{habits of the}} gipsy which I have described, {{shocking}} to the moralist and <b>sanitarian</b> and disgusting to the person of delicate stomach, it may be, which please me, rather than the romance and poetry which the scholar-gipsy enthusiasts are fond of reading into him.

60|$|Charmian {{had been}} raised a {{vegetarian}} and a <b>sanitarian.</b> Her Aunt Netta, who brought her up and {{who lived in a}} healthful climate, did not believe in drugs. Neither did Charmian. Besides, drugs disagreed with her. Their effects were worse than the ills they were supposed to alleviate. But she listened to the argument in favour of quinine, accepted it as the lesser evil, and in consequence had shorter, less painful, and less frequent attacks of fever. We encountered a Mr. Caulfeild, a missionary, whose two predecessors had died after less than six months' residence in the Solomons. Like them he had been a firm believer in homeopathy, until after his first fever, whereupon, unlike them, he made a grand slide back to allopathy and quinine, catching fever and carrying on his Gospel work.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, the Association had {{expanded}} its vision on food protection from milk safety. As the President of the Association {{pointed out in}} 1960: “Today, we <b>sanitarians</b> must be {{equipped to deal with}} problems extending throughout the entire range of environmental health. We must solve problems of waste disposal, insect and rodent control, air pollution, housing, radiological poisoning and many others. Additionally, with more Americans eating out more often than ever before, the food service industry has become an area of responsibility such as would have been impossible for our founding Members to imagine. Recently the packaging of prepared foods of the ‘heat and eat’ variety has developed as a rapidly expanding industry that poses new sanitation problems for you to solve.” The name of the association was changed after a mail ballot in members at large in response to the expanded scope of the Association, the International Association of Milk, Food and Environmental <b>Sanitarians</b> (IAMFES).|$|R
