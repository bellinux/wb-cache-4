5|$|The {{original}} railroad between San Francisco and San Jose (known as the Peninsula Commute) {{was built}} by the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road in 1863. In 1870 the railroad was acquired by <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific.</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> double tracked the line in 1904. In 1958 the railroad had record ridership, 7.5 million passengers. The popularity of the railroad began to decline and in 1977 <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> petitioned to the state government to discontinue Peninsula Commute. After months of negotiation, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reached {{an agreement with the}} three counties of which the Peninsula Commute ran through to continue rail operation. Under the agreement, the system was renamed Caltrain and operation responsibilities were shared by Caltrans, <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> and the three counties. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board was formed in 1987, and it bought the right of way of Caltrain from <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> in late 1991 for $220million. The PCJPB formally took over the operation of Caltrain in 1992 and contracted Amtrak to operate the system. In the same year, Caltrain extended to Gilroy. Amtrak's contract with PCJPB was renewed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{northern}} and southern segments of the US395 corridor were used by railroads built in the 1880s branching from the First Transcontinental Railroad in Nevada. Both lines were intended to connect the main <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad line in Nevada with other lines, but were never completed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the battery box and air {{reservoirs}} were located {{forward of the}} fuel tank; in locomotives manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. The battery box returned to its original location in the F40PH-2. The F40PH-2s delivered to Caltrain incorporated <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad-style headlights.|$|E

5|$|Newhall granted {{right-of-way}} to <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad {{to build}} a rail line to Los Angeles and sold them {{a portion of the}} land, upon which sprang a new town that the company named after him, Newhall. Another town grew around the train station and Newhall named it after his hometown, Saugus.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court would {{eventually}} reverse criminal convictions {{due to the}} exclusion of women from the jury pool in Taylor v. Louisiana (1975) and Duren v. Missouri (1979). The fair cross-section requirement was extended to civil cases in Thiel v. <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Co. (1946), where wage earners had been excluded from the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|As {{the land}} fraud trials reached their conclusion, {{attention}} also {{turned to the}} <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad (which had acquired the O in 1887). Not only had the company violated {{the terms of the}} grant agreement, but in 1903, declared it was terminating land sales—in violation of the grant agreement—either as a hedge against future increases in land values or to retain the timber profits for itself.|$|E

This time Cook {{was able to}} penetrate deep beyond the Antarctic Circle, and on 30 January 1774 reached 71°10'S, his Farthest South, but {{the state of the}} ice made further southward travel impossible. This southern record would hold for 49years.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are {{left on the}} north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887. A train depot and post office both stood in this area, but have been torn down. Three extant farmworkers' bungalows, built by the Del Valle family in 1916, are located west of the section house.|$|E
5|$|Hays left GTR for a {{short time}} to serve as the President of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railway Company but {{returned}} to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.|$|E

No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the <b>southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The Commission {{spent much}} of 1907 {{investigating}} the railroads and other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman, holding hearings across the country. In October, Lane determined that the <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad, one of Harriman's lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} included lands {{south of}} the Gila River and west of the Rio Grande which the U.S. acquired {{so that it could}} construct a transcontinental railroad along a deep southern route, which the <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad later completed in 1881/1883. The purchase also aimed to reconcile outstanding border issues between the U.S. and Mexico following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the earlier Mexican–American War of 1846–1848.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of naming, {{tropical}} cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield {{was born}} in Dallas, Oregon, on July 12, 1922, the only son of Dovie E. (Odom) Hatfield, a schoolteacher, and Charles Dolen Hatfield, a {{blacksmith}} for the <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad. Mark's father was from California and his mother from Tennessee. When Mark was five years old, his maternal grandmother took over the household while his mother, Dovie attended Oregon State College (now Oregon State University) and graduated with a teaching degree after four years. Dovie taught school in Dallas {{for two years before}} the family moved to Salem, where she taught junior high school.|$|E
