40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the foraminal transportation during foraminal enlargement after manual instrumentation with stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files,</b> preparation with the Mtwo system and Reciproc R 25 file. Methods: Thirty roots were selected, divided in three groups and prepared {{in accordance with}} the different instrumentation systems: Hand Files (HF); Mtwo system (MS); and Reciproc system (RS). All groups were prepared with the instrumentation level 1 mm beyond the apex. Photomicrographs were performed using scanning electron microscopy, to record the foraminal anatomy before and after instrumentation. Data were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's test with a significance level of 5 %. Results: The group instrumented with hand files showed higher foraminal transportation when compared to the Mtwo and Reciproc groups (p< 0. 05). Reciproc group showed lower transportation when compared to the Mtwo group (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files</b> caused significant foraminal transportation, while Reciproc system showed safe apical preparation, with little transportation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: It was {{the goal}} of this study to compare {{different}} NaOCl activation schemes regarding a desired and an untoward outcome. Ultrasonic tips and a currently marketed sonic system were used in conjunction with a 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution. Necrotic pulp tissue dissolution in simulated accessory canals and transportation of the main canal were assessed. METHODS: Epoxy resin models (10 per group) with a curved simulated main root canal and two simulated accessory canals filled with necrotic bovine pulp tissue were irrigated passively with one of three ultrasonic setups (straight stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files,</b> prebent stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files,</b> or nickel-titanium tips) or a sonic device in conjunction with a plastic tip. Activation was performed four times for 30 seconds with replenishment of the NaOCl solution in between. All the files/tips had a 2 % taper and a 0. 15 -mm tip diameter according to the manufacturer. Data from superimposing and analyzing digital photos before and after treatment were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons (alpha < 0. 05). RESULTS: Passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) in all the groups dissolved significantly more tissue than sonic activation (p < 0. 05). No detectable canal transportation with sonic activation was observed. The difference in this outcome was not significant compared with ultrasonically activated nickel-titanium tips, whereas the straight stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files</b> caused significantly more ledging compared with these setups (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Under the current conditions, PUI with a nickel-titanium tip promoted superior tissue-dissolving effects over sonic irrigant activation while maintaining simulated canal anatomy...|$|R

40|$|During {{instrumentation}} of {{the root}} canal, {{it is important to}} develop a continuously tapered form and to maintain the original shape and position of the apical foramen. The presence of curvatures in the root canal may cause difficulty in root canal instrumentation.

40|$|An {{innovative}} earthquake resistant hybrid coupled {{shear wall}} (HCSW) system is presented.

The reinforced concrete wall is conceived to undergo limited damage and the steel links connected to the wall are the main dissipative elements and are easily replaceable. Such hybrid system might represent a cost- and time-effective type of construction since simple beam-to-column connections could be used for the steel frame constituting the gravity-resisting part and traditional and well-known building techniques are required for the reinforced concrete and steel components...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the residual dentin thickness in upper anterior teeth at 4 mm {{short of the}} apex and provide theoretical basis for the width of post space end preparation. Methods 60 upper anterior teeth with straight root canals {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 groups (n= 20) and prepared,Group A:stainless <b>steel</b> <b>file</b> conventional root canal preparation technique; Group B:Gate-Glidden drill coronal preflaring + stainless <b>steel</b> <b>file</b> conventional root canal preparation technique; Group C:ProTaper for hand crown-down technique. The roots were cut horizontally at cement-enamel junction and 4 mm short of the apex. The minimum width of residual root was measured on mesial and distal wall by a vernier caliper gauge. Results The minimum width means of residual root among 3 groups were larger than 1 mm after root canal preparation. Linear correlation analysis showed that there were no correlation between the residual dentin thickness at cement-enamel junction and 4 mm short of the apex besides B group distal wall. Conclusion 3 # peeso reamer was recommended to prepare post space end in upper anterior teeth after root canal preparation in most cases. 目的探討上頜前牙根管預備后距根尖 4 mm處根管壁的最小厚度,為臨床預備樁腔末端的寬度提供理論依據。方法離體直單根管上前牙 60 個,隨機分為 3 組(n= 20) 進行根管預備,A組:不銹鋼根管銼常規法;B組:G型鉆根管冠部預處理+不銹鋼根管銼常規法;C組:手用ProTaper鎳鈦根管銼冠向下法。所有牙齒用金剛砂片分別在距根尖 4 mm處和釉牙骨質界處截斷牙根,截斷面垂直于根管。用游標卡尺測量斷面根管近中壁、遠中壁最薄處厚度。結果三種方法根管預備后距根尖 4 mm處和釉牙骨質界處剩余根管壁厚度均數都大于 1 mm。釉牙骨質界處與距根尖 4 mm處剩余根管壁厚度之間行直線相關分析,只有B組釉牙骨質界處與距根尖 4 mm處遠中壁剩余根管壁厚度之間存在線性相關,其它組之間均不存在線性相關。結論對于大多數病例,經三種方法根管預備后,推薦使用 3 #P型鉆預備上頜前牙樁腔末端...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the periapical healing of molar root canal {{treatment}} using two instrumentation techniques. Methods: A total of 225 maxillary and mandibular first and second permanent molars endodontically treated by undergraduate or postgraduate students were randomly selected from a computerized hospital database of which 110 molars had been prepared using a hybrid rotary technique with nickel-titanium instruments (group NR) and 115 with hand stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files</b> (group HF). Patients were recalled and the teeth were examined both clinically and radiographically for signs of periapical inflammation. Results: Some 19 % and 39 % of teeth in the NR and HF group, respectively, were judged to have some form of procedural errors. A higher rate of periapical healing was noted for NR (77 %) than the HF group (60 %) (p < 0. 05). Factors contributing favorably to treatment outcome included the use of rotary technique, maxillary molar, experienced operator, and absence of preoperative radiolucent lesion. Conclusion: There was a higher incidence of procedural errors and a lower success rate for primary root canal treatment of teeth prepared with stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files</b> compared with the use of NiTi instruments in a continuous reaming action. © 2009 American Association of Endodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
