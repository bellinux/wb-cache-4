50|$|DAT/EM Systems {{immediately}} {{moved its}} <b>stereoplotter</b> interface {{and support services}} into the global marketplace and became {{a leader in the}} global digital photogrammetry industry. At the 1999 ASPRS Conference in Portland, Oregon, DAT/EM released its first all-digital <b>stereoplotter,</b> the Summit PC digital softcopy stereo workstation. Using the knowledge acquired from designing Summit PC, DAT/EM Systems moved forward to create its well-known 3D digital <b>stereoplotter,</b> Summit Evolution.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of computers, the analytical <b>stereoplotter</b> became a popular machine of choice photogrammetry in the late 1960s to 1970s. A <b>stereoplotter</b> is an instrument that uses stereo photographs to determine elevations {{for the purpose of}} creating contours on topographic maps. Computers brought the capability to execute more precise calculations that ensure additional accurate output instead of approximations. This innovation also allowed a shift to a digital format rather than paper. Analytical stereoplotters edged out their analog predecessors and became the primary method of acquiring elevation data from stereo photographs.|$|E
50|$|Stereoplotters {{have changed}} as {{technology}} has improved. The first stereoplotters where projection stereoplotters they used only the light rays and optics {{to adjust the}} image. The Kelsh Plotter {{is an example of}} the projection stereoplotters. The analog stereoplotters came next and were more sophisticated in that they used more sophisticated optics to view the image. The analytical <b>stereoplotter</b> is used today. It incorporates a computer which does the work of mathematically aligning the images so that they line up properly. The analytic <b>stereoplotter</b> also allows for storing the data and redrawing at any desired scale.|$|E
50|$|From its {{beginning}} with the <b>stereoplotters</b> used to plot contour lines on topographic maps, it now has a very wide range of uses.|$|R

40|$|A stereopair of the Large Format Camera (LFC) imagery {{covering}} {{parts of}} the Red Sea Hills Region in eastern Sudan was evaluated for topographic mapping applications in developing countries. Conventional stereoscopic plotting instruments were used as measuring equipment. The data were then processed analytically. The same stereopair was then measured on an analytical plotter using its available software. The results show that although planimetric and height accuracy values obtained with the con-ventional plotter are lower than those achieved with the analytical plotter, accuracy values of op=:!: 35 m and Oh= :!: 30 m can easily be reached with conventional photogrammetric <b>stereoplotters.</b> This is an impor-tant conclusion for many developing countries where such <b>stereoplotters</b> are readily accessible; and where trained presonnel, who can operate, maintain and service such equipment is already available...|$|R
50|$|Analytical stereoplotters use a {{mathematical}} projection {{based on the}} co-linearity (two vectors pointing in the same direction) equation model. The mechanical element of the instrument is a very accurate, computer-controlled device that compares two photographs simultaneously. The measurement system {{can be made to}} create a precise measurement for images because the photo stages only move via the x and y coordinates that are programmed into the system. The Kelsh <b>stereoplotter</b> by comparison, was built with a fixed focal distance and focal length of lens for projection. The ratio for scale was also fixed. In contrast, the analytical <b>stereoplotter</b> has no substantial limitations on focal length or scale.|$|E
50|$|Lidar (light radar) has complemented {{and often}} times {{replaced}} the <b>stereoplotter</b> for gathering elevation data. Lidar uses a laser pulse directed at features and detects {{the amount of}} time between when the pulse is emitted and when it is detected to determine the difference in elevations.|$|E
50|$|A <b>stereoplotter</b> uses stereo {{photographs}} to determine elevations. It {{has been the}} primary method to plot contour lines on topographic maps since the 1930s. Although the specific devices have advanced technologically, they are all based on the apparent change in position of a feature in the two stereo photographs.|$|E
50|$|The {{analytical}} <b>stereoplotters</b> viewing {{system has}} an optical train system, which usually includes {{the ability to}} change the focal length of a camera by adjusting the lens. Style, size and color of the measuring mark can be adjusted in viewing system as well. There is also an illumination adjustment to each eye.|$|R

40|$|Using special photogrammetric techniques, Mars' {{topography}} {{is being}} systematically mapped at {{a scale of}} 1 : 2, 000, 000 from high-altitude Viking Orbiter images. Of the 140 maps in the series, 120 have previously been compiled on the AS- 11 AM analytical <b>stereoplotters.</b> In fiscal year 1991, the remaining 20 maps will be compiled (most of these are between +/- 30 degrees latitude and the poles). Elevations on the maps {{are related to the}} Mars topographic datum. The Mars planetwide control net is used for the control of compilation. The maps have a contour interval of 1 km and a vertical precision of +/- 1 km; thus, they are more detailed than previous maps...|$|R
50|$|Elevations are {{measured}} in three steps, that include first measuring the interior orientation, then the relative orientation, {{and finally the}} absolute orientation. Interior orientation photographs are placed {{in relation to the}} center of the <b>stereoplotter</b> by aligning the fixed standard of reference points for measurement to corresponding points on the photograph. The focal length of the camera is also set. With relative orientation the angle of orientation of the camera relative to the place where the photos were, the stereo-photo is taken programmed in the <b>stereoplotter.</b> This allows the effects of parallax (distortion of the final stereo-photo) to be reduced. In absolute orientation, the ground coordinates of a position are used to scale the model. You can use this to get the x, y, or z coordinates of any position on the stereo photographs. This information can be used for the construction of contour lines for topographic maps.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1985, three Pacific Northwest photogrammetric firms {{combined}} {{resources to}} create DAT/EM Systems International based in Anchorage, Alaska. By {{the spring of}} 1987, DAT/EM Systems International had produced its first viable digital mapping product. The first product allowed AutoCAD software to accept 3D coordinate data input from an analog <b>stereoplotter.</b> A similar interface to MicroStation CAD software followed, as well as support for analytical stereoplotters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stereoplotter</b> {{requires}} two {{photographs that}} have considerable overlap (60%) and are corrected for distortion due to angle of photo. The photos are put onto transparent media and projected {{with a light}} source. Each image will be projected with overlap on the other. The operator, using a special set of optics, would then see the image as three-dimensional due to the differing perspective of each photo.|$|E
50|$|Originally, <b>stereoplotters</b> {{recorded}} {{the path of}} the flying light spot by directly scribing the path on a sheet of acetate or polyester coated with an opaque lacquer, which could be photographed to make the topographic map printing plates. If mistakes were made during contour tracing, the operator would daub some lacquer on the incorrect trace, allow it to dry and then try flying the light spot again. Current systems that use digital capture techniques allow simple erasure of part of the faulty data vector in computer memory, whereupon digitizing can resume. The digital database is then combined in a graphics program with annotations and symbols, ultimately being used to produce the map printing plates with a photoplotter.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{has sought to}} demonstrate the benefits of kinematic GPS in conjunction with photogrammetric aerial triangulation for mapping purposes. The work was performed with the existing INDOT aerial camera which is quite old, and while this affected {{the accuracy of the}} results, the demonstration of capability with a likely potential for excellent results was achieved. Ground point accuracies from the strip were in the sub-meter range with only a single control point. This is contrasted with full-model control requiring 50 - 80 control points for such a strip. In order to bring accuracies down to an acceptable level, i. e. sub decimeter, {{it will be necessary to}} retrofit the INDOT camera with a better shutter event signal (or obtain a new camera). A computer program for least squares adjustment of independent models has been developed. This would permit processing of data from INDOT Wild B 8 <b>stereoplotters.</b> With a few implementation steps, INDOT would have an operational and production capability yielding significant productivity improvements...|$|R
40|$|Topographic {{maps are}} {{compiled}} by manually operated <b>stereoplotters</b> that recreate {{the geometry of}} two wide-angle overlapping stereo frame photographs. Continuous imaging systems such as strip cameras, electro-optical scanners, or linear arrays of detectors (push brooms) can also create stereo coverage from which topography can be compiled; however, the instability of an aircraft in the atmosphere makes this approach impractical. The benign environment of space permits a satellite to orbit the Earth with very high stability as long as no local perturbing forces are involved. Solid-state linear-array sensors have no moving parts and create no perturbing force on the satellite. Digital data from highly stabilized stereo linear arrays are amenable to simplified processing to produce both planimetric imagery and elevation data. A proposed satellite, called MAPSAT, could accomplish automated mapping in near real time. Image maps as large as 1 : 50, 000 scale with contours as close as 20 -m interval may be produced from MAPSAT data...|$|R
50|$|The <b>stereoplotter</b> serves an {{important}} need of allowing aerial photos {{to become the}} base for contours and elevation maps. In the United States the largest use of topographic maps is the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS has cataloged all of {{the territory of the}} United States and has produced topographic sheets for all of it. The sheets are most often used as 7.5' maps. This means there is 7.5' (0.125 degree) latitude by 7.5' (0.125 degree) longitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{analytical}} <b>stereoplotter</b> {{measuring system}} {{is made up}} of an input device for the operator to move the elevation point in three dimensions. The input device is programmed, and the digital measure of the elevation point deviation is sent to the computer. With this information, the program then is able to set and locate points for both the interior and exterior of the elevation and record measurements. The transfer of information is immediate and thus the person operating the machine is able to make any necessary adjustments to the coordinates.|$|E
50|$|Mason {{returned}} to India after the First World War and began preparing for {{his most important}} scientific project, {{the exploration of the}} Shaksgam Valley, in 1926. At that time the only westerner to see the valley had been Younghusband. Now Mason began its survey using a photo-theodolite and stereographic techniques, laboriously collecting great quantities of data. His results, plotted in Switzerland using what, at the time, was the world's most advanced <b>Stereoplotter,</b> were acclaimed as brilliantly successful, winning him the award of the 1927 Royal Geographic Society's Founder's Gold Medal.|$|E
40|$|Photogrammetry offers suitable, {{reliable}} and accurate methods for gathering data and making 3 D digital models, which have vast applications {{in design and}} implementation of information systems such as GIS. On the other hand, Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems are used for drawing, editing, and representing 3 D geometric models of features. CAD editing functions are used for simplifying data-cleaning tasks before using them in GIS systems and topology building. In the traditional photogrammetric procedures, after drawing raw map by photogrammetric instrument, several man-hours are needed for editing outputs and making them ready to be usable in CAD software or GIS environments. While for saving time and costs, if similar project is implemented by using integrated photogrammetric CAD-based systems, in real-time then map drawing and data editing steps to make it ready for GISs are carried simultaneously. A number of integrated systems have been developed so far, but they don’t support all the data-cleanup tasks {{at the time of}} digitizing. In this research, using a comprehensive logical data model and rules, IPCBS (an Integrated Photogrammtric CAD Based System) was designed, developed and implemented at Khaje-Nasir-Toosi University of technology. In order to minimize the editing procedure before using data for CAD purposes or GIS applications, IPCBS eliminates geometric and topologic errors, exactly at the same time of object digitization. Output of system can be directly entered to GIS or automatic cartography systems without any need for further editing process. Using IPCBS, {{there is no need for}} replacing traditional systems with completely digital ones and existing semi-analytical <b>stereoplotters</b> and analytical plotters, which are generally familiar for operators, can easily use these facilities.

40|$|For the {{extraction}} of topographic information about Venus from stereoradar images obtained from the Magellan Mission, a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) compilation system was developed on analytical <b>stereoplotters.</b> The system software was extensively tested by using stereoradar images from various spacecraft and airborne radar systems, including Seasat, SIR-B, ERIM XCL, and STAR- 1. Stereomodeling from radar images was proven feasible, and development is on a correct approach. During testing, the software was enhanced and modified to obtain more flexibility and better precision. Triangulation software for establishing control points by using SAR images was also developed through a joint effort with the Defense Mapping Agency. The SAR triangulation system comprises four main programs, TRIDATA, MODDATA, TRISAR, and SHEAR. The first two programs are used to sort and update the data; the third program, the main one, performs iterative statistical adjustment; and the fourth program analyzes the results. Also, input are flight data and data from the Global Positioning System and Inertial System (navigation information). The SAR triangulation system was tested with six strips of STAR- 1 radar images on a VAX- 750 computer. Each strip contains images of 10 minutes flight time (equivalent to a ground distance of 73. 5 km); the images cover a ground width of 22. 5 km. All images were collected from the same side. With an input of 44 primary control points, 441 ground control points were produced. The adjustment process converged after eight iterations. With a 6 -m/pixel resolution of the radar images, the triangulation adjustment has an average standard elevation error of 81 m. Development of Magellan radargrammetry will be continued to convert both SAR compilation and triangulation systems into digital form...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{continuous}} need for accurate forest description. Forest data at stand level {{is required in}} forestry planning, in particular when scheduling treatments {{within the next few}} years. Collection of forest data is typically acquired with subjective surveying methods in the field. However, field work is labor intensive and therefore an expensive method. An alternative to surveying methods in the field is to use remotely sensed data acquired by, e. g. optical, radar, and laser sensors. In the present thesis, different remote sensing techniques for estimation of forest variables at stand level have been evaluated. All studies were performed in hemi-boreal coniferous dominated forest at a test site in southern Sweden (lat. 58 ° 30 ’N, long. 13 ° 40 ’E), enabling a detailed comparison. Remotely sensed data were related to field data using regression analysis. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the average stem volume using airborne laser scanning data, CARABAS-II radar data, aerial photo-interpretation, and multi-spectral optical satellite data was found to be 13 %, 19 %, 21 - 24 %, and 24 - 32 %, respectively. The analyses clearly demonstrate that airborne laser scanning is the single remote sensing technique of those investigated that gives the most accurate stem volume and tree height estimates at stand level. The estimates from laser scanning data are better than commonly achieved with subjective surveying methods in the field. The accuracy of forest variable estimation using aerial photo-interpretation of Z/I DMC images was found to be in agreement with the results using conventional film-based panchromatic photos. Hence, the results indicate that photo-interpretation of Z/I DMC images using a digital photogrammetric workstation could replace photo-interpretation of film-based photos using analog or analytical <b>stereoplotters</b> without loss of accuracy. Combining two or more data sources which are complementary gives the possibility of improving estimation accuracies. Here, two particularly successful approaches were found. A combination of multi-spectral optical satellite and tree height data improved the RMSE of stem volume estimation to 11 - 12 %. Using a combination of multi-spectral optical satellite and CARABAS-II radar data improved the RMSE to about 15 %. The application of the investigated remote sensing techniques in the forestry sector is restricted to the costs and the availability of remotely sensed data. In Sweden, airborne laser scanning data might be supplied by several companies operating in a pure commercial market. The National Land Survey has the mission of aerial photo mapping on a regular basis, but aerial photo mapping is also performed by commercial companies. For multi-spectral optical satellite and CARABAS-II radar data the governmental policy effects in practice what is offered to the users...|$|R
5000|$|The optics of the <b>stereoplotter</b> is what {{allows the}} {{operator}} to plot the contours and features. The light source used {{to project the}} photo is what begins the process. One photo is projected using cyan/blue filter and the other photo is projected with a red filter. The operator wears a special set of glasses that have the same color filter for lenses. Seeing the left photo in blue light while the left eye has the blue filter and the right photo projected with red light and the right eye seeing through the red filter, the overlapping image becomes three-dimensional. The images will have control points that detail how the overlap of the photos should occur. The resultant overlapping image is called an anaglyph and is a three-dimensional model of the terrain. Once the two photos are projected and the desired control points aligned the operator will then start to record the desired elevations on the terrain by [...] "flying" [...] a light spot along the contours. If the light spot appears to hover above the terrain or appears to dive into the terrain, the operator knows that he has moved it {{too far away from}} a slope or too far toward a slope, respectively.|$|E

The <b>Stereoplotter</b> module was developed aiming at digitizing 3 D cartographic features from aerial stereopairs. In this module, the student can create, edit and save points, lines or polygons which will be used later in DEM module as break-lines. Some significant improvements were made in this module, like directly image zooming, maximizing the screen and the possibility of editing end fixing points. Moreover, several bugs were found and fixed. The DEM module was designed to generate the digital terrain model or digital surface model which can be performed by measuring points in a user pre-defined GRID or by the interpolation of 3 D points measured previously in the <b>Stereoplotter</b> module. An additional image showing the 3 D extracting results was added, therefore no 3 D viewing engine was developed. Nevertheless, the results of 3 D extraction can be exported to Octagon or Matlab for 3 D viewing. In order to analyze the accuracy of E-FOTO 3 D measuring, we performed a comparison between two sets of 3 D points generated from 2 D corresponding points from E-FOTO and from Erdas LPS 9. 3.
