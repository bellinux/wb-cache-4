25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a <b>smoldering</b> <b>fire</b> in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of November 18, 1990, the Southeast Michigan IWW General Membership Branch hosted a {{gathering}} of [...] "wobs" [...] in a remote wooded area at which a dinner, followed by a bonfire, featured a reading of Hill's last will, [...] "and then his ashes were released into the flames and carried up above the trees.... The next day ... one wob collected a bowl full of ashes from the <b>smoldering</b> <b>fire</b> pit." [...] At that event several IWW members consumed a portion of Hill's ashes before the rest was consigned to the fire.|$|E

25|$|Although {{photoelectric}} alarms {{are highly}} effective at detecting <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires</b> and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing {{what are called}} combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke, or use both the ionization and photoelectric processes. Some combination alarms may include a carbon monoxide detection capability.|$|R

40|$|Mentor: Dr. David PuiCombustion {{of common}} {{household}} items containing plastic and cellulosic {{solid and liquid}} materials results in flaming and <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires.</b> Products of combustion of these fires include H 2 O, CO 2, energy release, visible or infrared radiation, gaseous hydrocarbons, and solid and semi-volatile particles. Commercial and household smoke detectors rely on ionization and photoelectric techniques to detect particles generated by flaming and <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires</b> and the National Fire Protection Association recommends using both techniques in parallel to improve detection capabilities. The {{purpose of this study}} is to improve the understanding of how the response of commercial smoke detectors depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of smoke particles, i. e. varying number concentration and size distribution. Our data, in turn, will support the development, analysis, and optimization of the complete fire detection systems used by commercial aircrafts in the future. This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|R
50|$|Brown carbon has {{attracted}} interest {{as a possible}} cause of climate change. This class of organic carbon, known for its brownish color, absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet wavelengths and less significantly going into the visible wavelengths. Types of brown carbon include tar materials from <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires</b> or coal combustion, breakdown products from biomass burning, a mixture of organic compounds emitted from soil, and volatile organic compounds given off by vegetation.|$|R
50|$|While CO {{detectors}} do {{not serve}} as smoke detectors and vice versa, dual smoke/CO detectors are also sold. Smoke detectors detect the smoke generated by flaming or <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires,</b> whereas CO detectors detect and warn people about dangerous CO buildup caused, for example, by a malfunctioning fuel-burning device. In the home, some common sources of CO include open flames, space heaters, water heaters, blocked chimneys or running a car inside a garage.|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} Siberian boreal forest wildfires on the environment and climate necessitates an improved understanding of microphysical and chemical properties of emitted aerosols. Smoldering, flaming and mixed fires of typical Siberian biomass (pine and debris) were simulated during a small-scale study in a Large Aerosol Chamber (LAC). Individual particle analysis of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 smoke morphology and elemental composition revealed a strong dependence on combustion temperature, i. e., a dominant abundance of soot agglomerates versus roughly spherical organic particles in the flaming and smoldering phase, respectively. Cluster analysis of smoke microstructure was used to apportion the emitted particles into major characteristic groups: Soot and Organic, which accounted for around 90 % and 60 % of total particle numbers emitted from the flaming and <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires,</b> respectively. Carbon fractions and inorganic ion analysis supported the identification of particle types representative of combustion phase and biomass type. Elemental carbon (EC) particles from flaming fires comprised approximately 25 % of Group Soot, in good agreement with a high EC fraction in total carbon of around 65 % and low organic carbon (OC) /EC ratio near 0. 5. <b>Smoldering</b> <b>fires</b> of pine and debri...|$|R

Some subtle and only half-expressed emotion shook his whole being, seemed to tear at the locked chamber of his soul.|$|E
60|$|Warburton stamped up {{and down}} the car aisle. Manifestly he wanted to smash {{something}} or to take out his anger upon his comrades.

30|$|The {{creative}} spark for the VESDA invention {{came about}} during a remarkable series of huge bush fires ignited {{for research purposes}} in the forests of Western Australia in 1971.

It seemed to offer great potential to detect similar low smoke concentrations from <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires</b> in high airflow telephone exchanges and early computer centres, where point type smoke detectors were being found to be inadequate for the task.|$|R

These elements of the invention were important to discriminate between small <b>smoldering</b> <b>fires</b> and false alarms from contaminants with a device like VESDA which was two orders of magnitude more sensitive to smoke than conventional point type smoke detectors.
