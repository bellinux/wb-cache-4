40|$|SUMMARY: We {{are proposing}} {{to amend the}} {{regulations}} that govern the importation of animals and animal products to revise the conditions for the importation of live bovines and products derived from bovines with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). We are proposing to base importation conditions on the inherent risk of BSE infectivity in <b>specified</b> <b>commodities,</b> {{as well as on}} the BSE risk status of the region from which the commodities originate. We are proposing to establish a system for classifying regions as to BSE risk that is consistent with the system employed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the international standard-setting organization for guidelines related to animal health. The conditions we are proposing for the importation of <b>specified</b> <b>commodities</b> are based on internationally accepted scientific literature and, except in a few instances, are consistent with OIE guidelines. We are also proposing to classify certain specified countries as to BSE risk and are proposing to remove BSE restrictions on the importation of cervids and camelids and products derived from such animals. We are proposing to make these amendments afterconducting a thorough review of relevant scientific literature and a comprehensive evaluation of the issues and concluding that the proposed changes to the regulations would continue to guard against the introduction of BSE into the United States, while allowing the importation o...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} environment of agricultural producers has {{been influenced by}} formal U. S. agricultural policy for more than seventy years. Among the first pieces of New Deal legisla-tion proposed by incoming President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was a farm program designed to address declines in crop prices and net farm income. Key features of the Agricul-ture Act of 1933 included mandatory price support for <b>specified</b> <b>commodities,</b> direct sub-sidy payments to farmers, and supply controls. Farm programs, once viewed as temporary and supplementary to agricultural earnings, are increasingly viewed as permanent and of major proportion. Gardner examined the relation-ships between U. S. farm commodity programs and U. S. farm structure, while others (see Sum-ner for concept, evidence, and implications) have examined farm programs and specific crops. Gardner (2002), and Weersink et al. an-alyzed the effects of farm program programs upon land values. These studies examined various aspects of agricultural policy includ-ing whether farm program payments have enhanced land prices and landowner wealth rather than the welfare of producers. While it would seem logical that revenue-enhancing farm programs would increase land values, reliably estimating the magnitudes of farm program effects upon land values is an empirically challenging task. Both statisti-cal and budgeting-based methodologies {{have been used to}} estimate the share of land prices generated by farm program payments. Statis-tically based studies are {{complicated by the fact that}} both real per acre crop receipt...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} {{and analyze the}} various contractual arrangements in selected agricultural commodities in parts of Central and Northern Luzon. Specifically, the objectives are to : i) characterize the nature, process and degree of various agricultural contracts involved in the production and marketing of mangoes, hogs, rice and selected vegetables and, ii) analyze {{the implications of the}} various contracting arrangements in these commodities in terms of efficiency and equity. The research sites for this study consist of major producing provinces of the four <b>specified</b> <b>commodities</b> in selected parts of Northern and Central Luzon regions. For mango, Calasiao and San Carlos in Pangasinan, Iba and Masinloc in Zambales and Munoz in Nueva Ecija served as the study areas. For lowland vegetables, the municipalities of Talavera, Aliaga and San Jose City in Nueva Ecija, were primarily selected as study sites being major producers of eggplant, tomato, okra, onions and other vegetables. For hogs, Talavera, Munoz and San Jose City in Nueva Ecija where integrators and key informants are located constitute the sites of the study. The nature, process and degree of the different contracting systems in the four selected agricultural commodities have been diverse. In most cases, however, the different contracts were outcomes of the farmers need to adjust to the different production and market conditions surrounding the agricultural sector. The pervasiveness of sharecropping in many agricultural crops such as mango, rice and vegetables underscore the farmers difficulty in raising capital, due to missing credit and insurance markets. The associated risks, seasonality and specialized nature of agricultural production have likewise complicated the production processes and patterns of contracts in these commodities. Access to credit and marketing institutions and functioning of insurance markets are essential for the transformation of subsistence-oriented asset-poor farmers.

25|$|The US FTT bills {{proposed}} by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) and Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) {{have received a}} number of cosponsors in the Senate and House. The Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill is {{an early version of}} their cosponsored US FTT bill which includes a tax on US financial market securities transactions. The bill suggests to tax stock transactions at a rate of 0.25%. The tax on futures contracts to buy or sell a <b>specified</b> <b>commodity</b> of standardized quality at a certain date in the future, at a market determined price would be 0.02%. Swaps between two firms and credit default swaps would be taxed 0.02%. The tax would only target speculators, since the tax would be refunded to average investors, pension funds and health savings accounts. Projected annual revenue is $150 billion per year, half of which would go towards deficit reduction and half of which would go towards job promotion activities. The day the bill was introduced, it had the support of 25 of DeFazio's House colleagues.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe random utility based multiregional {{input-output}} (RUBMRIO) {{model is}} used by several integrated land use and transportation models (ILUTMs) to forecast commodity flows in a region and for spatial allocation of production activities. It makes use of multiregional input-output models {{which are based on}} random utility theory. In this work, we use optimal control techniques to find optimal final demand and transportation costs of a RUBMRIO model, that would lead to a desired level of commodity flow and production costs. At first, the RUBMRIO model is formulated as a discrete time dynamical system. It is shown, using Lyapunov argument, that the fixed point of the dynamical system is input-to-state stable (ISS). Then, a discrete time optimal control problem is formulated with states as commodity flows and production costs, and the final demand and transportation costs as control inputs. An optimization problem is then solved to obtain control inputs that would lead to desired commodity flows and production costs. Further, the proposed methodology is applied to a numerical example. It is shown that the optimal control based method can achieve user <b>specified</b> <b>commodity</b> flows and production costs up to an acceptable accuracy level...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to examine the}} relationship between narcotics trafficking and the processes of economic liberalization and democratization in the Caribbean. The salient social, political and economic processes were explored at each juncture of the drug trafficking chain to determine why certain groups and locales became integrated in the global narcotics economy. It also considered the national security implications of the global narcotics economy. ^ The Global Commodity Chain framework allowed the study to examine the social, political and economic processes that determine how a commodity is produced, transported, distributed and consumed in the global economy. A case study method was used to <b>specify</b> the <b>commodity</b> (cocaine) and locations (U. S. and Dominican Republic) where these processes were examined. ^ The important contributing factors in the study included: a liberalizing global economy, the social processes of migration, the formation of enclaves in the U. S., the opening of the political process and institutional weakness in the country of origin. All of these factors contributed to the Dominican Republic and Dominican migrants becoming key players in the cocaine commodity chain. It concluded that narcotics trafficking as a national security issue remains a fluid concept, contingent on specific cultural and historic antecedents. ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the first}} legal {{arrangements}} in the Ottoman Empire {{were carried out}} in 1886, {{it is known that}} some attempts were made before this date to establish a commodity exchange in İzmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi was used as “the grain exchange” just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern commodity exchange based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different commodity exchanges were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General <b>Commodity</b> Exchange regulations <b>specified</b> only one <b>commodity</b> exchange in each city. Therefore, upon the inspections by the Ministry of Public Works, Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi’s Commodity Exchange was declared as the sole legal exchange in the city and it was inaugurated with a ceremony on Monday, 13 June 1892.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural product {{prices and}} {{policies}} influence {{the development of}} crop yields under climate change through farm level management decisions. On this basis, five main scenarios were <b>specified</b> for agricultural <b>commodity</b> prices and crop yields. An economic agricultural sector model was used {{in order to assess}} the impacts of the scenarios on production, land use and farm income in Finland. The results suggest that falling crop yields, if realized due to low prices and restrictive policies, will result in decreasing crop and livestock production and increasing nutrient surplus. Slowly increasing crop yields could stabilise production and increase farm income. Significantly higher crop prices and yields are required, however, for any marked increase in production in Finland. Cereals production would increase relatively more than livestock production, if there were high prices for agricultural products. This is explained by abundant land resources, a high opportunity cost of labour and policies maintaining current dairy and beef production...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{textbooks}} {{characterize the}} evolution of an economy toward a modern market economy in the following way. Initially resources are privately owned {{but there is no}} money, so trade takes the form of unorganized barter. That is extremely costly and inefficient because it requires a double coincidence of wants. The high transactions costs that result are a barrier to any trade taking place at all. To reduce transactions costs, economic agents attempt to organize barter. Marketplaces develop, with trading grounds divided into trading posts or stalls at which <b>specified</b> pairs of <b>commodities</b> can be traded. Typically, these markets will be open for trade on specified market days. Even such organized barter is very costly, however. For example, the pairwise trading of only 10 commodities requires 45 separate trading stalls. To further reduce costs, economic agents attempt indirect pairwise trading. That can be accomplished by establishing trading posts for all commodities except one, the exceptional commodity being distinguished from all others {{by the fact that it}} is tradeable at all posts. The exceptional, intermediary commodity is money. Money facilitates the development of a modern market system by lowering the costs of acquiring information and making transactions (Brunner and Meltzer 1971). Now, let us turn our attention from the textbooks to the former Soviet Union. At the very time when the former Soviet Union claim...|$|R
40|$|Pakistan {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be underperforming as far as its agricultural export potential is concerned. However, analyses to support this allegation are very few, {{in part due to}} the lack of easily accessible data. In this paper provide the first necessary step in the analysis of Pakistan's comparative advantage in agricultural export markets. However, little or no analysis has been done that sheds some more light on this issue, in the sense of better <b>specifying</b> in which <b>commodities</b> and which markets Pakistan's comparative advantage is strongest. This paper attempts to start filling that void by quantifying the degree of comparative advantage of Pakistan agricultural export products in major overseas markets. This quantification is a necessary first step in getting a better handle on the factors that may limit the extent to which Pakistan is able to enter markets where it has a comparative advantage. Expansion of Pakistan's share in overseas export markets is crucial for further development of the country's agricultural sector. The main objective of the paper is to identify products where Pakistan has demonstrated comparative advantage, and to provide a first step towards understanding the factors that at present limit possibilities for further exploiting that advantage. The paper analyzes actual export flows and calculates measures of revealed comparative advantage. The focus in this paper being on agricultural trade, the analysis is based on international trade data that incorporates a unique degree of detail not seen before in trade analyses for Pakistan...|$|R
50|$|In 1981 Lockton {{moved from}} Los Angeles to Silicon Valley to apply his {{experience}} at California Business with subscription based financial information {{and at the}} Ontario Motor Speedway with the wireless technology behind the real-time timing and scoring system, to stock market trading information. He purchased a controlling interest in Data Broadcasting (originally Dataspeed, a company that had developed a pc version of the Ontario wireless real time scoring system) where he invented the hand held wireless QuoTrek, the first product to utilize “push” technology and wireless data, to deliver real time stock and commodity trading information to paying subscribers in a mobile environment. He successfully petitioned United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deregulate and {{permit the use of}} the analog sub-carrier (FCC Docket 82-536) for the real time broadcast of digital data. He successfully negotiated with the Boards of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and Amex exchanges as well as the Chicago Board of Trade and Commodities Exchange Center to create a low cost “non professional” fee structure for their real time trading information, thereby pioneering a consumer market for real time stock and futures trading. The first nationwide real time wireless data network he created supported the QuoTrek and Signal services which won numerous awards. With the QuoTrek’s companion invention, Signal, a wireless modem linked to a PC and Lotus 1-2-3 software to manage multiple investment accounts, the services generated over $1.3 billion in revenues over their product lives. George Guilder credited the QuoTrek in Life After Television (Norton 1992, pp 66-67) as the invention which created the communications paradigm known as “push” or “always on” data. Guilder predicted a revolution in the way time sensitive data would be delivered which is now pervasive on the Web and Cellular 3G networks. In 1984 Lockton designed and developed the prototype of a multi-purpose hand held device, the Informa, with a backlit LCD screen and alpha/numeric keyboard, designed to use the nationwide real time wireless data network of FM radio stations Lockton had assembled. In addition to user <b>specified</b> stocks and <b>commodities</b> quotes, news, weather and sports information in real time, the user could send wireless email and messages via a built in phone modem instantly received by the addressee wherever they were. The Informa concept preceded the Web by nine years, real-time wireless messaging by several years and the data capabilities of the 2G cellular networks by 10 years. In 1985 Data Broadcasting was sold to Lotus Development Corporation which never introduced the Informa.|$|R
