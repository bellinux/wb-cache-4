25|$|As envisaged by Alberto, {{the path}} toward {{developing}} a Brazilian nuclear sector included the nationalization of nuclear activities and specific compensations for exporting strategic raw materials.

50|$|EG&G, {{formally}} {{known as}} Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc., was a United States national defense contractor and provider {{of management and}} technical services.

Fu Ying, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of China, rejected the criticism, but expressed her government’s displeasure with Pyongyang’s action. Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also warned of a further nuclear armament of North Korea and called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

40|$|Technical {{evaluation}} {{is one of}} the key components of the Department of Defense (DoD) export license application review process. This article presents an overview of a metric approach to technical evaluation, using military ground systems as a case study. The metrics provide a summary of specific technology attributes associated with the system, subsystem, or components, and can be used to identify <b>sensitive</b> <b>technologies</b> which must be controlled to protect against potential proliferation. Metrics will assist in licensing decisions, which are extremely critical for protecting our technological advantages and maintaining technological superiority on the battlefield. The development of metrics requires joint participation of industry, military services, and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The major advantages of a metric approach are: (1) metrics provide a baseline of the technology status and identify <b>sensitive</b> <b>technologies</b> in a summary format, (2) metrics help reduce license application processing time, and (3) metrics provide consistent and jointly agreed DoD and industry positions with regard to the export of technical data, hardware, or software. With the decline in defense procurement of new systems and the continuous search for greater market share, defense industries are increasingly seeking to export their products (technical data, hardware, or software) to foreign customers.
