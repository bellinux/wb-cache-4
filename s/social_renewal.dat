25|$|By most accounts, Löhe was {{an ideal}} pastor who interacted {{well with a}} variety of {{different}} classes of people. He focused his theological studies on the Lutheran Confessions and put considerable thought into the celebration of Holy Communion as the center of congregational life. Löhe was especially interested in old Lutheran liturgies. Löhe was also noted for his ontological view of the pastoral office, which he believed existed independently of congregational call but as a direct appointment from Jesus Christ through ordination in opposition to C.F.W. Walther. He combined all these ideas with a heavy insistence on <b>social</b> <b>renewal.</b>|$|E

Espinosa's performance was met with positive reviews, such as the one written by Luis Fernando Galván of En Filme, stating that the actress [...] "effectively embodies the hope for <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> from a convincing performance where she goes on a trip into a social space with the intention of finding her place in the world and helping others to do the same".

The film was written by Espinosa and Zunino and won five awards at the 10th Works in Progress Guadalajara Festival. In 2016, it was announced by Variety magazine that Espinosa would join Mexican actors Demián Bichir and Diego Luna in the film The Black Minutes; in the same year, Espinosa played Rocío in the TV series Las Trece Esposas, produced by Blim and inspired by One Thousand and One Nights.
