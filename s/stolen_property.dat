5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of <b>stolen</b> <b>property</b> but several courts have judged that the National <b>Stolen</b> <b>Property</b> Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} stolen cultural property.|$|E
5|$|James Murrell (c. 1785 – 16 December 1860), {{also known}} as Cunning Murrell, was an English cunning man, or {{professional}} folk magician, who {{spent most of his}} life in the town of Hadleigh in the eastern English county of Essex. In this capacity, he reportedly employed magical means to aid in healing both humans and animals, exorcising malevolent spirits, countering witches, and restoring lost or <b>stolen</b> <b>property</b> to its owner.|$|E

B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the <b>stolen</b> <b>property.</b> J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E

5|$|Murrell {{claimed that}} he could exorcise malevolent spirits, destroy witches, and restore lost or <b>stolen</b> <b>property</b> to its owner, as well as {{providing}} services as an astrologer, herbalist, and animal healer. He charged a halfpenny for curing warts, and two shillings and six pence for breaking a witch's spell. He was reputed to cure sick animals by passing his hands over their affected area, muttering a prayer, and then hanging an amulet about their neck, and was requested to use these powers at farms in Essex, Suffolk, and northern Kent. During his lifetime, Murrell was known {{on both sides of the}} Thames Estuary, although not apparently beyond that. He did however receive postal correspondence from a range of places, including from Essex girls who were working as maids in London.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Nelson {{departed}} Alexandria, his {{first set of}} dispatches were already in French hands. Leander had been discovered off the western coast of Crete on 18 August 1798 by the French ship of the line Généreux, one of Villeneuve's escapees. After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, Généreux was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board Leander were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of Généreux inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after {{six and a half}} hours Thompson was forced to surrender. French captain Lejoille then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare. The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering Mutine, which escaped to the westwards before Généreux could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their <b>stolen</b> <b>property.</b> Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were knighted and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.|$|E
