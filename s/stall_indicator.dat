40|$|Axial {{compressors}} in aero {{engines are}} prone to suffering a breakdown of orderly flow when operating {{at the peak of}} the pressure rise characteristic. The damaging potential of separated flows is why a safe distance has to be left between every possible operating point and an operating point at which stall occurs. During earlier investigations of stall inception mechanisms, a new type of prestall instability has been found. In this study, it could be demonstrated that the prestall instability characterised by discrete flow disturbances can be clearly assigned to the subject of “Rotating Instabilities”. Propagating disturbances are responsible for the rise in blade passing irregularity. If the mass flow is reduced successively, the level of irregularity increases until the prestall condition devolves into rotating stall. The primary objective of the current work is to highlight the basic physics behind these prestall disturbances by complementary experimental and numerical investigations. Before reaching the peak of the pressure rise characteristic flow, disturbances appear as small vortex tubes with one end attached to the casing and the other attached to the suction surface of the rotor blade. These vortex structures arise when the entire tip region is affected by blockage and at the same time the critical rotor incidence is not exceeded in this flow regime. Furthermore, a new <b>stall</b> <b>indicator</b> was developed by applying statistical methods to the unsteady pressure signal measured over the rotor blade tips, thus granting a better control of the safety margin...|$|E

They can be embedded into host aerospace systems such as an altimeter, antenna, anti-icing system, flight data recorder, jet engine inlet, pitot tube, <b>stall</b> warning <b>indicator</b> or weather system.|$|R
50|$|Most {{military}} {{combat aircraft}} have an {{angle of attack}} indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a <b>stall</b> warning <b>indicator</b> or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1940s, Greene {{developed}} the first {{practical way to}} warn the pilot of the aerodynamic stall. His first design and apparatus included threaded bolts, a bicycle horn and other odd components, all powered by flashlight batteries. Greene filed his device for a patent in 1944, and the patent was issued in 1949. In order to develop his design, Greene founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in White Plains, NY, in 1946. There, he refined and marketed the <b>stall</b> warning <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
50|$|Basically, his device sounded {{an alert}} {{when the plane}} {{was in danger of}} not having enough lift to stay flying. This alert would allow time for the pilot to take {{corrective}} measures. Since its invention, this device became standard equipment for all aircraft and has also helped reduce the number of accidents due to stalling. The <b>Stall</b> Warning <b>Indicator</b> was called “the greatest lifesaver since the invention of the parachute”14 by the Saturday Evening Post and the device received the Flight Safety Foundation’s first Air Safety Award.|$|R
50|$|The SOCATA TB {{family are}} {{a series of}} {{single-engine}} light aircraft developed for general aviation and training purposes. Some versions, such as the TB-200 model, were specifically produced to meet the varied requirements of the trainer aircraft role. The type is often known for its favourable, easy to handle flight characteristics, such as its appropriate handling and control sensitivity, vice-free flying attitude, and being readily recoverable with ease from a typical stall, which lend themselves to less experienced pilots. Due to the absence of violent low-speed behaviour, the presence of a <b>stall</b> warning <b>indicator</b> is both necessary and furnished.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedGas turbine engine design {{is based on}} simplifying assumptions, including axi-symmetric flow. These assumptions break down in the real machines especially when operating near to stall. The reduction in operating surge margin associated with current trends to develop high performance military fighter aircraft further highlights {{the need to develop}} a thorough understanding of the flow in rotor blade passages and especially when operating close to stall. This research investigates the behavior of a Transonic Compressor Rig (TCR) as it approaches stall in the rotor-only and full-stage configuration using combinations of frequency and time domain analysis in the subsonic (70 % rated speed), sonic (80 % rated speed) and transonic operating ranges (90 %, 95 %, and 100 % rated speed). A steady-state analysis of the pressure measurements across a rotor passage of the TCR was conducted to identify potential pre-stall indicators, the structure of the flow field within the blade passages, and to correlate changes in flow structure with changes in pressure measurements. Further investigation using flow visualization techniques within the blade passages demonstrated how the TCR rotor departed from an idealized rotor when the axi-symmetric assumption holds when operating at steady-state and near stall conditions. This identification of potential <b>stall</b> <b>indicators</b> and characterization of the time variant flow field within the passages will impact future compressor design to enable operation closer to stall and increased performance across an operating spectrum.

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{pregnancy}} {{rate and}} number of embryos 30 days post mating in gilts group-housed in pens of three and gilts housed individually in gestation <b>stalls.</b> Other potential <b>indicators</b> of swine welfare examined included body weight, backfat thickness, lesions, lameness, display of stereotypies, and serum cortisol concentrations. Methods: After artificial insemination, Yorkshire × Landrace gilts were placed in gestation stalls (n = 14) or pens of three gilts each (n = 14 pens, 42 gilts) until 30 days post mating. Measures of welfare and performance assessed before mating and days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 post mating were compared between treatment groups. Gilts were euthanized and reproductive tracts were examined on day 30. Results: Group-housed gilts gained more body weight than gilts housed in stalls, but backfat thickness was similar between treatments. The proportion of gilts exhibiting stereotypies on day 28 was not affected by treatment. Lesion scores (0 to 5; 5 = severe) were higher for group-housed gilts and were highest during the first 7 days post mating. On day 30, lameness scores (0 to 5; 5 = severe) were higher in group-housed gilts, and serum cortisol concentration was higher in stall-housed gilts. Pregnancy rate on day 30 was lower for group-housed gilts. The numbers of ovulations and embryos, embryo weight, and crown-rump length were similar between groups. Implications: Indicators of welfare were differentially affected by type of gestation housing, and pregnancy rate was higher in gilts housed individually in stalls...|$|R
