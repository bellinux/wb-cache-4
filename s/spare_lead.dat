In order to increase their pin utilization rate and electrical characteristics for high-speed applications, an innovative leadframe package, named multiple exposed pads (M-pad) LQFP package, is proposed. By bonding all power and ground wires to their dedicated exposed pads, the leads originally bonded to the corresponding power and ground wires {{can be used as}} the <b>spared</b> <b>leads</b> for the other signals, or they can be just removed to reduce the lead numbers, and thus the size and cost of the M-pad leadframe package.

The simulated power parasitics of M-pad LQFP are much lower than those of E-pad LQFP and BGA packages. The simulated differential S-parameters of M-pad LQFP also indicate less signal loss compared with those of E-pad LQFP.

40|$|Malawi suffers {{frequent}} droughts and floods. In {{an economy}} that is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, it is crucial to understand the implications of these extreme climate events. Not only are rural livelihoods affected due to the severe impacts on the agricultural sector, but nonfarm and urban households are also vulnerable given the strong production and price linkages between agriculture {{and the rest of the}} economy. This study uses a general equilibrium model to estimate the economywide impacts of drought- and flood-related crop production losses. Climate simulations are based on production loss estimates from stochastic drought and flood models. Model results show that the economic losses due to extreme climate events are significant: Malawi loses 1. 7 percent of its gross domestic product on average every year due to the combined effects of droughts and floods. This is equivalent to almost US$ 22 million in 2005 prices. Given their crop choices, it is smaller-scale farmers and those in the flood-prone southern regions of the country who are worst affected. However, urban and nonfarm households are not <b>spared.</b> Food shortages <b>lead</b> to sharp price increases that reduce urban households� disposable incomes. This study makes an important contribution by estimating the economywide impacts of extreme climate events.

He strongly believed that {{each one of us}} is a distinctive, unique individual with our own characteristic way of life. Since the term was coined in the early 20 th century {{it is no wonder that}} the meaning of â€œlifestyleâ€ has gone through enormous changes. These days it is more often used to express â€œa way of life or style of living that reflects the attitudes and values of a person or groupâ€. Since globalisation is increasingly turning the world into a â€œglobal villageâ€ no wonder that lifestyle is changing faster than ever before. As a result â€œfor tourism, this influences the tourist’s perception of his/her personal needs and behaviour â€ 1. In this short essay attention will be focussed on the mutual effects of lifestyle and tourism. After taking a brief look at the different life-stages, which, according to Knowles (2001), have a fundamental influence on holiday choice, we will examine other factors that determine tourists’ decisions. The most important of these factors (perhaps not surprisingly) are time and money. It will be interesting to see that for many in western societies the greatest hindrance is not the financial burdens of a holiday but rather the lack of time to <b>spare.</b> This, inevitably, <b>leads</b> to demands that have not been trends in the tourism industry in past decades. Shorter, multiple holidays in exotic places are more sought after than they have ever been and due to changes in society somewhat shocking niche markets are also emerging. It is obvious that travelling overseas is less of a luxury these days than it used to be. As a consequence, more and more people will be able to make their choice to be on the move, be it on business or holiday, thus contributing to one of the hottest issues currently. Climate change, which has already made its influence felt, will no doubt have significant influence on all of us. What can travellers do to leave less of an environmental footprint and meet not only the needs of the present but also of the indefinite future?

40|$|Maintenance is {{constantly}} challenged with increasing productivity by maximizing up-time and reliability {{while at the}} same time reducing expenditure and investment. In the last few years it has become evident through the development of maintenance concepts that maintenance is more than just a non-productive support function, it is a profit- generating function. In the past decades, hundreds of models that address maintenance strategy have been presented. The vast majority of those models rely purely on mathematical modeling to describe the maintenance function. Due to the complex nature of the maintenance function, and its complex interaction with other functions, it is almost impossible to accurately model maintenance using mathematical modeling without sacrificing accuracy and validity with unfeasible simplifications and assumptions. Analysis presented as part of this thesis shows that stochastic simulation offers a viable alternative and a powerful technique for tackling maintenance problems. Stochastic simulation is a method of modeling a system or process (on a computer) based on random events generated by the software so that system performance can be evaluated without experimenting or interfering with the actual system. The methodology developed as part of this thesis addresses most of the shortcomings found in literature, specifically by allowing the modeling of most of the complexities of an advanced maintenance system, such as one that is employed in the airline industry. This technique also allows sensitivity analysis to be carried out resulting in an understanding of how critical variables may affect the maintenance and asset management decision-making process. In many heavy industries (e. g. airline maintenance) where high utilization is essential for the success of the organization, subsystems are often of a rotable nature, i. e. they rotate among different systems throughout their life-cycle. This causes a system to be composed of a number of subsystems of different ages, and therefore different reliability characteristics. This makes it difficult for analysts to estimate its reliability behavior, and therefore may result in a less-than-optimal maintenance plan. Traditional reliability models are based on detailed statistical analysis of individual component failures. For complex machinery, especially involving many rotable parts, such analyses are difficult and time consuming. In this work, a model is proposed that combines the well-established Weibull method with discrete simulation to estimate the reliability of complex machinery with rotable subsystems or modules. Each module is characterized by an empirically derived failure distribution. The simulation model consists of a number of stages including operational up-time, maintenance down-time and a user-interface allowing decisions on maintenance and replacement strategies as well as inventory levels and logistics. This enables the optimization of a maintenance plan by comparing different maintenance and removal policies using the Cost per Unit Time (CPUT) measure as the decision variable. Five different removal strategies were tested. These include: On-failure replacements, block replacements, time-based replacements, condition-based replacements and a combination of time-based and condition-based strategies. Initial analyses performed on aircraft gas-turbine data yielded an optimal combination of modules out of a pool of multiple spares, resulting in an increased machine up-time of 16 %. In addition, it was shown that condition-based replacement is a cost-effective strategy; however, it was noted that the combination of time and condition-based strategy can produce slightly better results. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to optimize decision variables (module soft-time), and to provide an insight to the level of accuracy with which it has to be estimated. It is imperative as part of the overall reliability and life-cycle cost program to focus not only on reducing levels of unplanned (i. e. breakdown) maintenance through preventive and predictive maintenance tasks, but also optimizing inventory of spare parts management, sometimes called float hardware. It is well known that the unavailability of a spare part may result in loss of revenue, which is associated with an increase in system downtime. On the other hand increasing the number of <b>spares</b> will <b>lead</b> to an increase in capital investment and holding cost. The results obtained from the simulation model were used in a discounted NPV (Net Present Value) analysis to determine the optimal number of spare engines. The benefits of this methodology are that it is capable of providing reliability trends and forecasts in a short time frame and based on available data. In addition, it takes into account the rotable nature of many components by tracking the life and service history of individual parts and allowing the user to simulate different combinations of rotables, operating scenarios, and replacement strategies. It is also capable of optimizing stock and spares levels as well as other related key parameters like the average waiting time, unavailability cost, and the number of maintenance events that result in extensive durations due to the unavailability of spare parts. Importantly, as more data becomes available or as greater accuracy is demanded, the model or database can be updated or expanded, thereby approaching the results obtainable by pure statistical reliability analysis...|$|R
40|$|There are 22 {{construction}} {{support vessels}} in the DOF Group that have active heave compensated cranes with lifting capacity of above 50 tonnes. The Brazilian flagged Skandi Salvador was chosen to represent the fleet in terms of specifications, since she {{was close to the}} average numbers for size, age and capacity. She has a NOV crane with SWL of 140 t. There are two main types of maintenance; preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance. Fault distributions can be used to evaluate which type of maintenance that should be performed, and in which intervals. Maintenance management should be a process of continuous improvement, with focus on planning, execution, reporting and analysis in order to establish and revise resource needs, goals and requirements, and the maintenance program itself. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Risk Based Inspection (RBI) are useful methods to establish an optimal maintenance and inspection program, based on functional demands, functional faults, and prevention of these functional faults. The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) concept and the ?Newsboy? model are mathematical decision models {{that can be used to}} decide number of spares to be ordered, order point, safety level, and investments in capital spare parts. Seven areas of improvement for the maintenance practice in the DOF Group were proposed: 1. 	Informal experience to be made formal. 2. 	Formalize the maintenance management processes. 3. 	Introduce scientific methods like Reliability Centered Maintenance and Risk Based Inspection to establish maintenance program. 4. 	Introduce scientific methods for spare parts management. 5. 	Introduce a fleet-oriented philosophy for all aspects of the maintenance practice, especially for spare parts management. 6. 	Bring the users closer to decisions regarding the MMS 7. 	Increase practical usability of critical equipment classification. The main objective of spare parts management is to find the optimal numbers, types and locations for spare parts needed to perform the desired tasks with as high uptime as possible. In effect, to have spare parts available when they are needed, but to avoid stocking spare parts that are not needed. At the heart of the proposed spare parts management philosophy lie fleet orientation, formalization, and scientific methods. A spare part evaluation work process is proposed, consisting of 6 phases: 1. 	Basic input. Where the actor responsible collects the data necessary for making the evaluation. 2. 	Spare part categorization. The spare parts are categorized in three categories, based on given criteria. 3. 	Risk assessment. A consequence classification is carried out to decide the desired probability of having a spare available during procurement lead time for operational spares and consumables. 4. 	Decision tools. Two different decision tools are utilized to make optimal decisions for the spare parts considered. 5. 	Output. The decisions are summarized and carried out. Information related to the capital spare parts decisions are entered into a newly established capital spare parts experience register. 6. 	MMS. The results from the spare part evaluations are inserted in the maintenance management system. An important part of the proposed spare parts management philosophy is the ability to make optimal decisions in changing environments. If the evaluation process is not dynamic, the actors responsible will soon revert to the former, subjective methods for making decisions. So, whenever a change in the operation of a vessel is planned or registered, the project/vessel manager should ask himself how this change might affect the input parameters of the decision tools. This forms the basis for the proposed dynamic spare part evaluation work process. The decision tool for capital spares is built around the relation between the expected cost of holding a spare part and not needing it, versus the expected cost of not having it when you need it. When basing the evaluation on significantly lower delivery times than estimated by the manufacturer, the optimal capital spare parts investment decisions for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador were to purchase all the recommended parts, except the largest crane wire. Using the estimated delivery times from the manufacturer, the optimal decisions were clearly to purchase all the recommended spare parts. At the delivery time of Skandi Salvador, the DOF Group chose to only purchase four of the items on the list of recommended capital spare parts. The capital spare parts investment decisions taken by the DOF Group at the delivery time of the vessel are therefore considered sub-optimal compared to the findings in this thesis, and the DOF Group is advised to purchase the remaining capital spare parts on the list of recommended spare parts. The decision tool for operational spares and consumables finds the optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock. An important input parameter is the desired probability of having enough <b>spare</b> during procurement <b>lead</b> time. This parameter is set based on the consequence classification for the part. The decision tool was used to make decisions for optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock for a list of recommended spare parts for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador...|$|R
