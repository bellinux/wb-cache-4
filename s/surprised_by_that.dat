[...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E

60|$|She approached, {{and stood}} facing him at arm's length, with both {{her hands on}} his shoulders; and he, <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> audacity, closed and opened his eyes two or three times, aware of some emotion arising within him, from her words, her tone, her contact; an emotion unknown, singular, {{penetrating}} and sad--at the close sight of that strange woman, of that being savage and tender, strong and delicate, fearful and resolute, that had got entangled so fatally between their two lives--his own and that other white man's, the abominable scoundrel.|$|E

60|$|The Count did not afflict himself much at his limited {{circulation}} in the fastidious circles {{of the high}} aristocracy. He relished society of a wilder and less ceremonious cast; and meeting with loose companions to his taste, soon ran into all {{the excesses of the}} capital, in that most licentious period. It is said that, {{in the course of his}} wild career, he had an intrigue with a lady of quality, a favorite of the Regent; that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> prince in one of his interviews; that sharp words passed between them; and that the jealousy and vengeance thus awakened, ended only with his life.|$|E

According to Carpenter, the producers singled out [...] "songs like I Am a Town and John Doe No. 24, songs that are story songs, very character-driven, as the key that made them {{want to see if}} this was something I was interested in. I was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that,</b> and intrigued." [...] Carpenter left the project in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|At the Winter 2014 TCA's, West {{opened up}} about Ava's {{relationship}} with Morgan {{and where it}} was headed. She said, [...] "She {{was worried about the}} thought that there are other elements that interfere with love. ... Family interfering with love is as old as love itself. I do think she loves him and her heart is broken." [...] During May 2014 sweeps, Ava cheated on Morgan and had an affair with his father, Sonny. The pair slept together in a crypt. In an interview, West spoke about the events of the affair and its locale. She stated, [...] "A lot of people seemed shocked by it and I was very <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> reaction.

50|$|Buford {{does not}} offer a {{conclusive}} explanation for why he thinks that this violence occurs. However, he does write,I was surprised by what I found; moreover, because I came away with a knowledge that I had not possessed before, I was also grateful, and <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> as well. I had not expected the violence to be so pleasurable....This is, if you like, {{the answer to the}} hundred-dollar question: why do young males riot every Saturday? They do it {{for the same reason that}} another generation drank too much, or smoked dope, or took hallucinogenic drugs, or behaved badly or rebelliously. Violence is their antisocial kick, their mind-altering experience, an adrenaline-induced euphoria that might be all the more powerful because it is generated by the body itself, with, I was convinced, many of the same addictive qualities that characterize synthetically-produced drugs.He also suggests that crowds cannot be incited to violence against their will, contrary to the belief that otherwise pacific crowds can be stirred to violence by a persuasive leader. Buford also argues that those in a crowd collectively make the decision whether or not to cross thresholds of violence.|$|E

40|$|I begin where Chief Justice Burger ended: when {{judged by}} normal {{personal}} and professional criteria, Robert Bork is among the best qualified candidates for the Supreme Court of {{this or any other}} era. 1 Few nominees in our history compare with him in the range of their professional accomplishments - as public servant, private practitioner, appellate judge, legal scholar. Few compare in the seriousness of their lifelong engagement with the fundamental questions of constitutional law. Of course, Bork 2 Ì† 7 s answers to these questions are controversial. But who can be <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>that?</b> Even those, like myself, who disagree with Bork both can and should admire the way he has woven theory and practice, reason and passion, into a pattern that expresses so eloquently our deepest hopes for a life in the law. The Republic needs more people like Robert Bork. It is a tragedy that the Republic should repay him for his decades of service by publicly humiliating him...|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined listeners {{ability to}} make accurate inferences about speakers from the nonlinguistic content of their speech. In Experiment I, naâ‚¬Ä±ve listeners heard male and female speakers articulating two test sentences, and tried to select which {{of a pair of}} photographs depicted the speaker. On average they selected the correct photo 76. 5 % of the time. All performed at a level that was reliably better than chance. In Experiment II, judges heard the test sentences and estimated the speakers age, height, and weight. A comparison group made the same estimates from photographs of the speakers. Although estimates made from photos are more accurate than those made from voice, for age and height the differences are quite small in magnitudeâ€”a {{little more than a year}} in age and less than a half inch in height. When judgments are pooled, estimates made from photos are not uniformly superior to those made from voices. 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.
