40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} numerical method is proposed to investigate deformations and stresses in elastic-plastic rotating <b>solid</b> <b>shafts.</b> Using {{the assumption of}} plane strain, the governing equation {{is derived from the}} geometric relation, equilibrium equation, deformation theory, von Mises' yield criterion and non-linear stress-plastic strain relationship. By making use of the information of the second and third derivatives of the radial stress with respect to the radial co-ordinate and introducing a truncated Taylor's expansion, an iterative algorithm is presented which can solve elastic-plastic problems of rotating <b>solid</b> <b>shafts</b> quickly and effectively. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate accuracy, efficiency and capacity of the proposed method in both fully elastic and non-linear strain-hardening elastic-plastic analyses of rotating <b>solid</b> <b>shafts.</b> Excellent agreement is found between this method and finite element approach.

40|$|AbstractOne {{problem in}} {{wheelset}} axles are the failures {{due to the}} propagation of fatigue cracks. To avoid those failures with sometimes catastrophic consequences analytical crack propagation simulations are used. For these simulations {{the knowledge of the}} crack propagation path and the corresponding stress intensity factor (SIF) is required. To calculate the SIF a numerical simulation, such as finite element method (FEM), is generally needed. To this end numerical simulations for shouldered <b>solid</b> <b>shafts</b> with elliptical surface cracks are done. In this work different influencing factors of the stress intensity factor expressions have been identified. Therefore, two different specimen types with three different stress concentration factors each were designed.

In order to examine the mechanical and optical properties of polyester, torsion tests were carried out on <b>solid</b> <b>shafts</b> under various twisting rates at 30 ℃ {{and the effects of}} strain rate on the shearing stress, shearing strain, fringe gradient and increasing rate of fringe gradient were investigated.

Finally, the relation between the fringe gradient and its increasing rate was formulated as a function of strain rate. From these results, we established a method to estimate the shearing stress and the shearing strain in a three-dimensional model only by measuring the finge gradient and its increasing rate.

This technique produce a significant deformation process leading to achieve proper material bonding. The results show high possibility to produce solid parts directly from solid chips without any melting and rolling process. The produced parts have mechanical properties closed to those obtained by the conventional forming technology. This method is relatively simple and demonstrate a clean recycling technology to reduce the waste and maximize the productivity...|$|R

In this experiment, 20 -mm-diameter <b>solid</b> <b>shafts</b> and 40 -mm-outer-diameter rings having a 20 -mm-inner-diameter step at the 18. 5 -mm-inner-diameter center hole were used. The material combinations of the shaft / ring were JIS S 45 C / SKD 11, A 5056 / S 45 C, and S 45 C / A 5056. The experiment was performed as follows. The shaft was put on the ring and pressed. Then, metal plastically flowed between the joining faces. The gap between them was filled with the flowing metal, and then, they were joined by high clamping pressure. The primary results were as follows. This joining method was completed with small amounts of metal flow because of highly precise fitting between the shaft and ring. Therefore, they could be joined by small pressing strokes. In this experiment, the maximum joining efficiency (shaft return proof load / joining load) reached 25 % - 35 %.

50|$|Most manual {{transmissions}} rely on {{splash lubrication}} although some five speed Rover gearboxes did incorporate an oil pump. The problem with splash lubrication {{is that it}} is speed dependent. There are centrifugal effects, hydrodynamic effects and effects from the gears working as pumps. If a gearbox is fitted with Perspex windows and run on a test rig these effects can be observed. As the gearbox is run through its rev range, the oil jets will switch over and move around. Research on the Austin Maxi 1500 gearbox showed that one of the ball races was running dry at 80 mph. The solution was to alter the casting to include a small projection that would intercept the main oil jet that was present at 80 mph and disperse it. This small modification enabled the later Maxi 1750 gearbox to be relatively trouble free. Four speed gearboxes seldom show these problems because at top speed (and maximum power) they are basically a <b>solid</b> <b>shaft</b> and the gears are not transmitting power.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a <b>solid</b> <b>shaft</b> that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|E
