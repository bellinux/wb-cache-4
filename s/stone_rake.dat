Bob finds {{a piece of wood}} for the handle, but because he lives in a rocky sector, starts making a <b>stone</b> <b>rake</b> head. (Alex had not considered wood to be unavailable or wrong for the rake head, so it was not specified.) ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{exterior}} elevations are of [...] "Hobart" [...] buff {{face brick}} laid in common bond with dressed limestone detailing. The central entry bay {{is flanked by}} large windows on either side. A flight of stairs leads to main entry. Entry level is halfway between the primary floor level and grade level. The entry is defined by a broken pediment supported by fluted console scroll brackets, all of limestone. Flanking the entry is a stone water table on which rest small, narrow windows. A frieze has raised Roman lettering stating [...] "MDCCC PUBLIC LIBRARY 01111". Above this is a full pediment with <b>stone</b> <b>raking</b> cornices. An oculus with stone garland surround is centered in the brick tympanum.|$|R
5000|$|The stones {{used for}} cooking are then {{placed in the}} center of the pit and a wood fire is started, {{although}} the exact method of heating the stones varies. The fire must burn until the stones are glowing hot. Care must be taken to ensure that the fire will burn out shortly after this optimal cooking temperature is achieved. The ashes are then swept off the <b>stones</b> and <b>raked</b> between them to form an insulating [...] "bed." [...] A layer of wet seaweed is placed over the stones, followed by traditional regional foods such as steamers, mussels, quahogs, and lobsters. Side dishes usually include, corn on the cob, carrots, and onions. Alternating layers of seaweed and food are piled on top and the entire mound is covered with canvas that has been drenched in water to seal in the heat and prevent the canvas from burning. The food is allowed to steam for several hours.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{we were at}} last summoned, {{the fire}} had been burning {{for more than four}} hours. The pit was filled with a {{white-hot}} mass shooting out little tongues of white flame, and throwing out a heat beside which the scorching sun was a pleasant relief. A number of men were engaged, with long poles to which a loop of thick vine had been attached, in noosing the pieces of unburnt wood by twisting the pole, like a horse's twitch, until the loop was tight, and dragging the log out by main force. When the wood was all out there remained a conical pile of glowing stones {{in the middle of the}} pit. Ten men now drove the butts of green saplings into the base of the pile, and held the upper end while a stout vine was passed behind the row of saplings. A dozen men grasped each end of the vine, and with loud shouts hauled with all their might. The saplings, like the teeth of an enormous rake, tore through the pile of stones, flattening them out towards the opposite edge of the pit. The saplings were then driven in on the other side and the <b>stones</b> <b>raked</b> in the opposite direction, then sideways, until the bottom of the pit was covered with an even layer of hot stones. This process had taken fully half an hour, but any doubt as to the heat of the stones at the end was set at rest by the tongues of flame that played continually among them. The cameras were hard at work, and a large crowd of people pressed inwards towards the pit as the moment drew near. They were all excited except Jonathan, who preserved, even in the supreme moment, the air of holy calm that never leaves his face. All eyes are fixed expectant on the dense bush behind the clearing, whence the Shadrachs, Meshachs and Abednegos of the Pacific are to emerge. There is a cry of [...] "Vutu! Vutu!" [...] and forth from the bush, two and two, march fifteen men, dressed in garlands and fringes. They tramp straight to the brink of the pit. The leading pair show something like fear in their faces, but do not pause, perhaps because the rest would force them to move forward. They step down upon the stones and continue their march round the pit, planting their feet squarely and firmly on each stone. The cameras snap, the crowd surges forward, the bystanders fling in great bundles of green leaves. But the bundles strike the last man of the procession and cut him off from his fellows; so he stays where he is, trampling down the leaves as they are thrown to line the pit, in a dense cloud of steam from the boiling sap. The rest leap back to his assistance, shouting and trampling, and the pit turns into the mouth of an Inferno, filled with dusky frenzied fiends, half seen through the dense volume that rolls up to heaven and darkens the sunlight. After the leaves, palm-leaf baskets of the dracaena root are flung to them, more leaves, and then bystanders and every one join in shovelling earth over all till the pit is gone, and a smoking mound of fresh earth takes its place. This will keep hot for four days, and then the masawe will be cooked.|$|R
