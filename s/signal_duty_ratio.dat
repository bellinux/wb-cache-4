40|$|N/PBTI) {{have become}} one of the most {{important}} reliability issues in modern semiconductor technology. N/PBTI-induced degrada-tion depends heavily on workload, which causes imbalanced degradation and additional clock skew for clock distribution networks with clock gating features. In this work, we first analyze the effects of N/PBTI on clock paths with different clock gating use cases. Then cross-layer solutions are proposed to reduce N/PBTI-induced clock skew. Two Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell circuits are proposed to alternate clock idle state between logic high and logic low for each clock gating operation. A skew mitigation methodology is also proposed to select the appropriate ICG cells based on the architecture and microarchitecture context. An example of sleep scheduling is also described as a simple software-level technique that can be used in conjunction with BTI-Gater to avoid certain pathological aging scenarios. Our experiments show that BTI-Gater can balance the gated clock branches to close to 50 % <b>signal</b> <b>duty</b> <b>ratio,</b> while guaranteeing a glitch-free clock signal with easy-to-verify timing constraints. Results on commercial processors show that BTI-Gater can effectively reduce N/PBTI-induced clock skew of up to 17 ps, which can be converted to up to 19. 7 % leakage power saving compared to pure design guardbanding.

40|$|International audienceWe are {{considering}} {{the problem of}} controlling a DC-DC switched power converter of the Buck type. The converter involves an inherent control limitation; accordingly the control <b>signal</b> (<b>duty</b> <b>ratio)</b> can only take values in the interval (0, 1). In the relevant literature, such a physical control limitation is generally not taken into account when designing the converter regulators. This is only {{dealt with in the}} control implementation stage, placing an isolated limiter between the (linear) controller and the controlled system. Furthermore, the presence of such a limiter is generally ignored when analyzing the closed-loop control system. In the present paper, the control signal limitation is dealt with using a nonlinear regulator that involves an internal limiter. The resulting closed-loop control system is shown to be equivalent to a nonlinear feedback involving a linear dynamics block in closed-loop with a nonlinear static element. Using absolute stability tools, sufficient conditions are established for the involved feedback to be L 2 -stable. If these conditions are respected when choosing the control design parameters then the regulator meets its objectives (closed-loop stability and output reference tracking). It is worth noting that, though the focus is made on a specific power converter, the paper includes an important theoretical dimension that may be of general interest...|$|E

In this thesis, the primary focus is on NBTI and HCI for which both cause temporal degradation in performance of nanoscale integrated circuits. This research studies and analyzes the temporal delay degradation of logic circuits due to NBTI and HCI effects on a 90 nm test chips.

In principle, the motor terminal voltages and currents are sampled and used to estimate the motor flux and torque.
