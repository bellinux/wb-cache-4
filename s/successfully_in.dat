5|$|Alarmed {{by these}} Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began {{supporting}} Sparta. This defection forced the allies to seek peace. The King's Peace, {{also known as}} the Peace of Antalcidas, was signed in 387 BC, ending the war. This treaty declared that Persia would control all of Ionia, and that all other Greek cities would be independent. Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace, with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia's ability to interfere <b>successfully</b> <b>in</b> Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's hegemonic position in the Greek political system.|$|E

Studies have shown that in-vitro fertilisation in cheetah poses more difficulties than are faced in the case of other cats.|$|E
