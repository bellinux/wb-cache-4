40|$|Biodegradation {{occurs in}} the diesel/water {{interface}} in petroleum product pipelines. The microbial contamination can result in inhibitor/fuel degradation, leading to unacceptable levels of turbidity, filter <b>plugging,</b> <b>storage</b> tank corrosion and stored product souring. Therefore, selection of the biocide/inhibitor {{plays an important role}} in the transportation of petroleum products through pipelines. Three biocides (cationic and nonionic) were employed to study the biodegradation in a diesel-water interface. The biocidal efficiency against degradation of diesel was examined by employing Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. Bronopol (2 -bromo- 2 -nitro-propane- 1, 3 -diol) was found to have higher bactericidal efficiency than N-cetyl-N,N, N-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetyl pyridinum bromide (CPB). But the cationic biocides (CTAB and CPB) showed good biocidal efficiency at the interface. The data are explained in terms of a model that postulates the formation of a ‘micelle’ at the diesel-water interface...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} to {{evaluate}} the cement nala plug in Wagarwadi watershed of Hingoli district was carried out during 1998 - 99. Water storage characteristics in the cement nala plug was studied by monitoring the depth of water <b>storage</b> in cement <b>plug</b> and length of water spread. The losses from surface water storage {{in the form of}} evaporation and seepage/percolation were estimated. The effect of seepage on ground water recharge was studied by monitoring water levels in the observation wells. Utilization of stored water in the cement nala plug was observed. The full water storage of cement nala plug was found to be 1725. 91 m, with the maximum length and width of spread, 11. 3 m and 14. 0 m, respectively with maximum impounding of water as 3. 0 m. The maximum evaporation loss and seepage loss from the cement nala plug was found to be 257. 2 m 3 and 1634 m 3, respectively. The impounded water in cement nala plug resulted in the increase in water levels in the observation wells of the influencing area. Due to silting, the storage capacity of the cement nala plug was reduced by 2. 16 percent in 5 years its construction with silt retention rate of 24. 124 tonnes/year...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{relates to}} {{the assessment of the}} sealing ability of bentonite/sand plugs when swollen in presence of both water and gas pressures, in the context of deep underground radioactive waste <b>storage.</b> Compacted bentonite/sand <b>plugs</b> are placed inside a constant volume cell, and subjected to swelling in presence of both water and gas: swelling kinetics and effective swelling pressure Pswell are identified. Secondly, the gas breakthrough (GB) characteristics of swollen plugs are assessed to determine their ability for gas migration, which has to be minimal for sealing radioactive waste repositories. We show that gas pressure Pg does not affect significantly Pswell until a threshold Pg > 2 MPa. When swelling occurs inside a tube with a smooth (turned) inner surface, continuous GB occurs when Pg is equivalent to the effective Pswell (obtained without gas pressure, at 7. 32 MPa ± 0. 11). When the plug swells inside a grooved tube, continuous GB does not occur up to Pg ≥ 10. 5 MPa: smooth interfaces are a preferential gas migration pathway rather than grooved interfaces, and rather than water-saturated bentonite–sand plugs. With smooth tubes, in presence of Pg ≥ 2 MPa, although Pswell is not affected, gas passes through the sample at significantly lower values than Pswell, due to partial sample saturation. It is concluded that GB pressure is a more accurate indicator of partial sample saturation than swelling pressure Pswell alone...|$|R

A stratified, single-vessel liquid desiccant storage tank {{is an attractive}} option for the seasonal storage of solar energy. Maintaining stratified storage preserves the chemical energy stored in concentrated liquid desiccant solutions. Simulations of desiccant-based storage systems have been limited to modeling well-mixed storage. The subject {{of this paper is}} a density-stratified liquid desiccant storage tank model. The one-dimensional storage is composed of a series of well-mixed segments of a liquid desiccant (CaCl 2 or LiCl) solution in a variable-volume, density-stratified storage tank. The density of each segment depends on both the temperature and the salt concentration of the desiccant solution. The model incorporates mixing due to mass diffusion and buoyancy and accounts for the heat of dilution in the energy balance. Thermal losses to the surroundings are accounted for and auxiliary heat input is permitted. Stored energy is a combination of sensible energy (a function of temperature) and chemical potential energy (a function of salt concentration and temperature). Fluid movement within the tank is simulated with a plug flow approach. Fluid enters the tank through fixed inlets or through an idealized inlet manifold. Fluid exits the tank through fixed outlets. For use with the Transient Systems Simulation (TRNSYS) software, the model is labeled TRNSYS Type 209. The user is able to define the storage characteristics (e. g. capacity, insulation, number and location of inlets and outlets, etc.), the initial conditions, and the boundary conditions of TRNSYS Type 209. Several test cases demonstrate TRNSYS Type 209 's capacity for modeling liquid desiccant <b>storage</b> using the <b>plug</b> flow approach. These cases use initial and boundary conditions that have been arbitrarily selected from within the expected operating ranges...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. July 2011. Major: Mechanical engineering. Advisor: Dr. Jane H. Davidson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 73 pages, appendices A-D. One {{of the most}} effective and simplest methods to maintain thermal stratification of solar hot water storage tanks during charge and discharge is the use of a rigid porous manifold. The same manifold design can be employed within a novel liquid desiccant solar thermal storage tank to prevent destruction of chemically stored energy during charge and discharge. This type of manifold does not require any moving parts or special materials and thus is particularly appealing for solar thermal storage systems. It has a series of vertical hydraulic resistance elements placed within a perforated tube. At the design operating conditions, the manifold ensures that fluid entering the tank is delivered to the vertical position where it is the same density as the tank fluid. In the present study the utility of a rigid porous manifold is assessed over a range of operating conditions in both a solar hot water and liquid desiccant storage environment. The primary result is the development of a simple relationship between a dimensionless performance indicator and a second dimensionless parameter that represents the operating condition. A simulation model is used to define this relationship between the operating condition and manifold performance and is applicable to manifolds operating in both hot water and liquid desiccant <b>storage</b> tanks. A <b>plug</b> flow tank model is used to approximate transient tank stratification. Initial modeling suggests off-design operation results in low levels of mixing. Finally, a manifold was built and tested within a prototype liquid desiccant tank. Results show that the design returns low density fluid through the bottom of the tank at a significantly reduced mixing rate compared to free discharge. The same manifold design is able to return high density fluid with minimal mixing...|$|R
40|$|INTEGRATING local {{renewable}} resources into the low voltage distribution system can create weak micro-grids with limited power capabilities and challenging control requirements. The low inertia in these micro-grids {{can result in}} significant frequency excursions when large load or generation changes are seen. Micro-grids may also be more susceptible to high harmonic distortion in their voltage due to non-negligible supply impedance. This calls for advance control techniques to regulate frequency and maintain voltage at the standards required of the utility grid. Failure to do so may incur disconnection of the weak grid from the main supply leading to cascading power disruptions to the consumers. This thesis explores one approach to improving the frequency control in weak grids {{in the presence of}} poor voltage quality by exploiting energy storage to independently and optimally dispatch active power to constrain frequency fluctuations within acceptable limits. Power system frequency - a direct indication of generation-demand imbalance -is selected as the main control signal in the energy storage control system. The energy storage injects active power when the frequency falls below the lower threshold and absorbs active power when the frequency rises above the upper threshold. Imposing thresholds close to but not equal to the nominal frequency allows a sufficient speed error for the conventional speed governor of the prime movers of the power system to operate unhindered and acquire the full control of the load at the equilibrium. Frequency control by the energy storage support combined with the continuous speed governing acts to restrict the frequency excursions within the thresholds well within the primary frequency time requirements. The power system frequency is detected directly from the measured supply voltage in order to eliminate the need for any communication between system elements and make the energy <b>storage</b> device <b>plug</b> and-play. This has meant the investigation of a suitable frequency tracker which can respond quickly, {{and at the same time}} operate correctly in the presence of high supply voltage distortion. Frequency detection introduces a transient delay and a steady state ripple to the estimated frequency. Hence, a set of frequency detection requirements are defined that must be satisfied by any candidate frequency detection method. In identifying the best technique(s), this thesis presents a comparative analysis of candidate frequency detection methods when applied specifically in a weak grid. The analysis revealed that the Double Second Order Generalised Integrator Frequency Locked Loop (DSOGI-FLL) displays optimum transient and steady state characteristics for the energy storage control application requirements, closely followed by a Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) technique generalised in the study. The proposed frequency trackers and energy storage control techniques were validated experimentally and tuning of the key parameters to match user requirements was presented for both single and multiple energy storage systems...|$|R
40|$|More {{than ten}} years ago, a first image {{digitisation}} product was published by the National Library of the Czech Republic in co-operation with an almost unknown small software company. It was a CD-ROM requested by UNESCO for its Memory of the World programme. After {{that there were many}} tests concerning digitisation devices and another two CD-ROM projects were completed to present two interesting manuscripts with rich description metadata related to all the structural levels of the book, including full text. In 1995 - 1996, our first digitisation centre was built to process manuscripts and old printed books. Later, it was upgraded several times with additional devices such as scanners, book cradles for careful document fixation, sophisticated camera stands, microclimate control units, etc. Simultaneously, many software tools were developed to assist the digitisation production. The co-operation with the company became crucial for further development of this activity and both the library and the company grew thanks to each other. In 1999, another project started to output digital data: it was based on the idea of safeguarding acid-paper library materials through preservation microfilming combined with digitisation of microfilm for access purposes. In {{order to be able to}} store large amounts of image data produced by this second programme, a mass <b>storage</b> facility was <b>plugged</b> into the digitisation production line. It was based on robotic library using magnetic tapes as storage medium. Successively, the digitisation programmes began to be used also by other Czech institutions holding rare collections of documents: other libraries, museums, archives, and even castle libraries and church institutions. Today, from all the digitised documents almost half of them are from other institutions than the National Library. This is an important success that has taken place thanks to support of the Ministry of Culture through specific grant programmes. Interested institutions can ask the Ministry for up to 70 % of the total digitisation cost for their projects with which they apply in calls for proposals...|$|R
40|$|Agaricus blazei is {{an immensely}} popular edible 'medicinal mushroom' in Japan, mainly due to {{traditional}} beliefs {{that it has}} antitumour properties, {{and the ability to}} stimulate the immune system. The majority of scientific research carried out on A. blazei has demonstrated that polysaccharides extracted from mushrooms fruiting bodies are the active agents for the purported anticancer properties. Limited research has been undertaken with regards to liquid-cultured mycelium and liquid culture filtrates of A. blazei and this investigation involved screening these products for novel medicinal properties. The growth of the fungus was examined on solid agar for the propagation of mycelium which was used for inoculation of liquid cultures. Optimal fungal storage conditions were also determined. The optimum growth temperature and pH of A. blazei on yeast malt agar were 28 - 29 °C and pH 5 - 6, respectively. <b>Storage</b> of mycelial <b>plugs</b> at - 80 °C in 10 % glycerol was found to maintain viability of the fungus for up to 36 months. Subsequent growth trials in liquid media found that a temperature of 30 °C over a pH range of 4 - 8 were optimal for mycelial growth. Glucose as a carbohydrate source produced the most mycelium, while sucrose was most favourable for exopolysaccharide production. The exopolysaccharides produced were identified as mannan-protein complexes. Organic solvent extracts of liquid-cultured mycelia were examined, and antibacterial activity was identified against Branhamella cattarhalis and some Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts. In vitro cytotoxic activity was observed against cervical cancer and lymphoma cell lines, particularly for hexane and dichloromethane extracts. Protein extracts of Agaricus blazei liquid-cultured mycelium were found to have antiviral effect against simian rotavirus, although the cause of the observed effect was likely due to the presence of a trypsin inhibitor in the extract. Cytotoxic activity of the protein extract was also identified against lymphoma cells in vitro. Exopolysaccharides from liquid culture filtrate of A. blazei did not have an effect on rotavirus, but had a marked cytotoxic effect on lymphoma cells, {{and to a lesser extent}} of cervical cancer cells. Thus, the cytotoxic effect was found to be specific for tumour cells...|$|R

BremerJack FryIncreasing water {{scarcity}} {{may result in}} greater irrigation restrictions for turfgrass. Drought tolerance and recovery of Kentucky bluegrasses (Poa. pratensis L.) (KBG) were evaluated during and after 88 and 60 day dry downs in 2010 and 2011, respectively, under a rainout shelter. Changes in green coverage were evaluated with digital images. Green coverage declined slowest during dry downs and increased fastest during recoveries in the cultivar ‘Apollo’, indicating it had superior drought tolerance. Electrolyte leakage, photosynthesis, and leaf water potential were evaluated in 7 KBG cultivars {{during and after the}} dry downs. Soil moisture at 5 and 20 cm was measured. There were generally no differences in physiological parameters among cultivars during or after dry down. The highest reduction in soil moisture at 5 and 20 cm was in Apollo, suggesting it had a better developed root system for mining water from the profile during drought. Weed prevention and turfgrass establishment of ‘Legacy’ buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides [Nutt. ] Engelm.) and ‘Chisholm’ zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) grown on turf reinforcement mats (TRM) was evaluated. ‘Chisholm’ zoysiagrass stolons grew under the TRM; as such, use of TRM for this cultivar is not practical. Buffalograss had 90 % or greater coverage when established on TRM in 2010 and 65 % or greater coverage in 2011; coverage was similar to that in oxadiazon-treated plots {{at the end of each}} year. ‘Legacy’ buffalograss plugs were established on TRM over plastic for 3 weeks, stored in TRM under tree shade for 7, 14, or 21 days, and evaluated for establishment after <b>storage.</b> In 2010, <b>plugs</b> on mats stored for 7 days had similar coverage to the control, but in 2011 displayed similar coverage to plugs stored on TRM for 14 or 21 day treatments. Green leaf are index (LAI) is an important indicator of turfgrass performance, but its measurement is time consuming and destructive. Measurements using hyperspectral radiometry were compared with destructive measurements of LAI. Results suggest spectral radiometry has potential to accurately predict LAI. The robustness of prediction models varied over the growing season. Finding one model to predict LAI across and entire growing season still seems unrealistic...|$|R
