50|$|A hand truck, {{also known}} as a dolly, two wheeler, <b>stack</b> <b>truck,</b> trolley, trundler, box cart, trolley truck, sack barrow, sack truck, or bag barrow, is an L-shaped box-moving {{handcart}} with handles at one end, wheels at the base, with a small ledge to set objects on, flat against the floor when the hand-truck is upright. The objects to be moved are tilted forward, the ledge is inserted underneath them, and the objects allowed to tilt back and rest on the ledge. The truck and object are then tilted backward until the weight is balanced over the large wheels, making otherwise bulky and heavy objects easier to move. It is a first-class lever.|$|R

50|$|Israel {{limits the}} amount of load the trucks may carry, ostensibly for {{security}} reasons. In the past, the total height of goods <b>stacked</b> on <b>trucks</b> {{was not allowed to}} exceed 1.2 meters. The Israeli authorities did, however, not explain why they did not use to its full potential the scanner, donated by the Dutch government and calibrated according to the military’s specifications, which can scan at a height of 2 meters. In February 2016, the allowed height was increased to 1.5 meters.|$|R

The 84 victims {{were reported to have}} been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.|$|R

50|$|In 1988, {{a method}} of using water to control was discovered. This was {{accomplished}} by containing 2 parallel tubes within a third outer tube. When filled, this structure formed a non-rolling wall of water that can control 80 percent of its height in external water depth, with dry ground behind it. Eight foot tall water filled barriers were used to surround Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station during the 2011 Missouri River Flooding. Instead of trucking in sandbag material for a flood, <b>stacking</b> it, then <b>trucking</b> it out to a hazmat disposal site, flood control {{can be accomplished by}} using the on site water. However, these are not fool proof. A 8 ft high 2000 ft long water filled rubber flood berm that surrounded portions of the plant was punctured by a skid-steer loader and it collapsed flooding a portion of the facility.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a non-linear integer programming {{model for a}} cross-dock problem that considers the total transportation cost of inbound and outbound trucks from an origin to a destination and {{the total cost of}} assigning strip and <b>stack</b> doors to <b>trucks</b> based on their number of trips and the distance between doors in cross-dock. In previous studies these two cost-based problems are modeled separately however it is more realistic and practical to use both of them as an integrated cross-docking model. Additionally this model is solved for a randomly generated numerical example with three suppliers and two customers by the use of a genetic algorithm. By comparing two different parameter levels i. e. low and high numbers of populations the optimum solution is obtained considering a high level population size. A number of strip and stack doors are equal to a number of inbound and outbound trucks in the same sequence as 4 and 6 respectively. Finally the conclusion is presented...|$|R
5000|$|The State Roads Commission (SRC), {{predecessor}} of the Authority, {{bought the}} bridge in 1923 {{and continued to}} operate it as a toll facility. The structure was extremely narrow, with a roadway only 13 ft wide. Heavy trucks inched past each other, {{and there were many}} side-swiping accidents on the bridge. Traffic usually moved at a snail’s pace. To alleviate the problem, the SRC in 1926 built a second deck over the old bridge, converting each level into a crossing for one-way traffic. This project was {{considered one of the most}} ingenious bridge-engineering feats of the time. Then new problems surfaced. The new deck had a vertical clearance of 12.5 ft [...] - [...] barely sufficient to accommodate the growing number of commercial vehicles traveling the bridge in the 1930s. Frequently, <b>trucks</b> <b>stacked</b> too high with freight became wedged between the deck and the overhead structure and could proceed only after their tires were deflated to allow adequate clearance. The need for a newer, more modern structure became apparent in the mid-1930s.|$|R
40|$|In Ireland, {{timber and}} biomass haulage faces the {{challenge}} of transporting enough material within strict legal dimensions and gross vehicle weights restrictions for trucks and trailers. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a method to control payload weight by knowing the moisture content of the wood. Weights, volumes, and moisture content were gathered from 100 truckloads of Sitka spruce pulpwood. Truck volume and weight utilization patterns were analyzed based on <b>stacked</b> volume, <b>truck</b> volume, and weights recorded from the weighbridge. Solid/bulk volume conversion factors for the truckloads were estimated indicating the truck’s solid volume capacity to be filled. Trucks were grouped into five conditions based on their configuration—volume capacity and legal maximum payload. A loaded volume fraction was estimated to assess the optimal volume capacity and stanchion height at which the trucks should be loaded. Results showed that 100 % of the trucks presented volume underutilization, with a maximum of 27. 5 m 3 (only 39. 85 % volume capacity). In contrast, 67 % of trucks were overweight while the remaining 33 % were under the legal maximum weight. The average solid/bulk volume conversion factor was 0. 66 ± 0. 013 at 95 % confidence level. Depending on the conditions, trucks can be filled to 100 % of their volume capacity with wood at an MC from 29 % to 55 %. The minimum truck volume capacity utilization was 45 %. This methodology can be used by truck hauliers, enabling them to determine in-forest the optimum volume and weight of wood to be transported by knowing the moisture content (MC), the wood specie, and using the height of the stanchions of the trailer as reference when loading the truck...|$|R
5000|$|Investigating this {{pressure}} spike, the Day Board Operator fully opened the level control valve {{to the heavy}} raffinate storage tank and shut off of the gas fueling the furnace, but the raffinate feed into the splitter tower was not shut off. Hot raffinate flowed into the blowdown drum and stack and as it filled, some of the fluid started to flow into the ISOM unit sewer system via a 6 in pipeline {{at the base of}} the blowdown drum, but the high level alarm for the blowdown drum didn't sound. As the blowdown drum and stack filled up, hot raffinate shot out of the top of the stack and into the air, forming a 20 ft [...] "geyser". The hot raffinate rained down on the ground and ran down the side of the blow-down drum and stack and pooled {{at the base of the}} unit. A radio call was received in the control room that hot hydrocarbons were overflowing from the <b>stack.</b> A pick-up <b>truck,</b> with its engine running, had been carelessly parked within 30 ft of the blowdown stack; the vapor cloud reached the vehicle, and hydrocarbon fumes were drawn directly into the air intake valve, causing the engine to race. Nearby workers frantically tried to shut down the engine, without success. The expanding vapor cloud forced the workers who were trying to shut down the overspeeding truck engine to retreat. The cloud continued to spread across the ISOM plant, across the pipe-rack to the West and into the trailer area unimpeded. No emergency alarm sounded, and at approximately 1:20 p.m., the vapor cloud was ignited by a backfire seen from the overheating truck engine by nearby witnesses, producing a massive explosion that was heard for miles. The blast pressure wave struck the contractor trailers, either completely destroying or severely damaging many of them. The force of the explosion sent debris flying, instantly killing 15 people in and around the trailers and severely injuring 180 others. The pressure wave was so powerful it blew out windows off site up to a distance of 3/4 mi away. An area estimated at 200000 sq ft of the refinery was badly burned by the subsequent fire that followed the violent explosion, damaging millions of dollars worth of refinery equipment. The entire ISOM unit was severely damaged by the explosion and subsequent fire, and as a result, remained out of operation for more than 2 years.|$|R
