5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. He thought that this would help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the city}} of College Station began {{manufacturing}} Austin city limits signs for students to place at {{the summit of the}} Bonfire so that <b>students</b> <b>would</b> stop stealing signs from Austin. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band began building the outhouse, ending the tradition of stealing Bonfire's components.|$|E
50|$|People from Manila may ask why {{a student}} came home early when school is in session. The <b>student</b> <b>would</b> answer, May pasok, pero waláng klase; the <b>student</b> <b>would</b> {{go to school}} to have their {{attendance}} checked, {{but there are no}} classes.|$|R

5|$|In 2016, {{due to a}} {{mounting}} debt {{in funding}} of the athletic program, the university polled its students {{on whether or not}} they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the <b>students</b> <b>would</b> approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As {{a result of this}} exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these <b>students</b> <b>would</b> found their own styles of aikido.|$|E
5|$|The Polytechnic-Foreign Specialised Institutions (Poly-FSI) {{initiative}} {{was introduced by}} the Ministry of Education in 2005. Its aim was to encourage polytechnics to partner with overseas universities to offer degree programmes in niche areas. Through this initiative, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> enjoy a more enriching learning experience in areas that also supported Singapore’s economic development.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American <b>students</b> <b>would</b> resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the planned}} {{relationship}} were contained in the agreement signed by the Ashland Board of Education and the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees. By this agreement the university would provide a course of study and administration which would be {{comparable to that of}} the university at Lexington and for which the <b>students</b> <b>would</b> receive the same credit as the students in Lexington. The Ashland Board of Education was to provide the buildings, land, equipment and facilities. All other expenses, including teacher salaries were to be paid by the University of Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|The {{score is}} {{calculated}} {{based on a}} bell curve. For example, if many do well in a paper, there is a potential reduction of the raw score and vice versa, despite differences in performances each year. For example, an average <b>student</b> <b>would</b> get a score of 210+ if he/she scored 3 low As and a high B. A highly proficient <b>student</b> <b>would</b> easily get a score of 250 and above if they scored 2 or 3 A*s and high As.|$|R

5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Formal singing {{schools were}} the first {{well-documented}} musical institution in Baltimore. They were common in colonial North America prior to the Revolutionary War, but were not established in Baltimore until afterwards, in 1789. These singing schools were taught by instructors known as masters, or singing masters, and were often itinerant; they taught vocal performance and techniques for use in Christian psalmody. The first singing school in Baltimore was founded in the courthouse, in 1789, by Ishmael Spicer, whose <b>students</b> <b>would</b> include the future John Cole.|$|E
5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.|$|E

50|$|Students {{choose their}} {{preference}} of Undergraduate College {{based on their}} interest (not major) when they are accepted to the university and {{are required to take}} two courses in their first year, one per semester, pertaining to their undergraduate college placement. These courses are generally known as FYS 101 and FYS 102 (FYS standing for First Year Seminar), but are specific to each college, with each section replacing FYS with the three letter college abbreviation (Example: a Global Studies <b>student</b> <b>would</b> take GLS 101, a Human Development <b>student</b> <b>would</b> take HDV 101, etc...).|$|R

5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: <b>students</b> <b>would</b> {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Literacy on Nauru is 96percent. Education is {{compulsory}} {{for children}} {{from six to}} sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12). There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> study either by distance or abroad. Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 Nauruan teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue onto the degree to complete their studies. This project is led by Associate Professor Pep Serow and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The <b>students</b> <b>would</b> imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
50|$|The law {{initially}} {{stipulated that}} {{the duration of}} study and training in the College would be two years, after which the <b>student</b> <b>would</b> receive a Diploma in Policing Sciences.|$|R

5|$|Mieza {{was like}} a {{boarding}} school for Alexander {{and the children of}} Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these <b>students</b> <b>would</b> become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day after}} the killings, the head of the State Treasury, Pekka Syrjänen, said that <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be able to seek {{compensation}} from the state for physical and psychological damage caused by the shootings. This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted in relation to other forms of compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings {{as a consequence of the}} attack. Relatives were also able to gain compensation for costs incurred whilst caring for those affected, or funeral or hospital bills.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be compensated.|$|E

50|$|Paul Pimsleur, {{also known}} for the Pimsleur {{language}} learning system, spent time researching four factors that he believed {{to be related to}} language learning aptitude. Pimsleur included grade point average as an indication of general academic achievement as well as motivation in his factors. In addition, the verbal ability factor indicated how well a <b>student</b> <b>would</b> be able to handle the mechanics of learning a foreign language and the auditory factor indicated how well a <b>student</b> <b>would</b> be able to listen to and produce phrases in a foreign language. To test these four factors, Pimsleur developed the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery.|$|R
