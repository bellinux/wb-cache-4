40|$|Improvements in {{survival}} in dialysis patients {{over the past}} few decades have been disappointing. Recent prospective trials such the haemodialysis study have not shown conclusive improvements. Two recent observational studies have found a striking survival advantage <b>for</b> <b>haemodiafiltration</b> (HDF). This review covers the differences between HDF and conventional haemodialysis (HD) and the history of the technological advances in the HDF technique. In addition, it explores the putative benefits of HDF over HD. While the observational studies provide a basis for optimism that HDF will provide benefit to dialysis patients, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn until the results of randomized controlled trials are available. While the evidence in favour of HDF at this stage is observational only, there are no studies suggesting that the treatment is detrimental. The use of HDF should probably be increased, particularly in centres where an increase in the frequency and duration of dialysis cannot be readily achieved...|$|R
30|$|Methods Patients {{admitted}} to regional ICU with intra-abdominal sepsis that required intervention, who developed severe septic shock required inotropic support and {{acute renal failure}} required renal support, was assigned to receive oXiris <b>haemodiafiltration</b> <b>for</b> 72  hours. Matched patients with similar pathology and severity, who received ordinary <b>haemodiafiltration</b> <b>for</b> acute renal failure, were identified for comparison. Primary outcome was the percentage of reduction of inotrope dose within 96  hours {{after the start of}} renal replacement therapy, which was calculated according to equivalent Noradrenaline dose (ug/hr). Second outcomes including duration of MV, duration of CRRT, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality.|$|R
30|$|Results: Sixteen {{patients}} (four patients received both CVVH and CVVHDF) {{were included}} and twenty sampling profiles (9 CVVH, 11 CVVHDF) were analysed. A two-compartment linear model best described the data. Patient weight {{was the only}} covariate that was associated with drug clearance. The mean (SD) parameter estimates were 25.2 [*]±[*] 17.3  L for central volume, 0.89 [*]±[*] 1.17  L/h for rate constant for drug distribution from the central to the peripheral compartment, 2.38 [*]±[*] 6.60  L/h for rate constant for drug distribution from the peripheral to the central compartment, 4.45 [*]±[*] 2.35  L/h <b>for</b> <b>haemodiafiltration</b> clearance and 4.69 [*]±[*] 2.42 for haemofiltration clearance. After accounting for patient weight, CVVH and CVVHDF clearance were 5.19 (± 0.74) L/h and 4.08 (± 0.50) L/h (p[*]=[*] 0.21), respectively. Dosing simulations for amikacin supported the use of high dosing regimens (≥ 25  mg/kg) and extended intervals (36 to 48  h) for most patients to achieve the pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics target of peak/MIC[*]≥[*] 8 for efficacy and the lowest probability of target attainment (PTA) of a minimal concentration[*]≥[*] 2.5  mg/L for toxicity.|$|R
