50|$|Almost {{all modern}} coxswain's {{amplifier}} systems have a liquid crystal display, showing the {{strokes per minute}} (SPM). On most systems, a magnet is positioned under the stroke man's seat. In bowloaded boats, the magnet is placed under the bow man's seat. As the rower moves up the slide (moving forward {{to prepare for the}} next stroke), a measurement is taken, and fed to the system. The stroke seat (first rower in the stern) sets the rate of rowing for the whole crew so this is very important. The display also usually features a timer which can be stopped, cleared, and reset, along with a <b>stroke</b> <b>counter.</b> For rows in poor lighting, the display is also equipped with a backlight.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Stroke</b> <b>counters</b> help {{a player}} {{keep track of}} the number of strokes he or she has made during a hole, an entire round, or both. The {{simplest}} devices are strings of beads, thumbwheels or [...] "clickers" [...] that a player advances by one after each stroke and provide a total for the player to write on their scorecard after each hole; newer variations have various degrees of computational power added and can keep score for multiple holes, total scores, and keep track of over/under par statistics.

Counters by themselves are allowed under strict rules, but some multi-functional devices incorporate additional banned features like rangefinders or wind gauges, and as such the entire device becomes illegal.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to define}} the {{dynamics}} of technical preparedness and competition activity of young footballers in age 10 – 12. Material and Methods: analysis and generalization of literary sources; pedagogical supervisions; instrumental method of registration of competition performance indicators; methods of mathematical statistics. In research 24 footballers took part 10 – 12. Playing activity was analysed during 18 games of championship of s. Kharkiv on football. Results: dynamics of indicators presented by tests: dribbling, <b>stroke</b> <b>counters,</b> shot on goal, dribbling with a stroke 5 laps, juggling, hit {{the ball on the}} accuracy. Conclusions: it was determined that the total command of technical and tactical actions (TTA) during competitive activity increases with age. The 10 -year-old young players perform per game 324, 6 ± 12, 3 TTA, at 11 -years of age, the figure was 407, 1 ± 14, 6 TTA, and in 12 -years – 433, 2 ± 13, 8 TTA...|$|R

40|$|Typography is a {{critical}} tool in visual communication. Selecting the appropriate typeface to express and communicate a message is very important. Since most studies on typeface design concentrate on typeface legibility and readability, this thesis focuses on the visual expression of typefaces and their design characteristics. The relationship between typefaces and their personality traits including legible, cheerful, fearful, creative, attractive, formal, sloppy, relaxed, friendly and confident are investigated. A font survey about twenty four typefaces and ten personality traits is conducted {{and a series of}} statistical analyses are performed to discover the correlation between typefaces and their personality traits. As a result, the number of studied typefaces is reduced from twenty four to fifteen and these fifteen typefaces are categorized into four groups according to their personality traits and typographical features. Typeface design characteristics, such as x-height proportion, ascender and descender proportion, font weight, <b>stroke</b> design, <b>counter</b> design as well as character space of these fifteen typefaces are studied in depth. Typeface design characteristics of four different groups are summarized. In addition, the aesthetic design characteristics of studied typefaces are analyzed.

50|$|After {{the front}} was finally stabilised for the Germans by Erich von Manstein <b>counter</b> <b>stroke</b> at Karkov, the 88th {{division}} was again in defensive positions, this time along the Minus river, whilst dramatic events unfolded around the Kursk salient. The {{failure of the}} German offensive preceded {{the start of a}} prolonged period of Soviet attacks, and by September, von Manstein was no longer confident that the forces of AGS could defeat them without substantial reinforcement. Hitler thereafter authorised the withdrawal to the Panther line on 15 September. A race to the Dnieper followed: both German and Soviet forces raced to reach the river first, with the German forces attempting to fully man defensive fortifications ahead of the arrival of the bulk of the Soviet forces.|$|R
5|$|With {{the weather}} {{improving}} over the United Kingdom and Normandy, Hausser's preparations for his <b>counter</b> <b>stroke</b> came under continual harassment from Allied aircraft and artillery fire, delaying {{the start of}} the attack to the afternoon. From the number of German reinforcements arriving in the VIII Corps sector and aerial reconnaissance, O'Connor suspected that the Germans were organising a counter-stroke. XXX Corps was still some way to the north, leaving the VIII Corps right flank vulnerable, O'Connor postponed attacks by I Corps and ordered VIII Corps onto the defensive. Dempsey, privy to ULTRA decrypts of intercepted German signal traffic, knew the counter-attack was coming and approved O'Connor's precautions. VIII Corps began to reorganise to meet the attack. Supply echelons for Hausser's divisions were located in the Évrecy–Noyers-Bocage–Villers-Bocage area and were the focus of RAF fighter-bomber attention throughout the morning and early afternoon; the RAF claimed the destruction of over 200 vehicles.|$|R

Although a eunuch was legally barred from the imperial throne, Staurakios nevertheless seems to have aspired to seize it for himself. Warned by Aetios, Empress Irene issued orders in February 800 that no one from the military should have any contact with Staurakios. This measure curbed the latter's designs, and introduced a precarious balance between Staurakios and Aetios, the latter still supported by Niketas Triphyllios. Soon after, Staurakios fell fatally ill, reportedly coughing up blood. Nevertheless, persuaded by doctors, monks and soothsayers that he would live and become Byzantine emperor, he instigated a revolt in Cappadocia against his adversary Aetios, who had by then secured the post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme (the highest-ranked military position in the Byzantine Empire).

60|$|And {{it needs}} but a cursory {{view of history}} to realize--though all {{knowledge}} of history confirms the generalization--that this arena is not a confused and aimless conflict of individuals. Looked at too closely it {{may seem to be}} that--a formless web of individual hates and loves; but detach oneself but a little, and the broader forms appear. One perceives something that goes on, that is constantly working to make order out of casualty, beauty out of confusion; justice, kindliness, mercy out of cruelty and inconsiderate pressure. For our present purpose it will be sufficient to speak of this force that struggles and tends to make and do, as Good Will. More and more evident is it, as one reviews the ages, that there is this as well as lust, hunger, avarice, vanity and more or less intelligent fear to be counted among the motives of mankind. This Good Will of our race, however arising, however trivial, however subordinated to individual ends, however comically inadequate a thing it may be in this individual case or that, is in the aggregate an operating will. In spite of all the confusions and thwartings of life, the halts and resiliencies and the <b>counter</b> <b>strokes</b> of fate, it is manifest {{that in the long run}} human life becomes broader than it was, gentler than it was, finer and deeper. On the whole--and now-a-days almost steadily--things get better. There is a secular amelioration of life, and it is brought about by Good Will working through the efforts of men.|$|R
40|$|Typeface design: {{collaborative}} work commissioned by Adobe Inc. Published but unreleased. The Adobe Devanagari typefaces were commissioned from Tiro Typeworks and collaboratively designed by Tim Holloway, Fiona Ross and John Hudson, beginning in 2005. The types were officially released in 2009. The design brief was {{to produce a}} typeface for modern business communications in Hindi and other languages, to be legible both in print and on screen. Adobe Devanagari {{was designed to be}} highly readable in a range of situations including quite small sizes in spreadsheets and in continuous text setting, as well as at display sizes, where the full character of the typeface reveals itself. The construction of the letters is based on traditional penmanship but possesses less stroke contrast than many Devanagari types, in order to maintain strong, legible forms at smaller sizes. To achieve a dynamic, fluid style the design features a rounded treatment of distinguishing terminals and <b>stroke</b> reversals, open <b>counters</b> that also aid legibility at smaller sizes, and delicately flaring strokes. Together, these details reveal an original hand and provide a contemporary approach that is clean, clear and comfortable to read whether in short or long passages of text. This new approach to a traditional script is intended to counter the dominance of rigid, staccato-like effects of straight verticals and horizontals in earlier types and many existing fonts. OpenType Layout features in the fonts provide both automated and discretionary access to an extensive glyph set, enabling sophisticated typography. Many conjuncts preferred in classical literary texts and particularly in some North Indian languages are included; these literary conjuncts may be substituted by specially designed alternative linear forms and fitted half forms. The length of the ikars—ि and ी—varies automatically according to adjacent letter or conjunct width. Regional variants of characters and numerals (e. g. Marathi forms) are included as alternates. Careful attention has been given to the placements of all vowel signs and modifiers. The fonts include both proportional and tabular numerals in Indian and European styles. Extensive kerning covers several thousand possible combinations of half forms and full forms to anticipate arbitrary conjuncts in foreign loan words. ____...|$|R

40|$|In desktop publishing, fonts are {{essential}} components in each document design. With {{the development of}} font design software and tools, {{there are thousands of}} digital fonts. Increasing the number of available fonts makes selecting an appropriate font, which best serves the objective of a design, not an intuitive issue. Designers can search for a font like any other file types by using general information such as name and file format. But for document design purposes, the design features or visual characteristics of fonts are more meaningful for designers than font file information. Therefore, representing fonts’ design features by searchable and comparable data would facilitate searching and selecting a desirable font. One solution is to represent a font’s design features by a code composed of several digits. This solution has been implemented as a computerized system called PANOSE- 1 for Latin script fonts. PANOSE- 1 is a system for classifying and matching typefaces based on design features. It is composed of 10 digits, where each digit represents a specific design feature. It is used within several font management tools as an option for ordering and searching fonts based on their design features. It is also used in font replacement processes when an application or an operating system detects a missing font in an immigrant document or website. Currently, PANOSE- 1 is only defined for fonts that have Latin characters. Therefore {{there is a need for}} providing a model that describes and classifies fonts with Arabic characters. In this research, a new model PANOSE-A is defined to extend PANOSE- 1 coverage to support Arabic characters. The model defines eight digits in addition to the first digit of PANOSE- 1 which indicates the font script and family type. Each digit describes a visual or a design feature and takes value between 0 - 15. The meaning of 0 and 1 values is similar to what is defined for PANOSE- 1. Each of the remaining values indicates a specific variation of its represented feature. Weight and contrast are two essential features in any font design. Two digits of the models describe the common variations of the weight and contrast features for text fonts. Another four digits describe the shape of some strokes that usually vary in their design between fonts. One digit describes the end shape of terminal strokes using three letters with different terminal strokes. Another digit describes the shape of the bowl stroke while the third digit describes the shape of curved stroke. The thresholds that used to define each shape class are taken from Naskh calligraphy guidelines. The fourth digit describes the shape of rounded <b>strokes</b> with enclosed <b>counter.</b> The shape classes of this digit are based on how the counter shape is similar to one of five geometric shapes. These basic geometric shapes are triangle, square, rectangular, oval and circle. The last two digits describe the characteristics of two important vertical references of the Arabic font design which are tooth and loop heights. The reliability of the model was evaluated by conducting two clustering processes on 30 fonts of Naskh style. The proposed PANOSE-A model was used to construct a similarity matrix for one the clustering processes while the other clustering process used a similarity matrix that was produced by using a font matching tool. The result clusters of the two clustering processes have been evaluated by silhouette coefficient. Silhouette is a method to measure data consistency validation within clusters. It indicates how objects are similar in their own cluster compared to other clusters. Clustering result based on the similarity matrix produced by font matching tool got 97. 04 while using clustering result based on the similarity measured by PANOSE-A model got 98. 24. The similarity between the results of the two clustering processes has been estimated, indicating that the model succeeded in classifying 85...|$|R
