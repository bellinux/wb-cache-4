5000|$|Frazier Lake Airpark [...] {{is a small}} privately owned, {{public use}} non-towered airport located near Hollister, in San Benito County, California, USA. The Airpark is located between two valleys that run from San Jose, California to Hollister, California. The nearest notable cities near Frazier Lake are Gilroy and Hollister. Frazier Lake has two runways, one is turf and one is water. The turf runway 5/23 is closed when it is too wet to avoid {{aircraft}} landing on a too <b>soft</b> <b>runway.</b> The turf runway may be closed at other times as necessary. The first Saturday of each month is antique airplane display day. Antique and homebuilt aircraft are on display and the public is invited to view them.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{requirement of}} military transport aircraft {{is the ability}} to manoeuvre on <b>soft</b> soil <b>runways</b> whereby the flotation depends on the aircraft / runway strength relationship. One must take into consideration that when operating on substandard airfields take-off distance is increasing and extra propulsive force must be available. Hence predictions for the manoeuvrability, the higher rolling resistance compared to rigid surfaces, not to mention the runway damage should be available. These effects depend essentially on the deformation of soil in contrast to rigid pavements where the rolling resistance is caused mainly by internal hysteresis losses in the tyre. In the design process of concurrent engineering MBS (Multibody System) simulation tools take an important place. In contrast to the CBR (California Bearing Ratio) method, which is until now state-of-the-art in the landing gear design process for <b>soft</b> soil <b>runways,</b> multibody simulation allows to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle, tyre and soil system. The simulation of tyre-soil interaction by means of multibody tools makes use of analytical modelling and specific measurable parameters are used to describe the physical soil behaviour. With analytical approaches for the tyre-soil contact area it is possible to reach quite a good approximation for the real contact conditions. The main problems i...|$|R
50|$|Field {{elevation}} is 1,636 feet (499 m) above mean sea level, {{and some}} density altitude {{problems can be}} encountered on a summer day. Trees surround the airport close in, and there are trees close to {{each end of the}} field in the approaches. Elk, deer and motorcyclists may be encountered on the field. The surface is rough. Vehicle ruts, and frost heaved rocks are possible. The south third of the runway is almost always <b>soft,</b> and the <b>runway</b> is generally smoother the farther north you land. Overflight to check for surface damage, presence of obstructions, and height of grass is essential. The airport is usually open from June 1 to October 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{bombs were}} carried in two-section bomb bay in the {{fuselage}} (with space for 4 bombs) and 8 bomb bays {{in the central}} section of the wings (with space for 16 bombs). This arrangement of bomb bays imposed considerable restrictions on the types of bombs that could be carried, especially in the wing bays which were quite small as they had to fit between the ribs of the wing. The maximum load was 2,580 kg (2 × 300 kg and 18 × 110 kg). Apart from two 300 kg bombs {{in one of the}} fuselage bomb bays, it could not carry bombs larger than 110 kg. With maximum loadout, most of the weight of the bombs was carried inside the wings. There were no provisions for mounting bombs {{on the outside of the}} aircraft. During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, 110 kg was the maximum weight used, since the 300 kg bombs were only available in small quantities, and difficult to load at improvised airfields with little infrastructure. 50 kg bombs were also used. Maximal bomb load taken from <b>soft</b> surface <b>runways</b> was reduced to about 800-1200 kg.|$|R
