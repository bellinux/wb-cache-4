5000|$|The [...] twin {{cylinder}} engine produced [...] and {{was capable of}} 85 mph. A single camshaft behind the cylinders operated the valves via long pushrods passing through a tunnel in the cast iron block. This system needed {{a considerable number of}} studs and nuts to fasten down the cylinder head and rockerboxes, many of them deeply recessed and requiring well-made <b>box</b> <b>spanners</b> or the then uncommon sockets. As with other British motorcycles of the period, this kind of set-up regularly led to oil leaks.|$|R

[...] Here they {{produced}} the first tubular <b>box</b> <b>spanners</b> in 1905, and the first tubular sections for aircraft and the first tubular furniture in 1907. In 1909 two acres of land were acquired in Rounds Green, Oldbury which became Paddock Works. In 1913 they started manufacturing tubular steel shafts for golf clubs, having patented a process for prodicng seamless tapered tubes, but these were banned by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and so these could not be sold in Britain, although their use was permitted in America.|$|R
50|$|The Type 38 105mm Field Gun was a {{conventional}} design, with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.|$|R

50|$|The sequel Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface was penned by Shirow later. The manga series ran in Young Magazine from September 1991 to August 1997 and was {{originally}} released in hardcover format {{along with the}} original manga in a limited edition box set titled Kōkaku Kidōtai <b>SOLID</b> <b>BOX</b> (攻殻機動隊SOLID BOX) on December 1, 2000. The box set also contained a booklet titled ManMachine Interface Inactive Module, a poster and a Fuchikoma robot action figure. Kodansha later released the standard edition in tankōbon format on June 26, 2001. The <b>SOLID</b> <b>BOX</b> version added over 140 pages of new content and more changes {{were added to the}} tankōbon version, such as 24 color pages and large modifications to over 20 pages. However, 200 pages from the original version that ran in Young Magazine were not included in either the <b>SOLID</b> <b>BOX</b> or the tankōbon version. The manga was then distributed in English by Dark Horse Comics into 11 comic issues from January 29, 2003, to December 31, 2003. Masamune Shirow manually redrew the manga for the English version so that it could be read from left to right. It was later collected into a single volume in trade paperback format on January 12, 2005. The manga was later republished by Kodansha Comics on August 10, 2010.|$|R

Griffith's stock company, appearing primarily in westerns. Four years later, he made his mark as a director and gained valuable experience at Universal (1916-17 and 1921-23), before moving on to MGM in 1925. He remained there until 1948, often helming prestige assignments featuring the studio's top male star, Clark Gable: Boom Town (1940), Honky Tonk (1941), The Hucksters (1947) - all <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> office hits.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Ghost in the Shell manga ran in Japan from April 1989 to November 1990 in Kodansha's manga anthology Young Magazine, and {{was released}} in a tankōbon volume on October 5, 1991. Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface followed 1997 for 9 issues in Young Magazine, and was collected in the Ghost in the Shell: <b>Solid</b> <b>Box</b> on December 1, 2000. Four stories from Man-Machine Interface that were not released in tankobon format from previous releases were later collected in Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor, and was published by Kodansha on July 23, 2003. Several art books have also been published for the manga.|$|R

The following chart shows the solubilities of various compounds, in water, at a pressure of 1 atm and at room temperature (approx. 293.15 K). Any box that reads [...] "soluble" [...] results in an aqueous product, while [...] "slightly soluble" [...] and [...] "insoluble" [...] markings means that there is a precipitate that will form (usually, this is a <b>solid).</b> <b>Boxes</b> marked [...] "other" [...] can mean that many different states of products can result.

[...] (WGSH) as an umbrella title for all the figures released in this line. To start the line, Mego produced Batman, Robin, Aquaman, and Superman figures. (For the South African market, a local radio play superhero, Jet Jungle, {{was included in the}} series.) The earliest figures were released in a <b>solid</b> <b>box,</b> but these boxes were often damaged by shoppers who wanted to see the figure inside. The design was quickly changed to a [...] "window" [...] style box. The WGSH line was offered from 1972 until 1983.|$|R

When Thunderbolt's old partners try to find him, he and Lightfoot make a pact with them to pull one last big heist. Eastwood was originally slated to direct it himself, but Cimino impressed Eastwood enough to change his mind. The film became a <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> office success at the time, making $25,000,000 {{at the box office}} with a budget of $4,000,000 [...] and earned Bridges an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Crain {{appeared}} in three film. A Letter to Three Wives (1949), in which Crain {{was one of}} several stars, quickly became established as a classic, winning Joseph L.

However Pinky, earned Crain a nomination the Academy Award for Best Actress {{and was one of the}} most popular films of the year. Pinky was controversial, since it told the story of a light-skinned African American woman who passes for white in the Northern United States. Although Lena Horne and other black actresses were considered, producer Darryl F. Zanuck chose to cast a white actress for fear of racial backlash.|$|R

The dotted box is the trajectory of the ending part of simulation and the <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> is the trajectory of the beginning part of simulation. Enlarging the ending part gets Fig.  20 b. According to Fig.  20, the air-gapped CT’s hysteresis loops are narrow, compared to the closed-core one. When the line fault is cleared, the core magnetic flux density continues to decline in an approximately spiral way, does not form a stable hysteresis loop. The core remanence value is gradually approaching zero. It {{can also be seen}} that the remanence of air-gapped CT can be gradually digested and, after the clearance it becomes lower than a certain level, usually 10 % of saturation flux density.|$|R

5000|$|The Type 38 75 mm Field Gun was a {{thoroughly}} conventional design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.At some point prior to the Second Sino-Japanese War (sources differ as to when) the Type 38 was extensively modified. The piece was trunnioned forward and equilibrators were added to compensate for muzzle heaviness. It was given a hollow box trail that allowed elevation to 43°. The new version was called the [...] "Improved Type 38". Some 400 units were produced in Japan, and it is unclear exactly how many Type 38s were upgraded to the improved version. However, both types were still in service in limited numbers {{by the start of}} World War II, despite efforts to replace the design with the Type 90 75 mm Field Gun.|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{operators}} understandably seek {{to operate}} {{remotely operated vehicles}} (ROVs) {{for as long as}} possible and in the widest range of sea conditions. Accurate predictions of the hydrodynamic loads are important at the design stage as well as in operation, particularly during the launch and recovery phases when snatching of the tether may occur. There is some speculation that calculation methods currently advocated in guidelines lead to an over-estimation of the hydrodynamic forces and consequently to unduly restrictive operability constraints. The present paper has measured wave forces on a 1 / 8 scale model of a widely used ‘workclass’ ROV, as well as on a <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> of similar envelope dimensions, and compared these against Morison's equation using coefficients derived from three methods. It is concluded that simple linear theory using total (substantive) derivatives, together with a Morison coefficient Cm≈ 1. 5, can provide good estimates of the loading even in waves of quite high steepness, perhaps for height-to-wavelength ratios up to 0. 08; i. e., in practice, up to wave breaking...|$|R
5000|$|When New York Times writer Fred M. Hechinger wrote a {{piece that}} {{declared}} A Clockwork Orange [...] "fascist", Kubrick responded:It is quite true that my film's view of man is less flattering than the one Rousseau entertained in a similarly allegorical narrative—but, {{in order to avoid}} fascism, does one have to view man as a noble savage rather than an ignoble one? Being a pessimist is not yet enough to qualify one to be regarded as a tyrant (I hope)... The age of the alibi, in which we find ourselves, began with the opening sentence of Rousseau's Emile: 'Nature made me happy and good, and if I am otherwise, it is society's fault.' It is based on two misconceptions: that man in his natural state was happy and good, and that primal man had no society... Rousseau's romantic fallacy that it is society which corrupts man, not man who corrupts society, places a flattering gauze between ourselves and reality. This view, to use Mr. Hechinger's frame of reference, is <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> office but, in the end, such a self-inflating illusion leads to despair.|$|R

5000|$|Estimates of the film's total {{revenues}} have varied widely: numbers {{as high as}} $600 million have been cited, which would make Deep Throat one of the highest-grossing films of all time. With an average ticket price of $5, box-office takings of $600 million would imply 120 million admissions, an unrealistic figure. Although subsequent sales of the film on home videotape certainly brought additional revenue, the FBI's estimate that the film produced an income of approximately $100 million may {{be closer to the}} truth. Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times also argues for a lower figure in a February 2005 article, pointing out that Deep Throat was banned outright in large parts of the US (as well as many other countries), and only tended to find screenings in a small network of adult theaters in larger urban centers. The directors of Inside Deep Throat responded to the article, suggesting that actual revenues from the film were possibly even higher than the $600 million figure. Hiltzik was unsatisfied with the directors' response, writing that their method was to [...] "construct a seemingly <b>solid</b> <b>box</b> office figure out of layers and layers of speculation piled upon a foundation of sand".|$|R
