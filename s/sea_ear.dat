50|$|Paua {{belong to}} the {{molluscan}} genus Haliotis, more commonly known as abalones. The name Haliotis derives from Greek and means <b>sea</b> <b>ear,</b> reflecting the ear-like shape of the abalone shell. Three species of abalone occur naturally in New Zealand: blackfoot paua (Haliotis iris), yellowfoot paua (Haliotis australis), and whitefoot paua (Haliotis virginea).|$|E
40|$|Abalone, {{popularly known}} as <b>sea</b> <b>ear</b> or ear shell, is an {{economically}} important marine gastropod mollusc belonging to the genus Haliotis. They are usually found attached to the rocks or dead corals in sheltered. bays or intertidal rocky shores with good water movement and surf action (Fig. 1). Abalones are herbivores feeding on sea weeds. Some of the abalone species with good growth rate are cultured for meat which has high market value. Abalone sea farming targeted for its meat has spanned nearly half a decade. Research and development projects and hatcheries are in operation in Australia, the British Isles, Canada, France and United States...|$|E

As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|R

40|$|Without sowing any seeds {{or using}} fertilizers, {{we have been}} {{harvesting}} millions of tones of food from the <b>sea</b> every <b>ear.</b> In return we have been giving to the sea millions of tones of pollutants, toxins, sewage and garbage even radioactive wastes-in fact practically everything which {{we want to get}} rid of from land. Thus the sea has been the biggest receptacle of many undesirable substances, but so far at least it has never responded in an unkind fashion. Can this go on forever or will the sea begin to show signs of scarcity or ill health...|$|R
5000|$|While the American {{black bear}} lives {{throughout}} the U.S., the brown bears and grizzly bears {{are more common}} in the northwest and in Alaska. Along the West Coast there are several species of whales, sea otters, California <b>sea</b> lions, <b>eared</b> seals and northern elephant seals. In the dry, inland desert areas of states such as California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico there are some of the world’s most venomous lizards, snakes and scorpions. The most notorious might be the Gila monster and Mohave rattlesnake, both found in deserts in the Southwest. The Sonoran Desert has eleven species of rattlesnakes - more {{than anywhere else in the}} world.|$|R

60|$|Friday, Jan. 8.—A quiet evening. We {{were all}} rather piano {{at the end}} of an episode which had been {{thoroughly}} delightful. When Mr. G. bade me good-night, he said with real feeling, “More sorry than I can say that this is our last evening together at Biarritz.” He is painfully grieved to lose the sound of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears.</b>|$|R

Graham rolled from side to side, drew a long breath, and tugged vainly at his bonds. The effort overtaxed his strength. He seemed to feel the darkness closing in upon him, the rushing of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears....</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{nevertheless}} fancied she {{was pleased}} at my eagerness, and, for Haldane had passed on, I felt suddenly oppressed by the recognition of what I owed her. Yet had it been possible I should not have lightened the debt. I {{looked down at her}} gravely, noticing how young and fresh and slender she seemed--bright as the blaze of sunshine in which she stood--and then I pointed towards the long ranks of sheaves and the <b>sea</b> of stately <b>ears.</b>|$|R

A woman read it, {{seated on}} a {{shelving}} slant of moorland with the blue sky overhead, and the soft murmur of the <b>sea</b> in her <b>ears,</b> and the sunlight streaming around her.

60|$|Yet {{he insisted}} upon it, {{over and over}} again, that he had met Dave before, or, if not the youth, then {{somebody}} who looked exactly like him, although older. Pressed to tell his story, {{he said he had}} met this man on Cavasa Island, in the South Seas. He also mentioned a crazy nurse and a lost child, but could give no details, going off immediately into a wild flight about the roaring of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears</b> and the dancing of the lighthouse beacon in his eyes.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} amongst those {{interested}} {{in the study of}} Tasmanian implements, existed the idea of certain bones having been used by the natives, probably as "scrapers. " Dr. F. Noetling (1) has examined certain specimens in the Tasmanian Museum, and in addition other bones ex. cavated by himself at Rocky Cape. As a result, in the paper mentioned, he comes to the. conclusion that those examples are simply portions of the fibulae of M. billardieri fractured by falls of that animal in the course of its flight when pursued. He reasons that all these specimens found in native feeding grounds are only traumatic fractures, and that therefore the use of bone implements was unknown to the native Tasmanian. In muCh time spent in reading works that contain references to Tasmanian aborigines, I have found no instances of an observer seeing such implements in actual use. Ling Roth (2) quotes La Billardiere (3) as noting the natives prepare small 'spatulate pieces of wood, by which they separated limpets or <b>sea</b> <b>ears</b> from the rocks, on which to feast. These they smoothed with a piece of shell. The bone implenients 1, 2, 3, and 4, hereunder described in detail, would have been too light for such use, except in the case of small and not too adhesive shell fish. I cannot but feel, however, that they would have been of considerable use in extracting the contents of such edible types as Turbo, etc. It seems reasonable to think, therefore, that such an instrument would be used, as a considerable proportion of the shells found on the mounds· are unbroken, and those not intact do not seem to have been crushed between stones. Such implements may also have been of use in getting out the contents of oysters, mutton fish, and more particularly the small conical type of shells. It is to be remembered that although many settlers in Van Diemen's Land have seen the aborigines hunting and camping {{for a day or two}} on their migrations, very few indeed, except La Billardiere, can have seen them in their natural state, collecting and eating their shell fish around their fires. The very presence of such observers would tend to cause all such feasting to cease...|$|R

You could not have chosen for him a more peaceful ending, a more peaceful resting-place.

60|$|When {{the great}} wave retired, and Martin, half-choked {{with water and}} half-dazed, {{struggled}} on to his feet, he {{saw that it was}} night, and a cloudy, black sky was above, and the black sea beneath him. He had not seen the light fade, and had perhaps fallen asleep and seen and talked with that old sea monster in a dream. But now he could not escape from his position down in the gap, just above the roaring waves. There he had to stay, sheltered in a cavity in the rock, and lying there, half sleeping and half waking, he had that great voice of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears</b> all night.|$|R
50|$|Sea lions, {{with three}} groups of pinnipeds, have {{multiple}} breeding methods and habits over their families but they remain relatively universal. Otariids, or <b>eared</b> <b>sea</b> lions, raise their young, mate, and rest in more earthly land or ice habitats. Their abundance and haul-out behavior have a direct effect on their on land breeding activity. Their seasonal abundance trend correlates with their breeding period between the austral summer of January to March. Their rookeries populate with newborn pups as well as male and female otariids that remain to defend their territories. At {{the end of the}} breeding period males disseminate for food and rest while females remain for nurturing. Other points in the year consist of a mix of ages and genders in the rookeries with haul-out patterns varying monthly.|$|R
60|$|The {{enclosure}} of {{the sanctuary}} was all paved with the lava; scattered blocks encumbered it in places; everywhere tall cocoa-palms jutted from the fissures and drew shadows on the floor; a loud continuous sound of the near <b>sea</b> burthened the <b>ear.</b> These rude monumental ruins, {{and the thought of}} that life and faith of which they stood memorial, threw me in a muse. There are times and places where the past becomes more vivid than the present, and the memory dominates the ear and eye. I have found it so {{in the presence of the}} vestiges of Rome; I found it so again in the City of Refuge at Honaunau; and the strange, busy, and perilous existence of the old Hawaiian, the grinning idols of the Heiau, the priestly murderers and the fleeing victim, rose before and mastered my imagination.|$|R
60|$|The church-bell was ringing. It {{was a small}} bell, and its sweet {{sound came}} {{floating}} softly over the <b>sea</b> to the <b>ears</b> of our voyagers like an old familiar hymn. The interest of this scene was further enhanced by the assembling {{of the people to}} church. Boats were seen pushing off from every island, issuing from every creek, rowing over the calm water, and all converging towards the little bay with the yellow strand. Each boat was crowded with men, women, and children; and as the men wore red caps, and the women white kerchiefs on their heads, their appearance was quite brilliant. In other respects, their clothes being all homespun and of one dark colour, their aspect was sombre enough. So numerous were the boats, and so suddenly did they make their appearance, that {{it seemed as if the}} land were being invaded by a foreign host.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stumbled}} {{on a few}} steps, a little black snake crept out of its bed of mud, {{and looked at him}} with yellow eyes protruding from its upraised head. He kicked it savagely away--a crumpled, shapeless mass. It was a piece of brutality typical of the man. Ahead he fancied that the air was clearer--the fetid mists less choking--in the deep night-silence a few hours back he had fancied that he had heard the faint thunder of the sea. If this were indeed so, it would be but a short distance now {{to the end of his}} journey. With dull, glazed eyes and clenched hands, he reeled on. A sort of stupor had laid hold of him, but through it all his brain was working, and he kept steadily to a fixed course. Was it the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears,</b> he wondered, that long, monotonous rolling of sound, and there were lights before his eyes--the lights of Buckomari, or the lights of death! ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Gruse was {{the owner}} of the farm-house where I had arrived that day, just before supper-time. He was a short, strong-built old man, with a pair of pretty daughters, and little gold rings in his ears. Two things {{distinguished}} him from the farmers in the country round about: one was the rings in his ears, and the other was the large and comfortable house in which he kept his pretty daughters. The other farmers in that region had fine large barns for their cattle and horses, but very poor houses for their daughters. Old Peter's ear-rings were indirectly connected with his house. He had not always lived among those mountains. He had been on the <b>sea,</b> where his <b>ears</b> were decorated, and he had travelled a good deal on land, where he had ornamented his mind with many ideas which were not in general use in the part of his State in which he was born. His house stood a little back from the high road, and if a traveller wished to be entertained, Peter was generally willing to take him in, provided he had left his wife and family at home. The old man himself had no objection to wives and children, but his two pretty daughters had.|$|R
6000|$|I {{watched her}} profile against {{the pillow and}} there came on her face an {{expression}} I knew well when with an indignation full of suppressed laughter she used to throw at me the word “Imbecile.” I expected it to come, but it didn’t come. I must say, though, that I was swimmy {{in my head and}} now and then had a noise as of the <b>sea</b> in my <b>ears,</b> so I might not have heard it. The woman of granite, built to last for ever, continued to look at the glowing logs which made a sort of fiery ruin on the white pile of ashes. “I will tell you how it is,” I said. “When I have you before my eyes there is such a projection of my whole being towards you that I fail to see you distinctly. It was like that from the beginning. I may say that I never saw you distinctly till after we had parted and I thought you had gone from my sight for ever. It was then that you took body in my imagination and that my mind seized on a definite form of you for all its adorations—for its profanations, too. Don’t imagine me grovelling in spiritual abasement before a mere image. I got a grip on you that nothing can shake now.” ...|$|R
60|$|That was {{a strange}} walk for Bernard Maddison. Two sensations were {{struggling}} within him for the mastery, fear and despair at the terrible crisis which seemed to yawn before his feet, and that sweet revolution of feeling, that intense, yearning love, which had suddenly thrown a golden halo over his cold barren life. But {{as he left the}} road and took the moorland path along the cliff, the battle suddenly came to an end. Before him stretched the open moor, brilliant with coloring, with dark flushes of purple, and bright streaks of yellow gorse, and the sunlight glancing upon the hills. There was the pleasant murmuring of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears,</b> a glistening, dancing, silver sea, the blue sky above, and the fresh strong breeze full of vigorous, bracing life. Something of a glad recklessness stole over him and lightened his heart. This was no scene, no hour for sad thoughts. Where was the philosophy of nursing such, of giving them a home even for a moment? Joy and sorrow, what were they but abstract states of the mind? Let him wait until the ashes were between his teeth. The future and the past no man could command, but the present was his own. He would claim it. He would drink deep of the joy which lay before him.|$|R
5000|$|I An old man sits In {{the shadow}} of a pine tree In China. He sees larkspur, Blue and white, At the edge of the shadow, Move in the wind. His beard moves in the wind. The pine tree moves in the wind. Thus water flows Over weeds. II The night is of the colour Of a woman's arm: Night, the female, Obscure, Fragrant and supple, Conceals herself. A pool shines, Like a {{bracelet}} Shaken in a dance. III I measure myself Against a tall tree. I find that I am much taller, For I reach right up to the sun, With my eye; And I reach to the shore of the <b>sea</b> With my <b>ear.</b> Nevertheless, I dislike The way ants crawl In and out of my shadow. IV When my dream was near the moon, The white folds of its gown Filled with yellow light. The soles of its feet Grew red. Its hair filled With certain blue crystallizations From stars, Not far off. V Not all the knives of the lamp-posts, Nor the chisels of the long streets, Nor the mallets of the domes And high towers, Can carve What one star can carve, Shining through the grape-leaves. VI Rationalists, wearing square hats, Think, in square rooms, Looking at the floor, Looking at the ceiling. They confine themselves To right-angled triangles. If they tried rhomboids, Cones, waving lines, ellipses -- As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon -- Rationalists would wear sombreros. [...] Each of these six landscapes of the imagination is a poem in its own right, each conveying an image, simply sculpted and precise, contributing to a pastiche effect. The first displays the influence of haiku and orientalism on Stevens, the second evokes the romantic mystery of night, the third is a wry comment about the duality of the human condition, the dream in the fourth bears comparison to Klee and Chagall, the fifth acknowledges the subtlety of nature, and the sixth associates this subtlety with a reality that evades a rationalist point of view. The sixth can also be understood as Stevens's gentle contribution to the ancient quarrel between philosophical reason and poetic imagination, recommending that philosophers trade in their square hats for sombreros. Buttel appreciates in the fourth landscape a hallucinatory effect such that [...] "space shrinks, the imagination expands, and the illogical perspective surprises the reader into a recognition of heavenly grandeur". Apropos of the first landscape, he cites Earl Miner in support of the idea that [...] "the objectivity, indirectness, and condensation of the haiku technique seem to have had a more beneficial and lasting effect on his style than the merely ornamental details of orientalism". Buttel reads the fifth landscape as a reaction against [...] "Romantic softness" [...] in favor of [...] "hard clarity", in the spirit of Imagism. The poem's central symbol is not something beyond the poem or something merely intimated by it, but is rather in the star, in the manner that Ezra Pound and the Symbolists recommended.|$|R
60|$|Twenty-four hours later, Deane walked upon a {{wilderness}} of marshy sands, glittering {{here and there}} with the stain of the sea, blue in places with the delicate flush of sea lavender. In the background, a village of red-tiled roofs. Before him, an empty sea. Behind and around, nothing but this stretch of bare, flat country, empty even of the sea until the tide should come and thrust its long arms of glittering silver up {{into the heart of}} the land. A few wandering gulls screamed overhead. From inland, a great silence. Here, too, the sea, flowing in upon the level sands, was quiet and noiseless. Deane felt every nerve of his body at rest. He realized to the full the marvelous joy of solitude. All the strain of those last few days seemed to have fallen away. He looked back upon that passionate chapter of his life as a stranger might look back upon recorded happenings. The tragedy of Basil Rowan, condemned to death amid the awful silence of that spell-bound court, sitting now in his cell with his head turned toward the door, passing through long hours of torture waiting for the reprieve which might never come, appealed to him now only as it might appeal to a million others who read the newspapers. He was almost able to forget that it was he in a measure who was responsible for that episode. He was able, even, to forget the tragical side of Winifred Rowan's visits,--to remember only her gentle, appealing ways, her passionate pleading, her gratitude, tempered still with anxiety, which had triumphed at their last interview over the repugnance which she had at first plainly shown towards him. All these doings and happenings were of another world. Here, trouble and anxiety were like the noxious playthings of a race of children. The sea that rippled in so softly on to the firm sands remained untroubled. The seagulls wheeling above his head in lazy content filled the air with their soothing cries. Everywhere the sunshine lay about the sea-stained places. The green marshes sparkled like emeralds. The wet seaweed, lying about in little heaps, seemed struggling to express new subtleties of color. Down one of the reaches came a brown-sailed fishing-boat, steered by a man who lay at full length upon the deck, his head upon a coil of rope, one hand only grasping the tiller. A few cows were standing about in the drier part of the marshes, swinging their tails, and moving slowly from one to another of the little plots of herbage. The very smoke from those red-tiled cottages went straight to Heaven, unruffled by even the faintest of breezes. To Deane it seemed that he had found an idyll of still life, and with a strong instinct of relief, he felt the desire for sleep, so long denied him, creeping over his hot eyes. The drowsiness of the place numbed his senses. The pain ceased. He was content to forget. He threw himself upon the sands, with his back to a sandy knoll covered with weedy green grass, and with the murmur of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears,</b> he slept.|$|R
60|$|It {{was three}} o'clock in the morning when Deane softly opened the door of his bedroom in the Hotel Universal, and looked up and down the side corridor. There was no one in sight, no sound of any one passing in the main corridor, a few yards away. For several moments he stood and listened intently. Then he moved a few yards to the left, and stopped {{opposite}} another door. He scrutinized the number,--27. It was the number he sought. He felt in his pocket for the keys which he had collected from various sources. One by one he tried them in the lock. In vain! Not one fitted. He tried the handle of the door softly. There was no doubt about it. The door was securely fastened. He recognized at once the failure of his first attempt, and returned to his room. His bed was as yet undisturbed. He had not even changed the tweed travelling suit in which he had journeyed up from Rakney. It was a fool's errand, after all, he thought, on which he had come. Yet somehow or other, after his conversation with Ruby Sinclair, after he had realized how thorough her search would indeed be, how convinced she was that somewhere amongst the effects of the dead man lay the secret of wealth, he had realized more completely than ever before the danger in which he stood. Granted, even, that no suspicion of complicity with Rowan attached to him, his financial ruin would be none the less complete if that paper should ever come into the hands of people who understood its worth. Never had the situation seemed so clear, so dangerous, as that night after he had walked home with the girl and turned his face again toward the sea. Something in the very desolation of the marshes seemed to help thought, perhaps by the absence of any distracting object. There was a sense of breadth about the place. As he walked, with only the murmur of the <b>sea</b> in his <b>ears,</b> he saw things clearly. He saw himself in the prime of life, suddenly flung from the place to which he had climbed, flung down to join all those poor millions of strugglers whose first foot has yet to be planted upon the first rung of the great ladder. He was too old to begin at the beginning. There was no place for him down amongst those on whom failure had already placed her mark. He could not have borne it. To be stripped of his riches, his name, the position of which he was without a doubt proud, to suffer the breaking of his engagement, the downfall of all his ambitions,--the very thought of it was intolerable. And in the deep silence of that night, as he listened to the gurgling of the sea below, and the faint movement of the wind across the level land, he realized, with a sudden pain at his heart, the danger in which he stood. In three days the girl would be there. Scotland Yard would send one of its myrmidons with her. She would have free access to all the dead man's belongings. She would take with her a lawyer. Every scrap of paper the man had possessed, every trifling object, would have its value. The Little Anna Gold-Mine was world famous. There would be no chance of their overlooking a single document bearing such a name.|$|R
