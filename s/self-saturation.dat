40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating an edge emitting laser is demonstrated that incorporates a distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) {{as one of}} the mirrors, with the other being a variable air gap external planar mirror that is used as a method for fine tuning the lasing wavelength. This type of calculation requires non uniformity of the dielectric’s static and dynamic (pumping) properties in both the transverse and longitudinal directions, together with self consistent coupling to the external tuning cavity. A key challenge addressed is the proper treatment of the open nature of the cavity, such that the amplitudes of the outgoing waves leaving the facets are consistent with the cavity interior and facet reflectivity.

The <b>self-saturation</b> growth of the material and the temperature window for ALD growth is confirmed by in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and residual gas analyzer (RGA) studies help to predict the two half reactions and FTIR further validates the self-limiting feature of ALD growth.

The films showed quite a smooth surface morphology over the whole range of growth temperatures. The increase in the film thickness did not significantly change the surface morphology of the films due to the formation of the crystalline phase even at an initial growth stage.

40|$|Fast {{magnetization}} preparation techniques {{acquire a}} series of echoes after a single magnetization preparation. If these echoes are acquired from different slices using a multislice technique {{the change in the}} preparation state of the echoes due to relaxation effects leads to different contrast modification for each slice. Encoding different preparation states along the phase-encoding direction of each slice instead of acquiring each slice in a different preparation state is introduced as a general concept to obtain images of identical contrast and point-spread function. This can be realized either by cycling the slice excitation order several times over the total number of repetitions or by moving the point of time at which the preparation is applied within each repetition. One possible application of this method is chemical shift selective fat saturation imaging. A homogeneous fat suppression across a multislice volume could be achieved using a FLASH sequence at a repetition time of TR = 145 ms, including a single fat saturation preparation. Conventional fat saturated spin-echo imaging at any TR can be accelerated significantly by reducing the number of applied preparations per repetition. A further application of the homogeneous preparation encoding (HoPE) method is described that encodes the spatial <b>self-saturation</b> of the multislice excitation order homogeneously in all slices. Only a reduced number of slices of the total volume are excited in each repetition and the slice excitation order is continuously moved along the imaging volume. This method is applied for time of flight (TOF) imaging. Using a TONE-like series of flip angles for the slice excitations of each repetition homogeneous TOF images can be obtained {{on the basis of a}} multislice acquisition...|$|E

The model, which consists of solving sequentially one ordinary differential equation per amplifier, is used to 1) determine power and SNR excursions in the surviving channels along a chain of 35 EDFA’s during isolated add–drop events in a 16 -channel WDM circuit switching scenario and 2) run Monte Carlo simulations of the first five EDFA’s of the same chain fed by burst-mode packet switching traffic on each of the 16 channels. Each packet source is modeled as an ON–OFF asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) source, with ON and OFF times having a heavy-tailed Pareto distribution. The aggregate source model is asymptotically self-similar, and well describes multimedia packet communications. The results are used to examine the influence of average network utilization and source ON–OFF time variance on the probability density function of signal power and SNR at each EDFA output. We demonstrate that self-similar traffic generates sizable power and SNR swings, especially at low network utilization. The simulations also indicate sizable broadening of the power and SNR density functions along the cascade of EDFA’s, reaching levels in excess of 9 dBm and 4 dB for the power and SNR swings, respectively, at the 5 th EDFA. The effect becomes more pronounced for longer EDFA chains. Such a large broadening may imply serious system impairments in burst-mode WDM packet networks.

40|$|In {{this talk}} we discuss recent {{developments}} in high power fibre lasers and amplifiers. Particular {{attention is paid to}} pump launching schemes and methods to minimise nonlinear distortion in fibre amplifiers. Diode-pumped fibre lasers and amplifiers have firmly established themselves as a reliable source of multiWatt radiation in near IR region. Average power in excess of 100 W [1] and pulse energies above 2 mJ [2] are now available in fibre based laser sources. High brightness high power pump is a key component in high power fibre-based devices. Currently available diode sources are powerful enough to pump a 100 W fibre laser even in traditional end-pumping scheme [1]. Further power scaling in this configuration becomes problematic due to significant difficulties in spatial separation of pump and signal beams. There are several elegant solutions to this problem which include multimode pump couplers [3], the v-groove technique [4] and side pumping [5]. In this talk we will discuss advantages of a new technique based on single clad coiled fibres [6]. In this structure the pump waveguide of the active fibre is directly accessible from the side so that pump light travelling in separate pump fibers can directly couple over into the doped fibre. This technique is very flexible and offers multipoint pump injection. Also it equally applicable to medium (1 - 3 W) and high (> 10 W) power fibre based devices. For high-energy devices (both amplifiers and Q-switched lasers) the challenge lies in founding core designs that can store a large amount of energy before <b>self-saturation</b> and spurious lasing between pulses limits further storage. The solution is to use a large core. This also increases threshold of unwanted nonlinear effects such as SBS and SRS. The downside is that beam quality degrades, as the core becomes multi-moded. We will discuss several solutions to this problem including application of complex refractive index profile [2] and tapered fibre filters [7]...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} syphilitic antibodies can {{be removed}} from a serum by means of absorption with barium sulphate. The removal is due either to an adsorption or a mechanical absorption. The activity of the syphilitic antibodies is thereby unimpaired. The readiness with which the absorption is accomplished with barium sulphate varies considerably with different syphilitic sera. That barium sulphate exerts the same absorbing effect upon non-syphilitic serum components is made evident by the interfering property which the latter manifest in the absorption experiment of the syphilitic antibodies. The selective removal of the serum components, other than the syphilitic antibodies, by means of barium sulphate absorption is, therefore, impossible. On the other hand, a partial removal of these components, with but little removal of the syphilitic antibodies, may be effected when the content of a given serum is poor in syphilitic antibodies and comparatively rich in the indifferent serum components. But this is impossible if the conditions are reversed. The main reasons why some negative syphilitic sera may be so modified by the barium sulphate treatment as to give positive reactions, are explained below, but these apply only to those methods in which inactivated serum is employed. The inactivation reduces the antibody content to about one-fourth to one-fifth of the original. When the serum is very rich in antibodies, this {{does not affect the}} result of the fixation test. But when the amount of the antibodies is small, the process of inactivation creates conditions quite unexpected. It may produce such a condition that a given amount of the serum contains, after inactivation, only one or two antibody units, while the other serum components remain undiminished. Here one must not lose sight of the vital fact that these apparently indifferent serum constituents are not at all indifferent in the fixation processes. They may possess affinities which {{are similar to those of}} complement for the fixing combination of syphilitic serum and antigen. Speaking quantitatively, one unit of the syphilitic antibodies plus antigen will fix 0. 1 cubic centimeter of guinea pig complement, but this unit can also be saturated and blocked by nearly the same amount of the seemingly indifferent serum component of the serum to be tested. Moreover, the regular amount of inactivated serum used in the Wassermann system is 0. 2 cubic centimeter, a quantity sufficient to saturate two units of the fixing combination. Fortunately, this <b>self-saturation</b> of the syphilitic antibody-antigen combination by the other serum components is not constant in occurrence, owing to the wide variations of the fixability of the serum components of man. Here the benefit of Wechselmann's procedure becomes obvious. By removing a surplus of the fixable indifferent serum components by means of barium sulphate, the serum is made to react positively, or more strongly than before the treatment with barium sulphate. This masking of the positive reaction through the <b>self-saturation</b> is liable to occur in any system in which inactivated serum is recommended. Another equally important factor in masking the positive reaction in a serum in which the antibodies are poor, is the presence in considerable amount of natural antisheep amboceptor in human serum. It is a plain and simple fact that an excess of hemolytic amboceptor renders a positive reaction feeble or completely negative. As we have shown in our present investigation, a hemolytic amboceptor {{can be removed}} from the serum by means of absorption with barium sulphate. Thus it is easy to understand why Wechselmann found that barium sulphate absorption improves the reaction in the original Wassermann system. The treatment of syphilitic serum with this salt can have a twofold benefit in the case of the original method of Wassermann; namely, the removal of certain interfering serum components and the removal or diminishing of the natural antisheep amboceptor present in the syphilitic serum. In the method of Noguchi, there is no necessity for applying the barium sulphate absorption. Noguchi recommends the use of unheated serum, hence the absolute amount of the serum employed is only one-half of the absolute amount of complement. Eventually an old serum may be anticomplementary and need inactivation, but if the result is doubtful in this instance, a fresh serum from the same patient may be secured and subjected to reëxamination. In this method there is no danger of introducing an amount of hemolytic amboceptor which is both unknown and uncontrollable, for the reason that human serum is usually devoid of isolysin (antihuman hemolytic amboceptor), and, if the latter is present, it never reaches the strength which shows any effect upon the hemolytic system employed. We conclude, therefore, that the barium sulphate absorption is to be recommended for the original method of Wassermann under certain conditions, but that it is unnecessary for the antihuman hemolytic system of Noguchi...|$|E
