50|$|A European {{outbreak}} {{of a novel}} Orthobunyavirus began in 2011. The virus was initially isolated near Schmallenberg in Germany, and has been informally named <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>virus</b> (SBV). <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>virus</b> falls in the Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses, in which the Aino and Akabane viruses are also grouped; as of January 2013, it {{is considered to be}} most closely related to the Sathuperi and Douglas viruses.|$|E

It appears to be transmitted by midges (Culicoides spp.) which are likely to have been most active in causing the infection in the northern hemisphere summer and autumn of 2011, with animals subsequently giving birth from late 2011. <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>virus</b> falls in the Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses; as of January 2013, it is considered to be most closely related to the Sathuperi and Douglas viruses.|$|E

40|$|Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are hematophagous insects {{with over}} 1400 species {{distributed}} throughout the world. Many of these species are of particular agricultural importance as primary vectors of bluetongue and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses,</b> yet {{little is known about}} Culicoides genomics and proteomics. Detailed studies of members from other blood-feeding Dipteran families, including those of mosquito (Culicidae) and black fly (Simuliidae), have shown that protein components within the insect’s saliva facilitate the blood feeding process. To determine the protein components in Culicoides sonorensis midges, secreted saliva was collected for peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. Forty-five secreted proteins were identified, including members of the D 7 odorant binding protein family, Kunitz-like serine protease inhibitors, maltase, trypsin, and six novel proteins unique to C. sonorensis. Identifying the complex myriad of proteins in saliva from blood-feeding Dipteran species is critical for understanding their role in blood feeding, arbovirus transmission, and possibly the resulting disease pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, rapid {{spread of}} Culicoides-borne {{pathogens}} such as bluetongue (BT) and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have been reported}} in Europe. In this study we examined the Culicoides populations in farms with wild and domestic ruminants in Eastern Slovakia with the aim to confirm the presence of biting midges serving as potential vectors of important pathogens. The main vector complexes were the Obsoletus complex (54 %; n= 4, 209) and the Pulicaris complex (23 %; n= 1, 796). To estimate the relative abundance of the cryptic species of the Obsoletus complex (Culicoides obsoletus, Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides montanus), we performed the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on ITS- 2 and ITS- 1 segments, on 125 midges randomly sampled. The relative abundance of C. obsoletus ranged from 5. 26 % in the farm with wild ruminants to 85. 71 % in another farm with cattle and sheep. A total of 112 pools of parous and gravid females belonging to the Obsoletus and Pulicaris complexes were tested for virus detection by the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BT virus, {{as well as for the}} Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (EHDV), with negative results...|$|R

A typical cycle of transmission of a virus by Culicoides is illustrated in the article Parasitic flies of domestic animals.|$|E
40|$|Most {{haematophagous}} insect vectors {{can also}} use sugar as an energy source; thus their sugar-feeding behaviour influences their longevity and blood-feeding rate and hence their vectorial capacity. Scant information {{is available on the}} sugar-feeding behaviour of Culicoides Latreille biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), which are vectors of bluetongue and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses.</b> The longevity of laboratory-reared Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen) under fluctuating temperatures (16 and 28 [*]°C) and with access to water or water and blood was on average 6. 4 [*]days and 8. 9 [*]days, respectively, which was around one third of the lifespan of siblings with access to sugar or sugar and blood (22. 2 [*]days and 27. 1 [*]days, respectively). Access to honeydew significantly increased the midge's longevity, whereas the provision of extrafloral nectaries had no impact. Females with access to sugar produced a significantly higher number of eggs (65. 5 [*]±[*] 5. 2) than their starved sisters (45. 4 [*]±[*] 8. 4). More than 80 % of field-caught female Culicoides from the two most abundant European groups, Obsoletus (n[*]=[*] 2243) and Pulicaris (n[*]=[*] 805), were fructose-positive. Fructose-positivity was high in all physiological stages and no seasonal variability was noted. The high rate of natural sugar feeding of Culicoides offers opportunities for the development of novel control strategies using toxic sugar baits and for the monitoring of vector-borne diseases using sugar-treated FTA (nucleic acid preservation) cards in the field...|$|R
40|$|Two vector borne diseases, {{caused by}} the Bluetongue and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses</b> respectively, have emerged in the European {{ruminant}} populations since 2006. Several diseases are transmitted by the same vectors and could emerge in the future. Syndromic surveillance, which consists in the routine monitoring of indicators {{for the detection of}} adverse health events, may allow an early detection. Milk yield is routinely measured in a large proportion of dairy herds and could be incorporated as an indicator in a surveillance system. However, few studies have evaluated continuous indicators for syndromic surveillance. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a framework for the quantification of both disease characteristics and model predictive abilities that are important for a continuous indicator to be sensitive, timely and specific for the detection of a vector-borne disease emergence. Emergences with a range of spread characteristics and effects on milk production were simulated. Milk yields collected monthly in 48 713 French dairy herds were used to simulate 576 disease emergence scenarios. First, the effect of disease characteristics on the sensitivity and timeliness of detection were assessed: Spatio-temporal clusters of low milk production were detected with a scan statistic using the difference between observed and simulated milk yields as input. In a second step, the system specificity was evaluated by running the scan statistic on the difference between observed and predicted milk yields, in the absence of simulated emergence. Th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Understanding {{seasonal}} {{patterns of}} abundance of insect vectors {{is important for}} optimisation of control strategies of vector-borne diseases. Environmental drivers such as temperature, humidity and photoperiod influence vector abundance, {{but it is not}} generally known how these drivers combine to affect seasonal population dynamics. Methods: In this paper, we derive and analyse a novel mechanistic stage-structured simulation model for Culicoides biting midges-the principle vectors of bluetongue and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses</b> which cause mortality and morbidity in livestock and impact trade. We model variable life-history traits as functional forms that are dependent on environmental drivers, including air temperature, soil temperature and photoperiod. The model is fitted to Obsoletus group adult suction-trap data sampled daily at five locations throughout the UK for 2008. Results: The model predicts population dynamics that closely resemble UK field observations, including the characteristic biannual peaks of adult abundance. Using the model, we then investigate the effects of insecticide control, showing that control strategies focussing on the autumn peak of adult midge abundance have the highest impact in terms of population reduction in the autumn and averaged over the year. Conversely, control during the spring peak of adult abundance leads to adverse increases in adult abundance in the autumn peak. Conclusions: The mechanisms of the biannual peaks of adult abundance, which are important features of midge seasonality in northern Europe and are key determinants of the risk of establishment and spread of midge-borne diseases, have been hypothesised over for many years. Our model suggests that the peaks correspond to two generations per year (bivoltine) are largely determined by pre-adult development. Furthermore, control strategies should focus on reducing the autumn peak since the immature stages are released from density-dependence regulation. We conclude that more extensive modelling of Culicoides biting midge populations in different geographical contexts will help to optimise control strategies and predictions of disease outbreaks...|$|R
50|$|Immunity can {{possibly}} be acquired naturally against SBV. It {{is possible that the}} seasonality of the infection cycle would not entail a second epidemic circulation next year, due to the shortness of the viraemic period (about 4 to 6 days post exposure, longer in affected foetuses). Vaccination is a possible option for controlling the disease as a vaccine exists for the similar Akabane virus. In March 2012, scientists of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut first succeeded in producing an electron microscope image of the <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The genetic {{structure}} of <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>virus</b> is typical for Bunyaviridae viruses, {{which are a}} family of enveloped negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three parts - Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn) and a nonstructural protein (NSm), while the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N) and, in an alternative overlapping reading frame, a second nonstructural protein (NSs). The genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein {{in the form of}} ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The N protein is the most abundant protein in virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{structure}} of the nucleocapsid, the N protein will eventually oligomerize to encapsidate the single-stranded RNA. In some NSVs the N subunits are oriented in a parallel orientation, and the ssRNA is sequestered in the center. In most NSVs, the nucleocapsid appears to be a random coil, and the symmetry is linear. Because the N subunits are oriented in a parallel fashion, the cross-molecular interactions among the subunits stabilize the nucleocapsid and are critical for capsid formation. The linear interactions along the encapsidated single-stranded RNA are actually a unique feature to NSVs. X-ray crystal structures of N proteins and EM micrographs of RNP complexes from a number of Bunyaviridae (a Family of segmented NSVs that includes the Bunyamwera virus and the <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>virus)</b> show that in these viruses the nucleocapsid adopts a helical arrangement where the N proteins form a head-to-tail chain by linking to each other via a flexible N-terminal arm. The resulting chain forms tight coils with four N proteins per turn that holds the circular ssRNA of these viruses on the inside of the coils and which extend to form large circular filaments.|$|E
40|$|Culicoides biting midges are {{important}} vectors of Bluetongue and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses</b> in Europe. The introduction of these viruses highlighted {{the need to}} develop novel surveillance and control tools to monitor and manage biting midges. Biting midges, as most insects, primarily use olfactory cues to recognize and discriminate resources for their survival and reproduction. Blood feeding insects rely on host-derived volatiles to locate their vertebrate hosts, and these odours can be exploited to manipulate insect-host interaction. The primary goal of this thesis was to identify host volatiles that modulate the host-seeking behaviour of biting midges. Through coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analysis of odour collections from cattle hair and urine, I identified several compounds that, in combination with carbon dioxide, elicited behavioural attraction or inhibition in Culicoides nubeculosus, in a dose dependent manner. Some of these host odours were evaluated in the field showing similar behavioural responses of C. impunctatus. Both laboratory and field assays emphasized the importance of release rate to obtain optimal behavioural responses. The impact of using host volatiles to monitor host-seeking biting midges was shown in another study. Here, I showed that incandescent light traps baited with two cattle kairomones, 1 -octen- 3 -ol and carbon dioxide, caught significantly more insects than UV light traps. UV light traps are to date the most commonly used method for monitoring biting midges. That said, differences were observed between trap types, both concerning species composition and the physiological state of the female biting midges caught. Incorporating the novel bioactive compounds, formulated in blends and released in proper ratio and rate, could further increase the efficacy of this trapping method. By incorporating these attractants together with repellent compounds identified in this project, a "push-pull"- system for biting midges could also be envisioned. The host volatiles identified are detected by the peripheral olfactory system of biting midges. A comparative analysis across biting species with different host preferences revealed a correlation between host preference and the number and types of antennal and maxillary palp sensilla. Functional characterisation of these sensillum types will be the next step to increase our understanding of how host odours are detected by biting midges With this thesis I have increased our understanding of the chemical ecology of host-seeking female biting midges and their peripheral olfactory system. Future research projects will need to develop viable commercial products that could be incorporated into management strategies for Culicoides biting midges. ...|$|R
40|$|Akabane (AKAV) and <b>Schmallenberg</b> (SBV) <b>viruses</b> are Orthobunyavirus {{transmitted}} by arthropod vectors {{with a broad}} cellular tropism in vitro {{as well as in}} vivo Both AKAV and SBV cause arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome in ruminants. The main cellular receptor and attachment factor for entry of these orthobunyaviruses are unknown. Here, we found that AKAV and SBV infections were inhibited by the addition of heparin or enzymatic removal of cell surface heparan sulfates. To confirm this finding, we prepared heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) -knockout (KO) cells by using a CRISPR/Cas 9 system and measured the binding quantities of these viruses to cell surfaces. We observed a substantial reduction in AKAV and SBV binding to cells, limiting the infections by these viruses. These data demonstrate that HSPGs are important cellular attachment factors for AKAV and SBV, at least in vitro, to promote virus replication in susceptive cells. Importance: AKAV and SBV are the etiological agents of arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome in ruminants, which causes considerable economic losses in the livestock industry. Here, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycan as a major cellular attachment factor for the entry of AKAV and SBV. Moreover, we found that heparin is a strong inhibitor of AKAV and SBV infections. Revealing the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interactions is critical in order to understand virus biology and develop novel live attenuated vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{three-dimensional}} protein structure {{is essential to}} understanding the myriad of functions of these important biomolecules and the complexes they form. Viruses are entities that exploit their protein machinery {{with a high degree}} of efficacy and economy and the structural characterisation of virus proteins is vital to discovering new ways to combat disease. No single biophysical technique can provide a complete picture of protein architecture, so a range of complementary approaches is required. This thesis presents the use of noncovalent mass spectrometry (MS) techniques for the study of a diverse range of viral structural proteins, including human, animal, and bacterial viruses. Noncovalent MS and travelling-wave ion mobility spectrometry-MS (TWIMS-MS) were used successfully to analyse the dynamic behaviour of the assembly domain (CP 149) of the capsid protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and, along with limited proteolysis, locate these dynamics to the C-terminus of a half-dimer. The C-terminus is crucial for virus particle assembly and such direct conformational analysis is • difficult with more established techniques. Following this, investigations were made into the effects of an anti-HBV small molecule, HAP-l, on the behaviour of CP 149. The molecule had no observable effect on CP 149 conformation but interestingly, induced the formation of oligomers which were found by TWIMS-MS to have a globular structure, i. e. not 'sheet-like' as may be expected for assembly intermediates. The small molecule also promoted the formation of large flat particles observed by electron microscopy (EM). The formation of these two rather different classes of particle possibly reflects two facets of the activity of the HAP class of compounds in cells. The technique of collision-induced unfolding (ClU) was studied to investigate whether this can be used to characterise and differentiate between CP 149 mutants. Although valuable insights into the unfolding pathway were revealed, together with a number of distinct conformational families, it was found that ClU could not distinguish between the mutations. This is thought to be a result of the substitution of only hydrophobic residues, which may not influence gas-phase structure due to the absence of the hydrophobic effect. MS, TWIMS-MS, EM and coarse-grained structural modelling were utilised to study the oligomerisation processes of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of Bunyamwera and <b>Schmallenberg</b> <b>viruses</b> from the Bunyaviridae family, a topical and increasingly important class of viruses, for which there is currently no high resolution structural information. The N proteins were shown to oligomerise on binding to RNA to form a range of well-defined but different oligomers. The MS and EM data suggest the shapes of the oligomers to be based on ring structures rather than possible tetramer-based arrangements. These data represent the first insights into the assembly pathways of these important viruses, and the first such MS assembly study of a non-spherical virus class. Noncovalent MS and TWIMS-MS were used to study the baseplate complexes of bacteriophages known to infect the bacterium lactococcus lactis, which is important to the dairy industry. The phages p 2 and TP 901 - 1 have multiprotein organelles termed baseplates that mediate cell attachment and genome release and are critical for infection. The complexes, of 0. 8 and 1. 8 MDa, respectively, were characterised in terms of their mass, and stoichiometry as were several subcomplexes likely to be important in assembly. The studies, in conjunction with published EM and X-ray crystallography data, highlighted the importance of the distal tail protein as a central hub to control baseplate assembly and showed that valuable structural information can be gained in the absence of high resolution crystallography data. In summary, MS and TWIMS-MS were found to be valuable tools with which to study protein dynamics, structure and assembly, which makes them vital for the advancement of biophysical characterisation of viral systems.

5000|$|Published {{scientific}} literature generally lacks detailed {{comparison of the}} performance of isothermal amplification techniques such as RPA, HDA, and LAMP relative to each other, often rather comparing a single isothermal technique to a [...] "gold standard" [...] PCR assay.

Furthermore, performance characteristics of any amplification technique are difficult to decouple from primer design: a [...] "good" [...] primer set for one target for RPA may give faster amplification or more sensitive detection than a [...] "poor" [...] LAMP primer set for the same target, but the converse may be true for different primer sets for a different target.
