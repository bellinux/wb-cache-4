2500|$|The Battle of Copenhagen 1801 (...) was {{the first}} of two battles which saw the British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and Horatio Nelson, a vice admiral in 1801, fight a huge Danish fleet {{anchored}} just off Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The Danish fleet at the inlet of the Copenhagen harbour formed a blockade preventing the British fleet from entering the harbour. The Danish mainly used older ships not meant to sail in the sea as blockades. Denmark defended the capital with these ships and bastions on both side of the harbour inlet, Kastellet, Trekroner, Lynetten (which all still exists) as well as Quintus, Sixtus and <b>Strickers.</b> It was the second attempt by the British to scare Denmark, as the British had already entered Øresund with a navy in August 1800, in order to force Denmark to sign an alliance with Britain. Now Britain would have Denmark's entire navy and merchant fleet, so it would not {{fall into the hands of}} the French. The British were not aware that the modern Royal Danish Navy and many merchant ships were well hidden in the Roskilde fjord, a bluff which was never called by the British.|$|E
