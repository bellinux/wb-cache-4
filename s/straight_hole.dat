5000|$|Firstly, {{reference}} bushes {{are attached}} to the front and back surfaces of the component at the measurement location, to minimise [...] "bell-mouthing" [...] and assist with aligning the data sets during analysis. A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a gun-drill is typically used due to the smooth and <b>straight</b> <b>hole</b> profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an air probe. This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the air probe is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated transducer to convert the pressure change into a voltage. A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using electro-discharge machining (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior to the trepanning.|$|E

50|$|In 1992 {{the first}} {{steerable}} turbodrill using a bent housing {{was created by}} Neyrfor. The advantage to using the bent housing method of steering instead of an offset stabilizer, is that it provided a <b>straighter</b> <b>hole</b> with less of a corkscrew effect, which in turn made drilling more efficient, faster, and more accurate.|$|R
50|$|Turbodrills use the {{mechanical}} {{energy of the}} drill itself, and the hydraulic energy provided by the oil rig’s mud pumps to deliver power to the drill bit. The drill bit on a turbodrill spins much faster than on a conventional motor drill. The result is that, though there is less torque, this is compensated for by the increased speed, which makes <b>straighter</b> <b>holes,</b> and can drill faster and easier through tougher ground materials. The process {{is very similar to}} a dental drill used by a dentist. These tools are able to dig faster, operate in a much higher temperature environment, deliver longer downhole life, and produce a better and <b>straighter</b> <b>hole</b> quality than a conventional mud motor. In many applications turbodrills can offer their customers significant cost savings over standard drilling systems by saving them time spent drilling the hole since they typically pay drillers by the hour.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the influence of a hole curvature on the flow structure and characteristics downstream of JICF (jet in cross-Flow) by means of smoke visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experiment was performed in a low speed wind tunnel with Reynolds numbers of about 480 and 1000, based on the hole diameter and main flow speed. Two geometries were tested: a circular hole with 90 ° curvature and a circular <b>straight</b> <b>hole</b> for comparison, under blowing ratios 0. 5 and 1. 0. The measurements were done in the symmetric plane and four cross-sections. The results show that the curved hole could decrease the mixing behavior of jet flow with the main flow as the hole leading edge also increases the chance of transportingthecoolant to the wall surface and the transverse coverage. The curved hole shows a high potential to increase the cooling effectiveness once it is applied to the turbine blades...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional {{finite element}} model of a bolted joint has been {{developed}} in the non-linear finite element code MSC. Marc and {{attempts were made to}} validate it by comparing results with those of experiments and other finite element. Issues in modeling the contact between the joint parts, which affect the accuracy and efficiency of the model, were presented. Experimental measurements of surface strains and load transfer ratio(LTR) were compared with results from finite element analysis. The results show that three-dimensional {{finite element model}} of bolted joint can produce results in close agreement with experiment. Three-dimensional effects such as bolt titling, seconding and through-thickness variations in stress and strain are well represented by such models. Three-dimensional finite element analysis was also used to study the effects of different parameters on the mechanical behaviour of single lap bolted joints. The results show that <b>straight</b> <b>hole,</b> small bolt diameter, and big hole pitch are selected first for bolted joint if other conditions allowed, and effect of bolt material on LTR of joint is small for small load. Interference and pre-stress should be strictly controlled for bolted joints in order to attain the best fatigue capability of lap joint...|$|E

Each microchannel consisted of a circular 10 -μm diameter <b>straight</b> <b>hole</b> with a length of 70 μm and a 50 × 10 μm rectangular microslot with a depth of 30 μm. At the constant oil flux of 10 L m− 2 h− 1, the percent of active channels increased with increasing the oil viscosity and ranged from 4 % for n-tetradecane to 48 % for soybean oil. The size distribution span for SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) - and Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate) -stabilized soybean and MCT oildroplets was 0. 21 – 022. The ability of asymmetricmicrochannels to generate monodisperse soybean oildroplets at the very low SDS concentration of 0. 01 wt. % has been demonstrated. At the SDS concentration below the CMC, the generated droplets tend to attach to the plate surface, whereas at the higher SDS concentration they detach from the plate as soon as they are formed.

40|$|The overall program {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} mud-pulse measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tool for oil and gas drilling operations that can be used where downhole temperatures are as high as 195 C (383 F). The work was planned to be completed in two phases: Phase I and an optional Phase II. The objectives of Phase I were first to identify critical components of existing MWD systems that can or cannot operate at 195 C. For components not able to meet the higher standard, one of several strategies was pursued: (1) locate high-temperature replacement components, (2) develop new designs that eliminate the unavailable components, or (3) use cooling to keep components at acceptable operating temperatures (under 195 C). New designs and components were then tested under high temperatures in the laboratory. The final goal of Phase I was to assemble two high-temperature MWD prototype tools and test each in at least one low-temperature well to verify total system performance. Phase II was also envisioned as part of this development. Its objective would be to test the two new high-temperature MWD prototype tools in wells being drilled in the United States where the bottom-hole temperatures were 195 C (or the highest temperatures attainable). The high-temperature MWD tool is designed to send directional and formation data to the surface via mud pulses, to aid in the drilling of guided wellbores. The modules that comprise the tool are housed in sealed barrels that protect the electronics from exposure to down-hole fluids and pressures. These pressure barrels are hung inside a non-magnetic collar located above the drilling assembly. A number of significant accomplishments were achieved {{during the course of the}} Phase I project, including: (1) Tested two MWD strings for function in an oven at 195 C; (2) Conducted field test of prototype 195 C MWD tool (at well temperatures up to 140 - 180 C); (3) Tested ELCON hybrid chip with processor, clock, and memory in a custom package for 700 hours at 200 C; (4) Contracted with APS Technology to conduct study of thermoelectric cooling of downhole electronics; (5) Conducted successful Peltier cooling test with APS Technology; (6) Tested and improved the electronics of Sperry Sun's Geiger Muller-based gamma detector for operation at 195 C; (7) Developed two high-temperature magnetometers (one in-house, one with Tensor); and (8) Encouraged outside source to develop lithium/magnesium high-temperature batteries (operating temperature of 125 to 215 C). One of this project's greatest achievements was improvement in Sperry Sun's current tool with changes made as a direct result of work performed under this project. These improvements have resulted in longer life and a more robust MWD tool at the previous temperature rating of 175 C, as well as at higher temperatures. A field test of two prototype 195 C MWD tools was conducted in Lavaca County, Texas. The purpose of this operation was to provide directional services on a sidetrack of a <b>straight</b> <b>hole.</b> The sidetrack was to intersect the formation up-dip above the water/gas interface. In addition, the gamma tool provided formation data including seam tops and thickness. Results from these field tests indicate progress in the development of a 195 C tool. Although the pulsers failed downhole in both tools, failure of the pulsers was determined to be from mechanical rather than electrical causes. Analysis of the economics of the 195 C tool highlights the greatest obstacle to future commercialization. Costs to screen individual components, then subassemblies, and finally completed tools for high-temperature operations are very high. Tests to date also show a relatively short life for high-temperature tools [...] on the order of 300 hours. These factors mean that the daily cost of the tool will be higher (3 to 5 times more) than a conventional tool...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{residual}} {{strengths of}} laminated composites containing notches or holes {{depend on the}} characteristic dimension of the notches {{as well as the}} laminate properties.

5000|$|Gun drills [...] are {{straight}} fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow {{body to the}} cutting face. They are used for deep drilling—a depth-to-diameter ratio of 300:1 or more is possible. Gun barrels are the obvious example; hence the name. Other uses include moldmaking, diemaking, and the manufacture of combustion engine parts such as crankcase, cylinder head, and woodwind musical instruments, such as uilleann pipes, as gun drills can drill long <b>straight</b> <b>holes</b> in metal, wood, and some plastics. The coolant provides lubrication and cooling to the cutting edges and removes the swarf or chips from the hole. Modern gun drills use carbide tips to prolong life and reduce total cost when compared with metal tips.
