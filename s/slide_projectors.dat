25|$|Cage's {{work from}} the sixties {{features}} some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting {{the mood of the}} era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. HPSCHD (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with fifty-two tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 slides of designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> with forty motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.|$|E

These presentations use up to 1,500images from the Imperial War Museum's photograph archive and were originally projected from 60synchronised <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> mounted throughout the space. In 2011 digital projectors were installed, allowing a greater degree of flexibility. The images are complemented by personal accounts from the museum's oral history sound archive. The Big Picture was devised after the reduction in the museum's budget forced the scrapping of the previous exhibition plan by designers DEGW and Amalgam.|$|E

2500|$|Sawyer's, Inc. was an American {{manufacturer}} and retailer of <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> scenic slides, View-Master reels and viewers, postcards, and related products, based in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 1914 as a photo-finishing company, Sawyer's began producing and selling View-Masters in 1939, and that soon became its primary product. [...] It later diversified into other photographic products, mostly related to film transparencies, and established manufacturing plants in Europe, Japan and India. [...] By the early 1960s, Sawyer's was the nation's second-largest manufacturer of <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> and by 1965 <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> had surpassed View-Master reels and equipment {{as a percentage}} of the company's annual sales. [...] In 1951, the company moved from Portland proper to the unincorporated Progress area in Portland's southwestern suburbs. [...] In 1966, Sawyer's was acquired by New York-based General Aniline & Film (GAF), and its product lines and facilities were taken over by GAF. [...] It was a subsidiary company of GAF until 1968, when it became simply a division of that company, renamed the GAF Consumer Photo Division.

2500|$|Under the {{directorship}} of Terence Murtagh in the 1970s, Armagh Planetarium introduced {{many new}} technologies. Murtagh recognised {{the possibility of}} exploiting the new technology of video projectors to provide the show’s special effects, eliminating entirely the need for dozens of <b>slide</b> <b>projectors.</b> Video tape recorders were very new and rare at this time and this research was very ambitious with many technical hurdles standing in the way. [...] Off-the-shelf video projectors had to be optically and electronically modified to present natural-looking images of celestial bodies on the dome. The system he introduced remained in place until computer controlled laserdisc players replaced the videotape players in the 1980s. This development was a great success and Armagh Planetarium was the first planetarium {{in the world to}} project video on its dome. [...] Other planetaria around the world followed this lead.|$|E

[...] His interest in voicing his political and social concerns led him to direct a multimedia project Imagen de Caracas (Image of Caracas). This was a collaboration between actors, writers, filmmakers and musicians who all sided on the issues of the political and social injustices in Venezuela and wanted to expose the audience, the people of Caracas, to the 400-year history of political and social inequalities that prevailed in their city. The production was a great spectacle that took two years (1966–1968) to complete. Situated on [...] of land, the project utilized eight 35mm projector, forty-five <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> eight large screens (each sixty-five feet wide and thirty-three feet high) and forty-six speakers. The idea was to engage the spectator in the performance, make him part of it in the hopes that through this interaction the audience will become aware of the social injustices that still prevailed in the [...] "democratic" [...] Venezuela. However, shortly after its opening the government forced the Image of Caracas production to close its doors, perhaps due to its negative projection of authority.|$|E

The series featured two nights of an USCO collaboration with Carolee Schneemann, as well as other emerging psychedelic light show artists such as Don Snyder (whose multimedia event included Ralph Metzner and Angus Maclise), Jackie Cassen, and Rudi Stern. According to Gerd Stern, USCO was asked to participate because [...] "they thought that our multimedia performances were kind of simulations of psychedelic experiences." [...] Callahan explained USCO [...] "took incandescent lamps out of <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> and replaced them with intense strobe bulbs, so the projected image itself would flash on the screen."
