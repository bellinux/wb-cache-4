50|$|When Uddalaka {{is having}} dialog {{with his son}} Shvetaketu, if he is saying “O Atman, that thou art”, what are these words {{referring}} to? Since “Atman” is addressing, “thou” must also refer to Atman. If “thou” points to the Supreme inner <b>self,</b> then the statement simply means “O Supreme inner <b>self,</b> you, the Supreme inner <b>self</b> is that, Supreme inner self”. This simply becomes a redundant statement that is trivially true. There are only two ways the triviality can go. One is Atman refers to individual <b>self</b> and that refers to Supreme inner <b>self</b> and negating their selfsameness is the purport. “O Individual <b>self,</b> you are not that Supreme inner self.” The second way is to note that in Vedic grammar, the Nominative case is representative of other cases. In Accusative case sense, {{it means that the}} very object and purpose of an Individual <b>self</b> is Supreme <b>self.</b> In Instrumental case it means that the Supreme inner <b>self</b> or the Lord is instrumental for every action of Individual <b>self.</b> In Dative case, it means the very goal of Individual <b>self</b> is to reach the Supreme inner <b>self.</b> In Ablative case, it means the very origin of Individual <b>self</b> is the Supreme <b>Self.</b> It also means that Individual <b>self</b> is eternally dependent on Supreme <b>self.</b> In Genitive case, it means that Individual <b>self</b> does not own anything as everything belongs to Supreme <b>self.</b> The individual <b>self</b> itself belongs to Supreme <b>self.</b> In Locative case it means the Individual <b>self</b> is located in Supreme <b>self</b> and thus always seeking support for the very existence. Thus in every which way, the eternal dependence is indicated.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of <b>self</b> awareness and private <b>self</b> consciousness on <b>self</b> evaluation. Sixty female undergraduate students completed the private <b>self</b> consciousness subscale developed by Fenigstein et al. i (1973) ? They were then randomly assigned to either the high (N= 30) or low (N= 30) <b>self</b> awareness treatment conditions. Those placed in the high <b>self</b> awareness condition listened to their own taperecorded voices which was intended to increase <b>self</b> awareness. The remainder listened to another's taperecorded voice which was intended to decrease <b>self</b> awareness. All subjects first completed the ideal <b>self</b> evaluation form consisting of 20 randomly arranged bipolar adjective dimensions. Then, depending on the <b>self</b> awareness condition, subjects either listened to their own taperecorded voices or another's voice while completing the real <b>self</b> evaluation form consisting of the Same 20 items. The absolute difference scores between the two <b>self</b> evaluation forms were used as an index of the intensity of <b>self</b> evaluation. <b>Self</b> awareness significantly increased the intensity of <b>self</b> evaluation. This effect was especially noted on initial,items: 1, 2, 3 and 7 i providing further evidence that the effect of listening to one's own voice diminishes quickly as originally observed by Ickes et al., (1973). Private <b>self</b> consciousness did not have a significant overall effect, but a post hoc analysis using subjects scoring in the extremes of this subscale showed that subjects scoring higher in private <b>self</b> consciousness exhibited more intense <b>self</b> evaluation. The present findings offer tentative support for the existence of two factors of awareness which affect <b>self</b> evaluation. One, <b>self</b> awareness as a state of the individual, was indicated by a temporary increase in intense <b>self</b> evaluation. The other, private <b>self</b> consciousness as a trait of the individual, was indicated by a consistent intense effect on <b>self</b> evaluation...|$|R

Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger <b>selves,</b> and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, The Nameless One meets seven {{characters}} who can join him on his quest: Morte, Annah-of-the-Shadows, Dak'kon, Ignus, Nordom, Fall-From-Grace, and Vhailor. These playable characters can also interact with the Nameless One to further the game's plot. Morte is a cynical floating skull originally from the Pillar of Skulls in Baator. He is introduced at the game's beginning in the mortuary. Morte loyally follows The Nameless One, partly out of guilt for having caused the deaths of some of his previous incarnations. The Nameless One meets Annah-of-the-Shadows, a young and brash tiefling (a human with fiendish ancestry) rogue, outside the mortuary, but she does not join the group until a later point in the game. Dak'kon is a githzerai, who once made an oath to follow The Nameless One until the latter died, not knowing of The Nameless One's immortality; this bound him to The Nameless One for eternity. Ignus is a pyromaniacal mage who was the apprentice of one of The Nameless One's past <b>selves.</b> In the Rubikon Dungeon Construct, the Nameless One can find Nordom, a modron disconnected from its species' hive mind. Fall-From-Grace is a succubus who acts as proprietress of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts in Sigil; unlike other succubi, she is not interested in seducing mortals. Vhailor, found below the city of Curst on the plane of the Outlands, is essentially an animated suit of armor dedicated to serving merciless justice.|$|E
5|$|The Combine use a large {{array of}} science fiction technology. They have access to {{teleportation}} technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves {{into the air and}} detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past <b>selves</b> who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the direct and indirect role of <b>self</b> esteem and procrastination in the relation between fear of failure and <b>self</b> worth. The participants were 279 students who study different major fields at the Faculty of Education in Pamukkale University. Age range varied from 19 to 34. In this study, Tuckman Procrastination Inventory, Rosenberg <b>Self</b> Esteem Inventory, Activate and Success Based <b>Self</b> Worth Scale, Concern over Mistakes Scale and Personal Information Sheet were used to gather data. Results showed that procrastination had partial mediating effect in relation to fear of failure; performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability. In other words, the effect of fear of failure on the performance based <b>self</b> worth and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability was decreased when procrastination was added the equation. The results also showed that <b>self</b> esteem had partial mediating role in relation to fear of failure-procrastination, fear of failure- performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability. In other words, the effect of fear of failure on the procrastination, performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability was reduced, when <b>self</b> esteem was added the equation. Finally, results showed that <b>self</b> esteem had full mediating role in the relation to procrastination; performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability.
