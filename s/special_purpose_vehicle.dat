2500|$|Often a {{separate}} institution, called a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicle,</b> is created {{to handle the}} securitization of asset backed securities. [...] The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicle,</b> which creates and sells the securities, uses the {{proceeds of the sale}} to pay back the bank that created, or originated, the underlying assets. [...] The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> is responsible for [...] "bundling" [...] the underlying assets into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors who might want to buy the securities, for managing credit risk – often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium – and for distributing payments from the securities. [...] As long as the credit risk of the underlying assets is transferred to another institution, the originating bank removes the value of the underlying assets from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold, a transaction which can improve its credit rating and reduce the amount of capital that it needs. [...] In this case, a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear. [...] A higher credit rating could allow the <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> and, by extension, the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate (and hence, charge a higher price) on the asset-backed securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds.|$|E

2500|$|Sukuk were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many Muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in non-Sharia-compliant activities (gambling, alcohol, pork, etc.). [...] Sukuk securities are structured to comply with Sharia by paying profit, not interest—generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment. For example, Sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company (and held in a <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Vehicle),</b> so that sukuk holders can collect the property's profit as rent, (which is allowed under Islamic law). Because they represent ownership of real assets and (at least in theory) do not guarantee repayment of initial investment, sukuk resemble equity instruments, but like a bond (and unlike equity) regular payments cease upon their expiration. However, most sukuk are [...] "asset-based" [...] rather than [...] "asset-backed"—their assets are not truly owned by their <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments.|$|E

[...] In [...] "asset-backed" [...] sukuk there is [...] "a true sale between the originator and the <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> (SPV) that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator". [...] Asset prices may vary over time. In contrast [...] "asset-based" [...] sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator, and so more closely resemble conventional bonds.|$|E
