5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, and <b>spends</b> <b>most</b> of {{its life}} cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer.

It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E
