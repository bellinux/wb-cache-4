50|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{panorama}} was what {{it came to be}} associated with, namely, by redefining the <b>sublime</b> to incorporate the material. In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes and in so doing, made the <b>sublime</b> accessible to every person with 3 shillings in his or her pocket. The <b>sublime</b> became an everyday thing and therefore, a material commodity. By associating the <b>sublime</b> with the material, the panorama was seen as a threat to romanticism, which was obsessed with the <b>sublime.</b> According to the romantics, the <b>sublime</b> was never supposed to include materiality and by linking the two, panoramas tainted the <b>sublime.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This essay {{explores the}} {{aesthetics}} of the <b>sublime</b> in Edgar Allan Poe’s short stories in order to clarify how Poe’s <b>sublime</b> is {{moving away from the}} Romantic conception of the <b>sublime.</b> Through Poe’s imaginative writing – his way of presenting impressive, yet disturbing, portraits of the human experience of horror – his work deals not only with aspects of the <b>sublime</b> but is also largely influenced by elements of the uncanny. In order to make the <b>sublime</b> experience possible it seems that Poe, through his usage of the uncanny, illustrates an environment that allows for his <b>sublime</b> to be experienced. However, while the uncanny seems to drive Poe´s narrative over the edge, it is the perversity of the narrators that allows for the <b>sublime</b> experience. This takes the subjective <b>sublime</b> of Romantic author´s such as Wordsworth and Kant even further, as the <b>sublime</b> experience is dependent upon certain traits of an individual...|$|R
