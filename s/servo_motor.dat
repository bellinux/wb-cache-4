25|$|The HDD's {{electronics}} {{control the}} movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a <b>servo</b> <b>motor.</b> Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.|$|E
25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a <b>servo</b> <b>motor.</b> Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E

Normally PID controllers are used to improve the transient response of DC <b>servo</b> <b>motors.</b> At present, most tuning methods are designed to provide workable initial values, which are then further manually optimized for a specific requirement. This paper presents a flexible and fast tuning method based on genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal parameters of the PID controller for the desired system specifications.
