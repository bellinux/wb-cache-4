50|$|Paint {{has four}} major {{components:}} pigments, binders, solvents, and additives. Pigments serve to give paint its color, texture, toughness, {{as well as}} determining if a paint is opaque or not. Common white pigments include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Binders are the film forming component of a paint as it dries and affects the durability, gloss, and flexibility of the coating. Polyurethanes, polyesters, and acrylics are all examples of common binders. The solvent is the medium in which all other components of the paint are dissolved and evaporates away as the paint dries and cures. The solvent also modifies the curing rate and viscosity of the paint in its liquid state. There {{are two types of}} paint: <b>solvent-borne</b> and water-borne paints. <b>Solvent-borne</b> paints use organic solvents as the primary vehicle carrying the solid components in a paint formulation, whereas water-borne paints use water as the continuous medium. The additives that are incorporated into paints are a wide range of things which impart important effects on the properties of the paint and the final coating. Common paint additives are catalysts, thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, texturizers, biocides to fight bacterial growth, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Polyaspartic {{chemistry}} {{was first}} introduced in the early 1990s making it a relatively new class of coating. Polyaspartic is actually an aliphatic polyurea because it {{is derived from the}} reaction product of an aliphatic polyisocyanate component and a polyaspartic ester component, which is a new type of amine/diamine functional coreactant for aliphatic polyisocyanate. Polyaspartic esters perform well as a reactive diluting agent for high solids polyurethane coatings.

One approach has been to develop water-borne polyurethanes having performance approaching that of <b>solvent-borne</b> coatings. Several water-borne resins were tested in white topcoat formulations versus <b>solvent-borne</b> controls (MIL-C- 83286 and Deft 1 -COAT). Selected chemical resistance and flexibility tests were performed to determine whether <b>solvent-borne</b> performance could be achieved in a water-borne formulation. Coatings were formulated with and without crosslinkers to determine whether chemical resistance could be improved without sacrificing flexibility. In general, chemical resistance of the water-bornes was {{not as good as}} that of the <b>solvent-borne</b> controls; all formulations failed 7 days ’ immersion in Skydrol 500 B. Crosslinking tended to improve chemical resistance but in some cases decreased flexibility of the coatings. An aziridine-crosslinked formulation performed best but is undesirable because of potential health risks associated with aziridines. With additional development, water-borne coatings should be able to satisfy performance requirements of the military specification for high-solids polyurethane topcoats, MIL-C- 85285...|$|E

40|$|An initial aim of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} the conventional techniques used {{in the analysis of}} newly prepared environmentally friendly water-borne automotive coatings and compare them with <b>solvent-borne</b> coatings having comparable formulations. The investigation was carried out on microtuned layers as well as on complete automotive multi-layer paint systems. Methods used included the very traditional methods of gloss and hardness and the commonly used photo-oxidation index (from FTIR spectral analysis). All methods enabled the durability to weathering of the automotive coatings to be initially investigated. However, a primary {{aim of this}} work was to develop methods for analysing the early stages of chemical and property changes in both the <b>solvent-borne</b> and water-borne coating systems that take place during outdoor natural weathering exposures and under accelerated artificial exposure. This was achieved by using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), in both tension mode on the microtomed films (on all depths of the coating systems from the uppermost clear-coat right down to the electron-coat) and bending mode of the full (unmicrotomed) systems, as well as MALDI-Tof analysis on the movement of the stabilisers in the full systems. Changes in glass transition temperature and relative cross-link density were determined after weathering and these were related to changes in the chemistries of the binder systems of the coatings after weathering. Concentration profiles of the UV-stabilisers (UVA and HALS) in the coating systems were analysed as a consequence of migration in the coating systems in separate microtomed layers of the paint samples (depth profiling) after weathering and diffusion co-efficient and solubility parameters were determined for the UV stabilisers in the coating systems. The methods developed were used to determine the various physical and chemical changes that take place during weathering of the different (water-borne and <b>solvent-borne)</b> systems (photoxidation). The <b>solvent-borne</b> formulations showed less changes after weathering (both natural and accelerated) than the corresponding water-borne formulations due to the lower level of cross-links in the binders of the water-borne systems.

30|$|The {{weatherability}} and combustibility of fireretardant-impregnated wood during accelerated weathering {{for up to}} 2000 h were evaluated. The {{ability of}} coating to retain fire-retardant chemicals against leaching was also examined using four coating systems (water-borne or <b>solvent-borne,</b> pigmented or clear, film-forming or penetrating). Furthermore, the distribution of fire retardants in the specimens was observed by scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive analysis of Xrays (SEM-EDX). The fire performance of the specimens during weathering depended on the chemical retention, and was maintained at a quasi-noncombustible material level if the chemical retention was above 150 kg/m 3. The maximum duration of accelerated weathering to keep this retention was 250 h for the uncoated specimens, but increased to over 1000 h for pigmented coatings. SEM-EDX revealed that the fire retardants were accumulated in the cell lumina throughout the wood tissues. However, in the uncoated samples, the leaching of fire retardants occurred for surfaces exposed to light and water, and was observed down {{to a depth of}} ∼ 150 μm after 500 h. The leaching depth extended throughout the specimen after 1000 h.

40|$|The concern {{regarding}} {{the effect of}} chems. on the environment has increased considerably in recent years. Nowadays, technol. developments in the coating industry are largely influenced by environmental issues and subsequent legislation. One of these issues is the tendency to replace cobalt as a catalyst with more environmentally friendly alternatives, because studies have indicated possible carcinogenicity. Not much knowledge {{is available on the}} effects of catalysts (driers) on the in-depth drying of alkyd coatings. Therefore we have studied the effect of cobalt as a primary drier combined with Ca and Zr as secondary driers on the in-depth curing of high solid <b>solvent-borne</b> alkyds. The profiling of the curing of alkyd coatings is performed with a new high-spatial-resoln. NMR setup. In this study, two effects obsd. in the <b>solvent-borne</b> alkyd coatings are investigated. One is that when Ca and Zr are added as secondary driers the speed of the obsd. crosslinking front increases. Second, in the deeper un-cross-linked region below the front, the signal of the NMR profiles was found to decrease proportional to t. This could be explained by the presence of slowly reacting species that diffuse into the deeper uncured region of the coating, after which they cross-link.
