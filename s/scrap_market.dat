40|$|The {{objective}} of this {{was to assess the}} levels of heavy metals contamination within the vicinity of the Agbogbloshie <b>scrap</b> <b>market.</b> Surface dust samples were collected from various points at the <b>scrap</b> <b>market</b> and its environs. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry preceded by acid digestion was used to evaluate the concentration of the heavy metals in the samples. Heavy metals such as Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd gave concentrations in the range of (10, 575 - 30, 384 mg/kg), (34 - 16, 952 mg/kg), (351 - 5, 105 mg/kg) and (2 - 72 mg/kg), respectively which were over thousand times more than the levels for which intervention is required. The scrap weighing site, the electronic waste dismantling site and the burning site (where electrical cables are burnt to retrieve metals) recorded the highest levels of heavy metals. Index of geoaccumulation which was employed to determine the level of pollution of the various elements gave the values in the range of 6. 7 - 8. 2 for Zinc (Zn), 4. 2 - 8. 1 for lead (Pb) and 3. 0 - 7. 8 for Cadmium (Cd) indicating extreme pollution from all the sites. This was also confirmed by contamination factor calculations. To assess the extent of pollution of each of the site, degree of contamination was calculated which revealed that the most contaminated site is the Weighing Site (WS) which recorded Cdeg value of 1482. 93, followed by Dismantling Site (DS) 1221. 6, Burning Site (BS) 1196. 9, Road Dust (RD) 1061. 9, School Compound (SC) 651. 44, Commercial Area (CA) 618. 6 and Church Premises (CP) 187. 6, respectively.

Supply equations for primary copper are estimated for four principal producing countries {{and the rest of}} the world; demand equations are estimated for the United States, Europe, Japan, and the Rest-of-World. Scrap supply equations are estimated for the U. S. and non-U. S. sectors as are price adjustment equations. The model is closed with a net input equation for the United States and various identities. The two separate copper markets (U. S. and non-U. S.) are converted by inputs, the generally free London Metal Exchange and <b>scrap</b> <b>markets,</b> and the price-setting behavior of U.

The model, fitted to 1948 - 1969 data, is used for forecasting and simulation experiments. Generally, short-run forecasts are good and longer-run forecasts are not very satisfactory. Perhaps the most interesting finding of the simulation is the prediction that Chilean output would be very sluggish even in the absence of nationalization and that Chilean revenues would be substantially increased were the Chilean government to increase domestic mine production and to allow world prices to adjust accordingly. ...|$|R

The SEMs predictive performance on the spot market is estimated for a selection of eight main vessel categories, five in the tanker market and three in the dry bulk market. SEMs take into account feedback loops between the spot market and its environment. SEMs are considered more complete models as spot prices and variables such as time-charter rates, fleet deadweight capacity and prices of second-hand, newbuilding and <b>scrap</b> <b>markets</b> are determined simultaneously by the shipping markets' operation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an aggregated econometric {{model of the}} world shipping markets. The model distinguishes between dry cargo and tankers and also between the a) freight market, b) second hand market for ships, C) shipbuilding market, d) <b>scrap</b> <b>market.</b> Chapters 1, 2 of the thesis examine the history of shipping in the last 100 years or so, analyse the cyclical behaviour of the industry, and consider past theoretical attempts at modelling the shipping markets. It is argued that the structure of existing models of the shipping industry is theoretically flawed In its treatment of the demand for new and second hand ships {{as well as in}} the treatment of expectations. Chapter 3 presents a 'new' theoretical model of the behaviour of shipping markets that attempts to remedy these defects. Novel features of this theory are the assumption of 'rational expectations' in shipping markets as well as the treatment of new and second-hand ships as assets, the portfolio demand for which varies with the own expected return relative to the return on other assets. Econometric versions of the theoretical model are estimated from post World War II annual data, separately for the dry cargo and tanker sectors In chapters 4, S. The two models are linked In chapter 6 and the models are used In order to simulate the dynamic response of the shipping markets to anticipated and unanticipated external shocks. A crucial role in the adjustment process is played by the forward looking speculative positions of investors in the second hand and newbuilding markets. Chapter 7 tests the assumption of the rational expectations hypothesis in the shipping markets by examining the evidence from the freight futures, time charter and new building markets. The stochastic behaviour of these variables is examined and statistical tests are performed in order to Investigate the extent to which this Is considered to be consistent -with the efficient markets / rational expectations hypothesis. The results are somewhat mixed. Chapter 8 illustrates how the model can be used for real world forecasting purposes and scenario planning...|$|E

40|$|Markov chain {{modeling}} {{is applied}} to the global anthropogenic copper cycle for the year 2000. The lifetime of copper varies from product to product and region to region, as well as through time. Assumptions of average lifetimes are therefore subject to a high degree of uncertainty. A large state transition table is created that encompasses the life-cycle stages of copper (mining, smelting, refining, fabrication, use, waste management, scrap, and final disposal), five end-uses (buildings, transportation, consumer products, electrical equipment, and machinery) in eight world regions, including trade at every stage. The system requires closure by mass balance, so all possible routes of copper trade and recycling are considered. Transitions between each pair of states are calculated using previous material flow analysis data. The main result is that an atom of copper is used 1. 9 times by human society before it enters final disposal. Scaling by the lifetime of copper in each life-cycle stage in each region gives a total average technological lifetime of copper of 60 Â years. A sensitivity analysis {{is applied to}} the model in order to test the robustness of the results. Several scenarios are also considered: increasing the recycling rate in each region to 70 %, applying European or North American in-use lifetimes to all regions, and increasing the share of the world copper cathode and <b>scrap</b> <b>markets</b> taken in by Asia to 50 %.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the relevant problem of iron-and-steel companies saving on purchasing the scrap metal. The {{analysis of the}} current state of the ferrous <b>scrap</b> <b>market</b> in the Russian Federation, trends of its development, led the authors to an opportunity to reduce the cost for purchasing scrap trough the optimal distribution of the regions between Russian iron-and-steel companies where they purchase ferrous scrap. The optimization of the regional structure of the scrap procurement taking into account the regional volumes of its generation and consumption results from using the linear programming methods applying three variants of the problem statement: minimizing the total cost of the scrap delivery to the factory, minimizing the total cost of the scrap at the “export parity” price with delivery, minimizing the total cost of the scrap at the actual prices with delivery. The authors have developed software for performing the calculations. The source are the database of the JSC Russian Railways, which provides information about the transportation of the ferrous scrap between stations of the Russian Federation by railroad; railway rates guide between railway stations of the Russian Federation; statistical data on the prices for scrap metal of the type 3 A in “export windows”; actual purchasing prices for the scrap of the 3 A type for the range of separate companies of the Russian Federation for several years. As a result, the authors have obtained the optimal regional structure of scrap purchasing for customers in the Russian Federation. We have formulated the recommendations for individual companies regarding the optimal routes of the procurement with scrap. The study has confirmed the possibility to decrease expanses for purchasing the scrap metal for all iron-and-steel factories of the Russian Federation through the optimization of the regional structure of procurement. It is also has allowed to estimate the possibility to cut expenses by using the optimal strategies allowing to choose the region of procurement...|$|E
40|$|Maritime {{economics}} {{is the study}} of how shipping market is organized and how it works. The global economy relies heavily on maritime transport. Suffice it to say that, in Europe only, 90 % of the trade with third countries and 30 % of intra-European trade takes place by sea. This requires efficient shipping and port sectors, as well as attractive intermodal transport solutions promoting trade and contributing to sustainable mobility of goods and passengers. This paper reports our efforts to design and estimate an econometric model of the world shipping market in which freight rates, shipbuilding, scrapping and lay-up are the central endogenous variables. The model distinguishes between two key sectors, the dry cargo sector and the tanker sector. However, these sectors are interlinked, inter alia, by combined carriers that are dual purpose vessels that may be used for dry cargos or crude oil. The model explicitly integrates stocks and flows and takes account of the fact that vessels take time to build, and once they are built constitute capital assets of considerably longevity. It also lays emphasis in rational expectations theory in the design and estimation of the model. The model is estimated from annual data that range from 1963 through the mid 1990 s. Chapter 1 examines the history of freight rates, prices, shipbuilding and scrapping over the last hundred years or so. It relates the fluctuations in these variables to the influence of the external factors. It draws on an extensive database in order to discuss the characteristic features of a typical shipping cycle. Chapter 2 reviews previous attempts at modelling the behaviour of shipping markets. It is argued that past events have been deficient in two important respects. First, new and second-hand ships have not been treated as capital assets. Secondly, expectations have not been treated properly. Chapter 3 develops a theoretical model that aims to remedy these deficiencies in past work. Thus both new and second-hand ships are treated as capital assets. Secondly, expectations are assumed to be rational. This allows, but not done in this paper due to time consuming efforts, to simulate the markets response to anticipated or unanticipated shocks. In chapter 4 and 5 the theory is used to specify and subsequently estimate an econometric model of the dry cargo and tanker market respectively. These models can also be used in order to carry out simulations of the effects of various shocks. However, simulations are not our goal in this thesis. In chapter 6 the individual dry cargo and tanker models are linked into an integrated model of the shipping markets. This integration allows to, but not done here, to simulate the spillover effects from one sector to the other. These spillover effects reflect the freight, shipbuilding and <b>scrap</b> <b>market</b> links that exist between the two sectors. In chapter 7 we give a presentation and interpretation of the estimation results of the entire dry cargo model discussed in chapter four. According to time budget, we do not estimate the econometric models presented in chapter five and six. However, it should be mentioned that the estimation procedures of the latter models are not significantly different from those presented of the dry cargo market with respects to estimation techniques and inference. This section is not meant as a complete simulation of the entire model, but rather an example on methodical approach. Given our methodical examinations, it should be straightforward to finalize and refines the estimation results of the entire model...|$|E

This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons of worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{volatile}} {{nature of the}} price of recycled metals over the past decade and examines legislative and fiscal drivers that have affected the industry. Results from this study have shown that the UK <b>scrap</b> metals <b>markets</b> are presently seeing some of the lowest scrap prices for nearly a decade for both ferrous and non-ferrous metals, in many cases halving in value in less than a year. Scrap metals and other recycled materials prices were high in 1994 - 96, which have since fallen back to more traditional low levels. World recessions and the steady decline of the UK manufacturing and engineering sectors have effected prices. With tougher new Government legislation, such as the Climate Change Levy and the proposed End of Life Vehicles Directive, small and medium sized scrap merchants are finding it increasingly difficult to compete...|$|R
