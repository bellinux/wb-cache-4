5|$|With {{the race}} {{scheduled}} for 19 June, the event conflicted with {{the conclusion of}} the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans. Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg, who won the 2015 race with Porsche {{would not be able to}} return and defend his title, leading to accusations that Formula One Management had deliberately scheduled the race to conflict with Le Mans and prevent Formula One drivers from participating. In May 2016, the Azerbaijan government decided to abandon the use of daylight saving time, prompting event organisers to change the <b>start</b> <b>time</b> of the race. The revised <b>start</b> <b>time</b> negated the clash between the start of the Grand Prix and the race in Le Mans.|$|E

30|$|The {{decoding}} scheme turns an encoded solution into a schedule. We set the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> of {{the first}} job in part 1 as 0. Then, to find the earliest possible <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> of the subsequent job, we first set the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> to be 0. The first operation of that job is scheduled. If any overlap happens between this operation and previously scheduled operations on the same machine, the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> is set to as the first possible <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> that avoids any overlap. The second operation in the processing route of the job is then scheduled. Again, if any overlap occurs between this operation and previously scheduled operations on that machine, we have to restart from the first operation in order to hold no buffer constraints. The procedure repeats until all {{the operations of the}} job are scheduled.|$|R
5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia <b>start</b> <b>Time</b> Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time.

At that moment, the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E

As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's <b>start</b> <b>time</b> passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
40|$|Local {{school districts}} often stagger daily <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for their schools {{in order to}} reduce busing costs. This paper uses data on all middle school {{students}} in Wake County, NC from 1999 - 2006 to study the impact of <b>start</b> <b>times</b> on academic performance. Using variation in <b>start</b> <b>times</b> within and across schools, I find that starting school one hour later leads to a three percentile point gain in both math and reading test scores. Using only variation in <b>start</b> <b>times</b> within schools over time, the effect is a two percentile point gain. I find evidence that later <b>start</b> <b>times</b> are associated with decreased absences, less time spent watching television and a greater amount of time spent on homework, indicating that these factors may explain why later starting students have higher test scores.

5|$|National {{competitions}} generally {{last one}} week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed {{the greatest number}} of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own <b>start</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{announced}} a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded {{that it would have been}} impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the <b>start</b> <b>time</b> of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the <b>start</b> <b>time</b> to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of the wall, and the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E
