5|$|Thunderstorms occur from May to September, {{that are}} {{occasionally}} severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although downtown Boston {{has never been}} struck by a violent tornado, the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. Boston has a relatively <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over 2,600 hours of sunshine per annum.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able {{to grow in the}} absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender {{can be found on the}} higher sea cliffs—unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the silver-studded blue.|$|E
5|$|The region's climate {{has been}} dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is {{dominated}} by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very <b>sunny</b> <b>climate.</b> Because {{of the lack of}} moisture, solar radiation energy is dissipated primarily by wind. In the Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. The world's highest level of ultraviolet radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E

50|$|The {{plant is}} dioecious, meaning the pollen-producing (male) and seed-producing (female) flowers are borne on {{separate}} plants. It prefers dry, <b>sunny</b> <b>climates,</b> {{although it is}} hardy to temperatures well below freezing. The leaves and young plants are edible when cooked.|$|R
25|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} of climate from most other inhabited regions is the hot and <b>sunny</b> <b>climate.</b> This difference {{is a major}} contributing factor to a rate of skin cancer that is {{at least three times}} higher than in more northerly regions. The media reports heat-related deaths increasing among illegal immigrants in and around Tucson. Heatstroke-related deaths have been recorded since 1999 in the Pima County Area.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the solar chimney concept is the solar attic. In a hot <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> the attic space is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads {{to the need for}} increased air conditioning. By integrating the attic space with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Nassau County has {{a climate}} {{similar to other}} coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and cool, wet winters. The county is {{classified}} as humid subtropical by some definitions. The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Nassau County has a moderately <b>sunny</b> <b>climate,</b> averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.|$|E
50|$|Black Baldy {{cows are}} noted for their good {{mothering}} abilities. In addition to general hybrid vigor expected with a crossbred, the cross also produces black skin, which in <b>sunny</b> <b>climates</b> reduces {{the prevalence of}} sunburn on bare skin, such as the udder of the cow.|$|R

50|$|Anthocyanin content {{depends on}} climate and area of cultivation, and is {{particularly}} high in <b>sunny</b> <b>climates.</b> This finding holds promise for tropical countries that grow mulberry trees {{as part of}} the practice of sericulture to profit from industrial anthocyanin production through the recovery of anthocyanins from the mulberry fruit.|$|R
25|$|St. Augustine has a humid {{subtropical}} climate or Cfa – {{typical of the}} Gulf and South Atlantic states. The low latitude and coastal location give the city a mostly warm and <b>sunny</b> <b>climate.</b> Like much of Florida, St. Augustine enjoys {{a high number of}} sunny days, averaging 2,900 hours annually. Unlike much of the contiguous United States, St. Augustine’s driest time of year is winter. The hot and wet season extends from May through October, while the cool and dry season extends November through April.|$|E
25|$|Southeastern Bergen County lies at {{the edge}} of the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone according to the Köppen climate classification because its coldest month (January) averages above 26.6°F / -3°C. In part due to Bergen's coastal location, its lower elevation, and the partial shielding of the county from colder air by the three ridges of the Watchung Mountains as well as by the higher Appalachians, the climate of Bergen County is milder than in New Jersey counties further inland such as Sussex County. Bergen County has a moderately <b>sunny</b> <b>climate,</b> averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.|$|E
25|$|Long Island has {{a climate}} {{similar to that}} of other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and chilly, snowy winters with {{variable}} precipitation. Under the Köppen climate classification, the east of Long Island lies in a transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a humid continental climate (Dfa). The oceanic climate zone (Cfb) only exists on the North Fork, the eastern end of the South Fork, islands in Peconic Bay, and Fishers Island, and is rare in eastern North America. Parts of the Harbor Hill Moraine are affected by a subtropical highland climate. The Atlantic Ocean brings afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Long Island has a moderately <b>sunny</b> <b>climate,</b> averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.|$|E

The nutritive high protein waste from the oil extraction process can be used as an animal feed.|$|R
50|$|Pigmentation genes show {{particularly}} strong evidence of adaptive evolution in non-African populations (Williamson et al. 2007). This {{is likely to}} be because those humans that left Africa approximately 50,000 years ago, entered less <b>sunny</b> <b>climates,</b> and so were under new selection pressures to obtain enough Vitamin D from the weakened sunlight.|$|R

500|$|Completed in 1938 some [...] above Yuma, Imperial Dam diverts {{nearly all}} of the Colorado's flow into two {{irrigation}} canals. The All-American Canal, built as a permanent replacement for the Alamo Canal, is so named because it lies completely within the U.S., unlike its ill–fated predecessor. With a capacity of over , the All-American is the largest irrigation canal in the world, supplying water to [...] of California's Imperial Valley. Because the valley's warm and <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> lends to a year-round growing season in addition to the large water supply furnished by the Colorado, the Imperial Valley {{is now one of the}} most productive agricultural regions in North America. In 1957, the USBR completed a second canal, the Gila Gravity Main Canal, to irrigate about [...] in southwestern Arizona with Colorado River water as part of the Gila Project.|$|E
500|$|During battles, players {{take control}} of a medieval army {{containing}} various units, such as knights and longbowmen, {{each of which has}} various advantages, disadvantages and overall effectiveness. Players must use medieval tactics in order to defeat their enemy, using historical formations to give units advantages in different situations. All units in the game gain experience points, known as [...] "valour", which improves unit effectiveness in combat as it increases. Every battle map contains various terrain based upon that of the province on the campaign map, with separate maps for each of the borders between provinces – four hundred unique maps are available for the game. The climate, surroundings and building style for every map varies depending {{on the part of the}} world it is located in; for example, a map based in the Middle East will have a hot, <b>sunny</b> <b>climate,</b> sandy terrain and Islamic architecture. Sieges are an important aspect of the game introduced to the Total War series, occurring when the invading army elects to attack the defending army which has retreated inside the province's castle. Upon starting the engagement, the attacker has to fight their way through the castle's defences, winning the battle once the enemy units have been defeated. Each unit in the game has morale, which can increase if a battle is going well for their faction, or decrease in situations such as sustained heavy casualties. Morale can drop low enough to eventually force a unit to rout off the battlefield, with the player having the option to attempt to rally the men back into the battle through their general. Each side's army can capture routing enemy units and ransom them back to the owning faction, with important generals having greater ransom values.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a broad-brimmed hat with a high crown worn by a rider on horseback {{can be seen as}} far back as the Mongolian {{horsemen}} of the 13th century. A tall crown provided insulation, the wide brim, shade. Hot, <b>sunny</b> <b>climates</b> inspire designs with very wide brims such as the sombrero of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests <b>sunnier</b> <b>climates</b> do not predict happiness. In one study both Californians and Midwesterners expected the former's happiness ratings {{to be higher}} due to a sunnier environment. In fact, the Californian and Midwestern happiness ratings did not show a significant difference. Other researchers say the necessary minimum daily dose of sunlight is as little as 30 minutes.|$|R

2500|$|Tsawwassen {{is known}} for its {{relatively}} dry and <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> compared with other locations in Metro Vancouver. [...] For example, it receives nearly 40% less precipitation than downtown Vancouver. As typical of the Vancouver metropolitan area it has an oceanic climate with cooler summers and milder winters than other areas on the Canada–US border. Due to the drying trend in summers, it has a cool-summer Mediterranean tendency, but winters are cooler than the Mediterranean climates experienced on more southerly coastal locations.|$|E

The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.|$|E
50|$|Reflective heat {{reduction}} roofing or a cool roof is {{most beneficial}} in hot <b>sunny</b> <b>climates.</b> If a home's roof is partially or completely shaded, the homeowner may not benefit {{as much as}} someone with a roof that is in direct sunlight. However even if a homeowner's roof is shaded, they will still receive the tax credit, receive benefit of heat reduction roofing, and enjoy a high quality environmentally friendly roof.|$|R
5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus.

50|$|Dark roofs {{may become}} up to 39 °C (70 °F) hotter {{than the most}} {{reflective}} white surfaces. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in <b>sunnier</b> <b>climates.</b> Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort {{of people in the}} building.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design for}} the new chapel is in the early Gothic manner, {{but in order to}} suit the {{comparatively}} <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> of the Eastern Cape, there is just that suggestion of Italian treatment which prevents it from being a direct copy of an English type. The form is that of a central nave of six bays, spanned by an open timber roof with massive beams, king posts and struts, the prototypes of which form such an attractive feature in: so many old English churches. There are two narrow side aisles to serve as passages, each having [...]space for one row of additional seats in case of emergency. The chancel has an apsidal east end, and is to be covered by a groined roof constructed in concrete, the sanctuary windows being kept high {{in such a way as}} to cut into the semi-circular line of the vault in an effective manner. Instead of transepts, the plan provides a projecting vestry [...]on the north side so as to preserve the cruciform plan, while the side aisles at the west are terminated against small projecting porches.|$|E
2500|$|While {{it is true}} {{that much}} of the {{traveling}} public would have been unable to make the trip to California's <b>sunny</b> <b>climate</b> {{were it not for the}} fleet, relatively safe, and affordable trains of the western railroads, it is also true that those companies in effect preyed on those same settlers once they arrived at the end of the line. For instance, while the railroads provided much-needed transportation routes to out-of-state markets for locally produced raw materials and avenues of the import for eastern goods, there were numerous instances of rate fixing schemes among the various carriers, the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific included. Opposition to the railroads began early in Southern California's history due to the questionable practices of The Big Four in conducting the business of the Central (later Southern) Pacific. The Central Pacific Railroad (and later the Southern Pacific) maintained and operated whole fleets of ferry boats that connected Oakland with San Francisco by water. Early on, the Central Pacific gained control of the existing ferry lines for the purpose of linking the northern rail lines with those from the south and east; during the late 1860s the company purchased nearly every bayside plot in Oakland, creating what author and historian Oscar Lewis described as a [...] "wall around the waterfront" [...] that put the town’s fate squarely in the hands of the corporation. Competitors for ferry passengers or dock space were ruthlessly run out of business, and not even stage coach lines could escape the group's notice, or wrath.|$|E

Yet {{at the idea that}} the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.|$|E
