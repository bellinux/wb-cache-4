5000|$|Roughly {{triangular}} in shape, the Kaiparowits Plateau extends {{for over}} 50 miles (80 km) from {{near the town}} of Escalante in Garfield County, to the south and southwest through Kane County and nearly to the border with Arizona. At its southeastern end the plateau rises from Lake Powell nearly 4000 feet (1200 m) to an elevation of 7584 feet (2311 m). The northeastern edge of the plateau is defined by the Straight Cliffs, below which are the broad <b>sandstone</b> <b>flats</b> of the Escalante River. The western edge of the plateau is at the Paria River, Cottonwood Canyon, and the Cockscomb. [...] The southern end of the plateau is deeply dissected by tributaries of the Colorado River, including Rock, Last Chance, Warm, Wahweap, and Coyote Creeks. These canyons are now major side channels of Lake Powell. An extension of the plateau's high terrain is known as Smoky Mountain, location of one of the few roads on the plateau. The northwestern end of the plateau is less well defined, essentially merging with the Aquarius Plateau. Canaan Peak, just south of Highway 12 and the town of Escalante, rises to 9233 feet (2814 m). Overall, the plateau covers an area of approximately 1650 square miles (4225 km²), much of it covered by pinyon-juniper woodland.|$|E
40|$|Aimed at {{ultra-low}} permeability reservoirs, {{the recovery}} effect of inverted nine-spot equilateral well pattern is studied through large-scale natural <b>sandstone</b> <b>flat</b> model experiments. Two adjustment schemes were proposed {{based on the}} original well pattern. This essay has put forward the concept of pressure sweep efficiency for evaluating the driving efficiency. Pressure gradient fields under different drawdown pressure were measured. Seepage area of the model was divided into immobilized area, nonlinear seepage area and quasi-linear seepage area combining with the nonlinear seepage experiment of the small twin core. The {{results showed that the}} ultra-low permeability <b>sandstone</b> <b>flat</b> model was characterized as nonlinear seepage law and threshold pressure gradient obviously. For one quarter of the inverted nine-spot equilateral well pattern, the middle region is difficult to develop. The recovery effect can be improved by adjusting production wells or adding injection wells. And the best solution is transforming the corner production well into injection well...|$|R

Phytosociologically three communities could be identified, i. e. the Crato- xylum glaucum-Dactylocladus stenostachys, Eugenia palembanica-Ilex hypoglauca, and Shorea ovalis-Eugenia acuminatissima communities. They occurred on <b>sandstone</b> <b>flat,</b> <b>sandstone</b> slope and swampy depression res- pectively.

40|$|The {{outcrops}} of Scala Dei (Colombo, 7 980) and Guadalope-Matarraña (Cabrera, 1983) alluvial {{systems are}} located in the SE sector of the Ebro basin. These alluvial systems were developed during the Palaeogene between the mountain front of the Iberian Chain-Catalan Coastal Ranges, and the Los Monegros (Cabrera, 7983) lacustrine system. The proximal alluvial materials correspond to thick conglomeratic levels with different geometries showing diverse types of progressive unconformities (Colombo and Vergés, 1992). The distal materials interfingered with lacustrine deposits correspond mainly to ochre and reddish lutites intercalated with some small tabular or lenticular sandstone rock bodies. The intermediate deposits are characterized by large amounts of sandy rock bodies, with symmetric or asymmetric transverse geometries, placed between tabular lutites and <b>sandstone</b> <b>flat</b> layers. Their geometries are lenticular and well differentiated with respect to their wings of lateral expansion which are infrequent. The planimetry of these lenticular bodies shows more or less straight segments separated by bends with a low curvature radius. Their mean sinuosity is low, although on rare occasions it is possible to find some bodies with a high sinuosity. The real meandering geometry is very uncommon. The study of several of these sandy bodies and their lateral edges allows us to define two basic architectural units. The lower unit corresponds to the filling of the initial incision and occupies approximately between the half and three quarters of the sandstone body total thickness. The upper unit is placed on the previous one and remains usually confined by the lateral banks The lenticular sandy bodies which are well-known in the literature as "Caspe- type palaeochannels" provides some information on the early stages sedimentary evolution of a distributive drainage system. When a low sedimentation rate In the interchannel sectors exists, this sedimentary information can be lost by the reworking of the initially deposited materials. This type of paleochannels are very common in the type area (distal areas of the Guadalope- Matarraña System) as. in other more distant zones with a different age (marginal-distal areas of the Seal a Dei System) in the Les Garrigues area. Depending upon their sedimentological features and palaeogeography these palaeochannels could be characteristic o f distal tracts o f alluvial systems developed in a semiarid to arid climate, in a general context with a high topographical gradien...|$|R
