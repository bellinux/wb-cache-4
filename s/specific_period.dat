25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of a martial art as practiced in a <b>specific</b> <b>period</b> {{is distinct from}} the practice of a traditional fighting system handed down by way of master-student transmission. The largest movement of martial arts reconstruction is the Historical European Martial Arts revival (HEMA), gaining momentum since the late 1990s. To a limited extent, there are also attempts to reconstruct other styles, such as Korean swordsmanship and Persian armed combat called razmafzar.|$|E

25|$|Twins are {{considered}} an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits {{are considered}} to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth {{to more than one}} offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or so ago, they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it.

25|$|The date {{estimated}} for {{the evolutionary}} divergence {{of a domestic}} lineage from a wild one does not necessarily indicate {{the start of the}} domestication process but it does provide an upper boundary. The divergence of the domestic horse from the lineage that lead to the modern Przewalski’s horse is estimated at 45,000 YBP but the archaeological record indicates 5,500 YBP. The variance could be due to the modern wild population not being the direct ancestor of the domestic one, or the impact of a split due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. The divergence time does not imply domestication during this <b>specific</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on your political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a <b>specific</b> <b>period.</b> This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|E

Unlike the stage musical, which was not set in a <b>specific</b> <b>period</b> of time, the film is clear that the story takes place between 1989 and 1990. Although this leads to occasional anachronisms in the story, the time period is explicitly mentioned to establish that the story takes place before the gentrification of Alphabet City.|$|E

25|$|The {{time when}} the Boian culture {{developed}} into the Gumelniţa culture {{is referred to as}} a transitional period, during which there are commonalities found {{on both sides of the}} chronological divide between the two cultures; as such, Boian Phase IV and Gumelniţa Phase A1 may be considered as a single, uninterrupted, transitional phase. As a result, there are frequent references to this by scholars, who use the term Boian-Gumelniţa culture to describe this <b>specific</b> <b>period.</b> Sometimes, though, this term is mis-used by some to include both the entire Boian culture and Gumelniţa culture periods, not just the transitional period overlapping the two cultures. Since each culture is distinct from the other during its main phases, they should each be considered and named separately, with the exception (as just mentioned) of the transitional phases of their development.|$|E
25|$|Rituals were {{involved}} in selecting and making these figures. It involved a male relative of the deceased specifically visiting the Russel Mountain quarries to acquire a suitable stone. The funerary sculpture was made by specialist artists. The carved figure was presented to a local leader in secret, {{where it would be}} formally kept, sometimes standing in rows with other kulaps, within leaf-decorated mortuary structures. Only men were allowed to visit the ceremonial enclosure to view and perform rituals to the figures of the dead. Women and children mourned the dead relative from outside the enclosure as they were considered impure to see the figurines. After the <b>specific</b> <b>period</b> of mourning was over, the figure was removed from the shrine in secrecy and destroyed to symbolically represent the release of “the soul into the realm of the ancestors”, otherwise bad spirits could reach the ancestor. These funeral practices are not conducted anymore.|$|E
25|$|Structured {{cognitive}} behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based {{process with}} core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities {{in the fields}} of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a <b>specific</b> <b>period</b> of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce recidivism.|$|E

25|$|Inscriptions {{are another}} source of deducing ancient Tamil history: {{most of them are}} written in Tamil-Brahmi script and found on rocks or pottery. The {{inscriptions}} have been used to corroborate some of the details provided by the Sangam literature. Cave inscriptions found at places such as Mangulam and Alagarmalai near Madurai, Edakal hill in Kerala and Jambai village in Villupuram district record various donations made by the kings and chieftains. Brief mentions of various aspects of the Sangam society such as agriculture, trade, commodities, occupations and names of cities are found in these inscriptions. Several coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of them carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty, such as the bow and arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends. Numismatists have used these coins to establish the existence of the Tamil kingdoms during the Sangam age and associate the kings mentioned in the legends to a <b>specific</b> <b>period.</b> A large number of Roman coins have been found in Coimbatore and Madurai districts, providing more evidence for the brisk maritime trade between Rome and Tamilakam.|$|E
25|$|The economy rate is more {{important}} in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team {{a better chance of}} finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when in the field is to bowl the opposition out and take all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a <b>specific</b> <b>period</b> of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is sure to get you taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.|$|E
25|$|Initially, R relied {{primarily}} on trained intelligence {{officers who were}} recruited directly. These belonged to the external wing of the Intelligence Bureau. In times of great expansion, many candidates {{were taken from the}} military, police and the Indian Revenue Service. Later, R began directly recruiting graduates from universities. However owing to allegations of nepotism in appointments, in 1983 R created its own service cadre, the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) to absorb talent from other Group A Civil Services, under the Central Staffing Scheme. Direct recruitment at Class I executive level is from Civil services officers undergoing Foundation course at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. At the end of the course, R conducts a campus interview. Based on a selection of psychological tests and the interview, candidates are inducted into R for a lien period of one year. During this period, they have an option of rejoining their parent service (if they wish to) after which they can be permanently absorbed into the Research and Analysis Service. Delhi-based security think tank Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses noted in one of its reports that R suffered from the 'tail-end syndrome' where the 'bottom of the entrance lists' of those qualifying the UPSC examinations were offered jobs. Additionally, recruitment is also by lateral deputation from the Officer corps of Armed Forces or Group A Civil Service Officers. The Civil and Defence Service Officers permanently resign their cadre and join the RAS. However, according to recent reports, officers can return to their parent cadre after serving a <b>specific</b> <b>period</b> in the agency if they wish to. Most of the secretaries have been officers from the IPS and other posts are held by IRS and IFS officers. R also employs a number of linguists and other experts in various fields. The service conditions of R officers are governed by the Research and Analysis Wing (Recruitment, Cadre and Service) Rules, 1975.|$|E
