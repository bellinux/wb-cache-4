Prayers used to close meetings today include the [...] "we" [...] version of the [...] "Serenity Prayer" [...] ("God, Grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference."); the Third Step Prayer ("Take my will and my life. Guide me in my recovery. <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> live.") or the [...] "Gratitude Prayer" [...] ("That no addict seeking recovery need ever die. ...

2500|$|George McCready Price was {{important}} in developing flood geology, and while he had limited influence {{at a time when}} all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a Seventh-day Adventist, and followed {{one of the founders of}} the church, Ellen White, in seeing fossils as evidence of the Great Flood. In 1906, Price published Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory in which he offered $1000 [...] "to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> prove that one kind of fossil is older than another." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh! but he <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> set it better,' said Phyllis, 'and he {{said that}} when he learnt the {{beginning}} of fractions, he thought them as hard as I do.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Bedi has {{expressed}} strong opinions on {{many aspects of}} modern-day cricket and {{has been described as}} [...] "being jealous of modern day great spinners". In particular, he was a vehement critic of the bowling action of Muttiah Muralitharan ("if Murali doesn't chuck, then <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> bowl") which he bluntly referred to as cheating and likened to a javelin throw and shot putting, saying that Muralitharan would [...] "complete 1000 Test wickets but they would count as mere run-outs in my eyes". He takes a very dim view of chucking, which he calls [...] "a bigger threat than bribing and betting" [...] and claimed in 2004 that many bowlers on the subcontinent chuck, calling Muralitharan a [...] "Sri Lankan bandit closing in on a dream artist called Shane Warne". He has stated, though, that he has nothing personal against Muralitharan, although Muralitharan has threatened to sue him. He levelled the same criticisms against his countryman Harbhajan Singh. Regarding suspect actions in cricket, he said [...] "When a bowler is chucking, he's referred to panels and the home cricket board. Why not do the same for a wide or no-ball, then?". He has accused one-day cricket, modern cricket bats and small grounds of causing a decline in classical spin bowling in India.|$|E
2500|$|RUTH: Yes, sir, I were; I {{were brought}} {{up to be a}} thief. Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till I was sixteen. I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most as bad as I can be—as bad as I can be! ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had never}} before known that the human leg did unscrew. I had {{always thought it was}} a fixture. But the man <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> undo them, and I found that they came off quite easily.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sometimes, however, I wish I {{had never}} joined the army. My father {{gave me a}} very fair education, and your father <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> draw horses--on a slate, I mean. Yes, I ought to have done more than I have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And another, [...] "Can you <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{correct this}} hopelessly corrupt passage of Graidiocolosyrtus Tabenniticus, on the cause why {{crocodiles}} have no tongues?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Aline {{is already}} longing to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> run a farm. Go on, and beware how you lay any weak points open to her criticism," [...] I answered.|$|E
5000|$|The lead guitar {{tracks on}} [...] "You <b>Showed</b> <b>Me</b> <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] and [...] "Good 2B Alive" [...] {{were taken from}} the audition/demo {{sessions}} in 2005 when Miljenko Matijevic and Uros Raskovski met at the Steelheart Studios for the first time.|$|R

5000|$|Teammate Brandon Lindsey, who {{believes}} Romeus and Sheard, credited them with helping him develop {{as a player}} saying, [...] "They’ve really <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> work hard every day in practice and to not get frustrated when things don’t go your way." [...] The Panthers lead the country in sacks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, just <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> start," [...] he says, [...] "which way you {{get into}} it, and then I won't keep you any longer; I'll puzzle out the rest for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|When, {{however, the}} Haggerty-Taggertys were gone she condescended to say, [...] "I shall never, never {{ask you to}} help me, but--if you like--you can <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hit without biting my tongue." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maria {{alone could}} dare to shriek out, 'Oh! but you promised to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make {{a crown of}} my pink heaths, and I have been out with Lieschen, and {{gathered}} such beauties!' ...|$|E

500|$|Cropper's {{recollection}} {{is supported}} by a 1968 Rolling Stone interview with Hendrix: [...] "He [...] <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play lots of things and I showed him how I played 'Have Mercy' or something like that".

6000|$|... "That is {{precisely}} and {{exactly what she}} is going to do. Go in to your supper, and I will push him about until you come out again. Then you can <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> put him to bed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O! {{they are}} {{beautiful}} little boats," [...] said he. [...] "Jonas <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make them.
