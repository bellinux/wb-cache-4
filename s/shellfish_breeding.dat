40|$|Croatia is {{the country}} where the sea was used as a food source about a {{thousand}} years ago. The tradition of some forms of collection and culture of marine organisms is very long along the Adriatic coast. The farming of marine organisms has a long tradition on the eastern Adriatic coast dating back to the 19 th century. L o r i n i (1903) mentioned a figure of 116 such fish ponds on the eastern Adriatic coast. Long tradition of <b>shellfish</b> and fish <b>breeding</b> and particularly a growing fund knowledge recently provided a mariculture development at a growing pace. The eastern Adriatic coast with a number of bays, coves and channels protected from the wind and waves by chains of islands provide marvelous conditions for intensive farming on floating platform...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} study that {{presents}} concentrations of domoic acid detected in the whole <b>shellfish</b> tissue from <b>breeding</b> and harvesting areas along the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea during the period 2006 to 2008. Shellfish sample analyses after SAX cleaning procedures, using a UV-DAD-HPLC system, showed the presence of domoic acid in four species. The most prevalent of those species were the blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), followed by European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis), Mediterranean scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) and proteus scallop (Flexopecten proteus). Domoic acid, a potentially lethal phycotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), was detected {{for the first time}} in January 2006 with the highest value of 6. 5486 μg g- 1 in whole shellfish tissue. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom events preceded these high domoic acid concentrations. According to this study, retention of domoic acid in the blue mussel M. galloprovincialis is more than 42 days. This investigation indicates the first presence of domoic acid in Croatian shellfish, but in concentrations under the regulatory limit (20 μg g- 1), therefore shellfish consumption was not found to endanger human health...|$|R
40|$|The {{marine and}} coastal {{resources}} of Ghana exist {{within a very}} fragile ecosystem. Current development trends and pressures exerted on these resources are steadily degrading the components of this fragile ecosystem. Landward, the area includes lagoons, marshes, estuarine swamps together with the intervening interfluve areas. Seaward, the boundary is determined as the limit of Exclusive Economic Zone (200 nautical miles). The area is richly endowed with important resources {{for the promotion of}} tourism, fishery, industry and mining. The lagoon, estuary and delta ecosystems provide suitable environments for <b>shellfish</b> and fish <b>breeding,</b> as well as feeding, roosting and resting sites for local and migratory birds and marine turtles. The coast supports mangroves, which are an important source of fuel-wood to local communities. The beaches, cliffs, lagoons, wildlife, cultural and historical sites and coastal landscape also provide an immense potential for tourism development. In addition, salt, deposits of limestone, silica, feldspar and other minerals have been identified within the coastal belt. There is also the possibility for hydrocarbons, for which prospecting is being undertaken. Furthermore, copra production is also an important economic activity along the coastal belt. The coastal and marine ecosystem is under threat from a variety of man’s actions which include: 1. Increases in urbanisation caused by migration and high rates of population growth. 2. Greater infrastructure along the coast, industrialisation and heightened economic activities 3. Provision of transportation facilities including extensive road networks, rail, air and water. 4. Siting of two main seaports at Tema and Takoradi which handle most of Ghana’s imports and exports respectively. This paper outlines the various mechanisms currently in place to protect Ghana’s coastal and marine ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn southwestern France, {{groundwater}} {{resources are}} withdrawn for various uses (drinkable water, irrigation, industry, geothermal energy, forestry, conservation of wetlands, <b>shellfish</b> <b>breeding</b> among others) which can sometimes cause conflicts between users. To help {{the management of}} these resources, regional hydrodynamic models have been developed. These models have been a support to the public policies for over 20 years. In the northern region, groundwater is in close relation with rivers, especially during periods of low-water levels. Indeed, groundwater used for irrigation impact not only the stream flows, but also the water supply for the second large wetland of France: the Marais Poitevin. The developed models have permitted to test the impact of several scenarios of water withdrawals. These tests help to determinate {{the amount of water}} that can be pumped to respect defined objectives as water levels in piezometer and river flows. These models were also used to test the impact of the eventual implementation of water tanks (400, 000 to 800, 000 m 3). Further south, the major problem is the important reduction of the level of the Eocene aquifer in the department of Gironde. In this area, the regional hydrodynamic model has been developed since 1990. Its development allows the management of deep groundwater resources and contributes to validate strategies of exploitation based on different simulations. This model also allows to answer problems of overexploitation and to analyse areas where water savings could be done to avoid this overexploitation, and to estimate the impact of new resources. The extreme southern region has a significant particularity: on two different sites, groundwater is used for the storage of gas. The cyclic injection and withdrawal of gas impacts significantly the aquifer level. The proposed model is adapted for the groundwater resources knowledge and management of this case. Finally, these models were used to evaluate impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in order to allow authorities to evaluate strategies to adapt to this change (Project Explore 2070 for example) ...|$|E
40|$|In Mali Ston Bay, {{located on}} the eastern Adriatic coast, mussels and oysters have {{traditionally}} been cultivated. However, previous studies showed that water and sediments from Mali Ston Bay contain elevated levels of some trace metals, which was attributed to natural processes of sedimentation and drainage. In order to assess the bioavailability of trace metals in the bay, and to assess the health risk of consumption of shellfish species from Mali Ston Bay, a passive monitoring program {{was carried out in}} the period from December 1998 to August 2005. Samples of the whole soft tissue were collected seasonally at 4 <b>shellfish</b> <b>breeding</b> farms and analyzed for essential (Cu, Zn) and non-essential (Cd, Cr, THg, Pb) metals. Mean concentrations of analyzed metals in the edible tissue of mussels (Cd: 1. 15 mg kg- 1 d. wt.; Cr: 1. 65 mg kg- 1 d. wt.; Cu: 5. 6 mg kg- 1 d. wt.; THg: 0. 15 mg kg- 1 d. wt.; Pb: 1. 09 mg kg- 1 d. wt.; Zn: 139 mg kg- 1 d. wt.) fell in the range of values usually found in low to moderately contaminated marine coastal areas. Examination of the spatial pattern of contaminants showed that there were no statistically significant differences among stations in Mali Ston Bay regarding trace metal content. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr and THg were significantly higher during the autumn-winter period, while concentrations of Pb and Zn did not depend on the sampling season. Among six analyzed metals, only concentrations of Cd and THg were significantly negatively correlated with the condition index of the mussels. Analysis of temporal trends during the 7 years of monitoring showed that metal concentrations had not changed with time. According to EU and WHO legislation, consumption of the edible tissue of the mussels was not harmful for humans since all the values were well below the permissible limits for fresh seafood. In addition, results of the evaluation of the risks to human health associated with consumption of the mussels containing trace metals suggest that there is no health risk for moderate shellfish consumers...|$|E
40|$|La lagune de Khnifiss, située au sud du Maroc, est une réserve biologique d’intérêt mondial pour l’avifaune. Des études pluridisciplinaires portant sur la physico-chimie des eaux, la biologie, la sédimentologie et les courants ont été réalisées par l’INRH dans la lagune en septembre 1998 et février 2001. Les résultats du courant obtenus montrent que la {{circulation}} des eaux à l’intérieur de la lagune est gérée par un courant alternatif et bidirectionnel : les courants du jusant sont plus importants que ceux du flot et varient également {{en fonction}} du rythme de la marée vive-eau/morte-eau. Ce mode de circulation des eaux attribue à la lagune une richesse en éléments azotés et phosphatés, surtout en période de vive-eau. La biomasse chlorophyllienne, assez importante dans la lagune, est causée par la richesse du milieu en éléments nutritifs et le phénomène d’upwelling qui se manifeste en été et au printemps dans la zone sud du Maroc. Ces études ont montré que la lagune de Khnifiss est un milieu propice à la conchyliculture. Néanmoins, l’installation de tout projet aquacole dans le site devra tenir compte de sa capacité trophique et de son équilibre écologique. The Moroccan coastal marine area has several zones that are targets for exploitation but must simultaneously be protected. Lagoons {{are considered to}} be among the most productive natural systems in the world, but they are also vulnerable systems due to natural and human constraints. Lagoons can also be a target of economic expansion. This is why an understanding about the state of these ecosystems is important in order to proceed with rational use of the resource. The Khnifiss lagoon, situated on the South Atlantic coast of Morocco, is a potential site for aquaculture and tourism if planned with an ecological awareness. The large surface area and high biological production for the avifauna qualify it to be among the four protected sites by the RAMSAR convention for humid zone conservation (lagoons of Khnifiss and Moulay Bousselham, lakes of Sidi Boughaba and Afennourir). The objective of this work was to complete previous studies and to estimate the nutritive richness of the Khnifiss lagoon. To understand the spatio-temporal variability in the water currents, and the physico-chemical and biological and characteristics of this lagoon, two surveys were organized in September 1998 and February 2001. The Khnifiss lagoon (20 km long and 65 km 2 surface area) is situated between Tantan and Tarfaya (28 ° 02 ' 54 '' N, 12 ° 13 ' 66 '' W). It opens up into the Atlantic ocean by a narrow inlet called ''Foum Agouitir'', about 100 m wide. The lagoon continues upstream beyond a salt marsh, called "Sebkha Tazra". Physical, chemical and biological variables were monitored: temperature and salinity; dissolved oxygen, nitrates and phosphates; chlorophyll a. The current (direction and intensity) and the sediment were also studied. Samples were collected four times from the surface and bottom waters during spring tide (ST), neap tide (NT), low tide (LT) and high tide (HT) during two seasons (September 1998 and February 2001). Seven hydrological stations were sampled, representing the lagoon system and one reference station in a neighbouring zone (Hréf), which represents the marine zone of the lagoon. Temperature and salinity were measured with a multi-sensor probe. The chemical analyses were carried out according to methods suggested by AMINOT & CHAUSSEPIED (1983). Thirty (30) sediment samples were also collected. Currents were measured at two fixed points by two current-meters. Based on the hydrological characteristics of the lagoon, especially temperature, salinity, water circulation and the nature of sediment, three zones were identified : 1. Zone I (downstream from the lagoon) was dominated by the ocean’s influence and included the Hréf, H 1 and H 2 stations. Maximum depths varied from 2. 5 to 6. 6 m, depending on the tide and location. The concentrations of the different hydrological parameters were controlled by the plug effect of the oceanic environment. The most important current in the lagoon was recorded in this zone in the spring tide (ST: 110 cm. s- 1). The sediment was coarse and important water - sediment exchange was caused by the strong current recorded in this zone. 2. Zone II (middle of the lagoon) was a transition zone with an intermediate oceanic influence. It was situated between the H 3 and H 5 stations. The size of the inlet and the important exchanges governed by currents caused by strong tides resulted in concentrations of the various parameters being similar to those in Zone I. Depths varied from 2. 64 to 8. 7 m. Waters were more saline during the LT and NT periods (36 - 41 practical salinity unit, or psu). The current decreased relative to that is zone I (56 cm. s- 1 in September 1998 and 78 cm. s- 1 in February 2001). In this zone the current moved preferentially towards the right strand at high tide and toward the left strand at low tide. 3. Zone III (upstream in the lagoon) covered a different biotope compared to the first two zones. The waters were less deep (2. 64 to 5. 3 m) and included the stations H 6, H 7 and {{the upper part of the}} lagoon. This zone was characterized by a very low oceanic influence. Water temperature and salinity were higher, 24 - 26 °C and 41 - 44 psu respectively, during the LT and NT periods. On the basis of the hydrological zonation, the conjunction of the climate descriptors (moderate wind, rare precipitation, absence of storms, moderate air temperature) of the lagoon and the strong hydrodynamic influence in the lagoon suggest that the Knifiss lagoon is a relatively unconfined ecosystem. The hydrodynamics of this lagoon permit a fast water renewal rate and insure a good environmental quality. In addition, studies carried out on the healthiness of this lagoon demonstrated not only a healthy environment, but also healthy shellfish. This diagnosis seemed to be related to the geographical location and important rates of water exchange. However, the absence of continental freshwater sources leads to an important increase in salinity and temperature at the level of the upstream zone (zone III). Zone III therefore cannot be considered for <b>shellfish</b> <b>breeding.</b> On the basis of the biological zones: With respect to the bathymetry of the lagoon (depths varied from 2. 5 to 8. 7 m), shellfish, in contrast to fish, require less water depth. Therefore, it is sufficient to search for a less turbulent zone, which offers sufficient planktonic food for the shellfish growth. In the Khnifiss lagoon, the taxonomy of the phytoplankton has not been yet studied. However, BENNOUNA (1999) demonstrated that the phytoplankton community was dominated by dinoflagellates and diatoms in the Oualidia and Sidi Moussa lagoons. RHARBI (2000) found that picophytoplankton were the principal breeding food source of oysters and clams in Oualidia lagoon. The source of shellfish for breeding is located in the neighbouring upwelling marine waters. Development projects planned for the lagoon must include an awareness programme for fishermen about the role that moderate and responsible <b>shellfish</b> <b>breeding</b> programs can play in the preservation and reconstitution of the marine resource as well as in the improvement of their incomes...|$|E
