40|$|Mangrove {{species have}} evolved {{specialized}} structures, such as pneumatophores, to supply oxygen to the roots, but, in Nypa fruticans, the only mangrove palm, no such structure has been reported. This study aimed {{to determine the}} adaptations of N. fruticans to the mangal habitat with special reference to the air-supplying structure. Following senescence, the rachis is abscised at the zone of junction with the leaf base. Simultaneously, lenticels develop so that, when abscission is completed, a network of mature lenticels covers the leaf base. Expansigenous aerenchyma with increasing porosity towards the stem junction occurs in the leaf base. The first two root branching orders present a subero-lignified rhizodermis and exodermis, and the cortex consists of <b>schizo-lysigenous</b> aerenchyma with wide lacuna, limiting radial oxygen loss and facilitating longitudinal oxygen transport to living tissues. Lifespan estimation suggests that leaf bases can live for up to 4 years following abscission, ensuring the persistence of aeration structures. This study provides structural evidence indicating that N. fruticans has evolved a unique type of air-supplying structure in the mangal habitat.

40|$|The origin, {{development}} and ultrastructure of secretory cavities in leaf of Ginkgo biloba {{and its relation}} to the secretory products were studied by optical and electron microscope. The results indicated that the formation pattern of the secretory cavities was <b>schizo-lysigenous</b> in nature. First, some original central secretory cells in the center of secretory cavities expanded, dissolved then moved aside schizogeneously forming an intercellular space. Later the central and peripheral secretory cells continued to dissolve making the intercellular space larger. This process continued until the central secretory cells degenerated, autolyzed and separated off into cavities. It has been assumed that the secretory products in the secretory cavities of Ginkgo biloba were synthesized mainly in the plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However it was our observation that the Mitochondrion, Golgi Body and Cytoplasm were also involved in the synthesis and translocation of the secretions. After synthesized in ER and plastids, the secretory products approached the plasmalemma and fused their membranes with the latter in the form of samll vesicles, and then was eliminated to the spaces between the plasmalemma and the wall. At last the secretory products percolated through the wall that faded into an even looser mesh of fibrillar material toward the cavity...|$|E
40|$|The study {{assessed}} phloem canal {{development and}} ultra-structure in shoot apices of Spondias dulcis G. Forst., phloematic canal ultra-structure in shoot apices of Tapirira guianensis Aubl., and floral canal ultra-structure {{and development and}} fruit canal ultra-structure of the latter specie. The flower and fruit canals of Anacardium humile St. Hil. were also studied ultra-structurally. The canals in shoot apices of S. dulcis show <b>schizo-lysigenous</b> formation and the floral canals of T. guianensis show schizogenous development. Epithelial cells of S. dulcis and T. guianensis canals have rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, elongated plastids of several shapes with osmiophilic inclusions and dictyosomes with production of vesicles. Such organelles participate in the secretion of a heterogeneous exudate, which is comprised of hydrophilic and lipophilic substances. The epithelial cells of the fruit of A. humile present elongated plastids with circular membrane system, which {{are involved in the}} synthesis of lipophilic substances. The results of the ultra-structural analyses of the epithelial cells corroborate the results previously obtained in a histochemical study. In the histochemical study, lipophilic and hydrophilic substances were identified in the canals of T. guinanensis and S. dulcis and only lipophilic substances were identified in the canals of A. humile. Based on the ultrastructural aspects of the secretory canals of T. guianensis and S. dulcis we concluded that the plastids of the epithelial cells of the two species are different although they produce secretion of similar composition. A new record for the family is the presence of a great number of circular plastids in epithelial cells of the fruit of Anacardium humile. The pattern found in the secretory canals of the studied species is the ecrine type of secretion release...|$|E
