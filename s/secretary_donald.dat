5|$|Reagan {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to ever have been sworn into a second term. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer, Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Captain Nutsch soon {{requested}} {{replacements for}} the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. He specified a supply of lightweight saddles, either McClellan or Australian-style, suitable for the smaller Afghan horses. A supply of saddles was air-dropped in mid-November. The last U.S. Army unit to receive horseback training was the 28th Cavalry in 1943. A picture of the soldiers on horseback was shown by Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld during a news conference on 15 November 2001.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the uprisings U.S. General John Abizaid in April 2004 {{requested}} an additional 10,000 troops be sent to Iraq after admitting that a number of Iraqi security personnel had abandoned their posts or joined the Iraqi insurgency. On 16 April 2004, U.S. Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld announced that he had approved General Abizaid's request and had extended the tour of roughly 20,000 soldiers, who were scheduled to be rotated out of Iraq, by three months. A fresh mass grave was found near Ramadi, containing the bodies of over 350 Iraqis. It is unclear whether this mass grave contained dead civilians and/or militants.|$|E
25|$|The artist, {{sculptor}} Douwe Blumberg, {{had been}} a horse trainer for 18 years and is a military history buff. He has completed more than 200 private and public commissions and has received numerous awards.

As part of Operation Enduring Freedom, President George W. Bush sent covert forces into Afghanistan to help the Northern Alliance defeat the Taliban. The group, named Task Force Dagger, was a joint Special Operations team consisting of Green Berets from the 5th Special Forces Group, aircrew members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ("Nightstalkers"), and Air Force Combat Controllers.|$|E

In May 2012, the tribunal again under a purported exercise of universal jurisdiction took testimony from victims of torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and convicted in absentia former President Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld, former Deputy Assistant Attorneys General John Yoo and Jay Bybee, former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and former counselors David Addington and William Haynes II for conspiracy to commit war crimes. The tribunal referred their findings to the chief prosecutor at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.|$|E
500|$|Though {{neither side}} ever apologized, a US-Turkish {{commission}} {{set up to}} investigate the incident later issued a joint statement of regret. In addition, US Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld {{wrote a letter to}} the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan expressing sorrow over the incident. The Hood event damaged diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States and marked a low point in US-Turkish relations. [...] While the incident received comparatively little coverage in the United States, it was a major event in Turkey, many of whose citizens saw it as a deliberate insult and nicknamed it [...] "The Hood event".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, even as {{the term}} came into wide use, there was {{disagreement}} about its exact meaning. In 2002 a U.S. State Department official, reporting on a meeting between President George W. Bush {{and the leaders of}} Japan and Pakistan, said that the latter, Pervez Musharraf, had referred to the [...] "possibility of trouble in the Arab street, whatever that is" [...] over the upcoming invasion of Iraq. This uncertainty has led to confusion over what the term represents. During the same period of time, Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld later recalled, Arab leaders urged him to make sure the operation went quickly as they [...] "were worried about the 'Arab street' erupting in anger at the West's invasion of a Muslim country. I was skeptical of the idea that a monolithic Arab street existed... but I did understand that popular discontent could cause them difficulties." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 12, 2002, Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, {{dedicated}} the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery.

This included Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 {{with her parents}} and older sister. A portion of the remains of 25 other victims are also buried at the site. The memorial is a pentagonal granite marker [...] high. On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words [...] "Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001". Aluminum plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack. The site is located in Section 64, on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon.|$|E
