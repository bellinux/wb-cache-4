25|$|In {{a review}} by Motor Trend editor Scott Kanemura, it was {{revealed}} that the GPS system fitted to the GT-R would remove the 180-kilometer per hour (112mph) <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> when the car arrives at a race track, but only on tracks approved by Nissan. Aftermarket ECUs have been developed to bypass the <b>speed</b> <b>limiter,</b> in addition to stand-alone speed-limiter defeaters. The GPS check will not be implemented in American models.|$|E
25|$|It was {{predicted}} that the gentlemen's agreement speed cap would hurt sales, because buyers would not want a bike that was hobbled with a <b>speed</b> <b>limiter,</b> even riders who would never approach the hypothetical maximum. However, sales in the United States have increased year after year since its release in 1999 until 2006 and went from just a few thousand units in 1999 to over 10,000 in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are <b>speed</b> <b>limiter,</b> cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the engine revs to 4,000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|In the article, Mike Russel, a {{spokesman}} for American Trucking Associations (ATA), is quoted saying that the ATA supports a national speed limit of 65 mph for all vehicles. Russell goes on to state that forcing trucks to drive slower than other traffic increases the accident rate. In 1991, <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> were considered and rejected by Congress. Despite claims that <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> would increase accident rates, Road Safe America petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to require manufacturers to install <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> on all trucks over 26000 lb GVW, to limit their speeds to 68 mph.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> will have the most impact on vehicle speeds and hence road safety in general. Whilst it is technically feasible to develop a functional speed control system, it may be more difficult to design a system that drivers actually wish to use. It is essential that drivers' acceptability towards <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> is gauged in order to establish {{the most effective way to}} implement the system. The research reported here used a variety of techniques to evaluate acceptability and concluded that although drivers perceive <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> to be effective in reducing accidents, there is a need to change perceptions about possible impacts on comfort and safety. ...|$|R
50|$|Speed {{limits are}} 120 km/h on freeways, 100 km/h on rural roads, and 60 or 80 km/h on urban dual-carriageways. Heavy trucks and buses are {{installed}} with <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> to prevent overspeeding.|$|R
25|$|Sébastien Bourdais's first Formula One race {{ended on}} lap 56 after {{suffering}} an engine failure (Ferrari's {{third of the}} race).

At the end of the penultimate lap, Kovalainen finally passed Alonso coming out of turn 13, to take fourth place. But moments later on the pit straight, he went to tear a strip off his visor, and accidentally hit the pit lane <b>speed</b> <b>limiter,</b> allowing Alonso back through.|$|E
500|$|Code Red/Code White was {{released}} in January 2012. The limited edition C3 Picasso Code Red and Code White replaced the Blackcherry in the UK. The Code has the same engine as the Blackcherry and has been finely tuned for a marginally increased fuel economy and lower carbon dioxide (...) emissions. It features obsidian black bumpers and 17-inch (43cm) Polar White or Cherry Red [...] "clover" [...] alloy wheels, and can be equipped with extra features, which include roof bars, curtain airbags, cruise control and a <b>speed</b> <b>limiter.</b> Body colours exclusive to the trim are Belle Ile Blue, Shark Grey and Cherry Red.|$|E

40|$|Scooters are {{manufactured}} with <b>speed</b> <b>limiters.</b> If these <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> are removed, the motor-scooter will exceed speed limits and break traffic rules. To {{determine whether the}} scooter exceeds the speed limit, the mobile stand for scooter’s speed metering is designed and manufactured. The loads of the scooter are calculated for various driving speeds. The testing of the stand is performed using an electric engine and the scooter. A relative speed measurement error is determined as 1. 2 %. The conclusion is made that the stand for scooter’s speed check can accurately determine the actual speed of the scooter.

2500|$|In 2016, Norfolk Southern began a rebuild {{program on}} the Dash 9-40C units. The rebuild {{involved}} overhaul of the engine, emissions upgrades, a new cab (featuring GE Trip Optimizer, PTC, and NS Cab Signals / [...] Locomotive <b>Speed</b> <b>Limiter),</b> new electronics, DPU and ECP capabilities, increased weight, and an electric parking brake. Norfolk Southern plans on rebuilding all of the Dash 9-40Cs {{and some of the}} Dash 9-40CWs. The new locomotives are being classified as GE AC44C6M.|$|E

2500|$|Following Jules Bianchi's {{accident}} at the Japanese Grand Prix, the FIA {{announced plans to}} introduce a mandatory <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> to cars that could be remotely activated from Race Control {{in the event of}} a yellow flag. Labelled [...] "Virtual Safety Car" [...] (VSC), the system is an alternative to the use of an actual safety car and was first tested during practice at the United States Grand Prix. The system originally aimed at restricting drivers to a [...] speed limit under specific yellow flag situations, following reports that Bianchi had been travelling at [...] when he left the circuit. Similar trials were conducted in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, with VSC ultimately being managed through specified sector (delta) times rather than a speed limit in affected sectors.|$|E
2500|$|The ACR Neon, {{available}} with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter [...]81 fifth gear and {{final drive ratio}} of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to [...] on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights {{and a lack of}} side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name [...] "ACR" [...] was initially the internal ordering code for the [...] "Competition Package", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym [...] "American Club Racer" [...] was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.|$|E
50|$|European Citroën,Mercedes Benz,Peugeot,Renault {{as well as}} some Ford car and van {{models have}} driver-controlled <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> fitted or {{available}} as an optional accessory which can be set by the driver to any desired speed; the limiter can be overridden if required by pressing hard on the accelerator.The limiter may be considered as setting the maximum speed (with throttle kickdown to override it) easing the throttle to reduce speed, whereas cruise control sets the minimum speed (with the brake pedal to override it) pressing on the throttle to increase <b>speed.</b> The <b>limiter</b> may shift down through automatic gears to hold the maximum speed.|$|R

2500|$|The SD70ACu is a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive first built by EMD and later rebuilt by Norfolk Southern. It is originally an SD90MAC (or well-known as SD9043MAC) {{that has been}} rebuilt to renew its electrical components and replace the cab with the new EMD Phase-II cab {{to comply with the}} most recent safety requirements. These locomotives are similar to the SD70ACe model, but have a different prime mover, which is EMD's 4,300hp (3,210kW) 16-cylinder 710G engine, the same engine used on the SD70MAC. The SD70ACu has three radiator fans, retaining the original configuration of that of SD9043MAC instead of two radiator fans as SD70ACe has. The shape of the rear end of SD70ACu looks like a [...] "Big T", which was the rear end shape of the SD9043MAC, while the rear end shape of SD70ACe is like an [...] "arrow head" [...] (from above). They also have the latest EMD cab that meets current FRA crashworthiness standards. These locomotives also have the Ultra Cab II, locomotive <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> (LSL), and cab signals. 100 of the 110 units Norfolk Southern purchased were originally SD9043MACs previously operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The other 10 units were acquired by a trade with Cit Group for MP15DC's. All NS-owned SD9043MACs are slowly being rebuilt by NS at its shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. As of September 20, 2017, 84 SD70ACU units have been completed and released to active service.|$|E

5000|$|Singapore Police Force land {{division}} officers typically respond to calls in rapid-deployment vehicles {{now known as}} the Fast Response Car (FRC) which are the main police cars in Singapore. Prior to 2000, they were known in public simply as police patrol cars. Fast Response Cars are usually composed of Japanese-made saloon cars. Most commonly seen are the Toyota Corolla Altis and the Hyundai Avante. Around 2000, Nissan Sunny and Subaru Impreza sedans were added to the fleet. Unlike civilian vehicles in Singapore in which <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> (<b>speed</b> governors) are installed to prevent over-speeding, Police Fast Response Cars are able to reach their maximum speed potential without hindrance when the need arises.|$|R
