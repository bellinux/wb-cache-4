50|$|Sulfur is {{input into}} the clinker burning process via raw {{materials}} and fuels. Depending on their origin, the raw materials may contain sulfur bound as sulfide or sulfate. Higher SO2 emissions by rotary kiln systems in the cement industry are often attributable to the sulfides contained in the raw material, which become oxidised to form SO2 at the temperatures between 370 °C and 420 °C prevailing in the kiln preheater. Most of the sulfides are pyrite or marcasite contained in the raw materials. Given the sulfide concentrations found e.g. in German raw material deposits, <b>SO2</b> <b>emission</b> concentrations can total up to 1.2 g/m3 depending on the site location.

Both satellite data products between 2005 and 2013 and Willems badge passive samplers during six two-week exposure periods between August and November, 2013 have been considered in this study. All satellite data products and passive monitoring of these two pollutants in Northeastern B. C. found higher values in Taylor, Fort St. John, and Dawson Creek. This spatial distribution of higher values has resulted from the large gas development activities in these areas. The temporal analysis of satellite NO₂ data revealed higher values near Dawson Creek after 2007 with annual increment of 1. 7 %.

An emission inventory is necessary {{to assess the impact}} of port projects or growth in marine activity as well as to plan mitigation strategies. In this study, a detailed emission inventory of total suspended particulate (TSP) matter, respirable particulate matter (PM(10)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) for a port having operation and construction activities in parallel is compiled. The study has been done for 1 year. Results show that the maximum contribution of emission of air pollutants in the port area was from TSP (68. 5 %) and the minimum was from SO(2) (5. 3 %) to the total pollutants considered in this study. Total TSP emission from all activities of the port was 4, 452 tyr (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) and PM(10) emission was 903 tyr (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) in the year 2006. Re-suspension of dust from paved roads was the major contributor of TSP and PM(10) in the road transport sector. Construction activities of the port had contributed 3. 9 % of TSP and 7. 4 % of PM(10) to total emission of particulate matter. Of the total particulate emissions from various port activities approximately 20 % of TSP could be attributed to PM(10). The sectoral composition indicates that major contribution of <b>SO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> in the port was from maritime sector and major contribution of NO(x) was from road transport sector...|$|E
40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} local government-industry linkages and pollution outcomes in Chinese cities over the period 2003 to 2010. For identification, I rely on the administrative rotation of city mayors, which is determined by political career considerations and retirement age cut-offs but unrelated to their environmental records. These transitions act as plausibly exogenous shocks that disrupt {{the relationship between the}} local government and enterprises at the city level. I employ several statistical models to {{investigate the}} leadership's impacts on environmental outcomes. First, a simple t-test is used to evaluate the change in the pollution index when mayors with particular characteristics enter or leave office. In addition, empirical models are utilized to explore the correlation between mayoral characteristics and changes in city-level pollution. I find correlations between mayoral characteristics and city-level environmental outcomes, focusing specifically on SO₂ emissions, <b>SO₂</b> <b>emission</b> intensities, and end-of-pipe SO₂ removal ratios. Finally, firm-level data allow me to identify the relationship between mayoral characteristics and pollution by enterprises of specific ownership types. Mayors with different characteristics show distinct impacts on city-level pollution. I hypothesize that city leaders who have previous experience in industry pay more attention to local economic growth rather than environmental improvements, resulting in increased SO₂ emissions. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that mayors with industry work background correspond to an increase (decrease) in city-level SO₂ emissions when they enter (leave) office after controlling for city and year fixed effects. Apart from this, I expect that leaders closer to retirement are under less pressure for promotion as they are going to retire soon and due to age cut-offs may not be eligible for higher positions; instead, they may feel less pressure to promote local businesses and pay more attention to environmental management. Evidence shows consistently that tenures of mayors on the verge of retirement are associated with reductions in city-level SO₂ emissions and increases in city-level end-of-pipe SO₂ removal rates. Further investigation shows that mayors realize their environmental goals via enterprises of specific ownership types. I predict that mayors rotated from the central government are not under pressure of promotion and they are adherent to the central policy in reducing <b>SO₂</b> <b>emission</b> intensities. I further predict that mayors from the local administration are expected to enforce the usage of SO₂ removal facilities, particularly among enterprises of low level authorities. Consistent with these hypotheses, results show that mayors with work background in central and local governments are associated with improved environmental outcomes, but through different channels. A central government work background results in intensity reduction, but not necessarily SO₂ emissions; however, local government work background is associated with short-term reductions in SO₂ intensities, possibly due to increases in SO₂ removal ratios, particularly among city SOEs. In addition to the analysis of mayoral characteristics, my research reveals several additional interesting findings. I find that enterprises of lower rank more readily build linkages with local officials not only for economic development but also for environmental management as high-ranking enterprises may face a more stringent monitoring system and are more politically powerful. Implications for environmental policy design in China can be drawn from the results. First, industries are encouraged to behave independently from the government in economic activities as well as policy implementation. Second, environmental performance should be effectively and explicitly included in the evaluation program of officials. Third, government-industry linkages, {{to the extent that they}} undermine the economic and policy system, should be minimized as much as possible. by Xingyao Shen. Thesis: S.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This {{dissertation}} addresses three topics on applied microeconomics. First, {{we investigate}} issues of market power and tax incidence in the U. S. brewing industry. Since alcohol consumption can be addictive, we derive a structural econometric model of addiction from a dynamic oligopoly game. This model identifies {{the degree of}} market power in a dynamic setting and allows us {{to test the hypothesis}} that federal tax incidence differs from state excise tax. Results indicate that beer producers have a modest market power and an increase in federal excise tax is more effective to reduce consumption than state excise taxes. Second, we estimate the effect of sulfur dioxide (S 0 ₂) emissions regulations on the productivity growth and opportunity cost of 261 phase I generating units. The Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1990 required units to reduce emissions to 2. 5 pounds per mmBTU fuel input in the phase I period (1995 - 99). We calculate Luenberger productivity indicators using directional technology distance function for 209 units in 1990 - 1999. There is more potential to reduce pure technical inefficiency since it is the main source of inefficiency in phase I period. Productivity declined, hut it i not significantly different from the productivity growth of pre-phase I. So environmental policy is successful to reduce <b>SO₂</b> <b>emission</b> without sacrificing productivity growth. Opportunity cost declined, but the opportunity cost of scrubber and "other" strategy increase. Third, we estimate the regulatory effect on strategy choice of 257 phase I units using multinomial logit model. We assume behavioral cost is a function of shadow input prices, output, SO₂ emissions and regulatory variables. Results suggest regulation significantly affect choices. Units located in high-sulfur coal states are more likely to choose scrubber, allowance or "other" strategy through shadow capital price effect. Allowance trade and sales restriction negatively affect allowance, scrubber or fuel switch strategy. Non-private units are more likely to choose allowance strategy while private units are likely to choose less uncertain scrubber and fuel switch. Units subject to stringent local regulation are more likely to choose "other" strategy and scrubber and units with substitution/compensation boilers are more likely to choose allowance and "other" strategies...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 The work {{presented}} herein includes {{one main}} body of research on infrasound from Tolbachik Volcano and suggestions for future work on eruption dynamics using infrasound from other volcanoes. We use both regional and local infrasound data to track {{the dynamics of the}} 2012 - 2013 eruption of Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia. Analysis of regional data recorded at the IMS array IS 44 in southern Kamchatka, ~ 384 km from the vent, focuses on the eruption onset in November 2012, while analysis of local data recorded 100 - 950 m from the vent focuses on activity in February and August 2013. Signals recorded from Tolbachik suggest an increase in eruptive intensity occurred from November 28 - 29, 2012. Local infrasound data are characterized primarily by repeated, transient explosion signals indicative of gas slug bursts. Three methods are employed to pick slug burst events in February and August, with all methods proving to be effective. The nature of slug bursts makes a monopole acoustic source model particularly fitting, permitting volume outux and slug radius calculations for individual events. Volume outuxes and slug radii distributions provide three possible explanations for the eruption style of Tolbachik Volcano from mid-February to late August. Cumulative outux for slug bursts (i. e. mass of emissions from individual bursts) derived by infrasound for both February and August range from < 100 to 3000 kg. These values are greater than infrasound-derived emissions calculated at Pacaya Volcano, but less than those calculated at Mt. Erebus Volcano. From this, we determine slug bursts at Tolbachik Volcano in February and August were larger on average than those at Pacaya Volcano in 2010, but smaller on average than those at Mt. Erebus in 2008. Suggestions for future work are also given after analysis of acoustic waveforms from local infrasound data collected at Karymsky and Sakurajima Volcanoes. Activity at both of these volcanoes ranges from short-duration ash-rich explosions to longer-duration ash-rich explosions. A multiparameter dataset collected at Karymsky Volcano in August 2011 includes infrasound data, gas and ash data, and thermal imagery from eruptive events. Content of gas vs. ash, general plume characteristics, plume altitude above the vent, plume temperature, and <b>SO₂</b> <b>emission</b> rates are correlated with acoustic waveform families identifed at each volcano using a cross correlation method. This preliminary analysis shows promise for correlating acoustic waveforms with eruptive activity and can likely be improved with future work...|$|E
40|$|The risk {{associated}} with a power generation system often refers to the contaminants emission from combustion facilities, which could violate environmental standards and affect human health through various exposure pathways. In this research, an integrated risk assessment by stochastic and fuzzy approaches was applied to systematically examine both probabilistic and possibility uncertainties existing in environmental conditions and evaluation criteria within an ambient air quality management system. The contaminant concentrations in ambient air predicted from a numerical simulation model usually contain probabilistic uncertainties due to the variations in modeling input parameters; while the temporal and spatial variations of environment make the consequences of contaminant concentrations violating relevant guidelines and health evaluation criteria to be linked with possibilistic uncertainties due to the vagueness of expert's judgments. This leads to difficulties in direct implementation of the deterministic environmental guidelines because {{of the existence of}} uncertain factors. To help resolve the problem, this study aims at developing a integrated risk assessment system for the management of ambient air quality by stochastic and fuzzy approaches. The objective entails the following tasks: (a) Monte Carlo simulation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) dispersion in the ambient air through a regulatory steady-state plume numerical modeling system AERMOD, to generate cumulative distribution functions for stochastic uncertainties; (b) fuzzy environment and health risk assessment based on stochastic simulation: quantification of environmental guidelines and health criteria using fuzzy membership functions acquired from a questionnaire survey; determination of risk levels by developing a fuzzy rule-based assessment system. The contaminant of interest in this study is SO₂. The environmental quality guideline was divided into three categories: loose, medium and strict. The environmental-guideline-based risk (ER) and health risk (HR) due to SO₂ inhalation were evaluated to obtain the general risk levels through a fuzzy rule base. The ER and HR levels were divided into five categories of low, low-to-medium, medium, medium-to-high and high, respectively. The general risk levels included six categories ranging from low to high. The fuzzy membership functions and the fuzzy rule base were established through a questionnaire survey. Thus the developed approach was able to integrate fuzzy logic, expert experience, and stochastic simulation within a general framework. The robustness of the evaluation results can be enhanced through the effective reflection of the two types of uncertainties as compared with the conventional risk assessment approaches. In order to test the feasibility and effectiveness, the developed model was applied to a thermal power station in Atlantic Canada. The results were analyzed under three scenarios with different environmental quality guidelines, leading to the variations of risk levels (based on different degrees of guideline strictness acquired from questionnaire survey). It is indicated that, the integrated risk assessment can more effectively elucidate the relevant environmental and health risks resulting from <b>SO₂</b> <b>emission.</b> The developed approach can offer a unique tool for quantifying uncertainties in air quality modeling and risk assessment, and also provide realistic support for related decision-making processes...|$|E
