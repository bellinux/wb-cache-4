25|$|Out in {{the real}} world, however, the {{response}} has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I {{got tired of}} doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E

[...] Welles did not attend the ceremony: [...] "I didn't go, because I feel like a damn fool at those things.

2500|$|Born in Nagyvárad (today Oradea, in Austria-Hungary at the time), he was {{the child}} of Jewish parents whose first {{language}} was Hungarian. In later testimonies, he indicated that his ethnic background was not entirely relevant to him: [...] "Germans said I was a Hungarian, Hungarians that I was Romanian, Romanians <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Jewish, but Jews said I was a communist, although I was not yet one at the time".|$|E
2500|$|John Houseman, {{director}} of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed — [...] "I was so employed I forgot how to sleep" [...] — Welles put {{a large share of}} his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. [...] "Roosevelt once <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money into a Washington project," [...] Welles said.|$|E

6000|$|... "Decidedly," [...] I answered, [...] "it {{can talk}} {{as well as}} you or me.

6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} queer, sir," [...] he admitted. [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting on all right because I am {{contented}} and happy. That {{is the chief}} thing after all, isn't it?" ...|$|E

60|$|Let {{it not be}} supposed, {{from what}} <b>I</b> have just <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{detailing}} any mystery, or penning any romance.
