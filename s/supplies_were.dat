5|$|Supplies {{could be}} flown into Wau if fighter cover was available. On 5 September, 12 planeloads of <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> dropped at Kudjeru. To economise on scarce {{transport}} aircraft, air transport was supplemented by an overland route. <b>Supplies</b> <b>were</b> {{shipped to the}} mouth of the Lakekamu in luggers, transported up the river to Bulldog in launches or powered dugout canoes, and then carried over the Bulldog Track by native carriers.|$|E
5|$|After direct American {{intervention}} in 1965, the increased presence of U.S. naval vessels in coastal waters Operation Market Time nullified the seaborne route. The alternative devised by Hanoi was ingenious. Following on the agreement between Sihanouk and the Chinese, an arrangement was also struck between the prince and the DRV government. In October military <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> sailed directly from North Vietnam on communist-flagged (especially of the Eastern bloc) ships to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville, where that nation's neutrality guaranteed their delivery. The <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> unloaded and {{then transferred to}} trucks which transported them to the frontier zones that served as PAVN/NLF Base Areas. These Base Areas also served as sanctuaries for PAVN/NLF troops, who simply crossed the border from South Vietnam and then rested, reinforced, and refitted for their next campaign in safety. None of {{this could have been}} accomplished without the acquiescence of Sihanouk.|$|E
5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day. <b>Supplies</b> <b>were</b> also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were {{allowed to return to}} their homes two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E

50|$|A power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> an {{electronic}} device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load. The primary {{function of a}} power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> to convert one form of electrical energy to another. As a result, power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} electric power converters. Some power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> discrete, stand-alone devices, whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices.|$|R
50|$|Power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> {{packaged}} {{in different ways}} and classified accordingly. A bench power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> a stand-alone desktop unit used in applications such as circuit test and development. Open frame power supplies have only a partial mechanical enclosure, sometimes consisting of only a mounting base; these are typically built into machinery or other equipment. Rack mount power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> designed to be secured into standard electronic equipment racks. An integrated power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> one that shares a common printed circuit board with its load.|$|R
5|$|To {{force the}} Ojibwa to comply, the {{subagent}} Watrous {{announced he would}} pay future annuities only at Sandy Lake, Minnesota instead of La Pointe, {{where they had been}} paid previously. This change resulted in the Sandy Lake Tragedy, when hundreds of Ojibwas starved or died of exposure in Minnesota and on the journey home because the promised annuity <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> late, contaminated or inadequate.|$|E
5|$|While {{the real}} {{supplies}} {{in the north}} were carefully hidden, matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south.

5|$|A {{significant}} benefit of Operation Dragoon {{was the use}} of the port facilities in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed almost to a halt in September due to a critical lack of supplies. The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, over 24,000people {{evacuated}} Philippines's northeastern {{province of}} Aurora. Many radio stations, typically which close during Easter, remained operational to broadcast the storm. Officials issued storm warnings, {{and the military}} was on alert. Beaches were closed, boats were ordered to remain at port, and 10flights were canceled. The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that ₱300.9million (US$6.8million) worth of funds and <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> available for possible relief efforts. Approximately 28,000family food packs were prepositioned in warehouses across Luzon.|$|E

40|$|ASEE 2007 Regular power <b>supply</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{used for}} some special {{applications}} such as discharging plasma generator, air purification system, medical discharging equipment, etc. Instead, a special low-power high-voltage pulsed power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> required. In this paper, the design and simulation of a separate excited pulse power <b>supply</b> <b>are</b> proposed. The power supply can produce high-voltage small-current pulses adaptive to different loads. The working principle of the power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> analyzed. A comparison between this power supply and other pulsed power supply based on capacitance energy storage is discussed. The circuit implementation of power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> proposed. The key component for the power supply, pulse transformer, {{as well as other}} components is studied in detail. Based on the analysis, an optimized design of the power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Computer simulation is used to verify the performance of the designed power supply, such as the output characteristics under different load resistances, the pulse frequency and the duty ratio. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed power supply. Some possible performance improvements on the power <b>supply</b> <b>are</b> also suggested. The designed power supply can satisfy the requirements for commercial {{applications such as}} plasma generation and air purification system...|$|R
