5|$|There was major {{restoration}} {{work done}} to the church in 1886, and {{a large amount of}} the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. During the restoration the east window was also replaced; it now depicts the <b>stylised</b> <b>form</b> of Saint Oswald, flanked on either side by Saint Aidan, and Saint Cuthbert, both Christian saints of the same era, and who helped him in missionary work in the Kingdom of Northumbria. These windows are directly opposite the western window, above the font {{at the other end of}} the church, which depicts the queen at the time, Queen Victoria. Further modern additions to the church can be seen in the bell turret and organ chamber, as well as the south porch, which is currently the sole congregational entrance to the church. The church uses an electric organ during services.|$|E
5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a <b>stylised</b> <b>form</b> of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E

500|$|The {{tradition}} evolved {{differently in}} the Ottoman world, where smaller single-roomed türbe typically stand {{on the grounds of}} mosque complexes, often built by the deceased. [...] The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone turban, which is also traditional at the top of ordinary Turkish gravestones (usually in <b>stylised</b> <b>form).</b> Two of the most famous are in the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul; the Yeşil Türbe ("Green Tomb") of 1421 is an unusually large example in Bursa, and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly colored tiles.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the oldest}} forms of Māori art are rock {{painting}}s, in 'classical' Māori art, painting {{was not an}} important art form. It was mainly used as a minor decoration in meeting houses, in <b>stylised</b> <b>forms</b> such as the koru. Europeans introduced Māori to their more figurative style of art, and in the 19th century less stylised depictions of people and plants began {{to appear on the}} walls of meeting houses in place of traditional carvings and woven panels. The introduction of European paints also allowed traditional painting to flourish, as brighter and more distinct colours could be produced.|$|R
50|$|The shrine at Naikū is {{constructed}} of Japanese cypress. Built on pillars set {{directly in the}} ground, the shrine building measures 10.9 by 5.5 meters and includes a raised floor, verandas {{all the way around}} the building and a staircase leading to a single central doorway. The roof is made of thatched reed with ten billets (katsuogi) located on the ridge of the roof, the bargeboards of which project beyond the roof to form the distinctive forked finials (chigi) at the ends of the ridge. The roof ridge is supported by two free-standing columns called the munamochi-bashira. The katsuogi, chigi and munamochi-bashira are <b>stylised</b> <b>forms</b> of older storehouse building techniques that pre-date the introduction of Buddhist architecture in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|The Dream is {{the largest}} of the jungle paintings, {{measuring}} 6' 8½" [...] x 9' 9½" [...] (204.5 x 298.5 cm). It features an almost surreal portrait of Yadwigha (Jadwiga), Rousseau's Polish mistress from his youth, lying naked on a divan {{to the left of the}} painting, gazing over a landscape of lush jungle foliage, including lotus flowers, and animals including birds, monkeys, an elephant, a lion and lioness, and a snake. The <b>stylised</b> <b>forms</b> of the jungle plants are based on Rousseau's observations at the Paris Museum of Natural History and its Jardin des Plantes. The nude's left arm reaches towards the lions and a black snake charmer who faces the viewer playing his flute, barely visible in the gloom of the jungle under the dim light of the full moon. A pink-bellied snake slithers through the undergrowth, its sinuous form reflecting the curves of the woman's hips and leg.|$|R

5000|$|Born in Saint-Brieuc, Côtes d'Armor, Brittany, Renaud was {{associated}} with the revival of Breton nationalist ideals in art in the early 20th century. His earlier works are in a style close to Art Nouveau, influenced by the work of his tutor Jean Boucher. He later moved towards more simplified and <b>stylised</b> <b>forms</b> influenced by Breton traditions, joining the nationalist art movement Seiz Breur. [...] Retaining a studio in Paris, he also lived for part of the year in his native Brittany, where he used local Kersanton granite for his most notable works, especially the Pleureuse de Tréguier (1922), the town of Tréguier's memorial to the dead of World War I. It depicts a local woman, Marie-Louise Le Put, who had lost her husband in the war and had also lost their three young children. She is shown seated, wrapped in a mourning gown. The memorial is notable for its stylised grandeur and solidity, symbolising the stoicism and resilience of local people. The art historian Malvina Hoffman writes that its [...] "massive design commands reverence and respect".|$|R

50|$|Art Nouveau in {{architecture}} and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival {{styles of the}} 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' {{some of the more}} abstract elements of Rococo style, such as flame and shell textures, they also advocated the use of very <b>stylised</b> organic <b>forms</b> as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use seaweed, grasses, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century auricular style, best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.|$|R
40|$|Judith Butler's {{philosophical}} {{writings on}} identity have provided inspiring, if occasionally 'troubling', ways of rethinking gender. A key contribution {{has been the}} challenge to conventional social constructionist ideas and thinking on subjectivity. In developing a paradigm of performativity, Butler's work takes us beyond the territory of identity secured in much previous feminist poststructuralist debate. She does so in part by providing an ontological critique - a type of 'queering' if you will - of such seemingly knowable categories as 'man', 'woman', 'girl' or 'boy'. In addressing the radical interruption in identity theorising offered in Butler's writing, we consider the arresting claim that identity {{is a type of}} 'doing' that is only made manifest at the point of action. To explore the theoretical, empirical and political issues at stake, we draw especially upon Butler's writings on identity and ally this to some of our own ethnographic research on gender, youth and schooling. Here, we explore young people's compulsion to enact and display <b>stylised</b> <b>forms</b> of gender embodiment, and the spectacular enactments of transgression that can elicit a practice of gender dissimulation. Our focus is upon the subversion, regulation and embodiment of gender identities and its implications for the sociology of education...|$|R
