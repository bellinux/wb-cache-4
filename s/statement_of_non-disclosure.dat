40|$|Information {{exchange}} between patients and health professionals {{is fundamental to}} achieving patient participation in decision-making and shared decision-making is said to require the exchange of "all information relevant to decision-making". This paper reports on a qualitative investigation of instances in which information that was potentially relevant to decision-making was not exchanged in consultations. Consultations from 5 diverse clinical areas in the UK were video-recorded and the health professionals and patients involved were interviewed separately before and after their consultations. This analysis is based on cases involving 20 patients. It draws on data from their 26 -recorded consultations and from the 137 associated interviews. Several strategies were used to identify instances in which patients and/or health professionals did not disclose information that was potentially relevant to decision-making. Analysis focussed on the types of information not disclosed, the reasons that health professionals and patients gave for non-disclosure, and the apparent or potential significance <b>of</b> the <b>non-disclosure.</b> We identified 34 instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information relating to the patient's problem and 52 instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information relating to treatment or management options. The types of information not disclosed were diverse and the reasons given for non-disclosure varied. Some, but not all, instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> had negative implications {{for the quality of}} decision-making and/or the patient's healthcare experience. Our findings have implications for future attempts to examine information exchange in consultations [...] whether for research or for professional assessment purposes. In particular, they highlight the importance of appraising instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information in context and of recognising the limitations of approaches that rely on single consultations and/or single perspectives for assessments of information exchange.

This longitudinal cohort study recruited 1709 pregnant women living with HIV who attended three of the largest maternity centres in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, for delivery between September 2015 and May 2016. Relevant items on demographics, serostatus awareness, disclosure to sex partners and family members, and lifestyle behaviours were obtained using structured interviews. Age-stratified binary logistic regression models {{were used to determine}} the significant correlates <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> among the participants. A higher rate <b>of</b> HIV serostatus <b>non-disclosure</b> to sex partners (25. 6 %) in comparison to family members (20 %) was reported by the participants. Younger age, not living with partners and alcohol use were significantly associated with <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus to sex partners. <b>Non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus to sex partners was significantly (p< 0. 05) associated with poor adherence to the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), failure to keep clinic appointments and high viral load at the delivery of the baby. Perceived fear of intimate partner violence, fear of rejection, guilt of not disclosing {{at the onset of the}} relationship, sex partner's <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus, and guilt of unfaithfulness were some of the reasons for <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus to sex partners. <b>Non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus is a public health concern with serious implications for both mother-to-child transmission, as well as horizontal transmission, in our setting.

40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{presented}} that examine disclosure of sensitive information and personalization in Internet-based surveys. In the first study, {{the impact of}} a personalized salutation on two forms <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> to a sensitive personal question (salary level) is tested. The results revealed that a personalized salutation tends to increase levels <b>of</b> active <b>non-disclosure</b> (measured through use of an I prefer not to answer option), but not passive non-disclosure (where the respondent selects no option). In the second study, participants are directed to the study via either a personalized URL (which incorporated an encoded identifier not obvious as such to the responder) or via a secure log-on page that required the user to type in identifying information. Non-disclosure to a sensitive question (salary) was significantly higher when participants went through a log-on procedure. We suggest that this pattern <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> to sensitive questions reflects increases in identifiability when a personalized salutation or logon procedure is used. We further suggest that the provision <b>of</b> an active <b>non-disclosure</b> option to a sensitive question is particularly appropriate in contexts in which anonymity may be compromised, since it enables participants to both protect their privacy and respond appropriately to the survey...|$|R

40|$|Objective: One of the {{indicators}} {{critical to the}} success of violence reduction programmes among female sex workers (FSWs) is the pattern of disclosure of violence. This study examines the rate <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> violence among FSWs in India by perpetrators of violence and programme exposure. Methods: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study conducted among FSWs in 2009 across four states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The analytical sample included 1341 FSWs who experienced physical violence in past six months. Multilevel logistic regression stratified by state was conducted to examine predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure.</b> Results: About 54 % of FSWs did not disclose their experience of violence to anyone with considerable variations in the pattern of disclosure across states. Another 36 % of FSWs shared the experience with NGO worker/peer. Compared to violence perpetrated by paying partners/stranger, that by non-paying partner were twice more likely to report non-disclosure (53 % vs. 68 %, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1. 8, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 1. 3 – 2. 4). Similarly, FSWs who were not registered with an NGO/sex worker collective were 40 % more likely to report <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> violence against those registered (58 % vs. 53 %, AOR: 1. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 1. 9).
