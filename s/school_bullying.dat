5|$|Graduados had scripts {{written by}} Ernesto Korovsky, Silvina Frejdkes and Alejandro Quesada. Although it was {{primarily}} a comedy, it also had a dramatic approach to LGBT rights and <b>school</b> <b>bullying.</b> In Clarín, Adriana Schettini praised its transitions from dramatic to comic scenes, its acting and scripts and its faithfulness to the characters' profiles.|$|E
5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because it was something she had not done before. Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of <b>school</b> <b>bullying</b> to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E
5|$|The series {{includes}} a homosexual character, Guillermo Almada (Juan Gil Navarro), {{who came out}} in the early episodes and later married his partner in a ceremony featuring guest appearances by Evangelina Salazar and Luis Brandoni. This was the first fictional same-sex marriage on Argentine television since it was legalized in 2010, reflected the growing acceptance of sexual freedom in Argentina. Another character, Patricia Longo, was an obese girl who was a victim of <b>school</b> <b>bullying.</b> Isabel Macedo had to be heavily made up to appear obese for the flashbacks. Patricia was initially the telenovela's villain, with the bullying her motivation for inflicting revenge on her former classmates.

5|$|Nicholas Tucker {{described}} the early Harry Potter books as {{looking back to}} Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses {{with which they were}} associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and <b>school</b> <b>bullying.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first {{community-based}} LGBTIQ {{youth groups}} {{in the fields of}} social services were established in the United States in the late 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s a sexual risk discourse dominated LGBTIQ issues in education policy in Victoria. Addressing <b>school</b> <b>bullying</b> with practical steps is a worldwide trend. The Safe Schools Coalition Australia provides resources such as this program as part of The National Safe Schools Framework which deals with the wider causes of bullying.|$|E

25|$|Workplace bullying, like {{childhood}} bullying, is {{the tendency}} of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of aggression is particularly difficult because unlike the typical forms of <b>school</b> <b>bullying,</b> workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organisation and their society. Bullying in the workplace is {{in the majority of}} cases reported as having been perpetrated by a manager and takes a wide variety of forms.|$|E
500|$|Graduados (...) is a 2012 Argentine telenovela {{which was}} {{broadcast}} by Telefe from March 12 to December 19. The plot concerns {{a group of}} people who graduated from high school in 1989 and reunite twenty years later. The main character, Andrés Goddzer (Daniel Hendler), discovers that María Laura Falsini (Nancy Dupláa) was pregnant in 1989 and married Pablo Catáneo (Luciano Cáceres), who thought that he was the child's father. The resulting parental dispute, the love triangle of the main characters and 1980s nostalgia are frequent plot elements, and story arcs related to <b>school</b> <b>bullying</b> and LGBT rights are also featured. The frequent flashbacks of the characters to their high-school days use the same actors, playing teenagers.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the Ombudsman {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} <b>school</b> <b>bullying</b> and violence after serious incidents at Hutt Valley High School in Lower Hutt, which included students being dragged to the ground, [...] "removing their pants and violating them with screwdrivers, pens, scissors, branches, drills and pencils," [...] a student [...] "being beaten unconscious and a student being burnt with a lighter". The Ombudsman's report recommended schools' guidelines be amended to make anti-bullying programmes compulsory in schools. Post Primary Teachers' Association president Robin Duff said the report illustrated a systemic failure by the Ministry of Education to help schools deal with bullying.|$|E

2500|$|Bullys {{title and}} {{gameplay}} features inspired controversy among {{parents and educators}} who noted the adult content in previous Rockstar games, including the [...] Hot Coffee minigame controversy. Groups such as Bullying Online and Peaceaholics criticized the game for glorifying or trivializing <b>school</b> <b>bullying,</b> although they raised their objections before the game was released to the public. The player may also choose to kiss select girls and a boy in the game, which the ESRB was aware of when rating the product. Classification boards generally restricted Bully to a teenage audience: the United-States based Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) classified {{the game with a}} T rating, the British Board of Film Classification gave it a 15 rating, the Australian Classification Board rated it M, and the New Zealand OFLC restricted it to persons 13 years of age and over.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his mother}} left for good, Slater's {{education}} standards slipped, with sport becoming the [...] "only thing [...] {{could focus on}} properly". <b>School</b> <b>bullying</b> accentuated his academic difficulties in Years 9 and 10, and he once ran home after it was suggested among fellow pupils that some bullies [...] "were planning to get [...] after school". As cricket and hockey began to overlap in his early teenage years, Slater slowly turned {{the majority of his}} sporting appetite towards cricket. He joined an inner-western Sydney Under–16 side over the Christmas holidays. Despite not being fond of Sydney, Slater knew {{that he would have to}} move to the metropolis if he wanted to further develop his cricketing career. After topping the batting averages in the Under–17s in the following season, Slater was subsequently chosen as captain for the New South Wales Under—16 team. The carnival was not a personal success for the captain; however, he recalls that his team performed [...] "well".|$|E
