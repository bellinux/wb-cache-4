25|$|The album's {{recording}} was a {{much different}} affair from the first two—likely because of the band's constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country {{of the first two}} albums, especially Faithless, was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop <b>sound,</b> <b>very</b> similar to Wilco's 1999 album Summerteeth. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including The Replacements' Tommy Stinson and The Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha.|$|E
25|$|The baroque {{interior}} of the Lady Chapel (rebuilt by Servandoni in 1729) was designed by Charles de Wailly in 1774, after the chapel was badly damaged by a fire which destroyed the nearby Foire Saint-Germain in 1762. The dome, lit by natural light from hidden windows devised by de Wailly, contains a fresco by François Lemoyne depicting the Assumption of Mary, which dates from 1734, {{although it has been}} restored several times since then. De Wailly also designed the pulpit (in the nave), completed in 1788. The oak canopy broadcasts <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> well and it was from here that the parish priest of Saint-Sulpice declared his refusal to accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Revolutionary orators used it later also.|$|E

25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky {{said about}} the texts of his Symphony of Psalms that [...] "it is not a symphony in which I have {{included}} Psalms to be sung. On the contrary, it is the singing of the Psalms that I am symphonizing". This decision was as much musical as it was textual. Stravinsky's counterpoint required several musical voices to function simultaneously, independent melodically and rhythmically, yet interdependent harmonically. They would <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> different when heard separately, yet harmonious when heard together. To facilitate maximum clarity in this interplay of voices, Stravinsky used [...] "a choral and instrumental ensemble {{in which the two}} elements should be on an equal footing, neither of them outweighing the other".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Justin Meldal-Johnsen, longtime bassist for Beck and Nine Inch Nails, who has previously produced records for M83 and Neon Trees. In an interview with Electronic Musician, Meldal-Johnsen stated he wanted [...] "the album to <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> visceral {{and a little bit}} less locked down and computerized, more 1981 than 2012, with a nod to 2016." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, Taylor York stated [...] "I don't think we've ever been so proud and satisfied with something we've done." [...] On June 29, 2012, the band had confirmed that former Nine Inch Nails and current Angels & Airwaves drummer Ilan Rubin would be recording drums for the album.|$|E
5000|$|In a very ironic paradox, {{black metal}} and crust punk have {{recently}} started to embrace one another.

500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|... "Supergirl" [...] {{received}} {{average to}} mixed reception from contemporary critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic said, [...] "That feeling of familiarity {{extends to the}} songs that haven't appeared anywhere else. Whether it's the happy side of Hannah ('It's All Right Here,' 'Supergirl') [...] they <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> much like what came before them." [...] Warren Truitt of About.com agreed but stated, [...] " [...] {{may be a little}} cookie-cutter, but at least the songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly compared the song's style to that of Kelly Clarkson. While reviewing a concert before the release of the soundtrack, Peter Larsen of The Orange County Register predicted it would be released as a single and become popular with children, yet [...] "saturate [...] ears for a month or two".|$|E
500|$|The renewed {{interest}} in Axelrod's work prompted Stateside Records to reissue Song of Innocence in 2000. Now wrote that after sounding odd during the 1960s, the songs had become [...] "a sampler's dream come true– who knew?" [...] David Keenan of The Wire attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy with producers such as DJ Premier and DJ Shadow to Palmer, [...] "the original badass drummer [...] played {{on all of these}} tracks". He facetiously critiqued that the album's songs [...] "may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> modern." [...] Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey felt Axelrod's first two records were [...] "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having [...] "literally been a rap producer's delight for years". In a 2013 list for Complex, DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named [...] "Holy Thursday" [...] the greatest hip hop sample of all time.|$|E

500|$|In writing Young Modern, Johns {{tried to}} make the music <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, {{sometimes}} as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning [...] "Straight Lines". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but [...] "still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{music critic}} Kelefa Sanneh commented saying [...] "If anything, Discipline {{may be too}} subtle: a pretty, smartly {{produced}} collection that sometimes sounds like background music." [...] Michael Arceneaux of PopMatters called the album the [...] "same old from her", adding [...] "These days her look and sound seem {{nothing more than a}} continuation of 2001's All for You." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watson wrote that Jackson's lyrics [...] "sound like the cheesy text messages of a lovesick adolescent" [...] and gave a C- rating. Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that [...] "Jackson's attempts to play the uber-nympho are beginning to <b>sound</b> <b>very,</b> very desperate" [...] with [...] "embarrassingly lewd lyrics" [...] and gave the record 2 out of 5 stars. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described most tracks on the album as either boring or unmemorable. Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] score as he had done with her previous album 20 Y.O. (...) [...]|$|E

[...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E

500|$|Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{referred}} {{the album}} to as a [...] "smart, bristly, busy sophomore disc", writing that [...] "Too {{much of it}} apes Avril Lavigne, with the standard shouted choruses and hiccupped verses that are beginning to <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> '03." [...] Stewart named [...] "Every Time You Lie" [...] and [...] "World of Chances" [...] as [...] "direction signs pointing to a much more interesting career". Awarding the album five out of ten points, Cody Miller of PopMatters was mixed in his review and said that Lovato [...] "desperately wants to be Kelly Clarkson", writing [...] "Lovato can't work miracles with mediocre pop songs like Clarkson, but the young singer-actress has a bigger range than any of her contemporaries, and {{a better sense of}} on-record charisma." [...] Miller was mixed regarding album's content, saying that [...] "there's nothing that really separates the tracks from each other. Most of the album's up-tempo numbers just blend together." [...] He concluded his review: [...] "Here We Go Again isn't perfect by any means, and when compared to someone like Clarkson or Pink, it's obvious the young singer has lots of work ahead of her if she wants to truly cement herself as a serious, viable pop/rock artist outside of the Disney mold. But given the context, Here We Go Again is certainly enjoyable to some scale." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of five, saying [...] "Lovato has chops and spunk akin to a fellow Texas pop singer, though her voice doesn't churn with Kelly Clarkson's gutsy heart yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "lo-fi" [...] Mwng was {{recorded}} over {{two weeks in}} late 1999, and—in contrast with the [...] "excessive expense" [...] of Guerilla—cost just [...] to make. The band chose Gorwel Owen as co-producer, having previously worked with him on their first two albums, 1996's Fuzzy Logic and 1997's Radiator. The majority of Mwng {{was recorded}} [...] with Owen at Ofn Studios in Llanfaelog, Wales. According to Rhys, the band had to play in separate rooms to avoid the sound of one instrument bleeding onto the track of another during recording due to Ofn's small size. [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] and [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] were recorded at Famous Studios in Cardiff, and were engineered by Greg Haver, while [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] was recorded at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, and was engineered by Michael Brennan, Jr. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] was recorded and engineered by keyboardist Cian Ciaran in his living room. Overdubs for all songs were added at Ofn with Owen, who also mixed the album at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. Songs were recorded almost entirely live, with the band wanting to make a [...] "really immediate record" [...] as a reaction against the drawn out recording sessions for Guerilla and 1997's Radiator, which had taken several months and proved frustrating for the group. The version of [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] that appears on the album is the original demo, with [...] Rhys on drums. The band felt that, although the demo did not <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> professional, there was a warmth to it that {{would be impossible to}} recreate were the group to record the song again. The album's title translates into English as [...] "Mane". According to Rhys, the band did not have the mane of a particular animal in mind, but felt it could be [...] "an extension of a Super Furry Animal".|$|E

500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes it, just for fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where she would say that her future husband [...] "is out there somewhere, chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not {{a lot of people think}} about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E
