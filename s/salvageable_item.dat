50|$|The ship {{remained}} hard aground and upright {{for four}} years. During this period, she was paid off and stripped of all <b>salvageable</b> <b>items</b> and was then destroyed with explosives by HMS Durban in September 1926.|$|R
50|$|Then {{the weather}} turned {{for the worse}} and the {{abandoned}} ship broke into two pieces on 12 October 1883 due to the pounding waves building up over the Sandbank and eventually the hull disappeared under the sea. Any <b>salvageable</b> <b>items</b> were sold by public auction on 29 October 1883. Some remains of the wreck are still there, located in 5 meters deep water and it sometimes visited by local divers.|$|R
5000|$|Kara sketched all the {{specimens}}, {{animals and}} birds within the park. Photography {{was also used}} in latter years to record the specimens in their natural state. Kara had the films made into [...] "slides" [...] which was {{state of the art}} at the time. All of Kara's specimens and photographic libraries were handed over to Parks Victoria who have since restored, converted to digital and archived all <b>salvageable</b> <b>items.</b>|$|R
50|$|On December 15, 2006, Six Flags {{confirmed}} {{that it was}} removing Batman: The Ride for refurbishment and relocation to a new park, as it {{was considered to be}} the only salvageable ride. Batman: The Ride was reassembled at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio and opened under the new name Goliath on April 18, 2008. In addition to Batman: The Ride, Six Flags removed shade coverings, ride parts, lights, security cameras, planting structures and various other <b>salvageable</b> <b>items.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, {{the city}} sold the Aud to the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation for $1 in hopes {{it would lead}} to {{asbestos}} removal and demolition. All <b>salvageable</b> <b>items</b> were to be removed and sold or stored. The sales of these artifacts, especially of seats, would help pay for a memorial to the Aud. The salvaged items include art deco flag holders, limestone eagles, a time capsule {{as well as a number}} of blue and orange level seats, which were sold at auction.|$|R
25|$|The 13 {{lifeboats}} retrieved by Carpathia {{were taken}} to the White Star Line's Pier 59 in New York, where souvenir hunters soon stripped them of much of their equipment. The Titanic nameplates were removed by White Star Line workmen and the boats were inventoried by the C.M. Lane Lifeboat Co. of Brooklyn. They were assessed for salvage at a collective value of £930 ($4,972) as the only <b>salvageable</b> <b>items</b> recovered from Titanic, they may have been taken back to England aboard Olympic, which left New York on 23 May 1912, before either being destroyed or quietly redistributed to other vessels.|$|R
50|$|The {{flooded area}} on the city's east side was reopened on July 11 for {{residents}} and business owners to begin assessing damage and to retrieve <b>salvageable</b> <b>items.</b> In order {{to focus on the}} post-flood recovery and clean-up, the city and state cancelled the 2007 Inter-State Fair & Rodeo. The ongoing flood recovery included a wholesale environmental remediation of the flood-affected eastern portion of the city, which continued through late 2008 to early 2009. Many of the flood-damaged homes were purchased by Coffeyville Resources LLC as a part of its effort to compensate the homeowners affected by the oil spill.|$|R

25|$|Ocelot was {{involved}} in a series of collisions with other vessels; the barge YF-1079, the stores ship , the landing ship medium LSM-39, and the victory ship SS Pratt Victory, before she attempted to move into the safer waters of the open sea. However she grounded on a reef, where she was then struck by the merchant ship SS Victor H. Oulanhan. Rapidly taking on water, the crew formed a bucket line, and bailed continuously for six hours. After attempts by tugs to refloat her failed, the ship was abandoned. She was eventually refloated, but on 9 October during Typhoon Louise she was struck by the repair ship , which severed her stern section. Stripped of <b>salvageable</b> <b>items,</b> she was abandoned on 29 October, decommissioned on 6 December, and was struck from the Navy List on 3 January 1946.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the items}} found in the Collyer brothers' house were deemed {{worthless}} and were disposed of. The <b>salvageable</b> <b>items</b> fetched less than $2,000 at auction; the cumulative estate of the Collyer brothers was valued at $91,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ), of which $20,000 worth was personal property (jewelry, cash, securities, and the like). Fifty-six people, mostly first and second cousins, made claims for the estate. A Pittsburgh woman named Ella Davis {{claimed to be the}} long lost sister of the Collyers'. Davis' claim was dismissed after she failed to provide a birth certificate to prove her identity (years earlier, Davis claimed she was the widow of Peter Liebach, another wealthy recluse, from Pittsburgh, who was found murdered in 1937). In October 1952, the New York County court decided that twenty-three of the claimants were to split the estate equally.|$|R
5000|$|Managua’s {{population}} has considerably expanded since 1995 (Bergin, 2008). Consequently, garbage production has also increased. Managua produces over 1,200 tons of garbage daily (Grisby Vergara, 2008). There are big trucks full of garbage that arrive in La Chureca {{every day at}} all hours of the day. There are approximately 3000 individuals who make their living working in La Chureca (Grisby Vergara, 2008). Of these, approximately 115-180 families live within La Chureca. The individuals who work and live in La Chureca are named ‘churequeros’ and they are some of the poorest people of the country. Of these, more than 50% are children under the age of 18 (Cuadra, &Linderholm, & Athanasiadou, & Jakobsson, 2006). Children are most often involved in more than one activity, most frequently: handling glass, metals, and plastics (ibid). Working in La Chureca is considered one of the worst forms of child labour in Nicaragua (ibid). Some of the most common activities of La Chureca workers of all ages include: recollection, classification, selling, storing, and cleaning of recyclable waste (Cuadra, &Linderholm, &Athanasiadou, & Jakobsson; 2006). Over the years, ‘churequeros’ have figured out ways of organizing the trash and making small profits off salvageable and recyclable materials (Bergin, 2008). These individuals swarm all around La Chureca with makeshift spears which are used to pick through the garbage which is then sorted and sold to suppliers of recyclable materials. Workers in La Chureca are self- employed individuals and, or families who collect <b>salvageable</b> <b>items</b> such as plastic, aluminum cans, and scrap metals such as copper and iron (Bergin, 2008). These workers are highly organized labour chains. That is, if one person collects glass, the other will clean it, another will crush and recycle it and another will sell it to a collector who will then sell it to different companies (Grisby Vergara, 2008). It is clear that the existing piles of garbage would be much larger if it were not for the individuals that work there (Grisby Vergara, 2008). La Chureca produces approximately US$20 million a year in marketable garbage and Churequeros earn between US$1.50 and US$2 a day (Bergin, 2008). Materials are often sold by the pound. For example, eleven pounds of aluminum equates to roughly twelve córdoba profits (US$ 0.63) for garbage sorters (Bergin, 2008). [...] Living and working in La Chureca brings terrible health hazards to churequeros. Often, families need to scavenge food from the waste as they lack the means necessary to purchase food. The food that is scavenged is mostly from restaurants dumping including: meat, dairy products, vegetable, and fruits (Bergin, 2008). The consumption of this rotting food frequently leads to intestinal and digestive problems for Churequeros (ibid). Because there used to be a slaughterhouse across the lagoon which merges with La Chureca, remains of farm animals such as bones, cow heads, and blood; pollute the land, water, and air in and surrounding La Chureca. In addition, much of the garbage from La Chureca often spills over into Lake Managua, affecting its natural resources. Fish from Lake Managua are an important part of the diet of the population living in poverty at lakeshore yet, there have been high levels of mercury found in native fish species in Lake Managua (Cuadra, &Linderholm, & Athanasiadou, & Jakobsson, 2006; Mc Crary, Castro, McKaye, 2005).|$|R
50|$|The {{wreckage}} {{can also}} be hazardous. Bomb fragments and other wreckage can cause lacerations and puncture wounds if not removed before the land is put to other uses, such as farming or recreation, {{or if it is}} handled by curious trespassers or untrained salvagers. The fragments, wreckage and residues may also contain toxic substances or be radioactive. Exposure can come from direct contact, but it can also come offsite by the air, from surface or groundwater contamination or by the uptake of toxins by plants and animals consumed by humans. Which route of exposure is most likely depends on the type of substances present, the proximity of inhabited areas and whether unauthorized personnel trespass on the range. Developing nations and those in an economic crisis often have a haphazard salvage industry involved in legal and illegal activities. In these areas, bombing ranges are scoured for <b>salvageable</b> metals. Unusual <b>items,</b> sometimes the most dangerous, are made into trinkets. The danger is greatly increased when the materials are melted down or worked by hand, exposing workers to toxic fumes or radiation.|$|R
40|$|During a {{hurricane}} or flood, many hospitals may sufferwater and wind damage; somemay have standing water {{for an extended}} period of time due to flooding. Building structures, equipment, and supplies may be heavily contaminated with microorganisms such as mold, mold spores, and bacteria. Before reopening, hospitals must be evaluated to determine: 1) if the facility is damaged beyond repair and must be condemned; or 2) if the extent of the damage is such that the facility may be restored, repaired, and reopened. Once the decision is made to repair and reoccupy the building(s), damaged or contaminated materials and structures must be removed and discarded, while <b>salvageable</b> materials and <b>items</b> can be thoroughly dried, repaired, cleaned, and restored to safe function. The restoration of a hospital to full function is a complex, multidisciplinary task, and the assistance of engineers, professionals trained in building remediation, and manufacturers of healthcare equipment will likely be necessary to complete the job. Once the work to restore the building is finished and the building is returned to service, periodic inspection of the remediated structure will be necessary to identify mold growth and initiate removal and control measures. Clinical- and laboratory-based surveillance in the healthcare facility for unusual clusters of infectious diseases due to pathogens in the environment will also be essential. The following information is intended to assist healthcare facilities with the tasks involved during clean-up and reopening. Links to electronic copies of recommendations from Governmental agencies and professional associations are provided. Implementation of these measures is meant to be followed in accordance with state and local certification requirements, completion of building and fire inspections, and other relevant state or local regulations. reopen_healthfacilities. pd...|$|R
