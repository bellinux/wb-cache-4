5|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, when Earl Páll herd of Earl Rögnvaldr's {{arrival in}} Shetland, he held council {{and decided to}} {{immediately}} gather forces and attack Earl Rögnvaldr before he could be reinforced by the incoming men he knew were coming from the Suðreyjar. That night Earl Páll was joined by five chieftains, with four ships—this brings his total forces to five ships. The fleet sailed to Rousay, where they arrive at sunset. During the night the force is further <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> arriving men. In the morning, as the fleet is about to set out for Shetland to meet Earl Rögnvaldr, about ten or twelve ships were spotted coming from the Pentland Firth. Earl Páll and his men were certain these ships were those of Frakökk and Ölvir; in consequence, the earl ordered the fleet to intercept. The saga states that when Ölvir's ships were east of Tankerness, they then sailed west from Mulls Head, Deerness. By this time, Earl Páll was further <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> a chieftain from Tankerness. The earl then ordered his ships to be bound together, and for a bondi to gather stones for the upcoming battle. When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Ölvir's forces made their attack.|$|E

40|$|A physically-based {{numerical}} model is developed {{to predict the}} microstructural evolution and strengthening in Al Cu Mg alloys during isothermal treatments. The modelling of the formation kinetics of the precipitates {{is based on the}} Kampmann and Wagner model. The <b>strengthening</b> <b>by</b> the shearable Cu:Mg co clusters is modelled on the basis of modulus strengthening mechanism and the <b>strengthening</b> <b>by</b> the non-shearable S phase precipitates is based on the Orowan looping mechanism. The model predictions are verified by comparing with the strength and differential isothermal calorimetery data on 2024 -T 351 aluminium alloys. The microstructural development and strength predictions of the model are generally in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to predict the}} precipitation kinetics and strengthening in Al Cu Mg alloys during non-isothermal treatments consisting of controlled heating and cooling.

The city's fortifications had also recently been improved with Italian-style bastions.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's highly popular {{presidency}} in 1951, Árbenz {{was elected to the}} presidency. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land reform program known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Due to the political climate of the Cold War, the US was already predisposed to see the socialist policies of the democratically elected Arévalo and Árbenz as communist. This conception had been <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion, and by the 1950s the US government was considering overthrowing Árbenz.|$|E

5|$|Lacking firm {{movement}} {{because of}} weak steering currents, Gordon meandered north-northeast {{in the presence}} of mild west-southwesterly wind shear, unable to strengthen under the adverse conditions. By November 11, a trough prodded Gordon to the north-northeast at 8mph (13km/h), and it <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> 6mph (9km/h) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea. The trough continued steering Gordon, bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12. Despite the warm waters, Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper-tropospheric shear hindered development, disorganized the upper level circulation, and reduced its winds to 40mph (65km/h).|$|E

5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

5|$|The Hetumoger {{confederation}} was <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> {{the arrival}} of the Kabars, who (according to Constantine) joined the Hungarians following their unsuccessful riot against the Khazar Khaganate.

Madgearu proposes that Kavar groups were already settled in the Tisza plain within the Carpathian Basin around 881, which may have given rise to the anachronistic reference to Cumans in the Gesta Hungarorum {{at the time of the}} Hungarian conquest.|$|E

5|$|The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in {{comparison}} {{to those of other}} ankylosaurs, and appear to have been <b>strengthened</b> <b>by</b> randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers. These were structurally similar to Sharpey's fibers, and were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering which was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians.|$|E
