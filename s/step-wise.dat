25|$|The 'Agenda 2000' reforms {{divided the}} CAP into two 'Pillars': {{production}} support and rural development. Several {{rural development measures}} were introduced including diversification, setting up producer groups and support for young farmers. Agri-environment schemes became compulsory for every Member State (Dinan 2005: 367). The market support prices for cereals, milk and milk products and beef and veal were <b>step-wise</b> reduced while direct coupled payments to farmers were increased. Payments for major arable crops as cereals and oilseeds were harmonised.|$|E
25|$|Proteins with {{different}} numbers of polyhistidine tags elute differently from nickel-affinity resin. For proteins {{with a single}} hexahistidine tag, 75 mM imidazole enables elution from Ni-NTA, whereas for proteins with two hexahistidine tags, 100 mM imidazole is required for elution. This <b>step-wise</b> elution {{may be used to}} isolate specific protein assemblies from a mixture, such as defined heteromultimers (e.g. an AB heterodimer from a mixture including AA and BB homodimers, if only subunit B has a polyhistidine tag). Such an approach was used in isolation of monovalent streptavidin.|$|E
25|$|The chosen {{composition}} of the mobile phase (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components ("analytes") and stationary phase (e.g. hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process {{taking place in the}} column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid–liquid extraction but is continuous, not <b>step-wise.</b> In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e. in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).|$|E
25|$|The second {{modification}} was {{the requirement}} {{that one of the}} ice giants and Jupiter encounter Jupiter causing its semi-major axis to jump. In this jumping-Jupiter scenario an ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit, causing Saturn's orbit to expand; then encounters Jupiter and is scattered outward, causing Jupiter's orbit to shrink. This results in a <b>step-wise</b> separation of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits instead of a smooth divergent migration. The <b>step-wise</b> separation of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn avoids the slow sweeping of secular resonances across the inner solar System that resulted in the excitation of the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets and an asteroid belt with an excessive ratio of high- to low-inclination objects The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in this model allow Jupiter to acquire its own irregular satellites. Jupiter trojans are also captured following these encounters when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps and, if the ice giant passes through one of the libration points scattering trojans, one population is depleted relative to the other. The faster traverse of the secular resonances across the asteroid belt limits the loss of asteroids from its core. Most of the rocky impactors of the Late Heavy Bombardment instead originate from an inner extension that that is disrupted when the giant planets reach their current positions, with a remnant remaining as the Hungaria asteroids. Some D-type asteroids are embedded in inner asteroid belt, within 2.5 AU, during encounters with the ice giant when it is crossing the asteroid belt.|$|E
25|$|Electronic Arts {{released}} The Sims 3 to retailers {{worldwide and}} available by digital download on June 2, 2009. The sequel, developed by The Sims Studio, was announced by EA in November 2006. The game is set 25 years prior the original game, and features an open, seamless neighborhood, improved tools for Sim creation, enhanced build and buy mode functions, {{and the introduction}} of wishes and goals. The game also introduces a new form of directed gameplay through small, <b>step-wise</b> goals presented as opportunities which the player may choose to pursue or refuse. The Sims 3 sold 1.4 million copies in the first week, making it the largest release in PC gaming history at the time. The game has sold over 10 million copies worldwide since its release.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{species in}} a given environment, {{available}} resources will {{limit the number of}} individuals that can survive indefinitely. This is the carrying capacity. Upon reaching this threshold, individuals may find it easier to gather resources in the poorer yet less exploited peripheral environment than in the preferred habitat. Homo habilis could have developed some baseline behavioural flexibility prior to its expansion into the peripheries (such as encroaching into the predatory guild). This flexibility could then have been positively selected and amplified, leading to Homo erectus adaptation to the peripheral open habitats. A new and environmentally flexible hominin population could have come back to the old niche and replace the ancestral population. Moreover, some <b>step-wise</b> shrinking of the woodland and the associated reduction of hominin carrying capacity in the woods around 1.8 Ma, 1.2 Ma, and 0.6 Ma would have stressed the carrying capacity's pressure for adapting to the open grounds.|$|E
25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and <b>step-wise</b> β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework within which to explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the reactants (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (top-right). Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of deprotonation (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes in the reactants or reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism are illustrated in Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the reactants and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the reactants and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|E
500|$|Commercial turkeys {{are usually}} reared indoors under {{controlled}} conditions. These are often large buildings, purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities (this reduces the birds' activity and thereby increases {{the rate of}} weight gain). [...] The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of <b>step-wise</b> light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly. Females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19. Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts. Many different breeds have been developed, {{but the majority of}} commercial birds are white, as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass, the pin feathers being less visible. Turkeys were at one time mainly consumed on special occasions such as Christmas (10 million birds in the United Kingdom) or Thanksgiving (60 million birds in the United States). However, they are increasingly becoming part of the everyday diet {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|Several {{additional}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed to improve upon and reconcile the LDR and BDR hypotheses. One predominantly favored hypothesis, first developed by Günter P. Wagner and Jacques Gauthier in 1999, involves a [...] "frameshift" [...] of the digits; the first digit fails {{to grow in the}} first developmental site due to not receiving the necessary signals, which has the effect of shifting digits I-III to the positions of II-IV. Thus, while digits I-III from the ancestral theropod are retained, they do not grow in the same location. A version of the frameshift hypothesis modified to incorporate both elements of BDR and fossil evidence from Limusaurus and other theropods, the [...] "thumbs down" [...] hypothesis of Capek et al., suggests that this frameshift took place after the reduction of both the first and the fourth digits in the theropod lineage. The major alternative hypothesis supported by Xu Xing et al., known as the [...] "lateral shift hypothesis", considers a partial, <b>step-wise</b> frameshift in which, from a four-fingered hand with reduced digits I and IV, I fully disappears while IV develops into a fully-fledged finger, with II-IV taking on the morphologies of the former I-III.|$|E

Music theorist Daniel Harrison compared the song to an earlier Brian Wilson composition, [...] "California Girls", as it both avoids a root-position tonic and suppresses a cadential drive. It also contains a <b>step-wise</b> descending bass-line like Wilson's other compositions on the Pet Sounds album.

2500|$|Harpsichords {{with more}} than one {{keyboard}} (this usually means two keyboards, stacked {{one on top of the}} other in a <b>step-wise</b> fashion, as with pipe organs) provide flexibility in selecting which strings play, since each manual can be set to control the plucking of a different set of strings. In addition, such harpsichords often have a mechanism (the [...] "coupler") that couples manuals together, so that a single manual plays both sets of strings. The most flexible system is the French [...] "shove coupler", in which the lower manual slides forward and backward. In the backward position, [...] "dogs" [...] attached to the upper surface of the lower manual engage the lower surface of the upper manual's keys. [...] Depending on choice of keyboard and coupler position, the player can select any of the sets of jacks labeled in figure 4 as A, or B and C, or all three.|$|E
2500|$|Structure {{determination}} by NMR {{has traditionally}} been a time consuming process, requiring interactive {{analysis of the data}} by a highly trained scientist. There has been a considerable interest in automating the process to increase the throughput of structure determination and to make protein NMR accessible to non-experts (See structural genomics). The two most time consuming processes involved are the sequence-specific resonance assignment (backbone and side-chain assignment) and the NOE assignment tasks. Several different computer programs have been published that target individual parts of the overall NMR structure determination process in an automated fashion. Most progress has been achieved for the task of automated NOE assignment. So far, only the FLYA and the UNIO approach were proposed to perform the entire protein NMR structure determination process in an automated manner without any human intervention. Alternatively, modules in the [...] such as APES (two-letter-code: ae), PINE/PINE-SPARKY (two-letter-code: ep) and PONDEROSA (two-letter-code: c3, up) can be used to operate automation and visual verification in <b>step-wise</b> manner. Efforts have also been made to standardize the structure calculation protocol to make it quicker and more amenable to automation.|$|E
2500|$|The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO or ALOX5) {{converts}} {{arachidonic acid}} into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), {{which may be}} released and rapidly reduced to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) by ubiquitous cellular glutathione-dependent peroxidases. [...] Alternately, ALOX5 uses its LTA synthase activity to act convert 5-HPETE to leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is then metabolized either to LTB4 by Leukotriene A4 hydrolase or Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by either LTC4 synthase or microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2). Either of the latter two enzymes act to attach the sulfur of cysteine's thio- (i.e. SH) group in the tripeptide glutamate-cysteine-glycine to carbon 6 of LTA4 thereby forming LTC4. After release from its parent cell, the glutamate and glycine residues of LTC4 are removed <b>step-wise</b> by gamma-glutamyltransferase and a dipeptidase to form sequentially LTD4 and LTE4. The decision to form LTB4 versus LTC4 depends on the relative content of LTA4 hydrolase versus LTC4 synthase (or glutathione S=transferase in cells; Eosinophils, mast cells, and alveolar macrophages possess relatively high levels of LTC4 synthase and accordingly form LTC4 rather than or to a far greater extent than LTB4. 5-LOX may also work in series with cytochrome P450 oxygenases or aspirin-treated COX2 to form Resolvins RvE1, RvE2, and 18S-RvE1 (see Specialized pro-resolving mediators#EPA-derived resolvins).|$|E
2500|$|Commonly, {{hydrogen}} isotope {{composition of}} natural gas from the same well has a trend of δDmethaneethanepropaneC4+. This is because most natural gas is thought to generated by <b>step-wise</b> thermal cracking that is mostly irreversible and thus governed by normal kinetic isotope effects that favor light isotopes. The same trend, known as [...] "the normal order", holds for carbon isotopes {{of natural gas}}. For example, Angola gas {{is reported to have}} a methane δD range of -190‰ to -140‰, a ethane δD of -146‰ to -107‰, a propane δD of -116‰ to -90‰, and a butane δD of -118‰ to -85‰. However, some recent studies show that opposite patterns could also exist, meaning δDmethane>δDethane>δDpropane. This phenomenon {{is often referred to as}} 'isotopic reversal' or 'isotopic rollover'. The isotopic order could also be partially reversed, like δDmethane>δDethanepropane or δDmethaneethane>δDpropane. Burruss et al. found that in the deepest samples of northern Appalachian basin the hydrogen isotopic order for methane and ethane is reversed. Liu et al., also found partial reversal in oil-related gas from the Tarim Basin. The mechanism causing this reversal is still unknown. Possible explanations include mixing between gases of different maturities and sources, oxidation of methane, etc. Jon Telling et al., synthesized isotopically reversed (in both C and H) low-molecular alkanes using gas-phase radical recombination reactions in electrical discharge experiments, providing another possible mechanism.|$|E
