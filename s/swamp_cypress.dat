A woodland management program removing diseased and weed trees is in operation.

60|$|But {{even further}} north, in Spitzbergen, in 78° and 79° N. Lat. {{and one of}} the most barren and inhospitable regions on the globe, an almost equally rich fossil flora has been {{discovered}} including several of the Greenland species, and others peculiar, but mostly of the same genera. There seem to be no evergreens here except coniferæ, one of which is identical with the swamp-cypress (Taxodium distichum) now found living in the Southern United States! There are also eleven pines, two Libocedrus, two sequoias, with oaks, poplars, birches, planes, limes, a hazel, an ash, and a walnut; also water-lilies, pond-weeds, and an iris--altogether about a hundred species of flowering plants. Even in Grinnell Land, within 8¼ degrees of the pole, a similar flora existed, twenty-five species of fossil plants having been collected by the last Arctic expedition, of which eighteen were identical with the species from other Arctic localities. This flora comprised poplars, birches, hazels, elms, viburnums, and eight species of conifers including the <b>swamp</b> <b>cypress</b> and the Norway spruce (Pinus abies) which last does not now extend beyond 69½° N.|$|E
