This paper describes, in outline form, a series of laboratory and field tests on an instrumented heavy goods vehicle. The vehicle was instrumented in the laboratory and an extensive series of calibration tests performed to establish the relationship between measurements of axle strain and vehicle load; this testing regime was also used to validate the instrumentation. A field trial was then conducted with the vehicle being returned to service and axle strain measurements being recorded continuously. Estimates of the static load were then validated against daily weigh-bridge measurements. The system has been in continuous service {{for several years now}} and {{has proven to be a}} robust and accurate method of calculating <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> load which can be easily installed on a vehicle at relatively low cost. When combined with a vehicle tracking unit real time load data can be made available to a fleet operator and on the spot load data displayed to the driver.

40|$|Airborne laser {{scanning}} has established {{itself as a}} dominant technology providing high quality surface data {{for a variety of}} applications. LiDAR has substantially widened the use of mapping, for instance, in the late nineties, telecommunication industry required large volumes of high-density DSM data. In addition, research has recently shown promising results in extracting features such as man-made objects, for example buildings, from the point cloud. More recently, research started to explore the feasibility of using Lidar data for transportation applications, including infrastructure, emergency and environmental mapping along corridors. Initial investigation on assessing the performance of extracting vehicles from LIDAR data and then categorizing them has proved that valuable traffic flow information can be obtained. The vehicle classification was mainly based on simple four-parameter description of the vertical <b>profile</b> of the <b>vehicles.</b> This paper is a continuation of that research effort by introducing an improved model of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>profile</b> description. A model library is formed based on the ground-based {{laser scanning}} data and an analytical approximation of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>profile</b> will replace the previous four-parameter description. The anticipated benefits are twofold: 1) a better extraction and a more robust coarse classification of the vehicles are expected, and 2) it is very likely that subclasses of vehicles can be introduced such as small cars, full-size cars, light trucks, SUVs and so on. This paper describes a newly developed model of <b>vehicle</b> <b>profile</b> description, the classification method, implementation, and algorithmic aspects.

A seven parameter simplified vehicle front end model {{is used in}} which the Central Composite Design(CCD) is utilized to generate a Plan of Experiments for the adult and child pedestrian cases each. Head Injury Criteria (HIC) results from the simulations are tabulated as the response function f(y). The Response Surface method is used to obtain mathematical models for all cases for which optimization is carried out. A close correlation is obtained between the predicted response and the response observed via simulation for the optimized models. The optimized <b>vehicle</b> front-end <b>profile</b> for the adult pedestrian group is shown to be different {{than that of the}} optimized profile for the child pedestrian. Moreover, the study shows that both optimized profiles are not mutually applicable for safety. A simple weighted biasing method is used to obtain responses that minimize the response for both adult as well as child pedestrian groups mutually within a single profile.

40|$|Current {{regulations}} for assessing pedestrian safety use a simplified test setup that ignores many real-world factors. In particular, {{the level of}} protection is assessed using a free-motion headform impacting the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s hood at a fixed angle. As such, this test setup does not capture the effect due to the <b>vehicle</b> front-end <b>profile,</b> nor does it comprehend injury due to a possible secondary impact of the pedestrian 2 ̆ 7 s head with ground. This thesis aims to numerically simulate vehicle to pedestrian crashes to develop knowledge that may suggest ways to improve safety {{above and beyond the}} regulatory tests. Inputs to the simulations include the <b>vehicle</b> front-end <b>profile,</b> impact speed, and pedestrian size. Outputs include the angle of primary head impact to the hood, the extent of head injury (HIC), and {{whether or not there is}} a secondary head impact with the ground. One key finding is that head impact angles, and hence head injury measures, vary greatly due to changes in <b>vehicle</b> front-end <b>profile.</b> This suggests that the current test setup for assessing pedestrian head impact, which assumes a fixed head-impact angle, could be improved to better capture the kinematics of real-world pedestrian crash events. One improvement could be the use of a full scale pedestrian dummy or human body model rather than a free motion headform. A second finding is that severity of head injury is much greater in a secondary head impact with ground than in the primary impact with the hood. Moreover, it is possible to avoid the secondary head impact with ground by careful designing of <b>vehicle</b> front-end <b>profile.</b> More research needs to be carried out to prove that concepts developed through numerical simulations also works in physical tests...|$|R

Conventional <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem assumes the logistics information is accurate and timely, and {{does not take into}} account the uncertainties, which is therefore inadequate during practical applications. In this paper, a vehicle initial routing optimization model considering uncertainties is proposed, the vehicle capacity, customer time-window, and the maximum travelling distance as well as the road capacity are considered. In the cyber-physical logistics system background, a routing adjustment model is proposed to minimize the total distribution cost considering the road congestion, and the static and dynamic models are proposed for traffic information transmission network to quantitatively analyse the impact of the traffic information transmission delay on the vehicle routing optimization. The learnable genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the initial routing optimization model and the routing adjustment model. The simulation results have verified its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the European New Car Assessment Program, {{which offers}} {{rigorous}} testing conditions, this study developed a numerical {{model for the}} computer simulation of crash analysis and analyzed two crash situations: a high-speed vehicle crashing into a wall and a high-speed test vehicle crashing into a <b>static</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The Simulation model was constructed using the superior functions of the Patran software, and the Pam-crash software was employed to perform various calculations for analysis. In crashes, the structure of vehicle bodies are greatly compressed and deformed because of high-speed impact force, which simultaneously generates high speed acceleration. Vehicle structural deformation constricts the driver and passengers, and acceleration can cause them physical harm. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the sources of harm to driver and passengers when crashes occur.

40|$|The {{presence}} of highly non-linear friction damping in the suspensions of many freight vehicles reduces prediction accuracy when using traditional kinematic gauging techniques. These techniques, {{which are often}} applied to the more linear behaving passenger vehicles, {{are based on the}} quasi-static suspension behaviour. Due to this limitation and a market requirement for cost effective and rapid vehicle gauging, the current approach in the UK for freight vehicles is to use <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> gauges. This method can be very conservative and lead to in-efficient use of the available space between vehicle and infrastructure. Computer simulation-based dynamic gauging techniques offer a way to maximize the use of the space available, by introducing into the gauging analysis, the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. This paper describes the process of dynamic gauging for friction damped freight vehicles. The benefits of this method in terms of potential increase of the vehicle size are shown, but also difficulties within the process, especially concerning the adequate validation of the simulation models...|$|R
