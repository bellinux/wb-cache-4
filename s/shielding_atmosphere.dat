5000|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} welding (AHW) is an {{arc welding}} process that uses an arc between two tungsten electrodes in a <b>shielding</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of hydrogen. The process {{was invented by}} Irving Langmuir {{in the course of}} his studies of atomic hydrogen. The electric arc efficiently breaks up the hydrogen molecules, which later recombine with tremendous release of heat, reaching temperatures from 3400 to 4000 °C. Without the arc, an oxyhydrogen torch can only reach 2800 °C. [...] This is the third-hottest flame after dicyanoacetylene at 4987 °C and cyanogen at 4525 °C. An acetylene torch merely reaches 3300 °C. This device may be called an atomic hydrogen torch, nascent hydrogen torch or Langmuir torch. The process was also known as arc-atom welding.|$|E

Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and die casting are all well developed for magnesium alloys, die casting being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. Forming behavior is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but scratch brushing or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert <b>shielding</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or fine chips, and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in sheet, bar, extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|E

At present alloys {{based on the}} titanium-niobium system are produced mainly using conventional metallurgical methods. The further subtractive manufacturing an end product results {{in a lot of}} wastes, increasing, therefore, its cost. The alternative of these processes is additive manufacturing. Selective laser melting is a technology, which makes it possible to synthesize products of metal powders and their blends. The point of this technology is laser melting a layer of a powdered material; then a sintered layer is coated with the next layer of powder etc. Complex products and working prototypes are made on the base of this technology.

40|$|Laser metal {{deposition}} (LMD) is {{an established}} technology for two-dimensional surface coatings. It offers high deposition rates, high material flexibility {{and the possibility}} to deposit material on existing components. Due to these features, LMD has been increasingly applied for additive manufacturing of 3 D structures in recent years. Compared to previous coating applications, additive manufacturing of 3 D structures leads to new challenges regarding LMD process knowledge. In this paper, the process chain for LMD as additive manufacturing technology is described. The experiments are conducted using titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Inconel 718. Only the LMD nozzle is {{used to create a}} <b>shielding</b> gas <b>atmosphere.</b> This ensures high geometric flexibility, although issues with the restricted size and quality of the <b>shielding</b> gas <b>atmosphere</b> arise. In the first step, the influence of process parameters on the geometric dimensions of single weld beads is analysed based on design of experiments and statistical evaluation. The results allow adjusting the weld bead dimensions for the specific component geometry. In the second step, features of a 3 D build-up strategy for high dimensional accuracy are discussed. For this purpose, cylindrical specimens consisting of more than 200 layers are built. Welding of multiple layers {{on top of each other}} leads to heat accumulation. Consequently, the molten pool is increased and weld bead height and width are changed. Furthermore, cooling times are prolonged. The build-up strategy has to be adjusted to deal with these issues. Process parameters, travel paths and cooling breaks between layers are varied. Temperatures during the deposition process are measured with pyrometer and thermography. The specimens are analysed with metallurgic cross sections, x-ray and tensile test. Tensile tests show that mechanical properties in the as-deposited condition are close to wrought material. The results are used to design guidelines for a LMD build-up strategy for complex components. As reality test, parts of a gas turbine burner and a turbine blade are manufactured according to these build-up strategies.

The LMF process is in particular suitable for very complex geometries. However build rate, part volume and material flexibility are limited in LMF. In contrast, LMD achieves higher deposition rates, less restricted part sizes and the possibility to change the material composition during the build-up process. On the other hand, due to the lower spatial precision of the material deposition process, the complexity of geometries is limited. Therefore, combined manufacturing with both LMF and LMD {{has the potential to}} utilize the respective advantages of both technologies.

40|$|Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) produce adverse {{space weather}} effects at Earth. Planets in the close {{habitable}} zone of magnetically active M dwarfs may experience more extreme space weather than at Earth, including frequent CME impacts leading to atmospheric erosion {{and leaving the}} surface exposed to extreme flare activity. Similar erosion may occur for hot Jupiters with close orbits around solar-like stars. We have developed a model, Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT), which predicts a CME's deflection. We adapt ForeCAT to simulate CME deflections for the mid-type M dwarf V 374 Peg and hot Jupiters with solar-type hosts. V 374 Peg's strong magnetic fields can trap CMEs at the M dwarfs's Astrospheric Current Sheet, {{the location of the}} minimum in the background magnetic field. Solar-type CMEs behave similarly, but have much smaller deflections and do not get trapped at the Astrospheric Current Sheet. The probability of planetary impact decreases with increasing inclination of the planetary orbit with respect to the Astrospheric Current Sheet - 0. 5 to 5 CME impacts per day for M dwarf exoplanets, 0. 05 to 0. 5 CME impacts per day for solar-type hot Jupiters. We determine the minimum planetary magnetic field necessary to <b>shield</b> a planet's <b>atmosphere</b> from the CME impacts. M dwarf exoplanets require values between tens and hundreds of Gauss. Hot Jupiters around a solar-type star, however, require a more reasonable < 30 G. These values exceed the magnitude required to shield a planet from the stellar wind, suggesting CMEs may be the key driver of atmospheric losses. Comment: Accepted in Ap...|$|R
