5000|$|The sampler/pulser circuit {{has three}} {{distinct}} operational states {{determined by the}} voltage level of the control signal, Control. The circuit transitions sequentially through all three states as the voltage level of the control signal, Control, falls from an initial voltage that {{is greater than the}} fixed input voltage V3, to the second state in which Control is between the voltage of the fixed input voltage V3 and the fixed voltage V2, to the third state in which Control's voltage is less than fixed voltage V2. Typically V2 can be approximately between one and two volts higher than voltage V1, and V3 can be approximately between one and two volts higher than V2. The control signal, Control, typically begins at a voltage level that is approximately the voltage level of Vdd, the power supply. The voltage level of Vdd is typically one to three volts higher than V3. At the time one desires to create a sampling aperture or pulse, the control signal is slewed in a negative direction, so that it ultimately ends up at a voltage that is less than V2. If the control signal is initially greater than V3 by more than a few tenths of a volt, transistor Q9 and Q10 are [...] "on" [...] (biased into the forward conduction region) and transistors Q7 and Q8 are [...] "off" [...] (biased so that essentially no current flows), resulting in the output nodes being pulled up to Vdd, causing the <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> to be turned [...] "off" [...] (the output nodes contain no signal). Similarly, if the level of the control signal {{at the end of its}} falling transition is less than V2 by a few tenths of a volt, transistors Q11 and Q12 are [...] "on" [...] and transistors Q5 and Q6 are [...] "off", resulting in the output nodes being pulled up to Vdd, and the <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> again being turned off. However, during the active falling of the control signal, when the control signal is between V2 and V3, transistors Q5, Q6, Q7, and Q8 are all [...] "on" [...] (and Q9, Q10, Q11, and Q12 all [...] "off") resulting in the <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> being turned on. In this case, the differential input signal across the input terminals IN+ and IN− is multiplied by the circuit gain to generate a differential output signal across OUT+ and OUT− terminals.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{sampling}} is {{a technique}} to visualize a time-varying waveform by capturing quasi-instantaneous snapshots of a signal via a <b>sampling</b> <b>gate.</b> The gate is opened and closed by narrow pulses in a pulse train having a well defined repetitive behaviour such that {{all parts of the}} waveform are measured. Sub-picosecond temporal resolution sampling can be achieved with all-optical techniques that utilize the ultrafast response of nonlinear materials in order to implement the required gating functionality. In this thesis, {{the focus is on the}} performance of a fiber four-wavemixing (FWM) based all-optical sampling oscilloscope (OSO) in terms of a trade-off between temporal resolution, signal optical bandwidth and signal sensitivity. This work also addresses the fact that the nonlinear processes utilized to implement all-optical sampling gates are inherently strongly dependent on the relative state of polarization (SOP) between the sampling pulses, used to open the <b>sampling</b> <b>gate,</b> and the signal being monitored. A very simple technique is described that completely removes the problem with signal polarization dependence of a fiber FWM-based OSO. All digital sampling schemes require a precise time-base in order to position the acquired samples correctly in time. The time-base is usually dependent on a hardware generated trigger signal, which is normally extracted from the monitored signal. We demonstrate a novel technique to achieve the required time-base by means of a software algorithm applied on the acquired samples. As a result, we can avoid clock-recovery from the signal, and hence, the OSO becomes independent of the waveform repetition frequency. The detrimental polarization dependence of the FWM process can be utilized to implement novel functionality to an OSO. By rotating the state of polarization (SOP) of the sampling pulses during the sampling process, a time-resolved measurement of the SOP of the monitored signal was demonstrated with picosecond temporal resolution. Finally, we used the OSO as a tool to monitor the transmission quality of a 160 Gb/s RZ data signal subjected to polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and third-order dispersion (TOD). Techniques to compensate for PMD and TOD are presented and a large improvement of the transmission quality was achieved...|$|E

The average analog of the in samplings output by the Boxcar enhances the signal-to-noise ratio by root m, because the repeated sampling and the average make the useful speckle signals stable, while the randomly varied photoelectric noise is suppressed by 1 / root m. In the experiment, we use an analog-to-digital converter module to synchronize all the actions such as the stepped movement of the phase screen, the repeated sampling, the readout of the averaged output of the Boxcar, etc. The experimental results show that speckle signals are better recovered from contaminated signals, and the autocorrelation function with the secondary maximum is obtained, indicating that {{the accuracy of the}} measurement of the autocorrelation function is greatly improved by the gated integration technique.

The author presents a renal artery examination technique, patient preparation for the testing, limitations of the method, currently recommended proper blood flow standards and criteria for the diagnosis of significant stenoses. Renal artery ultrasound is performed using a  2 – 5  MHz probe, usually a convex 3. 5 MHz one. The ultrasound machine must be equipped with the Doppler options for the evaluation of color coded blood flow and recording of the blood flow spectrum, including the triplex Doppler mode. Patients have to fast for at least eight hours before testing. Ultrasound always begins with the assessment of renal structure using the grayscale. Next, color coded blood flow imaging is used, followed by placing a sampling gate in the lumen of the target vessel to record the spectral image. The aim of renal artery ultrasound is to assess the course and position of arteries, evaluate blood flow parameters, as well as visualize possible changes: stenoses, occlusions, aneurysms, or arteriovenous fistulas. Blood flow velocity is always measured in a longitudinal projection/ longitudinal section of the vessel, after placing the <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> in the central part of the flowing bloodstream, which normally corresponds to the central part of the vascular cross-section.

Relative arrival time may be recorded in several fashions; i. e. a common free-running clock may be latched at the desired instant (a digital solution used in most of today's Time to Digital converters [TDC's]), or an common analog ramp can be sampled (producing a voltage proportional to the <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> delay; an analog solution used in earlier TDC's). The latter technique, which ideally would involve less noise injection and complexity, has been suggested for implementation in the hydrophone array. An analog circuit to sample one signal at the peak value of another has already been developed and fielded in tests of the Backgammon sonar system[2]; see Fig. 1. This circuit worked quite well up to frequencies approaching 80 Khz, and {{has been used to}} quickly calibrate and adjust the Backgammon system. It has been mainly realized from comparitor and operational amplifier circuits, however, and is somewhat complex.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} and demonstrates methods to characterize high-speed (> 10 Gbaud) signals in fiber optic communication systems and networks, including {{acquisition of the}} optical signal intensity, amplitude, phase and polarization. These quantities are necessary {{for the analysis of}} system performance, both in research and development stages, as well as for monitoring and management of operational systems. This becomes increasingly important as the optical communications systems develop toward using more sophisticated modulation formats. We demonstrated real-time optical intensity waveform sampling with high sampling rate and simultaneous high bandwidth by parallelizing the sampling in four optical gates. The optical sampling gates provide a total sampling rate of 100 GSample/s with sampling bandwidth limited by the Nyquist criterion. As an example, the first real-time acquisition of a 40 GHz bandwidth signal was demonstrated. The characterization of the full optical field, i. e. both the optical signal amplitude and phase, was used to analyze the regenerative properties of a saturated parametric amplifier on a 10 Gbit/s differential phase shift keying (DPSK) signal. The optical signal was visualized in a constellation diagram which enabled separation of amplitude and phase fluctuations. By introducing the phase preserving optical <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> to our coherent detection scheme, we were able to increase the temporal resolution tenfold. The high bandwidth was demonstrated by studying a 40 Gbit/s DPSK signal. Furthermore, we visualized the signal transitions by implementing signal averaging. Polarization analysis was utilized to characterize system properties. We investigated the polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) properties of a recirculation loop. It was found that, in contrast to the normal Maxwellian distribution, the first-order PMD statistics approaches a uniform distribution when no loop-synchronous polarization scrambling is used. Furthermore, we demonstrated methods to utilize the signal polarization for low-cost optical performance monitoring.

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis covers two projects, {{namely the}} study of optical {{responses}} of high temperature superconductor thin films and {{the study of}} polarization switching dynamics in ferroelectric materials, both using a femtosecond laser. We employed the improved Transient Photoimpedance Response method with high signal-to-noise ratio to conduct systematic investigations of the dependence of femtosecond optical responses of YBCO films on current, average laser power, temperature, and film thickness. All of the physical processes embedded in the optical responses were observed. Feature waveforms associated with different physical processes, namely the kinetic inductance, 2 -T, and thermal model, were obtained. Taking advantage of the direct relationship between the optical response and the Cooper pair breaking rate, we studied the photon energy dependence of the fast optical response of YBCO films. A resonance around 1. 5 eV was observed with a total width of ~ 100 meV. This narrowness of a spectrum-width has not been reported in the literature. The results are well interpreted by stripe phase theory. We also developed a superconducting <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> to perform the electrical correlation measurement of the fast optical response of YBCO films. An estimated ~ 8 ps pulse was obtained. For the application of ferroelectric materials as high-speed nonvolatile random access memories, the issue of how fast the polarization can be switched is of great importance. The goal of our research is to obtain the intrinsic polarization switching time. By simulating the pulse method utilized in our experiments, we concluded that the rise-time of the input electric pulse and the capacitor size are two limiting factors of this method. We therefore proposed and realized a novel approach for generating jitter-free, sub- 100 ps rise-time step-function-like electric pulses, using a femtosecond laser-activated semiconductor photoconductive switch. Quantitative measurements yielded a polarization switching time ts of ~ 220 ps for a 4. 5 x 5. 4 micron square PNZT capacitor, which is to our knowledge the fastest one ever reported. Modeling of the switching transient using the Ishibashi-Merz model gave a characteristic switching time t 0 of ~ 70 ps.

Nevertheless, geological, hydrological or hydrogeological data are often very scarce, and appropriate approach have {{to be found in}} order to improve the hydrogeological {{functioning of}} these islands. Groundwater resource is closely correlated with the permeability of rocks, and, in basaltic volcanic islands, permeability is usually considered to be negatively correlated with age formations. Younger lavas have higher permeability than older one's often highly weathered (Custodio et al., 1988). Existing hydrogeological models of basaltic volcanic islands describe large-scale systems at the volcano or island scale, and two end models have been described. The Hawaiian model (Meinzer, 1930) considers a low-lying basal aquifer linked to inland dike-impounded and perched aquifers overlying impervious layers and/or confined by dykes (Tabasaki and Mink, 1983). The Canary Islands model (Custodio, 1975; Custodio et al., 1988) considers a continuous and isotropic basal aquifer, and a decrease of hydraulic conductivity with the age of the volcanic rocks. Nevertheless, those models are consistent with Young Island (< 5 Ma) and seem not fully appropriate for older island such as Mayotte Island. Mayotte Island is a small French overseas territory of the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Its population has quickly increased during the last decades and has been multiplied by four in less than 30 years. The island is now very densely populated with more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer. Water needs are thus substantial. Surface water resource is very strongly solicited, and too dry seasons can lead to critical situations. Nevertheless, its hydrogeological functioning is not well known, and understanding the hydrogeological functioning of the island is thus essential for an adapted management of groundwater resources and to make appropriate drilling campaigns. In 2010, an helborne SkyTEM survey on the whole island has been performed. The transmitter loop is composed of four 284 m² loops that transmit a low moment with a single turn and a high moment with four turns of the loop. The current generated by the low moment is 11 A, giving a moment of about 3100 Am² and a turn off time of 10 microseconds. That generated by the high moment is 108 A, giving a moment of about 123, 000 Am² and a turn off time of 38 microseconds. The first <b>sampling</b> <b>gate</b> is centred about 6. 5 microseconds for the low moment and the last window of the high moment is 8 ms. A linear 3000 km of SkyTEM TDEM data was acquired in a month. The average flight line spacing was 200 metres, with local spacings of 400 metres or 100 metres. The average speed of the helicopter was 18 m/s (65 km/h) with an average ground clearance of the transmitter loop being 48 metres. The TDEM decay curves were filtered using Workbench software with 1 D modelling of the curves based on the Ward and Hohmann (1988) solutions. Data inversion was done with em 1 Dinv software (Auken et al, 2004) using a 20 -layer model with fixed depths and a spatial constraint between the model resistivities of nearby soundings (Viezzoli et al, 2008). This model was preferred to a stratified-type inversion because the development of the weathering profile is not conducive to the presence of a sharp contrast between the bodies. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to show the calibration of 3 D resistivity mapping realized on another and older volcanic island, with boreholes data in a test site in the South of Mayotte Island, and how the highlighted paleo-valley structure enhance understanding the hydrogeological functioning of the South of Mayotte Island. To establish the 3 D model, we used correlation between borehole, geological map and 3 D resistivity grids. Comparison between TDEM data, borehole and pumping tests data have provided new evidence about the hydrogeological scheme of the island, which seems different from the two previously mentioned. This study is focused in the South of the and includes two watersheds. The surface of the Kani-Kéli watershed, the west one, is about 4. 9 km², and the surface of the Mronabeja watershed, the est one, is about 4. 4 km². Four boreholes {{have been made in the}} past Simplified and interpreted geological logs show that two boreholes are drilled in weathered lavas, whereas the two others encountered about 30 m of weathered lavas overlying unweathered and superposed fresh fissured lava flows, with a confined aquifer in the fresh lava. 3 D geological model of this area is made with GeoModeller ® software. Two kinds of data are used: polygons extracted from the provisional geological map using ArcMap and TDEM data. One model was produced with TDEM sounding (i. e. without resistivity interpolatation). 3 D modeling of different geological formations can delineate structures with a hydrogeological interest. Indeed, in healthy fractured lavas, characterized by variable resistivity of 30 to 100 Ω. m, are considered as potential reservoirs of groundwater in these formations modeled structures thus correspond to aquifer sector Choungui South. The results show that helicopter borne TDEM is particularly adapted for this volcanic island, with low resistivities soils outcropping. Data computation also allows to image geological structure in 3 D and boreholes comparison allows attributing geological identification for the main ranges of resistivity data. Productive boreholes, in the axis of a resistive body, and unproductive boreholes outside, allow confirming the implication of paleo-valley as major constraint for groundwater flows and the necessity to enhance existing conceptual model. The South of Mayotte Island is thus proposed as an end member of basaltic models. These results are very hopeful, and we are now looking for similar structure in order to drill new boreholes, to confirm the replicability of this aquifer structure, and to provide water to population. method...|$|E
