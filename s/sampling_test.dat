Swabs from beef and pork carcasses from 48 and 34 facilities, respectively, were analyzed. All <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> were positive for aerobic bacteria with 99. 8 % of beef and 96. 0 % of pork samples, having total counts of ≤ 100 000 CFU/cm 2. Coliform bacteria were isolated from 22. 4 % and 42. 0 % of beef and pork carcass samples, respectively. Generic E. coli were recovered from 14. 6 % of beef and 33. 7 % of pork carcass samples. For beef carcasses, positive tests were obtained for 0. 1 % of 1036 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> for Salmonella spp., 1. 5 % of 1022 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> for Campylobacter spp. and 5. 4 % of 1018 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> for STEC.

40|$|Comparative {{evaluation}} of the semiautomated COBAS AMPLICOR hepatitis B virus (HBV) MONITOR Test (COBAS-HBV) and manual AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR Test (AMPLICOR-HBV) on 208 serum samples revealed {{no significant difference in}} the sensitivities of the two assays. Twenty <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> HBV DNA negative and 183 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> HBV DNA positive by both assays.

HBV DNA concentrations determined by the two assays were significantly related (n = 183, r = 0. 97, P < 0. 0001), which indicates that COBAS-HBV could replace AMPLICOR-HBV.

40|$|Evidence for {{serotonin}} {{involvement in}} impulsivity has generated {{interest in the}} measurement of impulsivity in regular ecstasy users, who are thought to display serotonergic dysfunction. However, current findings are inconsistent. Here, we used a recently developed Information <b>Sampling</b> <b>Test</b> to measure ‘reflection’ impulsivity in 46 current ecstasy users, 14 subjects who used ecstasy in the past, 15 current cannabis users and 19 drug-naïve controls. Despite elevated scores on the Impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy questionnaire, the current and previous ecstasy users {{did not differ significantly}} from the drug-naive controls on the Information <b>Sampling</b> <b>Test.</b> In contrast, the cannabis users sampled significantly less information on the task, and tolerated a lower level of certainty in their decision-making, in comparison to the drug-naive controls. The effect in cannabis users extends our earlier observations in amphetamine- and opiate-dependent individuals (Clark, et al., 2006, Biological Psychiatry 60 : 515 – 522), and suggests that reduced reflection may be a common cognitive style across regular users of a variety of substances. However, the lack of effects in the two ecstasy groups suggests that the relationship between serotonin function, ecstasy use and impulsivity is more complex...|$|E
