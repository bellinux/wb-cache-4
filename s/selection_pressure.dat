5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further <b>selection</b> <b>pressure</b> on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under <b>selection</b> <b>pressure</b> from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E

40|$|The Working Group on Fisheries-induced Evolution (WGEVO) met {{twice in}} 2016 : once {{remotely}} from 27 to 29 September 2016 {{and once in}} person at IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria from 18 to 20 October 2016. WGEVO pursued its effort to assemble evidence of fisheries-induced evolution and its consequences {{for the conservation of}} biodiversity and sustainable exploitation of marine species. Specifically, 2 individual-based eco-genetic models were developped for reconstructing the historical effect of fishing on the evolution of life-history traits describing growth, maturation and reproduction during the 20 th century in 2 major exploited stocks, namely northeast Arctic cod (Eikeset et al. 2016) and North Sea plaice (Mollet et al. 2016 a) WGEVO applied Evolutionary Impact Assessment, a general framework developed during the previous 3 -year term of the group for assessing the management implications of fisheries-induced evolution on stocks’ utilities in terms of ecosystem services, on North Sea plaice (Mollet et al. 2016 b). Finally, WGEVO continued the estimation of fisheries-induced Darwinian <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> exerted on exploited stocks’ life-history traits (somatic growth, maturation traits and reproductive effort). During the previous 3 -year term, the group developed a general framework for assessing these fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> and applied it to 31 stocks. 13 new stocks were analyzed this year, bringing the grand total to 44, and the calibration of the estimation algorithm is in progress for 13 additonal stocks. Although resuts can still be considered preliminary, the main findings of this large scale analysis of fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> on life-histoy traits are that: (i) Typically, fishing induces <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> towards earlier maturation at smaller size, reduced growth, and increased reproductive effort. (ii) Across stocks, fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> align along two nearly independent axes: a growth axis describing negatively covarying pressures on somatic and gonadic growth, and a maturation axis describing pressures on three maturation traits. (iii) Fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> rise superlinearly with fishing intensities. (iv) Fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> show high sensitivity to a fishery’s size selectivity. For all considered traits and across all examined life histories, <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> tend to be highest when the length at which fish become exposed to significant fishing is 1 - 2 times larger than their maturation length. Conversely, <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> tend to be more benign in fisheries with a peaked (permissive slot), rather than a sigmoidal size-selectivity pattern.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of genetic polymorphisms {{in a population}} contains information about the mutation rate {{and the strength of}} natural selection at a locus. Here, we show that the Poisson Random Field (PRF) method of population-genetic inference suffers from systematic biases that tend to underestimate <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> and mutation rates, and that erroneously infer positive selection. These problems arise from the infinite-sites approximation inherent in the PRF method. We introduce three new inference techniques that correct these problems. We present a finite-site modification of the PRF method, as well as two new methods for inferring <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> and mutation rates based on diffusion models. Our methods can be used to infer not only a "weighted average" of <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on a gene sequence, but also the {{distribution of}} <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> across sites.

5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of <b>selection</b> <b>pressure.</b> Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the <b>selection</b> <b>pressure</b> needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E

40|$|The Working Group on Fisheries-induced Evolution (WGEVO) met thrice in 2017 : twice {{remotely}} from 20 to 21 March 2017 {{and from}} 5 to 6 April 2017 {{and once in}} person at IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria from 12 to 14 June 2017. WGEVO pursued its effort to assemble evidence of fisheries-induced evolution and its consequences {{for the conservation of}} biodiversity and sustainable exploitation of marine species. Specifically, it was demonstrated experimentally on a freshwater model species that hypoxia or reduced ambient oxygen can lead to plastic effects on growth, maturation and reproduction in a direction similar to that of genetic changes induced by size-selective fishing, thus acting as a potential confounding factor of fisheries-induced evolution (Diaz Pauli et al. 2017). A field study on gonad weight recorded since the late 70 s in three populations of cod off Newfoundland supports the hypothesis that fisheries-induced evolution has occurred in gonadal investment in males, but not in females, and suggest that gonadal investment is more important for male reproductive success than expected in this lekking species (Baulier et al. 2017). WGEVO continued the estimation of fisheries-induced Darwinian <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> exerted on exploited stocks’ life-history traits (somatic growth, maturation traits and reproductive effort). During the previous 3 -year term, the group developed a general framework for assessing these fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> and applied it to 44 stocks until last year. 13 new stocks were analyzed this year, bringing the grand total to 57. The estimation is still in progress for a few additonal stocks but WGEVO will complete the estimation part of the projet {{by the end of the}} year. The main findings of this large scale analysis of fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> on life-histoy traits are that: (i) Typically, fishing induces <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> towards earlier maturation at smaller size, reduced growth, and increased reproductive effort. (ii) Across stocks, fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> align along two nearly independent axes: a growth axis describing negatively covarying pressures on somatic and gonadic growth, and a maturation axis describing pressures on maturation. (iii) Fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> rise with fishing intensities for the main traits i. e. maturation propensity, growth and reproductive investment. (iv) Fisheries-induced <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> show high sensitivity to a fishery’s size selectivity. For the main traits and across all examined life histories, <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> tend to be highest when the length at which fish become exposed to significant fishing is 1 - 2 times larger than their maturation length. Conversely, <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> tend to be more benign in fisheries with a peaked (permissive slot), rather than a sigmoidal size-selectivity pattern.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic <b>selection</b> <b>pressure.</b> This {{is suggested by the}} observation that archaea are resistant {{to a wide variety of}} antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that <b>selection</b> <b>pressure</b> from the environment could shift the range of variation in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and <b>selection</b> <b>pressure</b> work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of genetic polymorphisms {{in a population}} contains information about evolutionary processes. The Poisson random field (PRF) model uses the polymorphism frequency spectrum to infer the mutation rate {{and the strength of}} directional selection. The PRF model relies on an infinite-sites approximation that is reasonable for most eukaryotic populations, but that becomes problematic when θ is large (θ ≳ 0. 05). Here, we show that at large mutation rates characteristic of microbes and viruses the infinite-sites approximation of the PRF model induces systematic biases that lead it to underestimate negative <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> and mutation rates and erroneously infer positive selection. We introduce two new methods that extend our ability to infer <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> and mutation rates at large θ: a finite-site modification of the PRF model and a new technique based on diffusion theory. Our methods can be used to infer not only a “weighted average” of <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on a gene sequence, but also the {{distribution of}} <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> across sites.

40|$|Molecules with {{antibiotic}} properties, {{produced by}} various microbes, {{have been around}} long before mankind recognized their usefulness in preventing and treating bacterial infections. Bacteria have therefore been exposed to <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> from antibiotics for very long times, however, generally only on a micro-scale within the immediate vicinity of the antibiotic-producing organisms. In the twentieth century we began mass-producing antibiotics, mainly synthetic derivatives of naturally produced antibiotic molecules, but also a few entirely synthetic compounds. As a consequence, entire bacterial communities became exposed to unprecedented antibiotic <b>selection</b> <b>pressures,</b> which in turn led to the rapid resistance development we are facing today among many pathogens. We are, rightly, concerned about the direct <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> of antibiotics on the microbial communities that reside in or on our bodies. However, other environments, outside of our bodies, may also be exposed to antibiotics through different routes, most often unintentionally. There are concerns that increased <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> from antibiotics in the environment {{can contribute to the}} recruitment of resistance factors from the environmental resistome to human pathogens.

40|$|The {{response}} of an ecological system to perturbation {{can be described}} in terms of its resilience, essentially a measure of the time the system takes to return to its prior state. The resilience of an ecosystem is the result of interactions of the biota and their environment and will therefore change as the biota evolve and environmental conditions change. Ecological systems exist within the constraints of thermodynamic laws that prescribe the transfer of energy. Ecologically defined "thermodynamic imperatives," such as entropy, exergy, and ascendency, provide whole-ecosystem <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> that constrain the evolution of individuals within an ecosystem in addition to the <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> of individual evolution. The essence of these whole-ecosystem <b>selection</b> <b>pressures</b> may be captured by metrics.
