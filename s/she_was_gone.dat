On October 15, 2013, she was approached by {{a man with a}} handgun in a parking lot at the NBRS Bank in Aberdeen, Maryland. The man demanded her car, but she activated a key alarm and he fled. She was unharmed. Lt. Frederick Bundick, spokesman for the Aberdeen Police, said the two incidents appeared unrelated.|$|E
5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E

25|$|Rotti lures Shilo to the GeneCo 1st Annual post-plague Italian Renaissance Fair {{with the}} promise of a cure for her blood disease. There she finds the Largo {{brothers}} arguing about their father's will, while their sister harasses Blind Mag, GeneCo's opera singer and celebrity spokesperson. Mag uses surgically enhanced eyes but works for Rotti indefinitely as a result, having been tricked into signing her contract in blood pre-surgery. After introducing her to Mag, Rotti stations his Genterns to guard Shilo. He then announces that Mag will soon give the last GeneCo-sponsored performance of her career. GraveRobber helps Shilo escape the fairgrounds. As they hurry through the city, GraveRobber encounters several of his customers including the surgery addict Amber, who has skipped the fair she was supposed to speak at, once again publicly embarrassing her father. Under the stupor of the drug, she explains that she will be replacing Blind Mag after her eyes are repossessed following the opera. After GeneCops arrive, GraveRobber and Shilo part ways and she quickly returns to her room before Nathan notices <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{summarized}} the episode in an interview, [...] "The headline here is 'Picking up the pieces.'

Now she's back and she's {{going to find out}} what happened while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> It's going to shatter her". In a conference call interview, Pinkner and Wyman further described the episode as [...] "pretty fantastic" [...] because [...] "it's one of our most cinematic episodes". [...] "Marionette" [...] ended the episode arc begun in the season premiere, where one episode would take place entirely in one universe and then the following episode would alternate to the other; now Fringe would take place entirely in the prime universe, something that Pinkner deemed [...] "less predictable" [...] for viewers.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|In 1890, the Queen had Karim's {{portrait}} {{painted by}} Heinrich von Angeli. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim {{as he had}} never painted an Indian before and [...] "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July 1890, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross, for [...] "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household {{to look after the}} Munshi after <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. [...] Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. [...] Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to let her know that a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged. Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen: ...|$|E
500|$|On the April 18 of Impact Wrestling, James {{defeated}} Ms. Tessmacher {{to become}} the number one contender to the Knockouts Championship. James received her title match the following week, but was defeated by defending champion Velvet Sky. On the May 23 episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Sky after attacking her injured knee to become a three-time Knockouts Champion. The following week, James began portraying a villainous persona by calling out Velvet Sky, acting sarcastic and pompous towards her, and also did not help Sky when she was attacked by Gail Kim. James turned villainous on the June 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, when she attacked Sky when the latter {{said that she was}} ready for a rematch. James and Sky had their rematch on the June 27 episode of Impact Wrestling, where James retained her championship. On the July 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, James justified her actions by claiming that getting {{to the top of the}} Knockouts division requires [...] "clawing and scratching your way to the top"; James also claimed that [...] "no woman would ever be as great as her" [...] and she'll [...] "stand atop the division as the greatest Knockouts Champion of all time". On the July 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, James successfully defended the championship against Gail Kim. At the September 6 airing of Knockout Knockdown, James defeated Serena Deeb to qualify for the gauntlet battle royal finals, in which James was lastly eliminated by Gail Kim. James lost the Knockouts Championship on the September 19 episode of Impact Wrestling to ODB. Four days later, it was revealed that James had failed to come to terms on a contract renewal with TNA. James later stated in an interview that she technically wasn't under contract with TNA, but she did not confirm that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> On November 15, 2013, James appeared in an interview on WWE.com, discussing her history with WWE and the possibility of making a return to the company. At the December 6 airing of World Cup of Wrestling, James was a member of Team USA, along with James Storm, Christopher Daniels, Kazarian and Kenny King. James was defeated by Team Aces & Eights' Ivelisse Vélez following interference from the other members of Aces & Eights. Team USA would go on to defeat Team Aces & Eights in a 5-on-5 elimination tag team match, in which James gained a measure of retribution by eliminating Vélez during the match. James and Storm were presented with the trophy afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey's death shocked Laura Morgan from All About Soap, {{who could}} not believe that she was writing about her death.

Ellis said that she did not see it coming and concluded that she would miss Lynsey, who was on the path of becoming one of her [...] "favourite Hollyoaks characters". Heat columnist Sophie Wilkinson felt that the episode dealing with the aftermath of Lynsey's death was a [...] "shocker" [...] and questioned [...] "Who could kill butter-wouldn't-melt nurse Lynsey?" [...] Langford also expressed shock at her exit, saying that soaps rarely ever surprise him due to there predictability.

2500|$|In 1999 Premier Cruise Lines {{chartered}} OceanBreeze to {{the newly}} founded Imperial Majesty Cruises. Her old name, crew and hull colours were maintained, only the company name (on the hull) and the logo on the funnel was changed. Imperial Majesty placed OceanBreeze on two-night cruises from Fort Lauderdale to Nassau. The ship proved to be very popular on this route, and later in 1999 (some sources state early 2000) Imperial Majesty Cruises decided to buy her. In October 2000 she was remodeled at Newport News {{at the cost of}} $3,500,000 with more up to date interiors. [...] OceanBreeze was expected by many to continue sailing until the new SOLAS-regulations come in effect in 2010, [...] but this proved not to be, as OceanBreeze - while popular - was actually not at all well suited for the itinerary she was used for. Running a steam turbine–powered ship on two-night itineraries was highly expensive, and an additional $5 million would have been needed to convert the ship to conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition to this the ship, not having bow thrusters, needed costly assistance from tugs every time she visited a port. When another more profitable lease agreement presented in June 2003 for the MS Regal Empress, being a less restrictive ship than the OceanBreeze, Imperial Majesty Cruises decided to sell OceanBreeze for scrap. [...] A campaign entitled [...] "save the Southern Cross" [...] commenced immediately thereafter, but in [...] spite of many offers of assistance and months of hard work by an Australian-based , she was beached on 5 November 2003 at the Ahmed Muztaba Steel Industries yard located approximately 18 kilometres from Chittagong, Bangladesh and broken up for scrap metal. By late 2004, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
