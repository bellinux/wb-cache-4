40|$|The {{precision}} {{synthesis of}} poly(ionic liquid) s (PILs) in water is achieved {{for the first}} time by the cobalt-mediated radical polymerization (CMRP) of N-vinyl- 3 -alkylimidazolium-type monomers following two distinct protocols. The first involves the CMRP of various 1 -vinyl- 3 -alkylimidazolium bromides conducted in water in the presence of an alkyl–cobalt(III) complex acting as a monocomponent initiator and mediating agent. Excellent control over molar mass and dispersity is achieved at 30 °C. Polymerizations are complete in a few hours, and PIL chain-end fidelity is demonstrated up to high monomer conversions. The second route uses the commercially available bis(acetylacetonato) cobalt(II) (Co(acac) 2) in conjunction with a simple hydroperoxide initiator (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) at 30, 40, and 50 °C in water, facilitating the <b>scaling-up</b> of the <b>technology.</b> Both routes prove robust and straightforward, opening new perspectives onto the tailored synthesis of PILs under mild experimental conditions in water.

In the present study, the scale-up of ibuprofen-loaded NP produced by three manufacturing processes - salting-out, emulsification-diffusion and nanoprecipitation - was assessed at pilot-scale by increasing 20 -fold the laboratory-batch volume from 60 ml to 1. 51. Eudragit (R) L 100 - 55 and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVAL) were used as polymer and emulsifying agent, respectively. The influence of the hydrodynamic conditions on the NP characteristics such as mean size, drug content, residual PVAL and morphology was also investigated. At pilot-scale, stir-ring rates of 790 - 2000 rpm lead to NP mean sizes ranging from 557 to 174 nm for salting-out and from 562 to 230 nm for emulsification-diffusion. An increase in the stirring rate enhances the droplet break-up phenomenon {{which leads to the}} formation of finer emulsion droplets and thus smaller NP. Moreover, the influence of the stirring rate on the mean size of NP can be predicted using a model based on a simple power law. The continuous method used for nanoprecipitation scale-up allows production of NP in a reproducible way over a relatively short time. Finally, for the three methods, NP characteristics were reproduced well at both scales. However, the scale-up process induced a slight reduction in the size and drug loading of NP...|$|R

The vision is to lay foundation for the ‘Sunrise state of Andhra Pradesh’. The achievement of this vision is incumbent upon a fast paced and sustained double-digit growth delivered through a combination of programmatic and project interventions with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development. To operationalize its vision, the state government has charted out a multi-pronged strategy comprising seven missions, five grids and five campaigns. Among the seven, primary sector mission (Rythu Kosam Mission) is on the top aiming for achieving double digit growth in agriculture and allied sectors. Massive outlay of investments over five year period (2015 - 2020) are targeted in agriculture development under consortium approach by bringing state, national and international partners on board. ICRISAT leads the consortium in partnership with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and has designed a strategy to transform the agriculture and allied sectors in the state.

Electricity systems {{play a key role}} in this transformation, as cities across the world set out to implement local energy strategies via decentralised and low carbon energy systems. Such transformation is of particular relevance for cities in the global South, where rapid economic growth and an increase in energy consumption coexist with acute social needs and unmet infrastructure provision. Through a comparative study of two cities (Thane, in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India, and São Paulo, in Brazil) this thesis evaluates the way in which public and private stakeholders are implementing a new form of local energy generation through the use of domestic solar hot water (SHW) systems as a mechanism for reducing electricity consumption. By focusing on the governing mechanisms involved in <b>scaling-up</b> solar <b>technologies</b> and the ways by which these are mobilised to serve contrasting interests in the city, the thesis examines the emerging local governance of energy in the global South. The thesis uses Foucault’s analytics of governmentality as a conceptual tool aimed at unpacking the different ways by which energy in the city, in its material and socio-political formations, is thought of, mobilised, and transformed. Through a combination of interviews, site visits, and ethnographic techniques, it examines how this transformation in urban infrastructures is changing the manner in which energy is governed, the spatial and socio-political implications of this transformation, and the way in which the material dimensions of SHW systems influence the transformation process. The thesis discusses the governmental rationales involved in the making of a local governance of energy, the key governmental techniques involved in operationalizing a solar energy regime, and the multiple ways in which energy subjects are imagined within this process. ...|$|R

We follow inter-disciplinary approaches to evaluate prospects for wider promotion of SLM practices in the western highlands of Kenya. Findings from this study reveal that only 10 per cent of farmers are properly implementing the available SLM practices. Agricultural productivity is low and there is high dependence on benefits extracted from the forest resource. A positive correlation (rho = 0. 8) was found between stakeholder co-operation and success level of SLM projects. Results clearly show reasonable prospects such as some technology adoption activities and organisation of local actors that are necessary for triggering the transformation process to sustainable state of productivity. Nevertheless, technological transition could likely succeed if facilitated by enhanced stakeholder collaboration, a supportive policy environment and substantial resource mobilisation.

Clean technologies are needed that provide people and planet with safe, affordable and secure energy. PlantPower is a new additional source of electricity. It was in 1911 when the British botanist Michael C. Potter showed that bacteria can cause electrical effects accompanied by decomposition of organic matter. Nowadays, 101 years later, this electrical effect evolved into {{the development of a}} multitude of bio-electrochemical systems providing all kinds of services like wastewater treatment, electricity generation or chemical recovery. The Plant Microbial Fuel Cell (Plant-MFC) offers in-situ electricity production with living plants and bacteria. This unique combination was just invented 6 years ago and is already scaled-up to 25 square meters. The last 4 years a multidisciplinary research team explored the Plant-MFC in an EU research project. Exciting discoveries and great technological development took place over the last few years. New research questions came up and opportunities were identified to improve the system in the future. By bringing scientists, companies and entrepreneurs together we expect to bring PlantPower from the lab into the real world. The Plant-MFC is promising from a technical, environmental and economic perspective. The design criteria for the future are defined; but still development on several issues is needed.

40|$|Organic {{waste is}} the largest {{typology}} of waste generated globally, which if untreated, can causes environmental pollution and be a public health risk. The worm-based processing of organic waste is known as vermicomposting and is recognized as a sustainable approach {{for the management of}} organic waste streams. Although this technology has been around since the 1970 s and many different organic wastes have been successfully processed via vermicomposting, this technology has not been widely adopted at national or international levels. This paper explores the hypothesis that the availability of composting worms is the reason for low uptake of this technology. A market analysis of composting worm farm (vermiculture) businesses in two countries (South Africa and India) was undertaken to explore the hypothesis. It was found that the Indian market had the capacity to supply over 70, 000 kg of worms per month, whilst for the South Africa market this was 3000 kg. Both markets have the capability to increase production by two-fold or more. Overall, the study concludes that worm supply is not a barrier to the <b>scaling-up</b> of worm-based <b>technologies</b> in either country.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} {{electric field}} (RFEF) processing is as a novel technology for non-thermal inactivation of ill borne pathogens in liquid foods. Non-uniform product treatment, mainly {{due to a}} non-homogenous electric field distribution in the treatment chamber, poses challenges to the industrial <b>scaling-up</b> of the <b>technology.</b> This study investigates the electric field distribution inside RFEF treatment chambers using a 3 D COMSOL computational model. Co-linear and parallel-plate configurations of electrodes are investigated. Coupling between electric field, heat generation and fluid dynamics predicts local electric field increase in intensity at the insulator-liquid interface influencing flow pattern and temperature gradients. This shortcoming leads {{to the formation of}} hot spots that may damage the processed food and the treatment chamber due to dielectric breakdown. A novel Steinmetz treatment chamber design was proposed and simulated. This design significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution reducing the formation of hot spots. The new configuration of electrodes allows high electric field inside the treatment chamber, away from insulator-liquid interface, providing a more homogenous liquid treatment while stabilizing the process. The design however forms a dead zone where liquid recirculation occurs downstream of electrodes. This still prompts elevated local temperatures which can be controlled by reducing the number of alternating-current pulses applied to the liquid and reducing the temperature at the chamber inlet. The COMSOL model was validated by comparing simulated values of average outlet temperature with measured values from a bench-scale RFEF system, at various process conditions in NaCl solutions...|$|R

The utilization of the OFSP in Kenya despite its nutritional advantage is limited. Efforts by the Government extension service to promote the crop has had limited impact. The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute in collaboration with the International Potato Centre and farmers developed a number of OFSP technologies that can enhance its utilization. The ASARECA/AfDB-supported project “Dissemination of New Agricultural Technologies in Africa” (DONATA) for Orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) was initiated in Bungoma and Busia counties of Western Kenya in 2008. The project used the Innovation Platforms for Technology Adoption (IPTAs) approach in up-scale the proven OFSP technologies.

In spite of several chickpea varieties and production technologies recommended to farmers in the past, farmer adoption has not been encouraging. To promote better adoption, Integrated Crop Management (ICM) technologies of chickpea were introduced in potential production pockets in the Terai/inner Terai region. On-farm ICM research was initiated jointly by NARC and ICRISAT with DFID funds in 110 farmers 'fields in 1998 / 99. On the basis of encouraging results obtained in the first year, the project activities were extended to other districts subsequently. By 2004, ICM technologies were disseminated to 20 Terai districts. The ICM package consisted of high yielding disease-tolerant varieties, recommended dose of fertilizers, seed dressing with fungicides and need based foliar application of insecticides and fungicides. Results of the research indicate that ICM packages gave two to three-fold yield increase in chickpea, thereby reducing the unit cost of production and enhancing the incomes of poor and marginal farmers. Study on impact assessment of on-farm ICM research conducted in Banke, Bardia, Sarlahi and Mahottari districts reveals that adoption of the ICM package has substantially enhanced family income, increased dietary intake of chickpea among poor families and increased farmers' ability to spend on education, health and other household activities.

40|$|Electrical energy can be {{obtained}} from the controlled mixing of fresh (river) and saline (sea) water. Existing technologies such as pressure retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis make use of ion-exchange membranes which must be crossed by either the water or the ions. Recently a new physical principle has been experimentally demonstrated, which allows extraction of electrical energy without making use of membranes, based on the temporary storage of ions inside two porous electrodes kept at different electrical potentials, and the repeatable expansion/contraction of the electrostatic double layers formed inside the electrodes upon changing the salt concentration [D. Brogioli, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2009, 103, 058501]. To make further investigations and to improve the energy recovery, we developed a simple prototype cell of much larger dimensions. Because of the larger dimensions (thus higher currents), testing is more facile, while this design can be the basis for further <b>scaling-up</b> of this <b>technology.</b> In order to reduce the internal resistance of the cell, the electrodes are no longer placed side-by-side, but parallel to one another, separated only by a 250 µm-thick open spacer channel to form a “sandwich”-like flow cell.

The T 600 represents the largest LAr detector (760 t LAr mass) ever realized. It was installed and successfully operated for 3 years inside the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory from May 2010 to June 2013. One of the most important issues for the success of the detector technology is the liquid argon purity. Purity requirements become stronger and stronger with the increase of the detector dimensions: for a plant of the ICARUS T 600 size it is necessary to keep the residual electronegative impurity content to a level of the order of 0. 1 parts per billion or better all over the argon volume during the whole detector run, thus allowing the ionization tracks, created by interacting particles inside LAr, to be transported with only slight attenuation along the drift path. In this paper we present the ICARUS T 600 purification plant installed at Gran Sasso Laboratory and describe in details the solutions adopted for the LAr re-circulation and purification systems that permitted to reach impressive results in terms of LAr purity thus representing a milestone for any project involving LAr and developments at higher LAr mass scale...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) {{systems are}} special mirror {{assemblies}} that track {{the sun and}} concentrate its radiation, converting thus solar energy to medium- to high-temperature heat and through that to electricity. CSP power plants that employ air as the heat transfer fluid can benefit from commonalities in materials and design requirements within the entire spectrum of solar energy harvesting chain, namely capture, transformation and storage-related processes. Such commonalities can be exploited with the synergistic use of the gas-solid heat exchange functionality of ceramic porous structures like honeycombs and foams and the thermochemical activity of redox pair oxides. Honeycombs or foams capable of absorbing concentrated solar irradiation and therefore operating as volumetric receivers in the solar energy capture module, when coated or made entirely of redox oxide systems that can react with water or carbon dioxide, can be employed as chemical reactors {{for the production of}} the so-called solar fuels like hydrogen and syngas. In this case, the harvested solar energy is not converted directly to electricity, but into chemical bonds (chemical substances). With a similar rationale, chemically inert porous solid materials operating as regenerative recuperators during off-sun operation of air-operated Solar Tower Power Plants, if coated with or manufactured of, other oxide systems, capable of redox operation within this temperature range accompanied by significant heat effects, can render the storage concept from “purely” sensible to “hybrid” sensible/ thermochemical one within the same volume. The construction modularity of such systems provides for the design of the entire reactor/heat exchanger module as a structure with rational spatial variation of redox oxide materials chemistry and solid materials porosity in three dimensions, tailored to the local temperature and flow conditions.

Remarkably, some policies leverage four times as much investment in renewable energy as others, despite offering only half as much compensation to renewable power project developers. These results point to forces at play other than policy remuneration and generation costs alone.

40|$|The multicyclic carbonation/calcination (c/c) of CaO solid {{particles}} at {{high temperature}} {{is at the}} basis of the recently emerged Calcium-looping (CaL) technology, which {{has been shown to be}} potentially suitable for achieving high and sustainable post-combustion CO 2 capture efficiency. Despite the success of pilot plant projects at the MWth scale, a matter of concern for <b>scaling-up</b> the CaL <b>technology</b> to a commercial level (to the GWth scale) is that the CaO carbonation reactivity can be recovered only partially when the sorbent is regenerated by calcination at high temperatures (around 950 °C) as required by the CO 2 high concentration in the calciner. In order to reactivate the sorbent, a novel CaL concept has been proposed wherein a recarbonator reactor operated at high temperature/high CO 2 concentration leads to further carbonation of the solids before entering into the calciner for regeneration. Multicyclic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests demonstrate the feasibility of recarbonation to reactivate the sorbent regenerated at high calcination temperatures yet at unrealistically low CO 2 partial pressure mainly because of technical limitations concerning low heating/cooling rates. We report results from multicyclic c/c and carbonation/recarbonation/calcination (c/r/c) TGA tests at high heating/coling rates and in which the sorbent is regenerated in a dry atmosphere at high CO 2 partial pressure. It is shown that at these conditions there is a drastic drop of CaO conversion to a very small residual value in just a few cycles. Moreover, the introduction of a recarbonation stage has actually an adverse effect. Arguably, CaCO 3 decomposition in a CO 2 rich atmosphere is ruled by CO 2 dynamic adsorption/desorption in reactive CaO (1 1 1) surfaces as suggested by theoretical studies, which would preclude the growth of the regenerated CaO crystal structure along these reactive surfaces, and this effect would be intensified by recarbonation. Nevertheless, the presence of H 2 O in the calciner, which is also adsorbed/desorbed dynamically in CaO reactive planes, would shield CO 2 adsorption/desorption thus mitigating the deeply detrimental effect of CO 2 on the carbonation reactivity of the regenerated CaO structure. Oxy-combustion, which produces a significant amount of H 2 O, is currently used in pilot-scale plants to raise the temperature in the calciner. Auxiliary techniques are being explored to help heating the partially carbonated solids since oxyxombustion represents an important penalty to the CaL technology. Our study suggests that steam injection would be necessary in a dry calciner environment to avoid a sharp loss of CaO conversion if the sorbent is regenerated at high CO 2 partial pressure.

40|$|Abstract In {{response}} to population growth, rising income and urbanisation, {{the demand for}} livestock products, such as milk, meat and eggs is growing in Ethiopia. The growing demand for milk products offers opportunities for smallholders to realize better livelihoods. Whereas the growing demand for milk products in Ethiopia is widely recognised, the dairy sector {{has not been able}} to produce adequate milk to satisfy this demand, mainly due to low productivity of dairy animals. The use of technological inputs, such as improved breeds of dairy cows and cultivation of improved forages, is often seen as a prerequisite to increasing livestock productivity and resource use efficiency in the smallholder dairy sector. However, adoption of such technologies has been low, despite numerous efforts to disseminate the technologies in the past. This poses a question as to why the majority of smallholders have not adopted livestock technologies in the Ethiopian highlands. The overall objective of this study was understanding the factors affecting adoption of technologies that enhance the productivity of livestock production and water use efficiency in the Ethiopian highlands, with particular emphasis on dairy production. The study was intended to deepen the understanding on the role of factors at the levels of farm households, value chains and macroeconomic institutions and policies on farmers’ decision to adopt technologies. The study employed interdisciplinary approach to analyse micro and macro level constraints that affect adoption of technologies in livestock production. The findings in the empirical chapters show that low adoption of the technologies that enhance the productivity of livestock production and water use efficiency stem from farmers’ limited access to farm resources, differentials in potential welfare impacts of the technologies, lack of effective and reliable supply chains for inputs and outputs, inadequate physical infrastructure and weak institutions and policies. The findings show that smallholders have been subjected to multiple constraints. Given the multiple constraints at different scales and the associated transaction costs facing smallholders in rural Ethiopia, the returns to investment for the technologies may be too low to justify widespread adoption of the technologies. Therefore, adoption of technologies in the dairy sector requires interventions at production, storage, transportation, processing and marketing chains and at macroeconomic institutions and policies. In the short and medium term, dairy development programs in Ethiopia will have a better chance of success if they target farmers who have better resource endowments and who are connected to better-functioning value chains rather than blanket <b>technology</b> <b>scaling-up</b> strategies targeting the majority of smallholders. Future agricultural research needs to shift the focus from predominantly developing new biophysical technologies towards social science research that assesses issues at value chain, macroeconomic institutions and policies that influence adoption of technology...|$|R
