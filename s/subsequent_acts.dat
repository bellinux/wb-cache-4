With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, when {{alternative}} rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts</b> such as Nirvana and Pavement as {{a pioneer of}} the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was {{a return to a}} more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.|$|E

25|$|While {{under the}} Constitution, Congress could not {{prohibit}} the import slave trade until 1808, the third Congress regulated {{it in the}} Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>acts</b> in 1800 and 1803 sought to discourage the trade by limiting investment in import trading and prohibiting importation into states that had abolished slavery, which most in the North had by that time. The final Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was adopted in 1807, effective in 1808. However, illegal importation of African slaves (smuggling) was common.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate Congress {{made several}} more {{amendments}} {{over the course}} of the war to address losses suffered in battle as well as the North's greater supply of manpower. In December 1863, they abolished the practice of allowing a rich drafted man to hire a substitute to take his place in the ranks. Substitution had also been practiced in the Northern states, leading to similar resentment from the lower classes. In February 1864, the age limits were extended to between 17 and 50. Challenges to the <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts</b> came before five state supreme courts; all five upheld them.|$|E

25|$|The United States Constitution, {{adopted in}} 1787, {{prevented}} Congress from completely banning {{the importation of}} slaves until 1808, although Congress regulated it in the Slave Trade Act of 1794, and in <b>subsequent</b> <b>Acts</b> in 1800 and 1803. After the Revolution, numerous states individually passed laws against importing slaves. By contrast, the states of Georgia and South Carolina reopened their trade due to demand by their upland planters, who were developing new cotton plantations: Georgia from 1800 until December 31, 1807, and South Carolina from 1804. In that period, Charleston traders imported about 75,000 slaves, more than were brought to South Carolina in the 75 years before the Revolution. Approximately 30,000 were imported to Georgia.|$|E

[...] The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts.</b> Stuart Bailie wrote, [...] "If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency.

500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for being written by William Gibson, {{together}} with fellow science fiction novelist and long-time friend Tom Maddox. [...] "First Person Shooter" [...] {{was the second}} episode written by the authors, after {{the success of the}} fifth season episode [...] "Kill Switch", which first aired on February 15, 1998 and subsequently made frequent appearances in reruns, encouraging Gibson to continue working in television. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the writing process for [...] "First Person Shooter" [...] was slow. Initially, Gibson and Maddox presented the first two acts of their idea, which was tweaked by series creator Chris Carter and Spotnitz {{in order to make it}} feel more like an X-File. After the rewriting process, the writers then returned with the <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts.</b> Gibson and Maddox were fans of The Lone Gunmen and purposely wrote them into the episode.|$|E

[...] By 1965, the harder-edged sound of British acts, such as the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and the Yardbirds, became increasingly influential with American garage bands. [...] The raw sound of US groups, such as the Sonics, the Seeds, the Remains, the Standells, and the Shadows of Knight predicted the style of later acts.

500|$|The {{earliest}} medieval Poor Law was the Ordinance of Labourers {{which was}} issued by King Edward III of England on 18 June 1349, and revised in 1350. The ordinance was issued {{in response to}} the 1348–1350 outbreak of the Black Death in England, when an estimated 30–40% of the population had died. The decline in population left surviving workers in great demand in the agricultural economy of Britain. Landowners had to face the choice of raising wages to compete for workers or letting their lands go unused. Wages for labourers rose, and this forced up prices across the economy as goods became more expensive to produce. An attempt to rein in prices, the ordinance (and <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts,</b> such the Statute of Labourers of 1351) required that everyone who could work did; that wages were kept at pre-plague levels and that food was not overpriced. Workers saw these shortage conditions as an opportunity to flee employers and become freemen, so Edward III passed additional laws to punish escaped workers. [...] In addition, the Statute of Cambridge was passed in 1388 and placed restrictions on the movement of labourers and beggars.|$|E
