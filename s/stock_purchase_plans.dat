40|$|Financial {{economists are}} {{interested}} in whether alternative compensation plans are adopted primarily for tax, incentive or signaling reasons. As most compensation plans have tax implica-tions, examining for other effects is difficult. In this paper we examine the stock market reaction to employee <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>plans</b> which are ‘non-tax advantageous ’ and adopted for incentive/sig-naling reasons. The results suggest that (1) equity-based compensation s-themes {{have a positive effect}} on shareholder wealth for reasons other than tax reduction, (2) a motive for adopting these plans is to align managerial and shareholder interests, and (3) equity ownership motivates key executives more than subordinate employees. 1...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{participation}} {{decisions in}} employee <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>plans.</b> These plans allow employees to buy company stock {{at a discount}} from the market price and resell it immediately for a sure profit. Although an average employee stands to gain $ 3, 079 annually, only 30 % of individuals {{take advantage of this}} risk-free opportunity. Participation is more likely among employees who are familiar with stocks, are more educated, are less financially constrained, and make fewer errors in valuing financial securities. Our results suggest that compensation plans requiring active decisions by individuals can result in poor financial outcomes for employees of lower socioeconomic status. © 2014 The Author...|$|E
40|$|Employee <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>plans</b> (ESPPs) are {{designed}} to promote employee stock ownership broadly within the firm and provide another tax-deferred vehicle for individual capital accumulation in addition to traditional pensions, 401 (k) s, and stock options. We outline the individual and corporate tax treatment of ESPPs and {{the circumstances under which}} ESPPs will be preferred to cash compensation from a purely tax perspective. We then examine empirically ESPP participation using administrative data from 1997 - 2001 for a large health services company that employs approximately 30, 000 people. The picture that emerges from the analysis of these data suggests that there is substantial non-participation in these plans even though all employees could increase gross compensation through participation. We discuss a number of potential explanations for non-participation. ...|$|E
50|$|Equity based {{compensation}} is an employer compensation plan using the employer’s shares as employee compensation.

40|$|Many large listed firms offer workers the {{opportunity}} to buy shares in the firm at discounted rates through employee <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>plans</b> (ESPP). The discounted rate creates a gift exchange, where the firm hopes that workers who accept the gift reciprocate with greater loyalty and effort. But ESPPs diverge from standard gift exchange or efficiency wage models. Employees have to invest {{some of their own}} money by purchasing shares at the discounted rate to accept the gift. A sizeable number choose to reject the gift. In addition, the value of the ESPP gift varies with the share price and thus with the performance of the firm and the effort of workers in total.

40|$|Ownership {{of shares}} by {{employees}} {{in their own}} firm has grown substantially in the advanced world. In the past two decades, it increased in Britain (Pendleton, Whitfield, & Bryson, 2009), the United States (Kruse, Freeman, & Blasi, 2010), and in many EU countries (Pendleton, Poutsma, van Ommeren, & Brewster, 2005; European Federation of Employee Share Ownership, 2009). By 2004, one-fifth of British workplaces had share ownership plans covering one-third of private sector employees (Bryson & Freeman, 2010). In the United States in 2006, an estimated 18 % of workers had shares in their own firm, some held through collective employee stock ownership plans, some bought through employee <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>plans</b> that give employees a discount on shares, and some through their 401 k retirement savings Plan money. In addition to owning shares, 9 % of US employees had stock options with the firm. Taking account of the overlap, 24 % had an ownership stake through shares or options (Kruse, Blasi, & Park, 2010, Table 1) ...|$|E

For workers who buy subsidized shares, an ESPP sets up a group incentive pay system analogous to profit sharing, all-employee stock options, or an employment ownership scheme that makes part of workers' compensation depend on company performance. Using data from the UK establishments of a multinational firm that places its ESPP at the heart of its employee compensation system, we compare the workplace behaviour of employees who join the ESPP with that of observationally equivalent workers who do not join the plan. We find that workers who purchase shares at subsidized prices work harder for longer hours and have lower quit and absence rates than workers who do not join the plan, but are no more involved in co-monitoring the performance of fellow employees than non-Plan members. We also find perceptions of peers' Plan participation influences workers' behaviour. ESPP joiners socialise more with colleagues outside work: this greater sense of social identity with colleagues, predicted under some gift exchange models, lowers their costs of work effort and may explain why they are more productive than those who do not join the ESPP. These findings highlight the distinct place of subsidized share purchase schemes in the spectrum of gift exchange and group incentive pay system...|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, an {{employee}} <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>plan</b> (ESPP) is a tax-efficient {{means by which}} employees of a corporation can <b>purchase</b> the corporation's <b>stock,</b> often at a discount.

The only employees specifically excluded under the language of the ESPP were employees who worked less than five months per year or less than half-time. In reference to the independent contractors, the court held that because Microsoft conceded they were common-law employees and not independent contractors, Microsoft had no legitimate basis for rejecting their benefit claims. With regard to the individuals provided by temporary staffing agencies, the court used the following five factor test in determining whether they were truly “common law employees” and therefore eligible to participate in the plan: ...|$|R
