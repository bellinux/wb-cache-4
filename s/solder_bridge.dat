50|$|Solder mask or solder stop mask or {{solder resist}} {{is a thin}} lacquer-like layer of polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads. A <b>solder</b> <b>bridge</b> is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of solder. PCBs use solder masks to prevent this from happening. Solder mask is not always used for hand soldered assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are soldered automatically using reflow or solder bath techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the solder mask wherever components are soldered, which is accomplished using photolithography. Solder mask is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|E
40|$|In {{the surface}} mount technology, Ball Grid Array (BGA) {{has been used}} in a {{production}} of PC boards, because of their excellent characters such as high density of the lead pin pitch, better lead rigidity and self-alignment during re-flow processing. This paper deals with the development of image analysis for the detection of defects at BGA solder joints in PC boards by using X-ray images. In the conventional IC boards, it is possible to detect defects of solder joints by visual inspection, because the lead of IC package is set on its outside. However, we can't detect visually defects at BGA solder joints, because they are hidden under the IC package. In a production line, the inspection of BGA in PC boards depends on the function test of electric circuits in the final process. To improve a cost performance and the reliability of PC boards, an inspection of BGA is required in the surface mount process. Types of defects at BGA solder joints are <b>solder</b> <b>bridge,</b> missing connection, solder voids, open connection and miss-registration of parts. As we can find mostly <b>solder</b> <b>bridge</b> in these defects, we pick up this to detect <b>solder</b> <b>bridge</b> in a production line.

40|$|Process parameters; Printed circuit board(PCB) Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the typical {{soldering}} defects in lead-free wave soldering, the Design of Experiment(DOE) was conducted to optimize the process parameters. Based on the printed circuit board(PCB) experimental results, the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) was employed to analyze the experiment results quantitatively. Then the influential weights of each factor in different levels were obtained. It is concluded that the influential sequences of the four main process parameters in lead-free wave soldering are track speed, flux quantity, soldering temperature and preheat temperature; the optimal process parameters are as follows: flux quantity 40 mL·min- 1, preheat temperature 110 ℃, track speed 1. 6 m·min- 1, soldering temperature 265 ℃. Furthermore, the reasons of <b>solder</b> <b>bridging</b> and missing weld defects were discussed systematically according to the analysis results.

40|$|Flip Chip in Package (FCIP) {{has been}} {{developed}} to achieve the assembly process with area array interconnects. Particularly, a high I/O count coupled with finer pitch area array interconnects structured FCIP can be achieved using no-flow underfill assembly process. Using the assembly process, a high, stable yield assembly process recently reported with eutectic lead-tin solder interconnections, 150 µm pitch, and I/O counts in excess of 3000. The assembly process reported created {{a large number of}} voids among solder interconnects in FCIP. The voids formed among solder interconnections can propagate, grow, and produce defects such as solder joint cracking and <b>solder</b> <b>bridging.</b> Moreover, these voids can severely reduce reliability performance. Indeed, many studies were conducted to examine the void formation in FCIP. Based on the studies, flip chip geometric design, process conditions, and material formulation have been considered as the potential causes of void formation. However, the present research won't be able to identify the mechanism of void formation, causing a lot of voids in assembly process without consideration of chemical reaction in the assembly process with a fine-pitch, high I/O density FCIP. Therefore, this research will present process technology necessary to achieve high yields in FCIP assemblies using no-flow underfills and investigate the underlying problem of underfill void formation in these assemblies. The plausible causes of void formation will be investigated using experimental techniques. The techniques will identify the primary source of the void formation. Besides, theoretical models will be established to predict the number of voids and to explain the growth behavior of voids in the FCIP. The established theoretical models will be verified by experiments. These models will validate with respect to the relationship between process parameters to achieve a high yield and to minimize voids in FCIP assemblies using no-flow underfill materials regarding process as well as material stand points. Eventually, this research provides design guideline achieving a high, stable yield and void-free assembly process. Ph. D.

Two different board finishes were used, the first one being a lead-free Matte tin (100 % Sn) and the second a Sn- 37 Pb. The boards were aged in a pressure cooker {{under the influence of}} 103 ºC, 100 % RH for a time period of 30 days. The shear strength of some solder joints was measured as a function of aging and production parameters used. The void content was analysed as a function of board metallization, solder paste used and component pitch (large and small pitch). The solderability results were also analysed, where factors such as wetting, <b>solder</b> balls, <b>bridges,</b> and <b>solder</b> joint shape were compared. The results show that Matte tin is the preferred board finish when using the lead free solder paste.

The shear test results show that the un-aged boards attained a higher shear strength compared to the aged ones. Two failure modes were however observed during the shear testing. The majority of the aged samples showed complete pad lift-off while un-aged samples showed a fracture through the solder joint.

40|$|There {{are growing}} demands to {{characterize}} the stability of assemblies of optical components for ultrahigh-precision instruments. In this paper we demonstrate how absolute length measurements by interferometry {{can be applied to}} measure the thermal and dimensional stability of connections. In order to enable investigation of common joining techniques, including wringing, screwing, and gluing, as well as specialized, inorganic joining techniques such as silicatic bonding, thin-film soldering, and solderjet bumping, representative connections were fabricated. By using gage blocks or prismatic bodies as joining parts, parallelism and flatness were provided which are needed for precision interferometric length measurements. The stability of connection elements used in ultrahigh-precision instruments was investigated longitudinally and laterally to the connection interface, and also mutual tilting of the parts was detected by analysis of the phase topographies. The measurements have an accuracy level of about 1 nm, and the traditional wringing method was also considered as a reference joining technique. The long-term behavior was studied within a period of about 1 year under constant temperature. Further, the thermal dilatation and the reaction of connections to thermal stress were measured. Results show that screwed connections do not exhibit a significant drift of length or orientation. They also did not show response to temperature variations of +/- 10 degrees C. This is different for adhesive connections, where dimensional changes of up to 100 nm were observed. The specimens produced by using thin-film soldering as well as silicatic bonding revealed stability of length better than 5 nm per year and angular stability within +/- 0. 1 arcsec. Furthermore, these specimens were shown to be insensitive to a temporary temperature variation in a range from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. This situation is slightly different for the sample connections produced by solderjet bumping, which show a positive length change of similar to 25 nm and a tilt of +/- 1 arcsec. These observations can be explained by creeping of the relatively large <b>solder</b> bumps that <b>bridge</b> a gap of about 100 mu m between the connected mirror plates. The thermal expansion of the connections shows a strong correlation with the "layer thickness"...|$|R
