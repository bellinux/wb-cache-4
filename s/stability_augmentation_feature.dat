40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the modelling and control of a one-degree-of-freedom (1 DOF) twin-rotor multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system (TRMS). The behaviour of the TRMS in certain aspects resembles that of a helicopter. Hence, it is an interesting identication and control problem. A dynamic model characterizing the TRMS in hover is extracted using a black-box system identication technique. The extracted model is employed in the design of a feedback linear quadratic Gaussian compensator, namely the <b>stability</b> <b>augmentation</b> system (SAS). This has a good tracking capability but requires high control eort and has inadequate authority over residual vibration of the system. These problems are resolved by further augmenting the system with a com-mand path prelter, resulting in the command and <b>stability</b> <b>augmentation</b> system (CSAS). The com-bined feedforward and feedback compensator satises the performance objectives and obeys the actuator constraint. The control law is implemented in realtime on the TRMS platform...|$|R
