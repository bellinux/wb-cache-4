5|$|Refined <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> {{made from}} raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E
5|$|Refined <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> {{widely used}} for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. Refined <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500). The level of purity {{associated with the}} colors of sugar, expressed by standard number ICUMSA, the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate the higher purity of sugar.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E

5|$|Pliny gives special {{attention}} to spices, such as pepper, ginger, and cane sugar. He mentions different varieties of pepper, whose values are comparable with that of gold and silver, while <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> noted only for its medicinal value.|$|E
5|$|Kanafeh, a {{well-known}} dessert in the Arab World and Turkey. Made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center, {{the top layer}} of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Nablus, to the present day is famed for its kanafeh, partly due to its use of a white-brined cheese called Nabulsi after the city. Boiled <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> used as a syrup for kanafeh.|$|E
5|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell is an English cookery book by the cookery and {{housekeeping}} writer Thomas Dawson, {{first published}} in 1585. It includes recipes for medicines as well as food. To the spices found in Medieval English cooking, the book adds herbs, especially parsley and thyme. <b>Sugar</b> <b>is</b> used {{in many of the}} dishes, along with now-unfamiliar ingredients like violets and rosewater.|$|E
30|$|Total <b>sugar</b> {{concentration}} <b>was</b> {{measured by}} phenol–sulfuric acid method. Reducing <b>sugar</b> <b>was</b> measured by DNS method, as d-glucose equivalents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sugaring</b> <b>is</b> a food {{preservation}} method similar to pickling. <b>Sugaring</b> <b>is</b> {{the process of}} desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This <b>sugar</b> can <b>be</b> crystalline {{in the form of}} table or raw sugar, or it can <b>be</b> a high <b>sugar</b> density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.|$|R
5000|$|By early 2007 <b>Sugar</b> could <b>be</b> installed, {{with some}} difficulty, on several Linux distributions, and in virtual {{machines}} on other operating systems. By mid-2008 <b>Sugar</b> <b>was</b> {{available on the}} Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora distributions of Linux; e.g., as of Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), <b>Sugar</b> could <b>be</b> installed from the official Ubuntu universe repositories. By mid-2009 <b>Sugar</b> <b>was</b> also available on openSUSE and other Linux distributions. <b>Sugar</b> 0.82.1 <b>was</b> included in the OLPC system software release 8.2.0 for XO-1 laptops. <b>Sugar</b> 0.86 <b>was</b> released on September 30, 2009. <b>Sugar</b> 0.88 <b>was</b> released on March 31, 2010. <b>Sugar</b> 0.90.0 <b>was</b> released in October, 2010. There were three releases in 2011 and one in June 2012, which included support for the ARM architecture on the XO 1.75.

5|$|Based on {{analyses}} of fruit bodies collected in Portugal, there are 367 kilocalories per 100 grams of bolete (as dry weight). The macronutrient composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 17.9 grams of protein, 72.8 grams of carbohydrates, and 0.4 grams of fat. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 92% water. The predominant <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> trehalose (4.7 grams/100 grams dry weight; all following values assume this mass), with lesser amounts of mannitol (1.3 grams). There are 6 grams of tocopherols, {{the majority of}} which is gamma-tocopherol (vitamin E), and 3.7 grams of ascorbic acid.|$|E
5|$|Brown <b>Sugar</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} album of American R singer and multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo. It was {{released}} on July 4, 1995, by EMI Music. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1994 to 1995 at Battery Studios and RPM Studios in New York City and at the Pookie Lab in Sacramento. Production, instrumentation, arrangements, and songwriting were primarily handled by D'Angelo, who employed both vintage recording equipment and modern electronic devices. Brown Sugar contains themes of love and romance, and features a fusion of contemporary R and traditional soul music, along with elements of funk, quiet storm, and hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>sugaring</b> <b>is</b> {{to create an}} {{environment}} hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. <b>Sugaring</b> <b>is</b> commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time <b>sugaring</b> has also <b>been</b> used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.|$|R
50|$|The vaccine's {{polysaccharide}} <b>sugars</b> <b>are</b> grown {{separately in}} soy peptone broths. Through reductive amination, the <b>sugars</b> <b>are</b> directly conjugated to the protein carrier CRM197 {{to form the}} glycoconjugate. CRM197 is grown in C. diphtheriae strain C7 in a medium of casamino acids and yeast extracts.|$|R
50|$|A sugarloaf was {{the usual}} form in which refined <b>sugar</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} and sold until the late 19th century, when granulated and cube <b>sugars</b> <b>were</b> introduced. A tall cone with a rounded top was the end-product of {{a process in which}} the dark molasses-rich raw <b>sugar,</b> which <b>was</b> imported from <b>sugar</b> cane growing regions such as the Caribbean and Brazil, refined into white sugar.|$|R
5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> used as a syrup for kanafeh.|$|E
5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of rum is common throughout the island. <b>Sugar</b> cane <b>was</b> first introduced {{on the island}} when the Dutch colonised it in 1638. Even then, the propensity of making rum out of <b>sugar</b> cane <b>was</b> strongly recognised. <b>Sugar</b> cane <b>was</b> mainly cultivated for the {{production of}} [...] "arrack", a precursor to rum. Only much later, after almost 60 years, the first proper <b>sugar</b> <b>was</b> produced.|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>sugars</b> <b>are</b> also {{produced}} {{as a consequence}} of the malting process that eventually produces beer. The complex <b>sugars</b> <b>are</b> not broken down by the yeast, and are eventually consumed by the beer drinker, possibly causing flatulence. Homebrewers have found adding Beano to their brew may produce a beer that has a less malty flavor. The Beano breaks the complex sugars into simple sugars, and these simple <b>sugars</b> <b>are</b> consumed by the yeast, producing alcohol (or some acetic acid in the aerobic reactions in early fermentation).|$|R
50|$|Kwarezimal was {{developed}} by the Knights of Malta. The word kwarezimal refers to quaresima, the forty days of Lent. <b>Sugar</b> <b>was</b> not avoided during Lent as some practice it today. Unlike today, <b>sugar</b> <b>was</b> considered a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities.|$|R
5|$|In {{the season}} one finale, Shelby adopts Quinn and Puck's newborn daughter, Beth. She leaves Vocal Adrenaline before the {{beginning}} of the next school year. Shelby returns in the second episode of the third season, having been recruited to lead a second glee club at McKinley High by Sugar Motta's father when <b>Sugar</b> <b>is</b> refused entry into New Directions. Shelby offers to include both Quinn and Puck in Beth's life. Struggling at being a mother, she forms a romantic bond with eighteen-year-old student Puck, leading to a sexual relationship before she tells him that their relationship is a mistake and resigns from McKinley in the eighth episode. While Menzel's musical performances on the show have been lauded, Shelby's storylines were characterized as rushed, incomprehensible and polarizing by contemporary reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin. If this <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the coffee is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E
25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of sugar in the grape must. In the normal chaptalization process, cane <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> {{the most common type}} of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|Mill white, {{also called}} {{plantation}} white, crystal sugar or superior <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> produced from raw sugar. It {{is exposed to}} sulfur dioxide during the production to reduce the concentration of color compounds and helps prevent further color development during the crystallization process. Although common to sugarcane-growing areas, this product does not store or ship well. After a few weeks, its impurities tend to promote discoloration and clumping; therefore this type of <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> generally limited to local consumption.|$|E
25|$|Added <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> {{not always}} evident in food products. While {{expected}} in desserts, candies, and soft drinks, <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> also {{added to a}} wide range of non-sweet items such as bread, crackers, potato chips, peanut butter, soup, salad dressing, ketchup, mayonnaise, and many other common sauces. Forms of added sugar include technically accurate, but misleading, terms such as cane juice, evaporated cane juice, corn syrup and corn syrup solids, malt syrup, rice syrup, dextrose, maltose, maltodextrin, molasses, treacle, and xylose.|$|E
25|$|For {{conventional}} {{jams and}} marmalades that contain above 60% sugar and soluble fruit solids, high-ester pectins are used. With low-ester pectins and amidated pectins less <b>sugar</b> <b>is</b> needed, so that diet products can be made.|$|E
50|$|The armed/disarmed {{approach}} to glycosylation {{is an effective}} way to prevent sugar molecules from self-glycosylation when synthesizing disaccharides. This approach was first recognized when acetylated sugars only acted as glycosyl acceptors when reacted with benzylated sugars. The acetylated <b>sugars</b> <b>were</b> termed “disarmed” while the benzylated <b>sugars</b> <b>were</b> termed “armed”.|$|R
