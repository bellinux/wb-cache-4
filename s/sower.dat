5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the <b>sower,</b> at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the <b>sower</b> as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The <b>Sower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Limited {{access to}} life outside the clinic {{resulted}} in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The <b>Sower</b> and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.|$|E

5|$|Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre {{production}} The Elephant Man, {{which he}} undertook wearing no stage make-up, and which earned high praise for his expressive performance. He played the part 157 times between 1980 and 1981. Christiane F. – We Children from Bahnhof Zoo, a 1981 biographical film {{focusing on a}} young girl's drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, Christiane F. (1981), featured much material from his Berlin Trilogy albums. Bowie starred in The Hunger (1983), with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. In Nagisa Oshima's film the same year, Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, based on Laurens van der Post's novel The Seed and the <b>Sower,</b> Bowie played Major Jack Celliers, {{a prisoner of war}} in a Japanese internment camp.

25|$|Koester adds insight when he {{concluded}} that Thomas did not evolve from the editing of Synoptic parables but from an independent oral source. From “careful analysis of {{the parable of the}} <b>Sower</b> in the Synoptics and Thomas, John Homan concludes not only that the version in Thomas is independent, but that it does indeed permit us to recover {{an earlier version of this}} parable.” These examples provide evidence that Crossan’s theory may be accurate when he discusses an early dating of Thomas and the independent oral source.|$|E

500|$|Between 1885 and {{his death}} in 1890, Van Gogh {{appears to have been}} {{building}} an oeuvre, a collection that reflected his personal vision, and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word [...] "purposeful" [...] to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies. He painted many series of studies; most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends. The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre: those he thought the most important from that time were The <b>Sower,</b> Night Cafe, Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.|$|E
