50|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, farmers began {{gathering}} medicinal herbs from meadows and woods and to ply a trade with them. Important to the herbal lore were, among others, <b>spignel,</b> lovage, angelica, valerian and rhubarb. From the rootsâ€™ essential oils they mixed medicinal tinctures, essences and pills. Not least of all, they burnt schnaps. The research establishment {{grew out of}} this. Later, herbs were grown in dedicated fields, with angelica plants even being grown as late as 1989. The roots were exported to several European countries and overseas. With {{the changes in the}} East Bloc, local herb growers were left to themselves and their herbs.|$|E
