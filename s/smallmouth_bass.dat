50|$|California’s archaeological {{record has}} contributed to {{knowledge}} of the prehistoric distribution of fishes in Alameda Creek and its tributaries including Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus), Sacramento suckers (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), Tule perch (Hysterocarpus traskii), Hitches (Lavinia exilicauda), Hardheads (Mylopharodon conocephalus), Sacramento blackfish, and Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis). Many of these fishes still occupy the creek, {{although the number of}} introduced exotic fishes continues to increase. Exotic fish species such as the largemouth and <b>Smallmouth</b> <b>basses</b> (Micropterus salmoides and Micropterus dolomieui) respectively, were introduced to Alameda Creek (and the Napa River) by Livingston Stone in 1874.|$|R
50|$|The black {{bass are}} {{distributed}} throughout {{a large area}} east of the Rocky Mountains in North America, from the Hudson Bay basin in Canada to northeastern Mexico. Several species, notably the Largemouth and <b>Smallmouth</b> <b>basses,</b> have been very widely introduced throughout the world, and are now considered cosmopolitan. Black bass of all species are highly sought-after game fish, and bass fishing is an extremely popular sport throughout the bass's native range. These fish are well known as strong fighters, and their meat is eaten, being quite edible and firm.|$|R
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass,</b> bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, channel catfish, and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania State Game Land Number 84 {{is located}} {{immediately}} south of Mahanoy Creek between Helfenstein and Dornsife. The Sen. James J.

Catch and release fishing of <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass</b> and largemouth bass is permitted on the creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{confluence}} of Twomile Run with Kettle Creek was completely devoid {{of fish in}} 1967, but by 1997, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed two species of fish, white sucker and <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass</b> in this location. Twomile Run has the highest potential fish biodiversity of all streams in the Kettle Creek watershed, with a Potential Species Richness of 232 to 241 in places.|$|E

5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass,</b> walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E
25|$|The creek's estuary {{below the}} dam at Saugerties {{has also become}} a popular spot for bass fishing.

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass,</b> the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass,</b> largemouth bass, and chain pickerel.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass.</b> From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E

5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass,</b> rock bass, channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass,</b> largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for <b>smallmouth</b> <b>bass</b> was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E
