They rested {{one hand on}} the first (<b>conditioning)</b> <b>surface.</b> After a fixed conditioning period they transferred their hand to the second (test) surface and judged whether the test surface was convex or concave. In experiment 1 the curvature of the <b>conditioning</b> <b>surface</b> was varied; the subject's judgment of convexity or concavity of the test surface was strongly shifted in the direction opposite to the curvature of the <b>conditioning</b> <b>surface</b> (negative aftereffect). Therefore, subjects judged a flat surface to be concave after being exposed to a convex <b>surface.</b> After a <b>conditioning</b> period of 5 s the shift was about 20 % of the curvature of the <b>conditioning</b> <b>surface.</b> In experiment 2 the duration of the conditioning period was varied; the magnitude of the aftereffect could be described by a first-order integrator with a time constant of 2 s. In experiment 3 the time interval between the conditioning period and the touching of the second surface was varied; the magnitude of the aftereffect could be described by an exponential decay with a time constant of 40 s.

The propagation velocity of the wave is not reduced and is essentially that of a wave traveling in the same medium {{in the absence of any}} conductor at all. Furthermore, practical launchers need not have a cross-section that is a large portion of a wavelength. Energy associated with the wave is confined to a region determined by the diameter and geometry of the conductor rather than the wavelength of the propagating signal. The Launcher has a low frequency cutoff limited by launcher length along the conductor.|$|E

40|$|Objective : To {{evaluate}} the surface roughness of the ceramic samples subsequent to various <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> methods using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) {{and to find out}} the best <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> methods in feldspathic and IPS-Empress- 2. Materials and methods: A total of 120 disk samples were prepared for the present study. Samples were divided into namely Group A: Feldspathic (60) and Group B IPS-Empress - 2 (60). They were further subdivided into six groups each containing nine samples each based on different <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning.</b> After each <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> method, the surface roughness of one sample from the <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> groups and the control group were subjected to SEM for determining the surface roughness in the two groups. These samples were not used for the shear bond test because the measurements destroyed the surfaces. Results: The shear bond strength of metal brackets bonded to feldspathic ceramic surface when sandblasting with aluminum oxide yielded the highest (14. 64 ± 2. 14 MPa) and least among the control groups (0 MPa). The shear bond strength of metal brackets bonded to IPS-Empress- 2 ceramic surface when sandblasting with aluminum oxide with silane yielded the highest (10. 19 ± 0. 56 MPa) and least among the control groups (0 MPa). Conclusion: <b>Surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> with Co-Jet sand which produced silicatization resulted in a favorable bond strength in both feldspathic and IPS-Empress- 2 ceramic surfaces.

40|$|Objectives: To give an {{overview}} of aspects of silane coupling agents and <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> in dentistry. Methods: Currently, silane coupling agents are used as adhesion promoters. Silanes are effective in enhancing adhesion between resin composite and silica-based ceramics. They do not bond effectively to non-silica based dental restorative materials. <b>Surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> of non-silica based ceramics with silica coating improves the bonding. This current overview {{will focus on the}} silane coupling agents: their properties, limitations in adhesion promotion and the clinical problems with the use of silanes. It will also focus on the current <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> methods as well as new <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> techniques to enhance the bonding through conventional silanization approaches. Results: Several <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> methods are being used clinically to enhance the adhesion of resin composites to non-silica based restorative materials. Other approaches are under investigation. The clinical problem of using silanes in adhesion promotion is the bond degradation over time in oral environment. Significance: The current silane coupling agents are not ideal. The current silane coupling agents can fulfill the minimum requirements in clinical practice to enhance the bonding of resin composite to dental restorative materials. Developments of novel <b>surface</b> <b>conditioning</b> methods and silane coupling agents are required to address the bond durability problem. © 2012 Academy of Dental Materials.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess microleakage in {{conservative}} class V cavities prepared with aluminum-oxide air abrasion or turbine and restored with self-etching or etch-and-rinse adhesive systems. Materials and Methods: Forty premolars {{were randomly assigned}} to 4 groups (I and II: air abrasion; III and IV: turbine) and class V cavities were prepared on the buccal <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Conditioning</b> approaches were: groups I/III - 37 % phosphoric acid; groups II/IV - self-priming etchant (Tyrian-SPE). Cavities were restored with One Step Plus/Filtek Z 250. After finishing, specimens were thermocycled, immersed in 50 % silver nitrate, and serially sectioned. Microleakage at the occlusal and cervical interfaces was measured in mm and calculated by a software. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: Marginal seal provided by air abrasion was similar to high-speed handpiece, except for group I. There was SIGNIFICANT difference between enamel and dentin/cementum margins for to group I and II: air abrasion. The etch-and-rinse adhesive system promoted a better marginal seal. At enamel and dentin/cementum margins, the highest microleakage values were found in cavities treated with the self-etching adhesive system. At dentin/cementum margins, high-speed handpiece preparations associated with etch-and-rinse system provided the least dye penetration. CONCLUSION: Marginal seal of cavities prepared with aluminum-oxide air abrasion was different from that of conventionally prepared cavities, and the etch-and-rinse system promoted higher marginal seal at both enamel and dentin margins.

Shear-off-techniques were utilized to test the firmness of the compounds. Clogged Wirobond ® C and Wiron ® NT metal plates of different sizes were employed as test specimen. The clogging was accomplished by Compolute ® or PANAVIA F ® adhesives. An intermediate silicate layer was spreaded using either the Rocatec technology or a blow torch (pyrolysis conditions). In order to scrutinize {{the effect of the}} oral environment on the compound firmness, samples were exposed to an artificial aging process. The quality of the fracture was determined by visual evaluation of the fractured surfaces, with the presence of plastics on the sheared surfaces being the decisive criterion. In the following, a summary {{of the results of the}} underlying studies is given. All compound combinations exhibited the required minimal firmness of 5 MPa according to the ISO supplement 10477. Compolute ® adhesive in combination with the Rocatec technology assured the highest values. However, pyrolytic conditionings gave varying results depending on the adhesive employed. Generally, Compolute ® was shown to afford higher firmness values than PANAVIA F ®. The lowest values were obtained for the alloy primer compound using PANAVIA F ®. Furthermore, it was unambiguously proven that the spreading of an additional silicate-based intermediate layer allows the preparation of a highly stable metal-plastics compound that exhibits excellent resistance to hydrolysis conditions. Upon artificial aging, the adhesive power of the investigated metal-plastics compounds decreased dramatically. Consistently, the fractured surfaces did not show any remaining plastics residues. The other fractures featured varying fracture qualities leaving behind crescent-shaped notches in the plastics surfaces. The deformation of the adhesive geometry prior to fracture might account for this observed demolition of the plastics. The application of pyrolytic conditioning with a modified blow torch constitutes a convenient means for the onsite manipulation by the dentist, since the observed adhesion values are coequal to those derived from coventional adhesion methodologies...|$|R

Although Mg ions are essential to the human body, an excess may cause undesirable health effects. Therefore, surface treatments are required to enhance the corrosion resistance of magnesium parts, decreasing its rate to biocompatible levels and allowing its safe application as bioresorbable metallic implants. The application of biocompatible silane coatings is envisaged as a suitable strategy for retarding the corrosion process of magnesium alloys.

Although the flow slows down at the flat landing, the strong acceleration on the top surface increases the heat transfer coefficient on the tube <b>surface.</b> Air <b>Conditioning</b> and Refrigeration Project 11...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the computational procedure and results from large-eddy simulations {{in a complex}} three-dimensional louver geometry. The three-dimensionality in the louver geometry occurs along {{the height of the}} fin, where the angled louver transitions to the flat landing and joins with the tube surface. The transition region is characterized by a swept leading edge and decreasing flow area between louvers. Preliminary results show a high energy compact vortex jet forming in this region. The jet forms {{in the vicinity of the}} louver junction with the flat landing and is drawn under the louver in the transition region. Its interaction with the surface of the louver produces vorticity of the opposite sign, which aids in augmenting heat transfer on the louver surface. The top surface of the louver in the transition region experiences large velocities in the vicinity of the surface and exhibits higher heat transfer coefficients than the bottom <b>surface.</b> Air <b>Conditioning</b> and Refrigeration Project 9...|$|R
