50|$|The {{traditional}} approach in performing epidemiological trials by using paper questionnaires is both costly and time-consuming.

Modern IT technology provides means for <b>storage,</b> <b>organization</b> and retrieval of large amounts of biological and lifestyle data, which will ensure more data and more reliable statistical results. Efficient number crunching computing, using modern analytical tools and simulation based inference procedures allow knowledge to be extracted from the resulting large and complex data-structures. Web portals directly connected to the studies enables instant feedback and information to the participants. It also allows animations and other web based tools linked to the questionnaires, which can increase the interactivity and facilitates flow of information between the study participant and the study centre. The web portal will also generate a possibility for the Universities to carry out the third assignment, which is to spread the knowledge generated at the University to the public.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The star schema {{model has}} been widely used as the facto DW <b>storage</b> <b>organization</b> on {{relational}} database management systems (RDBMS). The physical division in normalized fact tables (with metrics) and denormalized dimension tables allows a trade-off between performance and storage space while, {{at the same time}} offering a simple business understanding of the overall model as a set of metrics (facts) and attributes for business analysis (dimensions). However, the underlying premises of such trade-off between performance and storage have changed. Nowadays, storage capacity increased significantly at affordable prices (below 50 $/terabyte) with improved transfer rates, and faster random access times particularly with modern SSD disks. In this paper we evaluate if the underlying premises of the star schema model <b>storage</b> <b>organization</b> still upholds. We propose an alternative <b>storage</b> <b>organization</b> (called ONE) that physically stores the whole star schema into a single relation, providing a predictable and scalable alternative to the star schema model. We use the TPC-H benchmark to evaluate ONE and the star schema model, assessing both the required storage size and query execution time...|$|E

Second, both column-stores and row-stores display performance advantages for different types of queries, and for high performance both should be implemented as options for the tuple-storage layout.

40|$|The {{literature}} has witnessed much work {{aimed at improving}} the efficiency of mernory systems. The motivation is obvious: {{the high cost of}} page faults in hierarchical stores. Most architectures, including vector processors, shared - and distributed - memory multiprocessors, and interleaved memories, similarly reward data locality and predictable patterns of access. Most current endeavors, however, prefix the <b>storage</b> <b>organization</b> of data operands and either manipulate loops in the code, tailor algorithms, or tune prefetching strategies and replacement policies. A methodology and an algorithm for automatically organizing the storage of array data for efficient access by the executing code are described. The simple techniques presented may be incorporated in a compiler and are complementary to the other optimizations in the literature. Furthermore, examples in Fortran 8 X and Fortran 77 pseudo-code support the general applicability of the work to programming languages, both scalar as well as array. Notwithstanding the column-major storage constraints, a technique for optiimizing storage in Fortran 77 is outlined.

Starting from the high-level behavioral specification {{of a given}} application, several memory management tasks are addressed in a common algebraic framework, using datadependence analysis techniques {{similar to those used}} in modern compilers. This software system can compute the minimum data storage required by a given application and can produce the graph of storage variation during the code execution; it can perform an energy-efficient assignment of the multidimensional signals from the specification to the memory layers, followed by a storage-efficient mapping of signals to the physical memory. The last phase of the methodology is a novel approach for powerefficient banking of the on-chip memory. keywordsâ€”Memory management, memory allocation, embedded signal processing systems, signal-to-memory mapping.

The experimental results of the proposed algorithms show that performance gains of up to 716 % are achieved, when compared with standard schemes. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are not very sensitive to the change in the query distribution.
