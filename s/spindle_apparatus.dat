The data obtained using the apparatus can be used by students to select the optimal preload level for a <b>spindle.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> was designed as four subsystems (one for each measurement) that were integrated into a cohesive measurement system. The apparatus is designed to be as small, light, and user-friendly as possible, in order for students to use it effectively. The apparatus is capable of measuring bearing preload up to 10, 000 lbs with a linearity of 0. 05 % and radial error motion with an accuracy of +/- 0. 00012 in. (3 [mu]m). It can measure the radial stiffness of the spindle for applied loads up to 500 lbs and running torque up to 443 in-lbs (50 N-m).

40|$|Activation of the mitotic {{checkpoint}} pathway {{in response}} to mitotic spindle damage in eukaryotic cells delays the exit from mitosis {{in an attempt to}} prevent chromosome missegregation. One component of this pathway, hsMad 2, has been shown in mammalian cells to physically associate with components of a ubiquitin ligase activity (termed the anaphase promoting complex or APC) when the checkpoint is activated, thereby preventing the degradation of inhibitors of the mitotic exit machinery. In the present report, we demonstrate that the inhibitory association between Mad 2 and the APC component Cdc 27 also takes place transiently during the early stages of a normal mitosis and is lost before mitotic exit. We also show that Mad 2 associates with the APC regulatory protein p 55 Cdc in mammalian cells as has been reported in yeast. In contrast, however, this complex is present only in nocodazole-arrested or early mitotic cells and is associated with the APC as a Mad 2 /p 55 Cdc/Cdc 27 ternary complex. Evidence for a Mad 2 /Cdc 27 complex that forms independent of p 55 Cdc also is presented. These results suggest a model for the regulation of the APC by Mad 2 and may explain how the <b>spindle</b> assembly checkpoint <b>apparatus</b> controls the timing of mitosis under normal growth conditions...|$|R

50|$|Cell {{division}} {{orientation is}} of the major importance for tissue architecture, cell fates and morphogenesis. Cells tend to divide along their long axis according of so-called Hertwig rule. The axis of cell division {{is determined by the}} orientation of the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Cells divide along the line connecting two centrosomes of <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus.</b> After formation, the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> undergoes rotation inside the cell. The astral microtubules, originating from centrosomes reach the cell membrane where they are pulled towards specific cortical clues. In vitro, the distribution of cortical clues set up by the adhesive pattern. In vivo polarity cues are determined by localization of Tricellular junctions localized at cell vertices. The spatial distribution of cortical clues leads to the force field that determine final spingle apparatus orientation and following orientation of cell division.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{initiation}} of meiosis {{and the relationship of}} this event with other key cytogenetic processes are major goals in studying the genetic control of meiosis in higher plants. Our genetic and structural analysis of two mutant alleles of the ameiotic 1 gene (am 1 and am 1 -praI) suggest that this locus plays an essential role in {{the initiation}} of meiosis in maize. The product of the ameiotic 1 gene affects an earlier stage in the meiotic sequence than any other known gene in maize and is important for the irreversible commitment of cells to meiosis and for crucial events marking the passage from premeiotic interphase into prophase I including chromosome synapsis. It appears that the period of ameiotic 1 gene function in meiosis at a minimum covers the interval from some point during premeiotic interphase until the early zygotene stage of meiosis. To study the interaction of genes in the progression of meiosis, several double meiotic mutants were constructed. In these double mutants (i) the ameiotic 1 mutant allele was brought together with the meiotic mutation (afd 1) responsible for the fixation of centromeres in meiosis; and with the mutant alleles of the three meiotic genes that control homologous chromosome segregation (dv 1, ms 43 and ms 28), which impair microtubule organizing center organization, the orientation of the <b>spindle</b> fiber <b>apparatus,</b> and the depolymerization of spindle filaments after the first meiotic division, respectively; (ii) the afd 1 mutation was combined with two mutations (dsy 1 and as 1) affecting homologous pairing; (iii) the ms 43 mutation was combined with the as 1, the ms 28 and the dv 1 mutations; and (iv) the ms 28 mutation was combined with the dv 1 mutation and the ms 4 (polymitotic 1) mutations. An analysis of gene interaction in the double mutants led us to conclude that the ameiotic 1 gene is epistatic over the afd 1, the dv 1, the ms 43 and the ms 28 genes but the significance of this relationship requires further analysis. The afd gene appears to function from premeiotic interphase throughout the first meiotic division, but it is likely that its function begins after the start of the ameiotic 1 gene expression. The afd 1 gene is epistatic over the two synaptic mutations dsy 1 and as 1 and also over the dv 1 mutation.

50|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is a molecular safe-guarding mechanism that governs proper chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cells.SAC inhibits progression into anaphase until all homologous chromosomes (bivalents, or tetrads) are properly aligned to the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Only then, SAC releases its inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), {{which in turn}} irreversibly triggers progression through anaphase.|$|E
50|$|The {{cellular}} <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{includes the}} spindle microtubules, associated proteins, which include kinesin and dynein molecular motors, condensed chromosomes, and any centrosomes or asters {{that may be}} present at the spindle poles depending on the cell type. The <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> is vaguely ellipsoid in cross section and tapers at the ends. In the wide middle portion, known as the spindle midzone, antiparallel microtubules are bundled by kinesins. At the pointed ends, known as spindle poles, microtubules are nucleated by the centrosomes in most animal cells. Acentrosomal or anastral spindles lack centrosomes or asters at the spindle poles, respectively, and occur for example during female meiosis in most animals. In this instance, a Ran GTP gradient is the main regulator of spindle microtubule organization and assembly. In fungi, spindles form between spindle pole bodies embedded in the nuclear envelope, which does not break down during mitosis.|$|E
5000|$|Gene {{transcription}} ceases during prophase {{and does}} not resume until late anaphase to early G1 phase. The nucleolus also disappears during early prophase. [...] Close to the nucleus of animal cells are structures called centrosomes, consisting {{of a pair of}} centrioles surrounded by a loose collection of proteins. The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell's microtubules. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division, which is duplicated by the cell before a new round of mitosis begins, giving a pair of centrosomes. The two centrosomes polymerize tubulin to help form a microtubule <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Motor proteins then push the centrosomes along these microtubules to opposite sides of the cell. Although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly, they are not essential for the formation of the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus,</b> since they are absent from plants, and are not absolutely required for animal cell mitosis.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{animal and plant}} systems support the 'long axis rule'. The studied systems include the mouse embryo, Drosophila epithelium, Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers [...] and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).The {{mechanism}} of the 'long axis rule' relies on interphase cell long axis sensing. However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on {{the orientation of the}} cell division is made by the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the interphase cell long axis. The cell then divides along the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ) participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about interphase cell shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in Drosophila melanogaster and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.|$|E
50|$|Astral microtubules are not {{required}} for the progression of mitosis, but {{they are required to}} ensure the fidelity of the process.

50|$|Analysis of the {{interactions}} between asbestos fibers and DNA has shown that phagocytosed fibers {{are able to make}} contact with chromosomes, often adhering to the chromatin fibers or becoming entangled within the chromosome.

50|$|KIF15 (also {{known as}} Kinesin-12 and HKLP2) is a motor protein {{expressed}} in all cells during mitosis and in postmitotic neurons undergoing axon growth. KIF15 maintains bipolar microtubule <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> in dividing cells and shares redundant functions with KIF11. KIF15 {{is thought to}} promote spindle assembly by cross-linking and sliding along microtubules creating a separation between centrosomes. HeLa cells depleted of KIF11, with reduced microtubule dynamics, are able to form bipolar spindles from acentrosomal asters in a KIF15 dependent manner.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the process}} of mitosis used by {{eukaryotic}} cells, binary fission takes place without {{the formation of a}} <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> in the cell. The single DNA molecule first replicates, then attaches each copy to {{a different part of the}} cell membrane. When the cell begins to pull apart, the replicated and original chromosomes are separated. The consequence of this asexual method of reproduction is that all the cells are genetically identical, meaning that they have the same genetic material (barring random mutations).|$|E

50|$|Centralspindlin is a motor complex {{implicated in}} cell division.

This complex is also implicated in tethering the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis This interaction permits cleavage furrow ingression.

50|$|More than a centure ago Oskar Hertwig {{proposed}} that the cell division orientation {{is determined by the}} shape of the cell (1884), known as Hertwig rule. In the epithelium the cells 'reads' its shape through the specific cell junction called tricellular junctions (TCJ). TCJ provide mechanical and geometrical clues for the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus</b> to ensure that cell divide along its long axis. Several factors could regulate cell shape and therefore orientation of cell division. Among these factors is the anisotropic mechanical stress. This stress could be the result of the external mechanical deformation of generated intracellularly by non-isotropic localization of specific proteins.|$|E
50|$|The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is a {{structure}} found in eukaryotic cells from which microtubules emerge.

The MTOC is a major site of microtubule nucleation and can be visualized in cells by immunohistochemical detection of γ-tubulin. The morphological characteristics of MTOCs vary between the different phyla and kingdoms. In animals, the two most important types of MTOCs are the basal bodies associated with cilia and the centrosome associated with spindle formation.|$|E

50|$|Clathrin {{has another}} {{function}} {{aside from the}} coating of organelles. In non-dividing cells, the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs continuously. Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is shut down in cells undergoing mitosis. During mitosis, clathrin binds to the <b>spindle</b> <b>apparatus,</b> in complex with two other proteins: TACC3 and ch-TOG/CKAP5. Clathrin aids in the congression of chromosomes by stabilizing kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle. The amino-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the TACC domain of TACC3 make the microtubule binding surface for TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin to bind to the mitotic spindle. The stabilization of kinetochore fibers requires the trimeric structure of clathrin in order to crosslink microtubules.|$|E
