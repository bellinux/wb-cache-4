40|$|In typical waveguides {{and optical}} fibers, light is {{confined}} through {{total internal reflection}} or through photonic bandgaps. Bound states in the continuum (BICs) confine light through destructive interference and promise many unique applications, yet {{they have never been}} found in optical fibers. Here, we show the existence of BICs in fibers with periodic Bragg gratings. Importantly, we find such BICs to persist even with the very small grating index contrasts that are available in typical fiber Bragg gratings. With numerical simulations and an analytical two-mode coupling analysis, we show that these BICs arise from the coupling between a high-quality-factor band and a low-quality-factor band.

The CdTe/CdS QDs are especially interesting in terms of creating luminescence light concentrators because they can be prepared in large quantity in water and have a high fluorescence quantum yield [14]. In addition, CdTe/CdS QDs in aqueous solution have a large effective surface charge that allows their implementation in a polymer matrix with the use of highly flexible and inexpensive layer-by-layer electrostatic assembly [15].|$|E
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of semiconductor nanowires are both important from a fundamental materials physics standpoint and {{necessary to understand}} in engineering applications: nanowire photovoltaic devices, <b>sensors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lasers,</b> among others, could all benefit. Unfortunately, these {{optical properties}} {{are not easy to}} ascertain. Transmission times are short, in-coupling of white probe light is difficult, and the angle-resolved measurements typically used to determine material dispersion relations in bulk materials are hindered by diffraction effects at subwavelength nanowire end facets. ^ Here, we present a series of experimental techniques and theoretical models developed to study of the optical properties of active nanowire waveguides. Beginning with a technique for determining the waveguide dispersion of individual ZnSe nanowires, we demonstrate enhanced properties with respect to bulk material. After investigating propagation loss in individual CdS nanowires, the theoretical model was then refined to quantify the strength of light-matter coupling, where size-dependence was observed. The knowledge gained from these studies was put to use in the first demonstration of all-optical switching in individual semiconductor nanowires. The switch concept was then extended into an all-optical nanowire NAND gate. These developments highlight the importance of semiconductor nanowires as both model materials systems and novel devices. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{large body}} of work has {{accumulated}} {{over the years in}} the study of the optical properties of single and coupled microcavities for a variety of applications, ranging from filters to <b>sensors</b> <b>and</b> <b>lasers.</b> The focus has been mostly on the geometry of individual resonators and/or on their combination in arrangements often referred to as photonic molecules (PMs). Our primary concern will be the lasing properties of PMs as ideal candidates for the fabrication of integrated microlasers, photonic molecule lasers. Whereas most calculations on PM lasers have been based on cold-cavity (passive) modes, i. e. quasi-bound states, a recently formulated steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) offers the possibility to take into account the spectral properties of the underlying gain transition, its position and linewidth, as well as incorporating an arbitrary pump profile. We will combine two theoretical approaches to characterize the lasing properties of PM lasers: for two-dimensional systems, the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory will obtain the resonant modes of the coupled molecules in an active medium described by SALT. Not only is then the theoretical description more complete, the use of an active medium provides additional parameters to control, engineer and harness the lasing properties of PM lasers for ultra-low threshold and directional single-mode emission.

40|$|Light {{trapping}} within waveguides {{is a key}} {{practice of}} modern optics, both scientifically and technologically. Photonic crystal fibers traditionally rely on total internal reflection (index-guiding fibers) or a photonic bandgap (photonic-bandgap fibers) to achieve field confinement. Here, we report {{the discovery of a}} new light trapping within fibers by the so-called Dirac point of photonic band structures. Our analysis reveals that the Dirac point can establish suppression of radiation losses and consequently a novel guided mode for propagation in photonic crystal fibers. What is known as the Dirac point is a conical singularity of a photonic band structure where wave motion obeys the famous Dirac equation. We find the unexpected phenomenon of wave localization at this point beyond photonic bandgaps. This guiding relies on the Dirac point rather than total internal reflection or photonic bandgaps, thus providing a sort of advancement in conceptual understanding over the traditional fiber guiding. The result presented here demonstrates the discovery of a new type of photonic crystal fibers, with unique characteristics that could lead to new applications in fiber <b>sensors</b> <b>and</b> <b>lasers.</b> The Dirac equation is a special symbol of relativistic quantum mechanics. Because of the similarity between band structures of a solid and a photonic crystal, the discovery of the Dirac-point-induced wave trapping in photonic crystals could provide novel insights into many relativistic quantum effects of the transport phenomena of photons, phonons, and electrons...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{requirements}} of an optical fibre amplifier or laser is {{that it should have}} a high absorption at the pump wavelength and a very low loss at the laser wavelength. Conventionally, this has been achieved by using a high dopant concentration in a short length of neodymium-doped compound-glass or silica fibre. However, an attractive alternative approach is to use lower dopant levels and thus exploit the long interaction lengths and very low losses inherent in communications-grade optical fibres. We report here a novel extension of the MCVD fabrication process which allows the fabrication of both mono- and multimode optical fibres containing rare-earth ions at concentrations of up to 0. 25 wt% in the core region. The technique is unique in that it allows the use of starting materials, e. g. rare-earth halides, which have a high melting point (> 580 °C) and hence have hitherto been unusable, since they exhibit a very low vapour pressure at the temperatures commonly encountered in reactant delivery systems for optical fibre fabrication. Initial work has concentrated on the lanthanide series as dopants, particularly neodymium and erbium, as these are of interest for both <b>sensors</b> <b>and</b> <b>lasers.</b> We have produced fibres with very high-loss absorption bands (> 3000 dB/km) in the visible and near infra-red regions, while maintaining the characteristic low loss (< 2 dB/km) of the MCVD fabrication process in the 'second window' for optical communications (1300 nm). The technique may also be used to incorporate many other rare-earth and transition metals into optical fibres...|$|E
40|$|Flash memory {{technology}} is widely common in modern microelectronics, and is essentially affecting our daily life. Considering the recent progress in photonic circuitry, {{and in particular}} silicon photonics circuitry, there is now an opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications. A particularly promising candidate that can benefit from such integration is the photonic resonator. As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building blocks in modern silicon photonic platform. However, their properties, and in particular their resonance frequencies deviate from their designed values due to unavoidable fabrication imperfections, imposing a stringent limitation on the applicability of such devices. Here we present a solution for this major obstacle and demonstrate electrical approach for post trimming of such resonators. This is achieved by integrating the well-established flash memory technology into the photonic circuitry. More specifically, we use the nanoscale Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) structure in order to trap charges in the thin silicon nitride layer, which is located {{in close proximity to}} the silicon device layer. This enables the accumulation of charges in the silicon, modifying the effective index of the optical mode and consequently the resonance frequency. By doing so, we provide a robust and elegant CMOS compatible memory solution, which can be easily manufactured and commercialized. We expect such an approach {{to pave the way for}} even more efficient utilization of resonators and interferometers in chip scale photonic and electro optic systems, with wide range of applications such as filters, modulators, <b>sensors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lasers,</b> to name a few...|$|E
30|$|Semiconductor {{quantum dots}} (QDs) {{have been widely}} {{explored}} as biomedical labeling agents [1 – 4]. However, the small-ensemble Stokes shift of intrinsic QDs can cause self-quenching. In addition, experimental results indicated that any leakage of cadmium from the QDs would be toxic and fatal to biological system [5], and cadmium-containing products can be environmentally problematic. Recently, Peng et al. [6 – 8] reported that doped QDs could not only replace cadmium in CdSe QDs with zinc, but also overcome a number of intrinsic disadvantages of undoped QDs emitters, i.e., strong self-quenching caused by their small-ensemble Stokes shift (energy difference between absorption spectrum and emission band) [9] and sensitivity to thermal, chemical, and photochemical disturbances [10]. Mn 2 +-doped ZnS QDs have been extensively investigated for use in various applications other than biomedical labeling, such as displays, <b>sensors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lasers</b> [11 – 13]. In addition, the luminescence lifetime of Mn 2 +-doped ZnS QDs is ~ 1 ms. Such a long lifetime makes the luminescence from the nanocrystal readily distinguishable from any background luminescence. Therefore, Mn 2 +-doped ZnS QDs could be potential candidates as fluorescent labeling agents, especially in biology [14]. Magnetic nanoparticles of iron oxides (MPs) also show many advantages in biological applications. One unique feature of magnetic nanoparticles is to respond well to magnetic control, {{which has led to}} several successful applications, including biological separation, protein purification, bacteria detection, and drug delivery [15, 16]. Highly luminescent QDs could serve as luminescent markers, while magnetic nanoparticles could be easily manipulated under the external magnetic field. Therefore, combination of QDs and MPs to get fluorescent–magnetic bifunctional composite nanoparticles (MPQDs) has attracted intense attention in the past decade due to its appealing applications [17 – 25]. Surface modification of QDs and MPs with silica has led to improved stability, lower toxicity, and higher biocompatibility, and protection of the QDs against corrosion by the biological buffer. In addition, the rich and well-known surface chemistry of silica makes bioconjugation more convenient. However, it was still a challenge to obtain magnetic, multicolor barcoded nanospheres with controllable size and tunable readout.|$|E
