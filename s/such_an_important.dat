5|$|After {{following}} the river back through Durgan {{to the open}} waters beyond Toll Point, the path skirts Falmouth Bay along Maenporth, Swanpool and Gyllyngvase beaches before passing around the headland beneath Pendennis Castle to enter bustling Falmouth. The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven is what made Falmouth <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The inexperienced Ferdinand {{was a poor}} {{choice of}} {{replacement}} for the capable Charles, having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, day-to-day decisions {{were placed in the}} hands of Mack, equally ill-suited for <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> assignment. When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E
5|$|Beer was <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{consumable}} to Americans {{that they}} would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E

5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Upon Austria's {{entrance}} into the war in summer 1805, Klenau joined the Habsburg army in southern Germany and became mired in a short campaign that exposed {{the worst of the}} Habsburg military organization. Archduke Charles was sick, and had retired to recuperate. Archduke Ferdinand, the brother-in-law of the Emperor Francis, was theoretically in command, but Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement, having neither experience, maturity, nor aptitude. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, decisions were placed in the hands of Karl Mack, who was timid, indecisive, and ill-suited for <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> assignment. Furthermore, Mack had been wounded earlier in the campaign, and was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able military officer, but as yet inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

25|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} Samson's mother was named Zlelponith. The Gemara taught that the oral {{tradition}} passed along this fact to provide a reply to the heretics (should they ask why the written Torah does not supply {{the name of the}} mother of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> figure).|$|E
25|$|Given the marginalized {{position}} of homosexuals in society, the metamessage that flows almost inevitably from excluding same-sex couples from <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> social institution is essentially that society considers such relationships {{to be less}} worthy of respect, concern and consideration than relationships involving members of the opposite sex.|$|E

25|$|Soviet Ukraine {{soon became}} a European leader in {{industrial}} production, and an important centre of the Soviet arms industry and high-tech research. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role resulted in a major influence of the local elite.

Many prominent Soviet sports players, scientists, and artists came from Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Had the war gone on {{a little}} longer for France, {{it is likely that}} all of the Amiot 143M would have ended up in a {{training}} role, having been replaced by more modern bombers such as the Breguet 693. The obsolete plane was never intended to have <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role come war time, but slow French production made its use necessary - often being pulled from training squadrons to shore up bomber groupes.|$|E

25|$|The British and French {{would then}} argue that Egypt's control of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> route was too tenuous, {{and that it}} needed be placed under Anglo-French management.
