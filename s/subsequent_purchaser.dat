50|$|A race statute will divest {{common law}} title {{from a person}} with {{superior}} title if the <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> recorded their deed prior to the person with superior title. A notice statute will divest common law title from a person with superior title if the <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> had no notice (either actual or constructive - otherwise known as bona fide) of the true owner's title. A race-notice statute requires a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> to be bona fide and record first.|$|E
50|$|Under a race/notice statute, a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> {{for value}} wins if (1) {{at the time}} of conveyance, that <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> had no actual or {{constructive}} notice of the prior conveyance, and (2) the <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> records before the prior purchaser. In short, a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> in good faith wins only if he records before the prior purchaser does. In this type of system, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land only if he was not aware of the prior sale to Al, and if Bob actually records his interest before Al does. In the hybrid race/notice statute, all grantees have a strong incentive to record early, thereby making the land records complete.|$|E

50|$|When {{dealing with}} real property, most American jurisdictions have codified {{recording}} statutes {{that will enable}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers</b> to divest title from the party with common law title if they qualify for protection under the recording statute.

50|$|This is a race/notice jurisdiction. In {{a normal}} situation, the deed that was {{recorded}} first, the 1928 deed, {{would have had}} priority. But this deed mentioned the earlier deed. This mention of the earlier deed put that deed within the chain of title. Therefore, all the <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers,</b> including the defendants, had constructive notice that the property {{would go to the}} heirs of Maude Harper upon her death. Maude should not have conveyed the property to Thornton, because it was a life estate only, and was not hers to convey.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{patented}} product passes lawfully {{into the hands}} of a purchaser without conditionor restriction, it is no longer within the monopoly or under the protection of thepatent act, but outside of it. ...It is clear that by such a sale the purchaser acquires an absolute title to the manufactured product which {{is the subject of a}} patent, and may deal with It in the same manner as if dealing with any other kindof property. He may use it, repair it, Improve upon it, or sell it. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>purchasers</b> acquire the same rights as the seller had, and may do with the article, or its materials, whatever the first purchaser could have lawfully done if he had not parted with the title.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} a {{security}} interest to attach to the collateral {{in the possession of}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers,</b> it must be perfected. If the security agreement is for a purchase money security interest, perfection is automatic. Otherwise, the lender must record either the agreement itself, or a UCC-1 financing statement, in an appropriate public venue (usually the state secretary of state or a state business commission under that person's authority). Perfecting the interest creates constructive notice, which is deemed legally sufficient to inform {{the rest of the world}} of the lender's rights in the collateral. Where a borrower has used the same property as collateral with respect to multiple security agreements made with different lenders, the first lender to record the interest has the strongest claim to that property.|$|R
50|$|Under {{a notice}} statute, a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> for value wins if, {{at the time}} of conveyance, that <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> had no actual or {{constructive}} notice of the prior conveyance. In short, a subsequent bona fide purchaser wins. Thus, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land so long as he was not aware of the prior sale to Al. However, note that if Al records his interest before Bob's purchase, this recordation will be deemed to give Bob constructive notice. If Bob purchases the land without notice, and Al then records his prior purchase before Bob records his own purchase, then Bob will still prevail in ownership of the land. The benefit of a pure notice statute is that it encourages Al to record quickly, but if Al records after Bob's purchase, Bob has only limited incentive to record his conveyence immediately. This can leave the land records incomplete for an indeterminate amount of time and could cause Al to make improvements of which he might be divested by Bob's later recorded deed.|$|E

50|$|No, {{said the}} Court of Appeals. The {{provision}} {{does not include}} a third party {{who does not have}} privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied. If there is no privity of contract between third persons and the seller of food, there can be no implied warranty. The benefit of warranty (either express or implied) does not run with the chattel on its resale (and thus is unlike a covenant running with land, which does give a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> a right of action on a warranty).|$|E
50|$|When a mortgaged {{tract of}} land is split up and sold, upon default, the {{mortgagee}} first forecloses on lands still owned by the mortgagor and proceeds against other owners in an 'inverse order' {{in which they were}} sold. For example, Alice acquires a 3 acre lot by mortgage then splits up the lot into three 1 acre lots (X, Y, and Z), and sells lot Y to Bob, and then lot Z to Charlie, retaining lot X for herself. Upon default, the mortgagee proceeds against lot X first, the mortgagor. If foreclosure or repossession of lot X does not fully satisfy the debt, the mortgagee proceeds against lot Y (Bob), then lot Z (Charlie). The rationale is that the first purchaser should have more equity and <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers</b> receive a diluted share.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{break-up}} of privately rented flats in both England and Wales, and Scotland, two distinct property 'ownership' systems emerged. Each sought to provide individual 'ownership' {{of the flat}} and collective management of the block in which the flat was contained. Leasehold 'ownership' effectively retained the previous landlord tenant relationship because of a peculiarity in English law that only allows 'positive covenants' - such as maintenance obligations, to be enforced on the first purchaser of a flat, not <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers.</b> Although in Scotland outright individual ownership of a flat was legally possible, the management arrangements covering the common parts of the building have not proved satisfactory. Neither legal arrangement put in place an 'ownership' or 'governance' regime which matched popular cultural expectations of what individual home ownership should constitute. The scale of and scope of property law reform over the last 30 years illustrates how these popular cultural expectations have demanded due recognition within the British property system...|$|R
50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and voluntary conveyances as against <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers</b> for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by {{free and common socage}} and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, and the laws of inheritance and dower were amended.|$|R
5000|$|We {{conclude}} otherwise, {{as we did}} in Mallinckrodt {{and subsequent}} decisions. A sale made under a clearly communicated, otherwise-lawful restriction as to post-sale use or resale does not confer on the buyer and a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> the [...] "authority" [...] to engage in the use or resale that the restriction precludes. And there is no sound reason, and no Supreme Court precedent, requiring a distinction that gives less control to a practicing-entity patentee that makes and sells its own product than to a non-practicing-entity patentee that licenses others to make and sell the product.|$|E
50|$|Stambovsky v. Ackley, 169 A.D.2d 254 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991), {{commonly}} known as the Ghostbusters ruling, is a case in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, that held that a house, which the owner had previously advertised to the public as haunted by ghosts, legally was haunted for the purpose of an action for rescission brought by a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> of the house. Because of its unique holding, the case has been frequently printed in textbooks on contracts and property law and widely taught in U.S. law school classes, and is often cited by other courts.|$|E
5000|$|Once an {{instrument}} affecting the title {{to real estate}} has been recorded, the law holds that everyone is deemed to know of its existence, even if they haven't searched the records in the recorder's office. This is the doctrine of [...] "constructive notice" [...] and it is nearly universal in the various states of the U.S. So, for example, after a deed or mortgage has been recorded by someone {{in the chain of}} title, no <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> will be protected against it. The reason is that the recording laws deem everyone to know of its existence once it is recorded.|$|E
40|$|The privity {{rule has}} {{give rise to}} many criticisms due to its {{injustice}} and inconvenience. In realizing this situation, various means or mechanisms were available to circumvent the privity rule including tort of negligence. Nevertheless, it may have its own weakness that is; {{it is difficult to}} establish a duty of care owed by promisor in recovering of pure economic loss claim. Hence, this dissertation intends to examine the claims by third parties in tort and look into their problems in imposing a duty of care owed by the promisors. By adopting the judicial decision from various cases, the scope of this research is confined with the third parties claim namely contractors or builders, owners or <b>subsequent</b> owners and <b>purchasers</b> or <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers.</b> The findings revealed that of 21 cases, only five managed to prove a duty of care owed by professional man, whereas the rest proved otherwise. To recap, the recovery of claims by third parties remains difficult and we might concluded that tort of negligence provides uncertainties in protecting their rights. Indirectly, it was not an effective mechanism to circumvent the privity rule?s problems as yet it was inadequately protecting third-party's rights in certain situations. Therefore, they may utilize this research as guidance so that, they have a better understanding in relation to its operation...|$|R
40|$|Information is {{fundamental}} to natural hazards management yet councils and other authorities suggest that they are reluctant to provide specific information about risks such as flood or fire risk, to property owners or prospective purchasers. This reluctance arises from a fear {{that they will be}} liable to pay damages if the release of the information has adverse consequences, for example by reducing the market value of the affected property. This article will look at Australian law to identify whether authorities would owe a duty of care to homeowners not to disclose risk information; and whether authorities owe a legal duty to disclose known risk information. It will be shown that there is no legal impediment to releasing reasonably accurate hazard information. Failure to do so will distort the property market and the potential liability to <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers</b> could be much greater than any risk of legal liability to current owners. Local councils should be proactive in identifying and warning of risk so people can make informed decisions about how they will prepare for and deal with the risks that they face. Releasing hazard information is key to developing resilient communities and sharing responsibility for hazard management...|$|R
50|$|Dennis Crouch, in Patently-O {{commented on}} the issues and {{provided}} {{a summary of the}} merits briefs filed in the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2017. Crouch opposed the Federal Circuit's ruling on these grounds:With personal property courts long ago rejected servitudes (such as use and resale restrictions) that bind <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers.</b> Unlike real property, personal property moves and is often transferred without substantial paperwork or record-keeping, and allowing a set of unique restrictions has the potential of gumming up the marketplace. The Federal Circuit in this case {{went all the way to}} the other side — holding that the presumption in foreign sales is that no US patent rights are exhausted. I purchased my last couple of smart phones through the used market - and have also repaired them several times. Under the law, I probably should have taken steps to ensure that all of the original equipment manufacturers affirmatively granted repair and resale rights. Coming together, the Federal Circuit’s approach here has the potential to limit the market for the repair and reselling of goods. I would suggest that those activities are incredibly beneficial to our society in terms of resource allocation and avoiding waste as well as empowering citizens and avoiding anticompetitive market behavior.|$|R
5000|$|In Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc., the Supreme Court of Canada {{adopted the}} {{principle}} that sale of a patented article exhausts the patentee’s right in that article. In the Eli Lilly case the Supreme Court also took the position that subsequent purchasers are not bound by any contractual limitations imposed by the patentee, unless they are brought to their attention {{at the time of}} sale: [...] "restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are {{brought to the attention of}} the <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> at the time of their acquisition." [...] This principle appears to differ somewhat from U.S. patent law, in which bringing the restriction to the attention of the purchaser is generally immaterial.|$|E
5000|$|The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, {{which took}} effect 13 June 1959, {{specifies}} {{that anyone who}} [...] "manufactures, sells or hires or offers for sale or hire, or exposes or has in his possession {{for the purpose of}} sale or hire or lends or gives to any other person" [...] an automatic-opening knife (flick knife) or gravity knife in England, Wales and Scotland is guilty of an offence. Importation of such knives into the United Kingdom after 13 June 1959 is prohibited. Under a strict interpretation of the Act, it is legal to possess an automatic-opening or gravity knife made before 13 June 1959 if it is held by the original owner within the home or other private place and is not transferred to any other person. As the penalty provisions of the Act apply to the prior owner of the knife, and not to the inheritor or <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser,</b> it is possible that a person living in the UK could acquire an automatic-opening or gravity knife and keep it at home or on other private property without penalty to the new owner, though a zealous prosecutor might attempt to level a charge of abetting or facilitating an offence by the knife's former owner as a consequence of acquiring the knife in a prohibited post-1959 transaction.|$|E
5000|$|A deed that is recorded, {{but is not}} {{connected}} to the chain of title of the property, is called a wild deed. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated thatBecause title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a deed won't be discovered {{even though it was}} recorded. [...] "Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." [...] A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchaser</b> is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.|$|E
60|$|The Secretary of the Treasury (Mr. Hamilton), {{it will be}} remembered, {{had been}} {{directed}} by Congress to prepare such a plan during its recess. In the one thus prepared, he asserted, what none were disposed to question, the propriety of paying the foreign debt according to its terms. He asserted, also, the equal validity of the original claims of the American creditors of the government; whether those creditors were the original holders of its certificates or <b>subsequent</b> <b>purchasers</b> of them at a depreciated value. The idea of any distinction between them, which some were inclined to advance, he repudiated as alike unjust, impolitic, and impracticable. He urged, moreover, the assumption, by the general government, of the separate debts of the States, contracted for the common cause, and that a like provision should be made for their payment as for the payment of those of the Union. They were all contracted {{in the struggle for}} national independence, not for the independence of any particular part. No more money would be required for their discharge as federal, than as State debts. He recommended, therefore, that the entire mass of debt be funded; the Union made responsible for it, and taxes imposed for its liquidation.|$|R
