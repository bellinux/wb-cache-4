The <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> ranges from 1 for the most compact sources to 4 for the most extended sources.

We discuss the overall distribution of <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> in the ICRF and the <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> variability with time for those sources that have VLBI images available at multiple epochs.

40|$|Graph {{databases}} supporting retrieval {{based on}} structural similarity utilize structure indexes. A <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> is a data structure that indexes different structural features of member graphs. These features are typically extracted at insertion time. However, as {{the extraction of}} structural features may suffer from combinatorial explosion, the <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> takes long insertion time and large disk space. The member graphs cannot be modified, since even a simple structural modification may require re-extraction of structural features. The depth to which structural features were extracted during insertion, forms a hard limit on query precision, which cannot be changed at query time. In order to address these issues, a new model is introduced that combines the database graph storage and the <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> into one data structure. There {{is no need to}} extract structural features at insertion time, no hard limit on query refinement and graph modifications are supported naturally. ...|$|E

We focus on three instances of <b>structure</b> <b>indexes</b> that are based on the notion of graph bisimilarity. We propose algorithms to update the bisimulation partition for both kinds of updates and show how they extend to these indexes. Our experiments on two real world data sets show that our update algorithms are an order of magnitude faster than dropping and rebuilding the index.

Based on multi-epoch VLBI images obtained with the VLBA and other VLBI telescopes around the world between 1994 and 2005, we evaluate this effect for 557 ICRF sources (about 80 % of the current frame) and calculate a so-called "structure index" to define the astrometric suitability of the sources.

Low temperatures around the tropical tropopause generally occur over the equator and extend northwestward and southwestward in the subtropics to form the horseshoe-shaped structure.

Because of this, the two preliminary indices are first defined to represent the two responses. The horseshoe-shaped <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> is then calculated from the two indices.

Low temperatures generally occur over the equator in the eastern hemisphere and extend northwestward and southwestward in the subtropics to form a horseshoe-shaped structure. Because this structure resembles a stationary wave response known as the Matsuno-Gill pattern, which is a superposition of the Rossby and Kelvin responses, the two preliminary indices are defined to represent the two responses. The horseshoe-shaped <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> is then calculated from the two indices. The seasonal cycle in the horseshoe-shaped <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> is significantly related to that observed in convective activities adjacent to three monsoon regions: the South Asian monsoon (SoAM) and the North Pacific monsoon (NPM) areas during the northern summer and the Australian monsoon (AUM) area during the southern summer. The convective activities in the SoAM and NPM areas individually influence the horseshoe-shaped structure. During the northern summer, interannual variation in the horseshoe-shaped <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> in the NPM area is related to that observed in convective activities associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle with about a half-year time lag. In the SoAM area, the variation is mainly controlled by isolated high temperatures, which are surrounded by the horseshoe-shaped temperature structures and {{are not related to}} convective activities.

40|$|Abstract — Ultrasound imaging {{provides}} a non-invasive, low cost, real-time imaging {{that helps the}} clinician in diagnosis and planning of therapy. However, the usefulness of ultrasound imaging is degraded {{by the presence of}} signal depended noise known as speckle. Image denoising algorithms are challenging operation because the fine details are embedded in medical image and diagnostic information should not be destroyed during noise removal. This paper presents speckle reduction by an improved total variation filter (ITV) method. The performance of these filters is evaluated based on the parameters such as mean square error (MSE), peak signal-to–noise ratio (PSNR), similar <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> mean (SSIM) and feature <b>structure</b> <b>index</b> mean (FSIM). An experimental result shows that the speckle noise can be efficiently removed by the ITV method without affecting the structure of the object.
