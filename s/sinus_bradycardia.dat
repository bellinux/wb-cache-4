40|$|Healthy {{teens and}} adults {{performed}} four vagotonic maneuvers. A large series of strabismus surgery patients had deliberately quantified tension on extraocular rectus muscles during general anesthesia. The mean bradycardia was greatest for diving response (apneic facial exposure to cold) and Valsalva maneuver and least for {{pressure on the}} globe and carotid <b>sinus</b> massage. <b>Bradycardia</b> occurred for every subject for the non-surgical maneuvers, however, extraocular muscle tension frequently caused no change in heart rate or even tachycardia. The inter-subject variance in percent heart rate change was greatest for surgical oculocardiac reflex. Of the rectus muscles, the inferior caused the most bradycardia while the lateral caused the least. The percent oculocardiac reflex was not age dependent. Occasional patients demonstrated profound bradycardia with strabismus surgery. Of these maneuvers, diving response has theoretical advantage in treating paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.

40|$|Sudden marked {{increases}} in the serum potassium concentration, up to 8 to 9 meq L - 1, {{are the result of}} transcellular movement of potassium and are associated with profound electrocardiographic abnormalities and fluid shifts. Electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalemia have been described in the cat, the dog, the horse and are well documented in man. Since there is no research about the effects of hyperkalemia on electrocardiogram of donkey, {{the purpose of this study}} was to induce the experimentally hyperkalemia in donkey and studying the relationship between KCl infusion and changes of ECG, electrolytes of plasma and K content of donkey's red blood cells. This research was carried out in seven clinically healthy female donkeys, injected with 0. 35 molar potassium chloride solutions to jugular vein.

40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the effects of}} the acute administration of intravenous (i. v.) digitalis administration (0 - 8 mg of digoxin in 5 - 10 min) on the electrophysiological variables of 12 normal subjects (group 1), 12 patients with asymptomatic <b>sinus</b> node <b>bradycardia</b> (group 2) and 34 patients with symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SSS) (group 3). The injection of digitalis induced: (1) an increase of sinus node cycle length (SNCL) in all groups; (2) a 10 % increase of sinus node recovery time (SNRT) in group 1, no changes in group 2 and a 25 % increase in group 3; (3) a tendency to increase, without reaching statistical significance, of corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) and sino-atrial conduction time (SACT) in all groups. In 16 patients of group 3 the effects of oral chronic treatment with digoxin (0 - 25 mg daily for 7 days) was also determined. The results show that chronic treatment did not further affect SNCL, SNRT or CSNRT, but caused a greater increase of SACT than did the acute i. v. administration. Chronic treatment significantly reduced the sinus rate and increased the number of premature supraventricular and ventricular beats, measured by means of 24 hour-Holter monitoring. These data suggest that digitalis should be used with great caution in patients with SSS...|$|R
40|$|Electrocardiograms were {{recorded}} from 1028 (99. 4 %) of 1034 consecutively born babies on the 1 st or 2 nd day of life.

One baby had <b>sinus</b> or junctional <b>bradycardia</b> of less than 80 beats/min. One baby had an incessant reciprocating tachycardia and subsequently required digoxin for heart failure. Continuous 24 -hour ECG monitoring in 25 babies with abnormalities of the screening ECG, and 25 babies without such abnormalities, failed to show any additional tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias warranting treatment.

40|$|Objective: This {{systematic}} review evaluated {{the existence of}} risk factors for the fetal manifestation of long QT syndrome (LQTS). Methods: Prenatal cardiac findings suggestive of fetal LQTS were studied using 30 English iterature reports extracted from the Pubmed database (1979 to December 2011) using the search terms ‘long QT syndrome’, ‘fetal arrhythmia’ and ‘congenital heart disease’. Results: LQTS ccounted for 15 – 17 % of fetal bradycardias ! 110 bpm among fetuses with a normally structured heart. Of the patients with significant prenatal findings of LQTS, 17 – 35 % exhibited a reduced baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) of 110 – 120 bpm on electronic cardiotocography. Other prenatal signs were <b>sinus</b> or intermittent <b>bradycardia</b> ! 110 bpm arising from atrioventricular block, tachyarrhythmias, pleural effusion and hydrops. More than 30 % of Japanese infants with LQTS born at or after the mid- 1980 s exhibited the above-mentioned in utero signs. Conclusions: Fetal factors including a slightly reduced baseline FHR of 110 – 120 bpm, bradycardia ! 110 bpm, tachyarrhythmias or clinical signs of heart failure, such as pleural effusion and hydrops, were associated with a higher frequency of LQTS. The use of these signs may help to increase the perinatal diagnosis of LQTS...|$|R

40|$|AbstractClinicians {{have long}} {{recognized}} the potentially serious manifestations of extreme bradycardia. However, even marked bradycardia {{can often be}} physiologic, and {{in the presence of}} impaired ventricular function may offer important compensatory hemodynamic effects. Disorders of the sinoatrial node producing bradycardia include failure of impulse formation, sinoatrial conduction block, concealed sinus-perinodal reentry, carotid sinus hypersensitivity and the constellation of brady- and tachyarrhythmias that compose the "sick <b>sinus</b> syndrome. " <b>Bradycardia</b> can also result from intraatrial block, atrioventricular nodal block or infranodal block. In addition, paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may produce concealment into the atrioventricular junction and simultaneous suppression of sinus node rhythmicity, resulting in long pauses. Pseudobradycardias manifesting as slow peripheral pulse rates can result from frequent, nonconducted early atrial premature beats, from ventricular bigeminy or runs of ventricular extrasystoles or from mechanical alternans. Cardiac pacemakers {{play an important role in}} the management of patients with severe symptoms attributable to bradyarrhythmias. However, excessive use of pacemakers and the inappropriate selection of physiologically unfavorable pacemaker systems should be avoided. Frequently, patients who are only mildly symptomatic with bradycardia should not receive a cardiac pacemaker because the prognosis is favorable. Patients with the tachy-bradycardia syndrome often require both pharmacologic and pacemaker therapy. In selected patients electrophysiologic testing may be helpful, but the majority of patients are best managed by careful attention to the history, electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings...|$|R

The same maximal cycle (five of 10 patients) or treadmill (five of 10 patients) exercise protocol was performed in atrial tachycardia and sinus rhythm 1 - 232 days after atrial tachycardia (mean, 34 days). Electrocardiogram, heart rate, and pulmonary gas exchange were recorded. Sinus rhythm exercise increased peak Vo 2 (mean, 28. 7 [sinus rhythm] vs. 24. 7 [atrial tachycardia], p< 0. 01), exercise time (p< 0. 01), and 02 pulse at rest (p< 0. 01) and at peak exercise (NS). Mean resting heart rate decreased from 109 to 70 beats/min (p< 0. 01). In atrial tachycardia, peak exercise heart rate was low (80 - 163 beats/mmn) because of fixed conduction (six of 10 patients) or high as conduction approached 1 : 1 (176 - 252 beats/min) (four of 10 patients). In sinus rhythm, rest to peak exercise heart rate increased in six of 10 patients (p< 0. 05). The data show improved exercise performance in sinus rhythm primarily because of improved heart rate adaptation to exercise, by either permitting increased heart rate response or eliminating excessively high heart rate with inadequate diastolic filling.

A living environment of these two groups is of same condition, for example, dietarily or economically. The incidences of abnormal ECG findings and hypertension in the both groups was analysed stochastically and the results obtained were as follows: 1.
