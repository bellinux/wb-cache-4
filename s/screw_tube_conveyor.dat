30|$|Pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyors</b> that shoot parts {{supplied}} by parts feeder systems are slso commercially available [13]. However, {{they are designed}} to shoot specific parts, e.g., bolts or nuts. Air leak in a pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> may be negligible for sufficiently heavy parts such as bolts and nuts. Au grains are small and lightweight, and an air leak can blow away subsequent grains in the buffer.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, in the {{commercial}} pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> combined with a parts feedersystem, parts are supplied via the pushing force of a parts feeder system. However, as mentioned, Au grains must be aligned before the treatment, and cannot be supplied by the pushing force of a part feeder system during the treatment. Therefore, a special pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> needs to be designed to shoot Au grains. The shooting subdevice that we developed satisfies the requirement for shooting Au grains.|$|R

40|$|Due {{to modern}} technology, screw blades are often {{manufactured}} by rolling {{them out of}} one single strip of steel. When simultaneously some blade inclination is applied, less residual stresses and/or larger possible ratios between outer and shaft diameter are claimed by some manufacturers, which seems plausible. However, it is sometimes also claimed that {{the efficiency of the}} conveyors is increased by such an inclined blade. The underlying idea is that the blade will cause extra pressure between the material to be conveyed and the <b>tube</b> of the <b>conveyor.</b> This in turn would delay the angular speed of the material, thus resulting in a steeper upward motion. In order to investigate this phenomenon, previous investigations based upon the conveyance of a single point mass have been modified for an inclined screw blade. It appeared that such a blade has no significant advantages over a normal one, which was confirmed by a series of tests. For completeness, tests were also carried out with a leading screw, resulting in worse results.

40|$|Objectives/hypothesis: to {{demonstrate}} the capability of a fiber-based Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (ARCLaser, Nuremberg, Germany and Valam, Orangeburg, NY) to disrupt biofilm. Study design: biofilms were grown in broth for 72 hours prior to the experiment. A clinical otorrhea isolate from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used. Biofilms were placed in MatTek culture plates, on stainless steel <b>screws,</b> tympanostomy <b>tubes,</b> and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sutures. Methods: culture plates, stainless steel <b>screws,</b> tympanostomy <b>tubes,</b> and PET sutures {{were used for the}} laser disruption of biofilm experiments. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser pulses were delivered on biofilms using shockwave probes originally designed for cataract surgery. The thin laser fiber tip was targeted against a titanium target, creating the production of plasma and resulting in a shockwave effect. Results: biofilm areas were imaged before, during, and after laser application using a confocal microscope. The biofilm was imaged growing on the glass/plastic step of the plates, in the grooves of the threads of the screws, over the tympanostomy tube, and on the PET suture. During laser treatment, a time-lapse function was used to capture the results. As a result of laser-generated shockwaves, the biofilm was initially seen to oscillate and eventually break off with individual pulses. Large and small pieces of biofilm were totally and instantly removed from the surface to which they were attached in {{a matter of a few}} seconds. Conclusions: we were able to effectively disrupt Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in vitro using a miniature Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, thin fibers, and special probes that generated plasma formation and a resulting shockwave effect. This laser technology has the ability to generate a powerful stress wave sufficient to disrupt biofilm without any ill effect to the underlying host structure...|$|R
