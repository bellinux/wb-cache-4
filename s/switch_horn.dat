5000|$|As the P5 was {{released}} during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older style stalk {{with the high}} beam [...] "dipper" [...] switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane {{was released}} a big item was the new multi-function column stalk which incorporated the dipper <b>switch</b> and <b>horn.</b> The P5s however used the ZF style stalk and still had a [...] "squeeze rim" [...] horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.Because the P6 LTD was not released until about {{five months after the}} ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.|$|R

500|$|... "Great Big World" [...] was sung by Anne Hathaway and {{replaced}} another song called [...] "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and {{described as being}} [...] "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." [...] This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. [...] "Be Prepared" [...] was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is {{rocking back and forth}} on his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart later on in the film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the character <b>switch</b> his <b>horns</b> several times, and this led to the song's concept.|$|R

5000|$|Accidents {{most often}} occur in {{collisions}} with other off-road vehicles, and are frequently {{the result of}} not being seen. In many dune areas, all sand vehicles (motorcycles, quads, sandrails,UTVs and sandcars) are required to use an eight-foot antenna whip and flag. This is critical to being seen by other vehicles as a driver traverses from one dune to the next. Most sandrails employ a variety of safety features for the driver and passengers. The most common {{is the use of}} a three-point safety belt system. Many sand rails also utilize roll bar padding and fire extinguishers. More advanced safety features sometimes include: arm and wrist restraints, netting for large frame openings, automatic fuel cut-off <b>switches</b> and <b>horns.</b> Additionally, the use of eye protection (goggles and ballistic-grade glasses) is considered a necessity. Finally, the use of helmets while [...] "duning" [...] is increasing due to the advances in performance.

50|$|The 2011 season saw an {{important}} {{change to the}} Racine Scouts hornline. During the early off-season, {{the staff of the}} corps decided it would be important to switch the corps to perform on horns in the key of B-flat, rather than in the key of G, which the corps has performed on during the preceding few decades. After a few tribulations with attempts early on in the pre-season to get the corps new horns, an agreement was made with a DCA corps to lease their B-flat horns for the summer. The 2011 season then became the first summer the Racine Scouts performed on B-flat horns. The Racine Scouts are one of the last corps in DCI to <b>switch</b> from <b>horns</b> keyed in G to B-flat. In 2011, with a new format at the championships, the Racine Scouts competed as a top-level (now known as World Class) corps {{for the first time since}} 1974, finishing thirty-ninth of forty-one corps. The Racine Scouts 85th anniversary season in 2012 was cut short when the corps administration decided to end the summer tour early after facing insurmountable challenges. The corps did however attend competitions, both DCI sanctioned and SDCA, allowing the corps to keep its title of being continuously competitive.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1968, the '69 Torana' was released, {{sometimes}} called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan which was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new indicator switch, and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was {{the loss of the}} stalk-operated headlight dip <b>switch</b> and <b>horn.</b> The dip <b>switch</b> ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard [...] engine. The Brabham Torana was still available, in two-door form only. It now included a sports steering wheel similar to the contemporary Holden Monaro GTS, full instrumentation, different badging, and different black accenting. The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.|$|R

50|$|If the Color Rush {{color is}} too {{similar to the}} home team, or if there are issues with {{visibility}} for color-blind viewers, the visiting team will wear their whites. It is unclear how each of these team will modify elements of their uniform for the Color Rush games, if at all. At least one team, the Arizona Cardinals, was given a choice between wearing their traditional white-on-white uniforms or a specially designed all-white uniform from Nike. The Cardinals opted for their traditional whites, with white socks. In week two of 2016, the New York Jets wore white facemasks instead of green, white gloves, solid white socks instead of white with green stripes, and white shoes instead of their usual black {{in the spirit of}} the Color Rush program. In week three, the Houston Texans modified their uniforms by wearing solid white socks instead of their blue and white socks. In Week 15, the Rams wore their regular white uniform but <b>switched</b> the <b>horns</b> on the helmet from gold to white, marking the first time the team wore white horns on the helmet since the 1972 season; this was also done as a nod to the Fearsome Foursome.

5000|$|CRN {{was founded}} in 1983 as Cable Radio Network to provide {{commercial}} radio programming to local cable television systems. CRN founder Michael Horn (who, at the time, was an on-air personality at Los Angeles’ KFI AM) read an article in trade publication Radio & Records that mentioned Los Angeles radio station KMET earned ratings points in the Phoenix market. Horn learned KMET was the audio source for a channel on a local cable system in Phoenix. Horn brought the radio-on-television idea to San Fernando Valley cable provider King Cable, where he soon programmed a country music channel. Seeking a more mass appeal, Horn changed the channel’s format to oldies music. Two other cable systems - Valley Cable and Falcon Cable - then became interested. Broadcast hookups were initially conducted through phone lines before the method became cost prohibitive. Horn invested more money and switched to satellite transmission. A branding change from [...] "Cable Radio Network" [...] to [...] "CRN Networks" [...] eventually followed. Noncommercial music channels from companies such as Digital Planet and DMX eventually were picked up by cable providers. Instead of competing with them, <b>Horn</b> <b>switched</b> CRN’s programming to a talk radio platform. CRN Networks then became [...] "CRN Talk" [...] and, in 2007, [...] "CRN Digital Talk Radio." [...] Horn commissioned a company that worked with Arbitron (now Nielsen Audio) to determine CRN’s listenership.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} physical and morphometric characteristics in indigenous cattle of Assam. The data pertain to 339 indigenous cattle of different categories. The physical characteristics included colour pattern of body coat, muzzle, tail <b>switch,</b> hoof and <b>horn.</b> Body length, height at wither, heart girth, pouch girth, length of tail, switch, neck, ear and head were taken up for morphometric characterization. The main body coat colour of indigenous cattle was brown (31. 18 %) followed by white (28. 53 %), fawn (15. 29 %), grey (13. 53 %), black (4. 41 %) and mixed (7. 06 %). The prominent colour of tail switch was black (74. 53 %). Most of animals had black muzzle (86. 47 %), black hooves (84. 71 %) and black horn (100 %). Morphometric characteristics data obtained were classified according to location, age group and sex of the animal. The means for body length, height at wither, heart girth, pouch girth, length of tail, switch, neck, ear and head were 83. 668 ± 0. 590, 91. 942 ± 0. 55, 113. 146 ± 0. 738, 121. 181 ± 0. 761, 54. 196 ± 0. 527, 26. 098 ± 0. 186, 32. 705 ± 0. 166, 18. 131 ± 0. 111 and 35. 035 ± 0. 195 cm respectively.
