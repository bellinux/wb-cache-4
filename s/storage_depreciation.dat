30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{functions}} of smart grids on the demand side, the concept of demand-side management (DSM) is proposed to reduce the energy cost of consumers, shift energy consumption from peak hours to reduce peak-to-average ratio (PAR) and balance power supply and demand [7, 8, 9]. DSM programs can be conducted effectively primarily due to their dynamic pricing schemes such as time-of-use (ToU) pricing [10], real-time pricing (RTP) [11] and critical-peak pricing. Most of consumers who want to reduce their costs are willing to shift their energy consumption from peak demand hours to off-peak hours {{because of the high}} price in peak hours. In fact, consumers in demand-side primarily refer to the users who consume energy to satisfy their requirements as residential users, commercial users and industrial users. However, residential DSM has attracted more attention due to residential users being responsible for about 40 % of global energy consumption [12]. Moreover, DSM has become more significant for smart grids especially when renewable energy generation is introduced into the smart house. Photovoltaic (PV) generation, which has been widely applied as a type of renewable energy generation, can be installed in the common household for providing energy [13, 14]. Since PV only works during daylight, PV generation usually requires a storage system to store the produced energy and then this storage provides energy for loads during peak hours to reduce the user’s cost [15]. However, it brings more challenges for DSM to schedule energy consumption when storage is introduced into the DSM, such as the optimization of storage capacity [16, 17]. Storage capacity, which is related to various aspects (user’s loads, price policy and characteristics of renewable energy sources), is an important factor for the cost of residential users. Users must pay more for <b>storage</b> <b>depreciation</b> cost when the PV is supplied with a large capacity storage system. However, storage with small capacity cannot satisfy user’s demand during peak hours, which causes the rise of energy costs. Therefore, optimization of storage capacity is a non-negligible problem for PV-storage systems in DSM programs.|$|E
30|$|Melo et al. [6] {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of using electric cargo bicycles to move freight in Portugal. Electric cargo bicycles are recognized to have the following advantages over conventional diesel vans: “taxes, insurance, <b>storage,</b> and <b>depreciation</b> costs.” They are also easier to park and consume less curb space. In the scenario presented in this research, a maximum of 2 [*]km was the distance an electric cargo bicycle would travel. Seven scenarios were tested for traffic flow, delay time, average speed, delay times, wheel to wheel energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, and external costs of an electric cargo bicycle using the microscopic traffic simulation model, Advanced Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Networks (AIMSUN). The researchers concluded that replacing 10 % of delivery vans with electric cargo bicycles would result in reasonable network efficiency and would reduce wheel to wheel Co 2 emissions and external costs.|$|R
30|$|In {{all four}} {{segments}} of the energy system, IoT facilities will collect multi-dimensional and multi-domain data, which lay foundations to {{the operation of the}} Blockchain and cloud systems (discussed later), and support the decision making of various energy stakeholders. For example, in the energy generation side, the IoT infrastructure would collect the operation status and CO 2 emission of the generation units, wind speed, solar radiation, etc.; in the transmission segment, IoT could monitor the energy network condition through the wide-area sensing devices including PMU, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, etc.; in the energy consumption segment, IoT could collect the big data including the appliance-level energy consumption data of buildings, environmental condition, transportation network condition, and so forth; in the energy storage segment, IoT could monitor the state-of-charge of the battery energy <b>storage</b> system, the <b>depreciation</b> condition of the energy storage systems, and so on.|$|R
40|$|A farm storage {{building}} is a good investment for many agricultural operations. The building {{can be used to}} store hay, machinery, or both. As a result, the value of these commodities will be worth more than if left in the field. However, does the increased value of stored hay or machinery offset the cost of owning a building? The following discussion examines the costs and savings of owning a farm {{storage building}}. Cost of Barn Storage Barn storage is the best method for preserving hay and protecting machinery. However, a storage structure can be expensive to build. Initial building cost depends on several factors including building style, material costs, and labor costs. Initial cost of construction can range from $ 4. 00 per square foot for an open-sided barn to over $ 6. 00 per square foot for a fully enclosed barn. Example 1. Calculate the estimated cost of an opensided barn that is 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. 100 feet x 50 feet = 5, 000 square feet 5, 000 square feet x $ 4. 00 /square feet = $ 20, 000 To evaluate the feasibility of constructing a storage barn, the initial building cost must be converted into an annual cost. The annual cost of barn <b>storage</b> includes <b>depreciation,</b> interest on investment, repairs, taxes, and insurance. Table 1 shows how to calculate the annual cost of storage for the barn described in Example 1. You can enter your figures to estimate the cost of storage for your barn. Depreciation is the cost associated with wear and tear on the building. Most farm buildings have a useful life Table 1. Total annual cost of a 100 -foot by 50 -foot, open-sided farm storage building. Initial cost of the building is $ 20, 000. Depreciation rate is over 20 years, interest rate is 9. 0 %, and repairs, taxes, and insurance total 2. 0 % of initial investment. Costs for Example Barn Depreciation (20 years) = $ 20, 000 ÷ 20 = $ 1, 00...|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBrian C. BriggemanGarden City Co-op, Inc. is a farm {{cooperative}} in Southwest Kansas. It provides marketing and storage of grain, fertilizer, crop protection products, seed, and petroleum to both member and non-member accounts. The cooperative also operates a transportation company called Western Transport. Western Transport provides transportation of anhydrous ammonia (NH 3), liquid fertilizer (32 - 0 - 0 or 10 - 34 - 0), diesel, gasoline, and propane utilizing semi-tractors and trailers to Garden City Co-op, Inc. {{as well as}} to other agribusinesses in the region. The purpose of this thesis is to integrate and optimize the supply chain strategies for the cooperative’s fertilizer and petroleum products as it relates to storage and transportation of those commodities. Utilizing the framework of an aggregate production plan, a model is constructed to minimize costs associated with inventory holding, net <b>storage</b> asset <b>depreciation</b> after tax savings, net transportation asset depreciation after tax savings, labor, operations, and freight. By varying the quantities of petroleum and fertilizer the cooperative purchases, sells, and stores each month over a one-year period, an optimum mix of storage and transportation assets is determined. Two different demand scenarios are evaluated that relate to demand during a drought year versus demand during a non-drought year. Also, different model scenarios include varying beginning period inventory and ending period inventory to stress transportation assets versus storage assets. The model is optimized using a genetic algorithm solver in the software program Evolver produced by Palisade Corporation. Results of the optimization provided two feasible strategies for the cooperative. By continuing services to non-member accounts, there was a greater investment placed on transportation. Investments included additional trucks, NH 3 trailers, petroleum trailers, and drivers. The strategy favored a just-in-time inventory approach versus inventory smoothing with storage. When discontinuing services to non-member accounts, investment between storage and transportation assets were relatively equal. The model favored a reduction in NH 3 trailers, liquid fertilizer trailers, trucks, and drivers. However, additional storage was necessary as well as petroleum trailers. The scenario favored an inventory smoothing approach across the model year...|$|R
40|$|The current {{paper is}} focused on the quality indexes of {{integral}} egg powder stored in different microclimate conditions. Failure of temperature and air moisture content leads to depreciation of egg powder quality in a more accelerated way than at eggs. From those reasons we aimed to study the evolution of qualitative parameters during storage in different environmental conditions. For that, we constituted 3 batches were we have determine the sensorial characteristics of the product, solubility and pH value. In addition with those determinations were effectuated a series of chemical analysis, tracking water content which was determined by drying stove, dry matter (%) and content in mineral substances (mg/ 100 g) which was determined through atomic absorption spectrometric method (AAS) with a GBC-AVANTA spectrophotometer type. The first observed modifications, after sensorial control, were mentioned in the 90 th day at batch Lexp- 2 which presented modifications of aspect and consistency (instable agglomerations). Regarding pH value this one suffer modifications during those 180 days of storage, the recorded values at final being higher with 1. 84 % at batch Lc, 8. 91 % at batch Lexp- 1 and with 10. 38 % at batch Lexp- 2. Regarding the chemical content of analysed product, experimental factors influenced only water content respectively the dry matter content, determinations being made on mineral substances (Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg). In conclusion we can say that the failure of pack type and of microclimate factors assured during <b>storage</b> leads to <b>depreciation</b> of the product in a quite short time.  </p...|$|R
