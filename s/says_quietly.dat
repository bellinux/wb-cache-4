25|$|At a Solemn Mass or Missa Cantata, a choir {{sings the}} servers' responses, {{except for the}} Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. The choir sings the Introit, the Kyrie, the Gloria, the Gradual, the Tract or Alleluia, the Credo, the Offertory and Communion antiphons, the Sanctus, and the Agnus Dei. Of these, only the five that form part of the Ordinary of the Mass are usually sung at a Missa Cantata. In {{addition}} to the Gregorian Chant music for these, polyphonic compositions exist, some quite elaborate. The priest largely <b>says</b> <b>quietly</b> {{the words of the}} chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant.|$|E
2500|$|In Solemn Mass, by far {{the greater}} part is spoken by the celebrant inaudibly, but, apart from a very few parts such as the [...] "Orate Fratres", all that he speaks aloud, such as [...] "Dominus vobiscum" [...] and the four opening words of the Gloria and of the Creed are sung by him. He <b>says</b> <b>quietly</b> for himself {{everything}} that the choir sings, except short responses such as [...] "Et cum spiritu tuo" [...] and [...] "Amen." [...] He reads for himself {{the words of the}} Epistle and the following chants while the subdeacon sings the Epistle, and he reads the Gospel for himself before the deacon sings the Gospel aloud.|$|E

"Don't {{come too}} near me," [...] he <b>says</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Typhus fever has broken out at Limehouse, {{and they say}} one can {{communicate}} it, even without having it oneself.

50|$|Shortly before {{shipping}} {{home at the}} end of World War II, six American Air Force officers explore an Asian bazaar. A snake charmer, Daru, {{allows the}} men to take pictures of him holding a cobra. Paul Abel mentions the strange cult of the Lamians, who worship snakes and believe that there are people who can transform into them. Daru <b>says</b> <b>quietly</b> that, for a price, Paul can see this for himself.|$|E

Reuven has definitely decided {{he wants to be a}} rabbi and is going on to study at a yeshiva. Danny tells Reuven that his younger brother Levi will take his place as his father's successor and his own relationship with Reb Saunders has completely changed. [...] "We talk now," [...] he <b>says</b> <b>quietly.</b> Danny is finally set free, and Reuven and Danny taste profoundly the pain in life, and the consolation of their deep love. Danny goes on to study psychology.|$|E

5000|$|A rabbi {{once asked}} his old friend, a priest, [...] "Could you ever be {{promoted}} within your Church?"The priest says, thoughtfully, [...] "Well, I {{could become a}} bishop."The rabbi persists, [...] "And after that?"With a pause for consideration, the priest replies, [...] "Maybe I could be a cardinal, even.""And then?" [...] After thinking for some time, the priest responds, [...] "Someday I may even rise to be the Pope." [...] But the rabbi is still not satisfied. [...] "And then?"With an air of incredulity, the priest cries, [...] "What more could I become? God Himself?"The rabbi <b>says</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "One of our boys made it." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} Jeanne had been steadily carrying {{on her work}} among her poorer neighbours, sitting up at night with sick children, and supplying food to starving little ones, <b>saying</b> <b>quietly</b> in reply {{to the words of}} gratitude of the women: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me a moment," [...] he said, faintly; {{and turning}} away, {{leaned against the}} wall and pressed his burning {{forehead}} on the chill, damp stone. He did not raise his head again till he had mastered himself, and could <b>say</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "Speak; I am fit to hear you, and sufficiently in my senses to ask your forgiveness for what I said just now." ...|$|R
60|$|This change I am sure, is excellent. It is, I am certain, just as {{it ought}} to be. I am merely <b>saying,</b> <b>quietly</b> and humbly, that I am not in it. I am being left behind. Take, for example, the case of alcohol. That, at least, {{is what it is}} called now. There were days when we called it Bourbon whisky and Tom Gin, and when the very name of it breathed romance. That time is past.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Will {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Lisa Tyler (Vera Farmiga), the illegitimate daughter he's never met. He goes to the museum where she works and recognizes her from an old photo, but {{he is unable to}} approach her. A few nights later he arrives home and Lisa is waiting for him in the lobby; they talk for the first time. She is pregnant and has become sentimental about parenthood, wanting just to meet her own father. She tells him about a dream she's had, that he's been trying to find her all these years in order to say he was sorry for abandoning her. Will <b>says</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "Yes I am." ...|$|E

5000|$|Father Stone's {{parents and}} {{maternal}} grandmother arrive, with his somewhat boisterous father very apologetic for his son's behaviour, scolding him for upsetting his mother like this, and {{saying it would}} have been better if he had been killed. Paul's ominous grandmother <b>says</b> <b>quietly</b> to Ted that she [...] "knows what he is up to", frightening him. His mother then tells Ted what a hero he is to Father Stone; to Ted's surprise, when he returns from visiting Craggy Island, Paul is constantly talking and telling his parents about his stay. He even counts the days until his next holiday on a calendar with Ted's picture on it and has drawn an elaborate picture of himself and Ted.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the opinion}} of experts {{one of the few}} errors Jackson made was to fail to read Carthy's body {{language}} and press home the advantage when he was persuading him to go down the road of surrendering peacefully. There was a moment during their talks when John put the gun down, putting {{his head in his hands}} rubbing the sides of his head, his voice breaking <b>saying</b> <b>quietly</b> I don't know... Jackson failed to see this as a 'buy sign', a sign of serious consideration, that his argument was working.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only other}} {{ceremonial}} {{elevation of the}} chalice after the consecration in the Eastern Churches occurs after the communion of the faithful. The priest lifts the chalice and makes the Sign of the Cross with it over the antimension as he <b>says</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "Blessed is our God...". He then turns towards the faithful, raises the chalice—which still contains the consecrated Body and Blood of Christ—as and says {{the rest of the}} blessing aloud: [...] "...Always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages." [...] The choir responds: [...] "Let our mouths be filled with Thy praise, O Lord, that we may chant of Thy glory. For Thou hast made us worthy to partake of Thy holy, divine, immortal, and life-giving Mysteries. Establish Thou us in Thy Holiness, that all the day long we may meditate upon Thy righteousness. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Though Emily {{talks to}} Jack again, {{she is not}} pleased to see him, and keeps the {{conversation}} light and short. Victoria gets a call from Conrad's head of security, Frank (Max Martini), and he tells her that Emily's past from the ages of 16-18 is sealed by the courts, as though she never existed. He then tells Victoria that Emily and Michael Davis (Lydia's ex-husband) were both on New York's landmark and preservation association. He observes that Michael and Emily were absent on the same day, and assumes that Emily was the woman Michael left Lydia for. Victoria demands that he follow Emily everywhere she goes. After all the guests have left, Emily lights a single candle on a cupcake and <b>says</b> <b>quietly</b> to herself, [...] "Happy Birthday Amanda", implying it is her real birthday today.|$|E
5000|$|Andy and Lucy console {{one another}} in the {{aftermath}} of the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant, where Annie was kidnapped by Windom Earle. Cooper, Harry, and Hawk contemplate the chalkboard map, as Cooper <b>says</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "Fire walk with me." [...] Pete Martell enters the police station exclaiming, [...] "Grand theft auto!" [...] and says the Log Lady stole his truck and drove off toward the woods. There were [...] "...twelve rainbow trout in the truck bed." [...] Truman recalls a circle of twelve sycamore trees in the woods: Glastonbury Grove, where Hawk found the pages torn from Laura's diary. The Log Lady arrives carrying a jar of black oil given to her by her husband before his death. Cooper informs Pete that Windom Earle stole his truck. The Log Lady says, [...] "This oil is an opening to a gateway." [...] The oil smells like scorched engine oil. Hawk brings in Ronnette Pulaski, who recognizes the odor from the night of Laura Palmer's death.|$|E

6000|$|There was, then, {{a feeling}} almost of {{disappointment}} when Ned {{walked into the}} playground looking much as usual, except that his face was pale and his eyes looked heavy and dull. No one asked him any questions; for although Ned was a general favorite, it was generally understood {{that he was not}} the sort of fellow to be asked questions that might put him out. When they went in school, and the first class was called up, Ned, who was always at its head, took his place {{at the bottom of the}} class, <b>saying</b> <b>quietly</b> to the master: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{talked of}} {{the courage of}} modern men. He was {{astonished}} at the quickness with which they came to disregard shrapnel. And they were so quietly enduring when they were wounded. He had {{seen a lot of}} the wounded, and he had expected much groaning and crying out. But unless a man is hit in the head and goes mad he does not groan or scream! They are just brave. If you ask them how they feel it is always one of two things: either they <b>say</b> <b>quietly</b> that they are very bad or else they say there is nothing the matter....|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned focus of the novella on the grieving process, another theme woven {{into the fabric of}} the novella is that of bicycle safety. The book strongly suggests that had Mick been wearing a bicycle helmet, he would not have died from his injuries. In one scene, as Phoebe is experiencing a sense of guilt over Mick's death, her father sighs heavily, and <b>says</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "If only I had made him wear his helmet." [...] The theme is brought around again {{towards the end of the}} book, when Phoebe moves past her own pain and anger in what Publishers Weekly calls [...] "a powerful scene in which Phoebe overcomes her own pain and anger to participate in a school assembly on bicycle safety." [...] However, Publishers Weekly also notes that the theme of bicycle safety [...] "never dominates the story", and that Park never allows the book to descend into a maudlin [...] "cautionary tale." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sugako scolds {{her husband}} saying {{he should not}} lie to children. He {{eventually}} shows her his discharge notice and she tries to get her son to accept the scooter. Chounan refuses and Okajima <b>says</b> <b>quietly</b> that they should buy him a bike, which by the next scene they apparently have. Still looking for employment Okajima does his best to be pleasant. He sees his son playing {{with a group of}} boys and their bikes only to be told that Miyoko is sick with [...] "childhood diarrhea". Upset he takes his son and rushes home to find it is true. Sugako informs him the doctor wanted Miyoko to stay at the hospital but due to money concerns she waited. Okajima says he will make the money somehow and tells his son to summon a rickshaw to take them all to the hospital. At the hospital Miyoko recovers apparently quickly, but they are forced to sell Sugako's kimono to pay the bill.|$|E

5000|$|Mother Teresa {{encouraged}} {{members of}} her order to secretly baptise dying patients, {{without regard to the}} individual's religion. Susan Shields, {{a former member of the}} Missionaries of Charity, writes that [...] "Sisters were to ask each person in danger of death if he wanted a 'ticket to heaven'. An affirmative reply was to mean consent to baptism. The sister was then to pretend that she was just cooling the patient’s head with a wet cloth, while in fact she was baptising him, <b>saying</b> <b>quietly</b> the necessary words. Secrecy was important so that it would not come to be known that Mother Teresa’s sisters were baptising Hindus and Muslims." ...|$|R
6000|$|Big {{though he}} was, Grim {{staggered}} {{back from the}} impetuous shock, and O'Riley, following up his advantage, kicked the ball in a side direction, away from everyone except Buzzby, who happened to have been steering rather wildly over the field of ice. Buzzby, on being brought thus unexpectedly within reach of the ball, braced up his energies for a kick, but seeing O'Riley coming down towards him like a runaway locomotive, he pulled up, <b>saying</b> <b>quietly</b> to himself: [...] "Ye may take it all yer own way, lad; I'm too old a bird to go for to make my carcass a buffer for a mad-cap like you to run agin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As your {{distress}} is {{occasioned by}} my company," [...] said Eve, [...] "it is fortunately {{in my power}} to relieve it." [...] Thus <b>saying,</b> she <b>quietly</b> walked across the room, and took her seat next to Mademoiselle Viefville.|$|R
