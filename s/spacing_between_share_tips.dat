As a result of the simulations, focus can be put on the relation <b>between</b> <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> rules and the evolution of the ecological equilibrium.

Applications and tools should use the store to configure drivers by writing information into keys in the database; drivers should set watches on the appropriate keys and respond to changes appropriately [18]. Xenstore is an information storage <b>space</b> <b>shared</b> <b>between</b> domains. It is meant for configuration and status information rather than for large data transfers. Each domain gets its own path in the store, which is somewhat similar in spirit to procfs. When values change in the store, the appropriate drivers are notified [19].|$|R

With LINDA, JAVASPACES AND TSPACES, shared memorybased communication concepts have been realized on the system level with corresponding APIs. This article proposes to consequently use the same simple communication paradigm also on the user interface level. We examine existing basic technologies like JINI, JXTA and tuple spaces, analyze typical application scenarios and the underlying communication patterns. Then we discuss in detail, how these patterns can be realized with the InfoSpace mechanism which offers to each user a private local space and a view on a common <b>space</b> <b>shared</b> <b>between</b> all participants in a specific logical InfoSpace. Finally we show an architecture which realizes the InfoSpace infrastructure and report on first experience with a JINIbased solution. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: UNIX {{provides}} a programming {{model for the}} user which gives an illusion of multiprocessing. On uniprocessors, this illusion works well, providing communication paths, process security and a simple programming environment. Unfortunately, this model is not powerful enough {{to take full advantage}} of modern multiprocessor hardware. This results from a design which uses data queueing and preemption to provide the multiprocessing illusion. Recent proposals for lightweight processes in UNIX show that other programming models may be effectively supported as well. These models provide for virtual address <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>between</b> tasks by breaking the process into several lightweight contexts that may be manipulated more quickly than a normal process. Unfortunately, such models raise questions about support for normal UNIX semantics, scheduling performance, and kernel overhead. This paper describes a new programming model which goes beyond simple address space sharing, providing a selection of shared resources whil...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe environment, as a <b>space</b> <b>shared</b> <b>between</b> agents, {{is a key}} {{component}} of multiagent systems (MAS). Depending on systems, this space may integrate physical, communication or social dimensions. Each of them has its own process and rules to support agents' interaction. For instance, in the physical dimension, the rules may be based on the agents' location. The agents' interaction is then contextualized, and the environment allows a multi-agent control since it performs the interactions according to the state and rules of the MAS. The dimensions of the environment are generally connected either in an application-dependent ad-hoc way outside of the agents or within each agent. In order to ensure a multi-agent control, the relations between dimensions must be explicit outside of the agents. Using these relations between the environment dimensions, the interaction becomes also multi-dimensional. In this paper, we propose to formalize rules and mechanisms to make this connection outside of the agents and in a generic way...|$|R
