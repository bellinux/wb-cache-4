5|$|Certain solids are {{selenium}}-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by <b>some</b> <b>plants.</b> In soils, selenium {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff.

5|$|Defensive {{structures}} and chemicals are costly as they require resources that could otherwise {{be used by}} plants to maximize growth and reproduction. Many models have been proposed to explore how and why <b>some</b> <b>plants</b> make this investment in defenses against herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids with Banksia marginata and B.integrifolia {{have been}} {{recorded}} at Nadgee Nature Reserve, where all three species occur.

5|$|Alternatively, the {{ancestor}} of Oryzomys peninsulae may have arrived by rafting {{during the late}} Miocene, about six million years ago, when {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula was an island located near what is now Nayarit and Jalisco in western Mexico. <b>Some</b> <b>plants</b> and birds from the area may have a similar biogeographic heritage.|$|E
5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (<b>some</b> <b>plants</b> may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E
5|$|In addition, <b>some</b> <b>plants</b> use {{fatty acid}} derivates, amino acids and even {{peptides}} as defenses. The cholinergic toxine, cicutoxin of water hemlock, is a polyyne {{derived from the}} fatty acid metabolism. β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid as simple amino acid {{is used by the}} sweet pea which leads also to intoxication in humans. The synthesis of fluoroacetate in several plants {{is an example of the}} use of small molecules to disrupt the metabolism of herbivores, in this case the citric acid cycle.|$|E

5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and <b>some</b> <b>plants</b> are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. <b>Some</b> <b>plants</b> produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have seeds that are dispersed by ants. Seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. <b>Some</b> <b>plants</b> in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E

5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that <b>some</b> <b>plants</b> are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is a {{component}} of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and <b>some</b> <b>plants</b> (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|E
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and <b>some</b> <b>plants.</b> Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>plants</b> {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>plants</b> {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>plants,</b> {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
