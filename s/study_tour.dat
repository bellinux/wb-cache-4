5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, {{when he heard a}} baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{goes along}} to a cookery class that Vanessa is {{teaching}} and flirts with Tiffany Giles (Shaye Hopkins) to make Vanessa jealous. She invites him {{to dinner and}} he suffers an allergic reaction to the food. Vanessa and Rhys almost kiss, but are interrupted by Lucas. The following day, Rhys goes to Harold's Store and kisses Vanessa. Rhys opens up to her about his father and they arrange a date. When Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) is brought into the hospital, he tells Rhys that Jade attacked him. Rhys reports this {{to the police and}} when Jade finds out, she asks him to leave the house. Rhys applies for a three-month <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> in Japan and asks Vanessa to come with him. Rhys' mother later gives him a ring so that he can propose to Vanessa. Shortly before leaving for Japan, Rhys comes across a car accident involving the street's teenagers. He rings the emergency services, before assessing their injuries. Rhys cuts his hand on a piece of wreckage, which forces him to cancel the trip to Japan. He later learns that he has only a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. Following an EMG, Rhys learns that there has been no improvement to his hand. After altering the report to say that his nerves are healing, Rhys is invited to assist Jessica in surgery.|$|E

For three years he studied there with eagerness, exploring figure painting and genre works.

25|$|Fomin {{acquired}} a solid reputation, {{but did not}} have an architect’s license yet. He returned to St.Petersburg in 1905 and completed Leon Benois' course at the Academy of Arts in 1909, winning a one-year <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> to Greece, Egypt and Italy. At this time, Neoclassical Revival became the leading style in St. Petersburg, and the most technologically advanced. Banks and department stores, who favored the style, could afford a steel frame and concrete slab floors. A combination of money and technology allowed the mix of classical columns and arches with large glass surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, King {{received}} a British Council grant for a <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> of printmaking facilities in England. He also visited France, Switzerland, Italy and America, where {{he visited the}} Pratt Graphics Centre in New York. Later, in 1974, the Kings visited Europe and also Japan, where one of their daughters was studying. King was able to study Japanese printmaking and papermaking techniques. King noted later that this experience had been important for his work. In 1976, the Kings again went to Europe, visiting Germany, the Netherlands and Norway and returned via Japan. There were further study trips to Europe and Japan in 1982 and to America in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In 1836 Christian briefly joined as {{assistant}} {{the office of}} William Railton (c.1801–1877), later architect of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London, who was appointed as Architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1838 – a post which Christian later succeeded to. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners were set up as a permanent body {{by the government in}} 1836 to administer the estates and revenues of the Church of England. Following a <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> of Italy in 1837 Christian went into the office of John Brown (c.1806–76) in Norwich and supervised the construction of Brown's St Margaret's Church at Lee in Lewisham and his Colchester Union Workhouse (here Christian's close scrutiny of the work so irritated the labourers that they deliberately caused a drain to burst in order to discredit him). In 1841 he designed his first independent building, the Marylebone Savings Bank, perhaps commissioned through local and family connections. Between 1841 and 1842 Christian embarked on a long continental <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> in company with other young architects who were to remain lifelong friends and following this he established his own architectural practice in October 1842 at 44 Bloomsbury Square, London, where he also lived (he later moved across to the former home of Isaac D'Israeli, father of the famous Prime Minister, on a corner of the square). On his marriage in 1848 to Annie Bentham (1814–1913), a relation of the Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, Christian set up home in Hampstead in the north London suburbs while continuing his business in Bloomsbury. The couple were to have four daughters – Eleanor, Anne Elizabeth, Agnes and Alice. Anne Elizabeth, known as 'Bessie', was Christian's favourite daughter who died in 1890 after giving birth to Christian's only grandchild, Ewan Christopher Blaxland (1889–1954), who became a clergyman as his grandfather was originally intended to be.|$|E

25|$|Ewan Christian {{is mostly}} remembered today for his {{design of the}} National Portrait Gallery (1890–95) in St Martin's Place, London, {{situated}} just north of Trafalgar Square. However, the building, faced in Portland stone, is not typical of his work and was built {{towards the end of}} his life, being completed shortly after his death. Christian was an unexpected and controversial choice for such a commission and was appointed by the donor for the new building W. H. Alexander (1832–1905). In the autumn of 1889 the architect embarked on a <b>study</b> <b>tour</b> of continental museums and art galleries in order to prepare himself for the task, an exhausting project which included visits to Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Berlin, Frankfurt, Kassel and Dresden.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of {{innovation}} was spread by several means. Workers who {{were trained in}} the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a <b>study</b> <b>tour,</b> gathering information where he could. During {{the whole of the}} Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.|$|E

Key to the study is how the contribution of <b>study</b> <b>tours</b> on oversight has been construed by staff and committee members in the Limpopo Legislature. The study was conducted from a qualitative perspective through interviews, focus group discussion and documentary analysis. The results of the study show that lack of common understanding on oversight rendered the lessons drawn from <b>study</b> <b>tours</b> meaningless. Capacities to discharge the oversight function and leadership have been identified by the study as essential to committees and the legislature respectively. The findings show that this is most likely the first study on the contribution of <b>study</b> <b>tours</b> to oversight function within the legislative environment in the country. It is therefore significant because it sets out the background for future academic research on the topic...|$|R
