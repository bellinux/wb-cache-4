25|$|Historically, {{there are}} several {{scientific}} approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that {{can be measured in}} a laboratory; the kinetic theory of gases which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on statistical physics and quantum mechanics. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature. Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from <b>statistical</b> <b>averages</b> of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using natural units, temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern metric system of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the Boltzmann constant, a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.|$|E

A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the average quantity of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (mean spatial distribution) and over the entire expected time period (mean temporal distribution).

The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the Indian Meteorological Department with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables.|$|E
6000|$|The {{process of}} {{composite}} portraiture {{is one of}} pictorial statistics. It is a familiar fact that the average height of even a dozen men of the same race, taken at hazard, varies so little, that for ordinary statistical purposes it may be considered constant. The same may {{be said of the}} measurement of every separate feature and limb, and of every tint, whether of skin, hair, or eyes. Consequently a pictorial combination of any one of these separate traits would lead to results no less constant than the <b>statistical</b> <b>averages.</b> In a portrait, there is another factor to be considered besides the measurement of the separate traits, namely, their relative position; but this, too, in a sufficiently large group, would necessarily have a statistical constancy.

40|$|Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test; <b>statistical</b> <b>average</b> spectra formula Abstract. The {{analyses}} on {{the statistical}} response spectra {{have an important}} role in determining the earthquake demand. Elastic and inelastic spectra on acceleration of the 205 records on medium-stiff soil site for SDOF systems are presented in statistical analyses. The empirical probability distributions of the spectral values are derived according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test. The formula for <b>statistical</b> <b>average</b> spectra of the ground motion ensemble are recommended, which are valuable for current research and code revisal. The results show that the <b>statistical</b> <b>averaged</b> elastic α spectra fits well to the design spectra prescribed in Chinese code when the period is smaller than 2 s. The inelastic responses decrease with the increase of ductility demand µ when µ< 4. The coefficients of variance of the elastic and inelastic spectra are still large and the dispersion cannot be ignored. The probabilistic distribution of the spectra value on acceleration is validated as the lognormal distributions.
