50|$|BMW {{would reach}} an {{agreement}} with Vickers to acquire Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motor Cars on 31 April 1998 for £340m, but this was superseded by an agreement for Volkswagen Group to acquire the business for £430m, which was announced eight days later, on 7 May 1998.

40|$|Shareholder {{voting on}} {{corporate}} acquisitions is controversial. In most countries, acquisition decisions are delegated to boards, and <b>shareholder</b> <b>approval</b> is discretionary, which makes existing empirical studies inconclusive. We study the U. K. {{setting in which}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>approval</b> is imposed exogenously via a threshold test that provides strong identification. U. K. shareholders gain 8 cents per dollar at announcement with mandatory voting, or $ 13. 6 billion over 1992 - 2010 in aggregate; without voting, U. K. shareholders lost $ 3 billion. Multidimensional regression discontinuity analysis supports a causal interpretation. The evidence suggests that mandatory voting imposes a binding constraint on acquirer chief executive officers.
