40|$|During {{the last}} several decades {{radiation}} therapy of superficial tumors by megavoltage electron beams has been widely applied in human and veterinary medicine. The objective of our research was to investigate clinical and pathohistological changes in the rabbit skin during a 90 -day period after a single local electron beam irradiation of posterior extremity, and to investigate the impact of the single application dose of irradiation on dynamics and severity of acute skin changes in rabbits. Experimental trial was conducted on 18 adult New Zealand white rabbit males divided into 3 groups of 6 rabbits, whose left posterior extremity was irradiated with a single total dose of 55, 65 and 75 Gy, respectively, on the field size 10 x 10 cm, using 6 MeV beams. Clinical observation of the skin changes during the 90 -day postradiation period in all the three experimental groups of rabbits singly irradiated by megavoltage electron beams in total doses of 55, 65 i 75 Gy resulted in occurrence of epilation, erythema, dry desquamation, edema,  moist desquamation, <b>secondary</b> <b>ulceration,</b> and reparation. Severity of the main acute responses of the rabbit skin such as erythema, and dry and moist desquamation was proportional to the single high dose of megavoltage electron irradiation, and was reflected in time between irradiation to clinical symptoms as well as the duration of symptoms. Pathohistological changes in the rabbit skin and subcutaneous tissue were observed on the 20 th, 50 th, and 90 th day upon irradiation, and their severity was growing in proportion with the dose (55, 65 i 75 Gy) following the dynamics and severity of the acute clinical skin changes.

40|$|Objective: The {{occurrence}} of digestive complications especially upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) has increased after cardiac surgery. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the incidence of UGIB and identify the independent risk factors. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 1077 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) from 1994 to 2012 The group of patients with UGIB (n 1 = 20) was compared with the population group (n 2 = 1057). Demographic characteristics, therapeutic management, endoscopic findings, and outcomes were analyzed. Through a regression analysis we identified independent risk factors of UGIB. Results: The mean age of the group n 1 was 58. 2 ± 12. 4 years and 50. 18 ± 13. 5 years in the group n 2. UGIB occurred about 13 ± 5. 5 days after cardiac surgery. Gastroduodenal ulcer was the most common etiology of hemorrhage (n = 13, 65 %). Renal insufficiency, previous gastric ulcer, increased lactate concentration during CPB, prolonged mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressor drug and pulmonary infection was likely contributing factors in UGIB.

40|$|BACKGROUND In Chopart-level amputations {{the heel}} often {{deviates}} into equinus and varus when, {{due to the}} lack of healthy anterior soft tissue, rebalancing tendon transfers to the talar head are not possible. Consequently, anterior and lateral wound dehiscence and ulceration may occur requiring higher-level amputation to achieve wound closure, with considerable loss of function for the patients. METHODS Twenty-four consecutive patients (15 diabetes, 6 trauma, and 3 tumor) had Chopart's amputation and simultaneous or delayed additional ankle dorsiflexion arthrodesis to allow for tension-free wound closure or soft tissue reconstruction, or to treat <b>secondary</b> recurrent <b>ulcerations.</b> Percutaneous Achilles tendon lengthening and subtalar arthrodesis were added as needed. Wound healing problems, time to fusion and full weight-bearing in the prosthesis, complications in the prosthesis, and the ambulatory status were assessed. Satisfaction and function were evaluated by the AmpuPro score and the validated Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire scale. RESULTS Five patients had successful soft tissue healing and fusions but died of their underlying disease 2 to 46 months after the operation. Two diabetic patients required a transtibial amputation. The other 17 patients were followed for 27 months (range, 13 - 63). The average age of the 4 women and 13 men was 53. 9 years (range, 16 - 87). Postoperative complications included minor wound healing problems in 8 patients, wound breakdown requiring revision in 4, phantom pain in 3, residual equinus in 1, and adjacent scar carcinoma in 1 patient. The time to full weight-bearing in the prosthesis ranged from 6 to 24 weeks (mean 10). The mean AmpuPro score was 107 points (of 120), and the mean Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire scale was 147 points (of 200). No complications occurred with the prosthesis. Twelve patients lost 1 to 2 mobility classes (mean 0. 9). The arthrodeses all healed within 2. 5 months (range, 1. 5 to 5 months). CONCLUSION Adding an ankle arthrodesis to a Chopart's amputation either immediately or in a delayed fashion to treat anterior soft tissue complications was a successful salvage in most patients at this amputation level. It enabled the patients to preserve the advantages of a full-length limb with terminal weight-bearing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV, retrospective case series...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-three {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} duodenal ulceration complicated by pyloric stenosis who {{came under the}} care of one surgeon were treated by highly selective vagotomy (HSV) combined with digital dilatation of the stenosis through a gastrotomy. No form of drainage procedure was used. Thus the antral "mill" and the pyloric sphineter were left intact. Since the stenosis is usually distal to the pylorus rather than truly pyloric such dilatation does not damage the pyloric ring, although it may on occasion lead to perforation of {{the first part of the}} duodenum. The subsequent progress of these patients was compared with that of a similar, consecutive series of 23 patients with pyloric stenosis who were treated by truncal vagotomy with a drainage procedure by other surgeons on the same surgical unit. Patients were followed up for between four months and five years. The clinical assessment was carried out in "blind" fashion at a special gastric follow-up clinic. No evidence of recurrent ulceration was found in either group of patients. Two patients from each group subsequently came to reoperation for the relief of gastric stasis. Twenty-two of the 23 patients (96 %) who had undergone HSV plus dilatation eventually achieved a good-to-excellent clinical result (Visick grades 1 + 2), wheras only 17 of the 23 patients (74 %) who had undergone truncal vagotomy with drainage achieved such a result. The main clinical difference between the two groups was that side effects such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain or discomfort were more common after vagotomy with drainage than after HSV. These results bear witness to the remarkable propulsive powers of the gastric antrum after HSV, which were evidently sufficient to overcome any tendency to re-stenosis in more than 90 % of patients. The 9 % incidence of failure due to re-stenosis could perhaps be avoided if a small duodenoplasty were performed instead of simple digital dilatation. The results support the hypothesis that damage to the antral mill and pyloric sphincter can be avoided in the course of operations for "pyloric" stenosis <b>secondary</b> to duodenal <b>ulceration.</b> Avoidance of the drainage procedure is of benefit to the patient, just as it is in patients who have duodenal ulceration without stenosis...|$|R

The effects of blood loss on liver function can lead to an unduly pessimistic assessment of liver status. An effective choice of emergency surgical procedure may require considerable surgical expertise. Oesophageal transection and devascularisation are satisfactory for many patients with oesophageal varices secondary to cirrhosis and should nearly always control bleeding. Difficulties arise in patients who are grossly obese and in those who have undergone extensive surgery in the upper abdomen. Problems may also be encountered in those treated by repeated sclerotherapy, which may have caused severe inflammatory change and thickening around the lower oesophagus and upper stomach. We believe that an emergency mesocaval shunt using either a vein graft or a synthetic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene is the procedure of choice for this difficult group of very sick patients. The surgical exposure is satisfactory and not unduly prolonged in even the largest patients and the technique does not interfere with any subsequent transplant operation. There is a greater choice {{in the management of}} the patient with less urgent bleeding from recurrent varices after sclerotherapy. Repeat sclerotherapy may be effective for small oesophageal varices while liver transplantation may be indicated in the patient with deteriorating liver function. A selective distal splenorenal shunt should be considered for patients with intact splenic and left renal veins and a mesocaval vein graft for the remainder. We would therefore suggest that surgery should still be considered for the management of portal hypertension, particularly in the following circumstances: (1) Uncontrollable bleeding during the initial course of sclerotherapy; (2) Life threatening haemorrhage from recurrent varices; (3) Bleeding from ectopic varices not accessible to sclerotherapy; (4) Uncontrollable bleeding from oesophageal <b>ulceration</b> <b>secondary</b> to injection sclerotherapy; (5) Severe, symptomatic hypersplenism; (6) For patients who live in communities remote from blood transfusion facilities and adequate medical care. The management of the complications of portal hypertension continues to pose problems. We believe that the best results should come from a combined management approach using injection sclerotherapy as primary treatment and surgery for complications and for haemorrhage from unusual anatomical sites...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} outcomes after endovascular intervention (EVI) {{for chronic}} critical limb ischemia (CLI) by Rutherford category (RC) 4, rest pain; and 5, tissue loss. MethodsThe medical records of all EVI performed for RC- 4 to RC- 5 by vascular surgeons {{at a single}} institution during a 3 -year period were reviewed for sustained clinical success (SCS), defined as Rutherford improvement score (RIS) 2 +, without target extremity revascularization (TER). The RC- 5 group was evaluated for patency until healing and healing ≤ 4 months without recurrence or new <b>ulceration.</b> <b>Secondary</b> sustained clinical success (SSCS) was a RIS of 2 + with TER. The RC- 5 group was evaluated for patency until healing and healing {{at any time during}} follow-up, without recurrent or new ulceration. Significance was established at the 0. 05 level. ResultsOf 106 EVI performed for CLI, 78 (74 %) were RC- 5. There were 39 (37 %) men. Mean age was 73 ± 12 years. Mean follow-up was 19 months (range, 1 - 44 months). RC- 5 patients were significantly more likely than RC- 4 to be diabetic (58 % vs 32 %; P =. 020), dialysis dependent (14 % vs 0 %; P =. 036), and to require distal EVI (53 % vs 29 %; P =. 029). RC- 4 patients {{were more likely to be}} current smokers (57 % vs 32 %; P =. 023). At 24 months, survival was comparable, with RC- 4 at 84 % ± 8 % vs RC- 5 at 62 % ± 7 % (P =. 09), but limb salvage was significantly better for RC- 4 (100 %) vs RC- 5 (83 % ± 4 %; P =. 026), as was SCS (48 % vs 21 %; P =. 006) and SSCS (85 % vs 39 %; P <. 001). Independent predictors of failed SSCS were diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 2. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 07 - 7. 46; P =. 036), congestive heart failure (CHF; OR, 3. 62; 95 % CI, 1. 19 - 10. 99; P =. 023), and RC- 5 (OR, 5. 5; 95 % CI, 2. 4 - 30. 3; P =. 001). SSCS was 94 % in RC- 4 patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) or CHF and 10 % in RC- 5 with DM or CHF (P <. 001) but improved to 67 % in RC- 5 when neither CHF nor DM were present (P =. 004). ConclusionsRC- 4 have fewer comorbidities, less advanced ischemia, and better outcome than RC- 5. These groups should be evaluated individually. Limb salvage was acceptable, yet early wound healing without TER (SCS) occurred in only 21 %. RC- 5, DM, and CHF were predictors of poor SSCS. Careful selection of patients should improve outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{conducted}} 12 autopsy cases of malnutrition which showed enteritis as the complication in that process. They were observed pathologic-histologically {{and the following}} changes are confirmed. The areas in which the changes of enteritis appear in malnutrition, are. usually the large intestine and also the end part of small intestine. The mucous layer of intestine in these cases showed to incline to necrobiosis. And in the surrounding tissue we found the infiltration of the round cells which contain usually histiocytes and lymphocytes but few leucocytes. There are recognizable dilatation of capillaries full of erythrocytes and the erythrodiapedesis in the necrotic areas. In the more advanced cases we found {{the erosion of the}} mucous layer. And in the most severe cases the ulcers of intestine occured. But the appearance of fibrin in these infiammative areas is usually scanty. In the necrotic areas of the beginning stage of this enteritis no bacterial proliferations are microscopically observed. But in the superficial layer of ulcers in the end stage of this enteritis moderate proliferation of cocci which gave usually positive in Gramm staining. So this bacterial invasion does not mean the primary cause of enteritis. In the necrotic areas of the mucosa the diffuse fatty debris appeared with fatty degenerated leucocytes. The submucous tissue showed the remarkable edematous thickening. They are rich in severe dilated capillaries with the remarkable perivascular infiltration of lymphoid cells but few leucocytes: In the severe cases these lymphocytic infiltrations appeared also in the muscularis of the intestine with slight fatty debris but no appearance of fibrin. The miiscularis and the serosa are usually edematous thickened with the infiltration or round cells. The mesenteric lymph nodes in the neighbourhood of the ulcerated parts of intestine showed the swelling by the resorption of blood in these autopsy cases. In the aforementioned findings the acute necrobiotic enteritis in malnutrition is not inclined to the leucocytic infiltration with the appearance of fibrin in the areas but shows the remarkable dilatation of blood capillaries with erythrodiapedesis into the space of connective tissues. These changes of the intestine are different from the changes in the bacterial enteritis and are resembling the changes in uraemia, i. e. the favorite occurence in the large intestine and the end part of small intestine, the necrosis of mucous layer with the infiltration of round cells and the dilatation of capillaries with the erythrodiapedesis in the edematous submucous tissues. In the severe cases of enteritis in malnutrition we confirmed the remarkable degenerative atrophy of the endocrine apparat (so called secretory tube, 2 ̆ 2 Streifensttick 2 ̆ 2 Zimmermann) of salivary gland which shows to have the effect on the maintainance of mesenchymal tissues including the reticulo-endothelial system. But in the slight cases of enteritis the changes of that part of salivary glands are slight. And in the genuine cases of malnutrition which have no complication of enteritis, the salivary gland shows moderate hypertrophy especially in the endocrine part: 2 ̆ 2 secretory tube, Streifenstuck 2 ̆ 2 Zimmermann. So we are inclined to the opinion that the enteritis in malnutrition does not occur primarily enterogen but endogen as well as in uraemia, following the secondary enterogen bacterial infection. And in that stage the disturbance of the internal secretion of salivary gland has the remarkable meaning of the <b>secondary</b> appearance of <b>ulceration</b> of intestine by the bacterial infection...|$|R
