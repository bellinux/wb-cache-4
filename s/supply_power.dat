5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, can <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> {{directly to}} an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host devices that <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> and type-B receptacles on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.|$|E
5|$|To {{reliably}} {{enable a}} charge-only feature, modern USB accessory peripherals now include charging cables that provide power {{connections to the}} host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> from a converter device and do not include a host device and data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable.|$|E
50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R

5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Two millennia ago, humans {{developed}} spyrix, a {{power source}} which absorbs spirits to <b>supply</b> <b>power.</b> In response, the spirit Maxwell gathered humans, {{who share a}} symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As spirits are needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier. Twenty {{years prior to the}} present, an Elympion cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia, eventually forming a terrorist group known as Exodus. Exodus works with the Elympios military {{to find a way to}} destroy the barrier. In the present era, Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and Auj Oule. While the two countries appear to live in harmony, they both initiate black operations in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{was born}} in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until {{the final days of}} the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was {{initially}} employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> in competition with C Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C's property for a good price, and gained public esteem.|$|E
