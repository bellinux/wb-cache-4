50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the city became {{home to a}} number of U.S. Department of Defense facilities, most notably the Clinton County Air Force Base. Following its closure in 1971, the economy of the city hovered in {{recession}} for more than a decade. After a number of small attempts to reuse the abandoned air force base, Airborne Express purchased the facility in 1979 for $850,000, a fraction of the estimated $100 million spent to construct it. During the next 24 years, Airborne invested more than $250 million to build a hub for its national delivery network, including new sort centers, a 9000 ft runway, aircraft hangars, machine <b>shops,</b> <b>flight</b> simulators, a state of art control tower, and a modern administration building to accommodate an estimated 6,000 employees and its fleet of 125 DC-8, DC-9 and Boeing 767 aircraft.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of a city with access to two firms or {{facilities}} (shopping malls, airports, commercial districts) selling a differentiated product (<b>shopping,</b> <b>flights)</b> and/or offering a differentiated workplace is studied. Transport connections to one facility are congested. A model is presented for this asymmetric duopoly game that can be solved for a Nash equilibrium in prices and wages. A comparative statics analysis is used to illustrate {{the properties of the}} equilibrium. A numerical model is then applied to the two Brussels airports. Three stylized policies are implemented to address the congestion problem: expansion of transport capacity, congestion pricing, and a direct subsidy to the uncongested facility. Our results indicate that the degree of intrinsic differentiation between the two firms is crucial in determining the difference in profit and market share. Price and wage differences also depend on trip frequency and consumer preferences for diversity. Congestion pricing is the most effective policy tool but all three options are shown to have attractive attributes. Copyright (c) 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|R

50|$|A $70 million {{renovation}} of airport facilities, designed by Brubaker, Brandt Inc., was initiated in 1979 for the airport's 50th anniversary and completed in 1981. This upgraded the airport's capacity to 250 flights per day by adding {{what is known}} today as Concourse B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south concourse (now Concourse A) was dedicated. The concourse was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until they shut it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north concourse was completed in 1996, which is now Concourse C, and was expanded in 2002.Between 1998 and 2000, numerous airport expansion and renovation projects were completed, including a $25 million terminal renovation in 1998 that included additional retail <b>shops,</b> new <b>flight</b> information displays, enhanced lighting, upgraded flooring, and a new food court.

5000|$|One {{slide rule}} {{remaining}} in daily use {{around the world}} is the E6B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called [...] "prayer wheel" [...] is still available in <b>flight</b> <b>shops,</b> and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.|$|R
50|$|By May 1899 {{it began}} to look as though war was a real possibility. First to leave were the wives and {{children}} of middle and upper-class families. By June white miners joined the <b>flight.</b> <b>Shop</b> assistants {{and others in the}} urban economy were notified by their employers that their services would not be required {{after the end of the}} month. Between May and mid-October nearly 100,000 white people fled the district. Thus, at the onset of war, there were only about 10,000 whites in the city. The task of transporting this number of people — as well as the more than 100,000 non-whites who left — was an enormous one. At first only third-class passengers were consigned to trucks which normally carried coal, livestock or Africans. By the middle of October even first class passengers were quite happy to travel in coal trucks to the coast.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} primary entrances to U.N.C.L.E. headquarters. In the daytime, field agents are {{admitted}} {{by way of}} Del Floria's, a small, nondescript tailor/dry-cleaning <b>shop</b> located one <b>flight</b> below street level. The agents go to the single fitting booth and turn the coat hook on the back wall. Outside in the shop, an operator activates a mechanism on the pressing machine that releases the disguised armored door. The wall swings inward and an agent finds him/herself in the main admissions area. There, a receptionist pins on a security badge (white or later, yellow for highest security clearance; red and green for low clearance and visitors). A chemical on the receptionist's fingers activates the badge. There are also entrances through the Men's and Women's lockers {{at the rear of}} the parking garage (admissions for non-field personnel). After hours, when Del Floria's is closed, agents may also enter through the Masque Club or through the offices of the charitable organization.|$|R
5000|$|Time {{limit is}} the most common {{technique}} of hunger marketing. Time limit also has huge impact on consumption because It is one of the direct stimuli to consumers. It is used in many home shopping and internet shopping sites. QVC, one of the biggest home shopping website, has a banner on their first page and it says “Ends in time”, which is limited with a comment, and ‘Today’s special value’ in order to attract consumers’ attention. Also, “almost sold out!” or “we are about to terminate selling! In a minute!” is a comment often used in home <b>shopping</b> sites or <b>flight</b> and hotel sites, and it stimulates customers’ interests. “The time limit for this product,” or “Only 10 items left” is the case that companies try to attract people’s attention as well. This time limitation strategy is often used with special discounts strategies such as “Only today, up to 50%.” In fact, by limiting the time of offering their products, they make consumers have feeling like “I am allowed to buy this product only this time!” ...|$|R
40|$|This {{instruction}} implements AFPD 32 - 10, Installations and Facilities. It {{provides the}} directive {{requirements for the}} operations management of civil engineering. It establishes a civil engineer worldwide baseline set of definitions, operations process descriptions, and organizational guidance which applies to the objective operations flight organization for both groups and squadrons (civil engineer groups should use the appropriate organizational equivalent to flight used in this AFI). Paragraph 2. does not apply when operations management functions are cost-compared under OMB Circular A- 76 (if cost-compared, operations management functions will be spelled out in a Performance Requirements Document). Additionally, major commands (MAJCOM) may elect to further restrict applicability of this AFI based on competitive sourcing initiatives and to accommodate MAJCOM-unique requirements and desired flexibility.

5000|$|After {{beginning}} {{by painting}} religious works, in the 1550s {{he developed the}} painting of domestic scenes in which he reproduced articles of furniture, cooking utensils, and food with great flair and realism. His Butcher's <b>Shop,</b> with the <b>Flight</b> into Egypt (Uppsala, 1551) [...] "has been called the earliest example of Mannerist inversion of still life in Northern painting", showing the [...] "lower" [...] subject matter far more prominently than the subject from history painting. [...] A similar inversion in landscape painting had been developed by Joachim Patinir in Antwerp several decades earlier when he invented the world landscape. Unlike these, in Aertsen's works the genre material dominates {{the front of the}} image, with the history scene, normally religious, easy to overlook in the background. This pictorial technique drew on the paintings of another Antwerp artist, Jan Sanders van Hemessen, whose genre treatments of religious and moral scenes had smaller scenes inset into the background in a similar way.In the Uppsala painting the zones behind the butcher's stall show (from left) a view through a window of a church, the Holy Family distributing alms on their journey, a worker in the mid-ground, with a merry company eating mussels and oysters (believed to promote lust) in a back room behind. The sign at top right advertises the land behind as for sale. The painting offers the viewer a range of options for life, in an allegory on physical and spiritual food. The painting carries the coat of arms of Antwerp, suggesting it was a civic commission, perhaps by the rich Butcher's Guild. Such subjects were mostly painted before about 1560.|$|R

50|$|There are {{different}} crew duty positions an air battle manager may be qualified to perform during his career. On both the E-3, E-8 {{and in a}} CRC they begin as an airborne weapons officer (AWO), responsible for the direct control of weapons systems in the fight. This position also has several jobs that {{can be considered a}} position during a military operation,i.e. strike controller, OCA, DCA. From there, ABMs may upgrade to several different positions, depending on the platform they are serving on. Two positions common to all platforms are the senior director, who directs the weapons section (consisting of weapon directors and AWOs), and the mission crew commander, a senior ABM who controls the entire operations crew. ABMs in charge of the surveillance section are called air surveillance officers on the E-3, or sensor management officers on the E-8. The electronic combat officer, another upgrade position for AWOs,is only found on the AWACS platform and is in charge of operating certain sensors aboard the E-3 as well as infusing electronic war fare information and intelligence reports on and off the E-3 as well as expedite the F2T2EA process between strategic and tactical assets. ABMs may also serve as instructors and evaluators in whatever crew position qualification they maintain. With addition to their flying duties, ABMs also have office duties within their respective line squadron. This can be a flight scheduler, an officer in charge of a <b>shop,</b> or a <b>flight</b> commander in charge of flight operations of either 30 plus officers, 30 plus enlisted, or a mixture of both. At an air operations center, ABMs may be tasked to work in various departments to include operations or plans. When working in operations, ABMs may be tasked with various duties to include offensive operations duty officer, defensive operations duty officer, command and control duty officer, joint interface control officer, and liaison officer to name a few. Within plans, ABMs help plan future operations.|$|R
40|$|Global {{processes}} like {{globalization and}} the possibility to travel {{around the world are}} offering affluent people the possibility to travel around the world easily and to return to the places they like. In this thesis I discuss who the tourists, residential tourists and foreign residents that go to Guanacaste in Costa Rica are, how they regard the local place and environment and how involved they are in that local place and environment. Guanacaste, the research area, is a rural province at the West coast of Costa Rica. Not only the diverse landscape and tropical climate make the country attractive for tourists, also the political stability and the wealth of the Costa Rican population are attractive. Since 2001, the development of (residential) tourism projects increased dramatically in Guanacaste but since 2007 it slowed down because of the economic crisis. 	Scholars use different terms to describe the temporal migrants who move for lifestyle reasons: amenity migration, lifestyle migration and residential tourism. Various authors warn that the development of (residential) tourism in a developing country only increases social and economic inequality. Others argue that tourism can be or become a development-stimulating sector if conditions like a strong, democratic government, involved and pro-active local population and involvement between the tourists and the local population are met. Tourism and residential tourism can have a positive and stimulating effect in the tourist-receiving area, if the tourism sector has enough linkages with other economic sectors. The local environment should be carefully watched when tourism development emerges. Nature is in a tourism destination one of the most valuable assets and the area cannot afford to lose that pull factor. Tourists are not only interested in nature, but also in typical food, clothing, dancing and other entertainment. Although residential tourists are often no legal citizens in the tourist-receiving area, they might still be powerful because they are usually affluent people who are used to stand up for their rights and opinion. I divided the respondents in three groups: tourists, foreign residents and residential tourists. The majority of all respondents is from North America and is highly educated. The residential tourists are usually retired. The foreign residents are via their jobs or own businesses more involved in Costa Rica than the residential tourists or the normal tourists. There is a clear difference in spending patterns between normal tourists and residential tourists. Residential tourists and especially foreign residents spend more on supermarket <b>shopping</b> and <b>flight</b> tickets. These things do barely contribute to the local economy; most of it leaks away to, for instance, North American airlines or super market owners. Residential tourists spend a bit more on luxury and touristy things which comes back in the local economy like housing, trips and tours and eating or drinking out. The climate or weather of Costa Rica is indeed listed as the number one reason to go there. Second are the beach and nature. Also the residential tourists were highly attracted by the climate, but they were more than the other groups attracted by the property prices and services. In general, the climate, nature and relaxed lifestyle of Guanacaste are the pull factors for all groups of respondents. For the residential tourists and the foreign residents, the home country politics, tax systems and other regulations are mentioned as motives to move, so the push factors. The Costa Rican nature is far more important for the residential tourists and foreign residents than economic development or social wellbeing. They argue that the nature is what makes Costa Rica so unique, services like hospitals, gyms and internet access can be found somewhere else in the world. After nature, social wellbeing and economic growth were equally chosen by the respondents as important for Guanacaste’s future. They argue that social wellbeing is necessary to work and enjoy nature or that via economic development social wellbeing and the nature are developed. Unemployment and stagnation are seen as only temporal and not so negative as environmental degradation. Possibly the respondents see it that way because most of them do not necessarily need a flourishing economy immediately because {{they are the ones who}} were strong enough to financially survive the crisis. The respondents showed a strong preference for what they see as original Costa Rican culture and habits. The majority of them prefer to live in a small quiet place and prefer a quiet beach. Only some like both, although several respondents mention they like to live in a small rural environment but in the proximity of a big city with all kinds of services. There has to be a balance for the interviewees between tranquility and services: tranquil should not mean isolated and having access to services should not mean that those services are only delivered by international companies in big cities. The residential tourists indicated that they would prefer Guancaste to develop in a way that is well controlled, responsible and balanced, with everything thought out on forehand and environmental and aesthetic concerns taken into account, like is usually the case in their home countries. The idea that the well-thought-out plans make it possible to control the speed and direction of the local economic growth is attractive to them. So, the residential tourists and foreign residents can handle an economic crisis, but when Costa Rica becomes crowded, polluted and with all services they were used to in their home countries, the reasons for their move to Costa Rica are gone. The majority of the residential tourists and foreign residents talks in a very positive way about the economic crisis. People have to live with less money, but they say to be happier this way. The crisis is seen as an opportunity: a good reason to take a step back, reflect and slow down the development of enormous projects. The residential tourists and foreign residents are socially involved in both Costa Rica and their home country. The type of involvement differs per country. In Costa Rica, the respondents were mainly involved via the local media and in local organizations, but not so much in social life with Costa Ricans. Because there are so many other people from English-speaking countries, it is easier to get contact with them than with only Spanish-speaking people. Besides that, almost all respondents use internet to stay in contact with family and friends in their home countries so the respondents do not even need to contact Costa Ricans or Nicaraguans for their social life. Striking is that residential tourists and foreign residents are involved in local organizations, so that they want to do something for the community. In their home country, the respondents were still socially involved, mainly via internet, but not so much in social organizations. It is not possible to be an active member of, for instance, a political organization when you can never attend meetings. The residential tourists and foreign residents mainly miss non-transportable things from their home country, experiences that cannot be shipped to Costa Rica. To experience these things like the four seasons and snow at Christmas etcetera, the respondents are able to flight back in general once a year. There is a certain feeling of despair or discrimination among the residential tourists. They have the feeling that although they want to do the right thing and that they are engaged in protecting the environment, the Costa Ricans do not take them serious, left out that they would be able to make a change. Most residential tourists and foreign residents see themselves as powerless because they have the feeling that local population and the government do not even want to listen to their ideas and plans. But on several cases the residential tourist and foreign residents have been partly successful in changing plans. When is taken into account that a considerable part of these people is only on tourist visa in the country, they have a remarkable influence...|$|R
