40|$|The mineral creedite is a {{fluorinated}} hydroxy hydrated <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> {{and calcium}} of formula Ca 3 Al 2 SO 4 (F,OH) · 2 H 2 O. The mineral {{has been studied}} {{by a combination of}} electron probe analysis to determine the molecular formula of the mineral and the structure assessed by vibrational spectroscopy. The spectroscopy of creedite may be compared with that of the alums. The Raman spectrum of creedite is characterised by an intense sharp band at 986 cm− 1 assigned to the View the MathML source ν 1 (Ag) symmetric stretching mode. Multiple bands of creedite in the antisymmetric stretching region support the concept of a reduction in symmetry of the sulphate anion. Multiple bands are also observed in the bending region with the three bands at 601, 629 and 663 cm− 1 assigned to the View the MathML source ν 4 (Ag) bending modes. The observation of multiple bands at 440, 457 and 483 cm− 1 attributed to the View the MathML source ν 2 (Bg) bending modes supports the concept that the symmetry of the sulphate is reduced by coordination to the water bonded to the Al 3 + in the creedite structure. The splitting of the ν 2, ν 3 and ν 4 modes is attributed to the reduction of symmetry of the SO 4 and it is proposed that the sulphate coordinates to water in the hydrated aluminium in bidentate chelation...|$|E
40|$|All {{available}} workers {{engaged in}} bagging an artificial crystalline aluminium silicate [...] the kiln-dried residue from the calcining and water extraction of alunite (a hydrated <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> and potassium) {{that is currently}} classified as a nuisance dust [...] were studied after a complaint of respiratory and systemic symptoms, including arthritis, by {{an employee of the}} factory, who showed physiological and radiographic evidence of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and in whom lung biopsy showed diffuse fibrosis with granulomas. Inhalation challenge produced a transient decrease in transfer factor and transfer factor standardised for alveolar volume. Twenty-five subjects were known to have been exposed at some time to the dust of alunite-residue. Of the 17 who could be contacted, all agreed to attend for respiratory questionnaire and occupational history, pulmonary function testing (spirometry, lung volumes, gas transfer), and posteroanterior chest radiograph. Six subjects considered that occupational exposure to the dust was responsible for respiratory symptoms. Three subjects had abnormality of the chest radiograph consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. The mean percentage of predicted transfer factor standardised for effective alveolar volume was 71. 1 % in subjects with abnormal chest radiographs and 86. 6 % in subjects with normal radiographs (p = 0. 10). There was a trend in the correlation between the percentage of predicted transfer factor standardised for effective alveolar volume and total dust exposure (sum of the products of grade of severity of each exposure period and duration of each exposure period in months) (r = 0. 40 p = 0. 10).

40|$|Among nitrate, <b>sulphate</b> and {{chloride}} <b>of</b> <b>aluminium,</b> the last, i. e. aluminium chloride, {{was found}} to be the most suitable to make the hydrogen cyanide synthetic catalyst of alumina made of both aq. solution of the above mentioned salt and aq. ammonia, as the decomposition rate of ammonia was low, while alminium sulphate was unsuitable to be adopted as catalyst, as the alumnia gel made of this compound decomposed a considerable amount of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide was produced in the process. 　By means of ”aging” in hot water for several hours, catalytic activity changed favourably for increasing hydrogen cyanide yield. 　To explain the relation between the adsorptive power of ammonia gas as ”adsorbent” and the catalytic activity to synthesize hydrogen cyanide as ”catalyst,” the alumina gel was examined, and {{was found to}} have excellent catalytic activity as well as superior adsorptive power. Therefore it was confirmed that to carry out, beforehand, adsorption examination with ammonia and compare the results with those of standard catalysts was a good means of securing a successful hydrogen cyanide synthetic process...|$|R
40|$|A mineralogical {{study was}} {{undertaken}} of air heater deposits in a 300 MWe pf boiler located in Western Australia {{to understand the}} deposit formation in air heater sections of boiler {{as an aid to}} implement possible remediation actions. Several air heater deposit samples were collected in the selected regions of the air heater along with samples of the feed coal, bottom ash and fly ash for comparison of ash chemistry and mineralogy. The deposit samples were examined using a combination of ash chemistry and quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis; the ash samples by bulk chemical analysis to determine the major element chemistry and mineralogy by quantitative X-ray diffraction. Samples of the deposits were also analysed using optical microscopy and QEMSCAN, an automated electron beam image analysis system. Chemical and mineralogical analysis showed that the deposits are unusual in containing high amounts <b>of</b> <b>sulphate,</b> particularly <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> and, to a lesser extent, iron. From the analyses it appears that the formation of the deposits is due to the high sulphate content which is acting as a cementing agent. There is an indication that temperature could be another factor in formation of the deposits, with a decrease in temperature leading to the formation of sulphurous acid which then reacts with the reactive glassy amorphous fly ash phase to form the aluminium and iron sulphates. Dew point calculations indicated that this is a possible deposit formation mechanism based upon air heater temperature data obtained from the utility. There was no evidence that unburnt carbon has {{played a significant role in}} deposit formation. Large temperature fluctuations resulting from the inherent nature of the operation of the air heater are a significant factor in deposit formation and a practical solution to consider would be the use of an SO 2 absorbent placed prior to the air heater...|$|R

In the presence <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> the colour <b>of</b> solutions of haematein at any particular pH depends on the number <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> atoms to each molecule of haema-tein.

40|$|A {{suite of}} {{amorphous}} silica-aluminas (ASAs) was prepared by homogeneous deposition–precipitation (HDP) <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> on a silica surface followed by calcination. The HDP process {{was investigated in}} detail by 27 Al NMR spectroscopy of solid and liquid aliquots of the synthesis mixture. Deposition occurs predominantly via a hydrolytic adsorption <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> onto the hydroxyl groups of the silica surface. Precipitation becomes more significant at higher aluminium concentration. Depending on the aluminium loading, the surface contains four- and six-coordinated aluminium as well as patches <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> hydroxides. Calcination results in two competing process, that is the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network and sintering <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into separate patches of a phase which mainly consists of octahedral Al. These ASAs exhibit Brønsted acidity similar to industrial amorphous silica-aluminas prepared by the grafting <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> on very reactive silica gels. Their acidity does not vary systematically with the aluminium concentration, except below 5 wt% Al 2 O 3. The acidity increases with the calcination temperature. The active sites form due to the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network at high temperatures, leading to Al substitutions of Si atoms. This is expected as the acidity does not correlate with anything else, viz., the amount <b>of</b> four-coordinated <b>aluminium</b> nor the presence of segregated Al or five-coordinated aluminium at the interface of these domains and the mixed silica-alumina phase. The surface of an amorphous silica-alumina consists <b>of</b> isolated <b>aluminium</b> grafted onto the silica surface (pure silica-alumina phase) with a very small amount <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> in the silica network, which brings about the Brønsted acidity, and small patches <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> oxides. Graphical abstract Well-defined precursors to amorphous silica-alumina are prepared through the grafting <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> to silica via hydrolytic adsorption.
