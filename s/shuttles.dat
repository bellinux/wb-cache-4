5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train <b>shuttles</b> at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are loaded onto train <b>shuttles</b> in Calais.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000 {{unmanned}} missions {{have been}} designed to explore the Earth and the solar system. Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA.

5|$|Powers were renewed in 1926 {{for four}} tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town, {{with the concept}} of the Piccadilly running {{non-stop}} on the inner pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with <b>shuttles</b> from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton.|$|E

Bond and Goodhead disable the radar jammer hiding the station from Earth and the US sends a platoon of Marines in a military space shuttle. During the battle, Bond kills Drax and his station is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|By late April, Air America {{helicopters}} {{were flying}} several daily <b>shuttles</b> from TF76 to the DAO Compound {{to enable the}} 9th MAB to conduct evacuation preparations at the DAO without exceeding the Paris Peace Accords' limit of a maximum of 50 U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam. The US Government was continuing to observe its obligations under the Accords, notwithstanding the North Vietnamese invasion.

5|$|In 1923 fifty {{motor car}} bodies {{were ordered to}} allow some of the {{original}} 1904–05 car bodies to be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified 'local stock' worked the <b>shuttles</b> from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its {{hazardous}} waste storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus <b>shuttles,</b> subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} day, each crew member divided {{his time between}} {{physical}} exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating). The crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning {{had been scheduled to}} begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting <b>shuttles</b> or resupply vehicles.|$|E

5|$|In early 2000, the MBTA {{released}} a study which analyzed {{the possibility of}} full-time commuter service to Yawkey to serve workers at nearby Boston University, Kenmore Square, and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area. An addendum released in August 2000 analyzed increased service (on all modes) to Fenway Park on game days. Possibilities studied included running game day service from the Plymouth/Kingston Line with an unused trainset, a South Station-Yawkey shuttle, increased Green Line service, and bus <b>shuttles</b> to the Red Line in Cambridge and to Ruggles station. Consideration was given to building a dedicated terminal spur and station on {{the remains of the}} former Highland Branch.|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space <b>Shuttles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mir {{was based}} upon the Salyut series of space {{stations}} previously launched by the Soviet Union (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-manned Soyuz spacecraft and Progress cargo ships. The Buran space shuttle was anticipated to visit Mir, but its program was canceled after its first unmanned spaceflight. Visiting US Space <b>Shuttles</b> used an Androgynous Peripheral Attach System docking collar originally designed for Buran, mounted on a bracket originally designed for use with the American Space Station Freedom.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Shuttle</b> Training Aircraft (STA) was a NASA {{training}} {{vehicle that}} duplicated the Space <b>Shuttle's</b> approach profile and handling qualities, allowing Space <b>Shuttle</b> pilots to simulate <b>Shuttle</b> landings under controlled conditions before attempting the task {{on board the}} orbiter.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{the space}} <b>shuttle</b> for the Earth Resources Program is discussed. Several {{problems}} with respect to payload selection, integration, and mission planning were studied. Each of four <b>shuttle</b> roles in the sortie mode were examined and projected into an integrated <b>shuttle</b> program. Several representative Earth Resources missions were designed which would use the <b>shuttle</b> sortie as a platform and collectively include the four <b>shuttle</b> roles.
