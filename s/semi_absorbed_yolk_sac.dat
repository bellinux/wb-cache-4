40|$|The gut {{contents}} of young herring larvae sampled each hour from 3 to 9 April 1967 at three depth intervals around a floating drogue were examined to study their feeding. Copepod eggs constituted more than 90 % {{of the food}} items. Feeding started shortly after sunrise within the same hour in the depth intervals 25 - 5 m, 30 - 50 m and 75 - 55 m. Mean length increased with diminishing <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> until absorption when mean length decreased. The latter could indicate lack of suitable food. The mean gut content of feeding larvae did not increase until after absorption of the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> Larvae from the deepest strata had less gut contents than the others, probably because a lower percentage of them had <b>absorbed</b> <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs.</b> A high percentage of larvae feeding during day-time contradicted total defecation due to capture. No correlation was found between numbers of Calanus eggs in the guts and in plankton. Larvae containing Calanus nauplii had more assorted gut contents than larvae containing Calanus eggs.

50|$|Fertile eggs require {{approximately}} 24 to 36 {{hours to}} hatch at {{a temperature of}} 27 °C. Upon hatching, the fry are translucent, around 3 to 4 millimetres long, but a peculiarity of the species is that the fry require an additional 3 to 5 days to <b>absorb</b> the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> before becoming free-swimming (Innes, 1966, p. 180.1). Once this process is completed, the young become free-swimming, and at this stage, require very fine sizes of food such as live infusoria {{for a period of}} up to 14 days, after which the fry are able to feed upon newly hatched brine shrimp. If infusoria are unavailable, commercial prepared foods for egglayer fry may also be used.|$|R

40|$|Salvelinus miyabei Oshima {{is a small}} salmonid fish {{attaining}} about 25 cm {{in total}} length and is restricted only in Lake Shikaribetsu in central Hokkaido. Some 30 individuals of this fish were caught in Yanbetsu River which flows into this lake and artificial insemination was carried out on October 30, 1959. These specimens quite resemble the fluvial dwarf form of Dolly Varden, S. malma (Walbaum), in general characters, however, S. miyabei have somewhat more gill rakers and more developed ‘kype’ than those of non-migratory S. malma. The eggs of S. miyabei were measured 5. 1 ～ 5. 6 mm in diameter. Hatching took place about 80 days or more at the water temperature of 6. 5 ～ 3. 6 ℃. The newly hatched alevins preserving 70 % alcohol were 15. 0 ～ 16. 3 mm in total length. About 50 days after hatching the alevins attained {{to the length of}} 19. 4 ～ 20. 8 mm. Two-thirds of yolk substances were consumed and parr marks were clearly visible on the body sides. Just emerged fry attained 21. 8 mm. It took 3 months for the alevins to <b>absorb</b> <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> completely at the water temperature of 3. 6 ～ 7. 1 ℃.

50|$|Like {{all other}} known Oreochromis, O. lidole is a {{maternal}} mouthbrooder: females carry {{the eggs and}} small juveniles in their mouths for several weeks. When juveniles have <b>absorbed</b> their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs,</b> they are released to forage independently, under the female's guard, but are {{allowed to return to}} their mother's mouth when danger threatens. Females produce up to 700 young and have been recorded to guard fry up to 5 cm long. Breeding mainly occurs during the hot season from October to January, when males gather in deep water (mainly 20-45m) off clean, steeply shelving beaches to dig huge craters (1-3m in diameter) in which courtship and spawning takes place. Females often migrate to more productive turbid waters to release their young, in areas such as Lake Malombe.|$|R
50|$|Hens usually {{remain on}} the nest for about {{two days after the}} first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by <b>absorbing</b> the {{internal}} <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> Some commercial breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual. Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.|$|R
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, the dark shyshark is oviparous; adult females have a single {{functional}} ovary and two functional oviducts.

The eggs are enclosed in purse-shaped capsules measuring [...] long and [...] across; each capsule is plain amber to dark brown in color and bears thin, coiled tendrils at the four corners. In one observation of an egg that hatched after 104 days, the developing embryo had external gill filaments until it was 50 days old, and completely <b>absorbed</b> its <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> shortly before hatching.

[...] At {{the beginning of the season}} the males will take refuge under flat-bottomed rocks, waterlogged wood or other rubble found in stream beds. In order to mate the female will come up to the males nest and lay her eggs there. The female chooses her mate on physical attributes. Since larger males pick out nesting sites with better resources qualities, the female's choice of the largest male indicates she is picking good genes in a mate and also a good environment for her young to grow up After mating she either leaves or is chased away by the male. The males do this because females will eat the eggs right after spawning if the male does not run her off.

40|$|The {{development}} of the digestive system in the larvae of the marble goby Oxyeleotris marmoratus was examined histologically from the 2 nd to the 35 th day after hatching. The larvae <b>absorbed</b> their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> 4 - 5 day after hatching, however they commenced exogenous feeding 2 days after hatching. After the onset of exogenous feeding 5 regions could be easily distinguished in the gut: the buccal capvity, the oesophagus, a future stomach, the intestine and the rectum. At this time, the intestinal tract was functional however the stomach was not developed completely. The first signs of intestinal absorption appeared in day 3 after hatching and could be identified as lipid vacuoles in the rectum. The larvae started to absorb protein in day 5. The stomach formed from day 10 to 15 but only circular muscle layer was identified in the muscularis external. Liver and pancreas were formed and well-developed in the early larval period. After metamorphosis, the appearance of gastric glands in day 30 indicated that the {{development of}} digestive system was completed...|$|R

50|$|Redhump eartheaters are {{immediate}} maternal mouthbrooders. These fish grow relatively quickly, {{and can be}} sexed as subadults. Sexual dimorphism {{is clear}} - males have a large, red nuptial hump on their heads and grow larger than the females. Mature males develop an iridescence on the scales on their sides and very large humps. Males will display to females by opening their mouths and flaring their gills. Nonreceptive females may be driven from the spawning area. Spawning takes place on a smooth rock or clean sand bed. The female lays one or two eggs, then the male fertilizes them. The female immediately takes the fertilized eggs into her mouth and proceeds to lay more eggs. This continues until spawning is completed. The female carries the eggs until they are free-swimming and have <b>absorbed</b> their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs,</b> about 2-3 weeks. She eats little to no food during this period. Eventually, she releases them and allows them to search for food, taking them back into her mouth when she feels threatened.

Maintenance temperature for the fry should be carefully and slowly reduced to around 25 °C once the fishes are thus recognisably miniature versions of the adults. The first signs of black colouration on the unpaired fins may take a further two weeks of more to being manifesting themselves, and it will not be until the fishes are at least 12 weeks old that they will fully represent miniature versions of the parents. Even at this stage, the black colouration of the unpaired fins will be incompletely developed, and it will not be until sexual maturity is achieved (approximately 8 to 9 months after hatching) that the black border on the anal fin will become a reliable gender differentiation characteristic.|$|R

Marsupials, therefore, provide a unique opportunity to examine the conservation of INS imprinting in mammalian <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> placentation. Marsupial INS was cloned and its imprint status in the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> placenta of the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, examined.

40|$|Objective. To {{review the}} process of blood-cell {{formation}} in the murine and human <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> Data Sources. Most articles were selected from the PubMed database. Data Synthesis. The <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> is the first site of blood-cell production during murine and human ontogeny. Primitive erythroid cells originate in the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> and complete their maturation, including enucleation, in the bloodstream. Though species differences exist, the pattern of hematopoietic progenitor cell emergence in the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> is similar in mouse and man.

40|$|The murine <b>yolk</b> <b>sac,</b> {{being the}} first site of {{embryonic}} blood cell production, has long been theorized to contain the migrating hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that seed the liver and initiate hematopoiesis on day 10. 0 postcoitus (pc). However, it remains controversial whether <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> cells isolated before day 11. 0 pc possess any long-term repopulating HSC activity upon transplantation into adult recipient mice. We hypothesized that failure to demonstrate engraftment of day < 11. 0 <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> cells in adult hosts may result from an inability of <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> cells to home to the active adult hematopoietic sites (spleen and bone marrow). In the present studies, we transplanted <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> cells into conditioned newborn mice in whom the liver, {{as well as the}} spleen and bone marrow, concomitantly function as a site of blood cell formation.

40|$|During avian {{embryonic}} development, endodermal {{epithelial cells}} (EECs) <b>absorb</b> <b>yolk</b> through the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> membrane. Sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT) {{is important for}} esterification and yolk lipid utilization during development. Because the major enzyme for <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> membrane cholesteryl ester synthesis is SOAT 1, we cloned the avian SOAT 1 promoter and elucidated the cellular functions of SOAT 1. Treatments with either glucagon, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), an adenylate cyclase activator (forskolin), a cAMP analog (dibutyryl-cAMP), or a low glucose concentration all increased SOAT 1 mRNA accumulation in EECs from Japanese quail, suggesting that SOAT 1 is regulated by nutrients and hormones through a cAMP-dependent pathway. Activity of protein kinase A (PKA) was increased by IBMX, whereas co-treatment with the PKA inhibitor, H 89 negated the increase in PKA activity. Cyclic AMP-induced EECs had greater cholesterol esterification than untreated EECs. By promoter deletion and point-mutation, the cAMP-response element (- 349 to - 341 bp) was identified as critical in mediating transcription of SOAT 1. In conclusion, expression of SOAT 1 was regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway and factors that increase PKA will increase SOAT 1 to improve the utilization of lipids in the EECs and potentially modify embryonic growth...|$|R
