40|$|Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular common major {{vegetable}} crops worldwide. This study evaluated the nutritional content <b>of</b> seven commercial <b>eggplant</b> fruits in terms of fatty acid, mineral, sugar, organic acid, amino acid and polyamine contents. The most abundant fatty acid was linoleic acid (range, 39. 14 - 53. 81 %, ave. 45 %), and the most abundant mineral was K (range, 1556. 2 - 3171. 6 mg/kg fw, ave. 2331. 9). The major organic acid was malic acid (range, 129. 87 - 387. 01 mg/g fw, ave. 157. 49), and the major sugar was fructose (range, 1242. 81 - 1379. 77 mg/ 100 g fw, ave. 1350. 88). The major polyamine was putrescine (11. 54 and 25. 70 nmol/g fw, ave. 17. 86), and the major amino acid was glutamine (148. 4 and 298. 75 mg/ 100 g fw, ave. 219. 74).

40|$|The biomolecular {{difference}} in the structural and functional components <b>of</b> resistant and <b>susceptible</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> pearl millet which is greatly affected by downy mildew disease caused by Sclerospora graminicola were analyzed. Mesocotyl region has shown {{to be the most}} susceptible region for attach of pathogen.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditional {{descriptors}} for {{characterization of}} fruit shape <b>of</b> <b>eggplant</b> (Solanum melongena L.) provide limited information {{and do not}} allow a detailed characterization of this complex trait. New image analysis software tools like Tomato Analyzer, allow obtaining quantitative and objective data for {{a large number of}} fruit shape parameters. The Tomato Analyzer software tool was used for the evaluation of fruit shape in a collection <b>of</b> traditional <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggplant</b> from four varietal groups (Round, Semi-long, Egg Shaped, and Long). A total of 26 fruit shape parameters were obtained using the Tomato Analyzer software. Significant differences were found among varieties for all traits, except for shoulder height. In addition, considerable differences were identified among varietal groups for many parameters. Values for broad-sense heritability were high for most of the traits. The principal components analysis clearly separated the four varietal groups. Discriminant analysis allowed the correct classification to their actual <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> almost 60 % of the individual fruits. The wide variation observed and high values for heritability for most fruit shape parameters indicated that the image analysis software tools like Tomato Analyzer are of great utility for the phenotypic characterization of fruit shape in eggplant germplasm. This has important implications for selection and breeding for this important trait in eggplant...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons at the University of Maiduguri to compared the efficacies of selected aqueous plant extracts on {{the management of the}} population <b>of</b> <b>eggplant</b> leaf roller (Eublemma olivacea Wlk.) infesting eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). The extracts were from neem leaf; bitter melon; black current; ginger rhizome and wild onion. They were compared with a conventional insecticide, Lambdacot 500 EC and the absolute control. Extracts were applied at 5 % w/v while Lambdacot was applied at 1. 5 g a. i/ha. The results indicated that the mean number of leaf rollers in treated plots were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than the control. The highest mean number of leaf rollers was 3. 01 and 3. 93. Lambdacot 500 EC had the lowest eggplant leaf roller counts per plant followed by neem, ginger rhizome and wild onion. The mean number of leaves damaged per plant followed similar trend. There was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher number <b>of</b> <b>eggplant</b> fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield in the decreasing order of Lambdacot 500 EC, neem, wild onion, bitter melon and black current. The absolute control had the fewest number <b>of</b> <b>eggplant</b> fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield. These aqueous extracts should be adopted by eggplant farmers as they are cost effective and friendly to the environment. However, the actual quantities of these extracts to be applied per plant depending on the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggplant,</b> season and weather condition of the cropping season and canopy architecture remain to be critically explored...|$|R
40|$|Polysomes {{isolated}} from a <b>susceptible</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> wheat leaves (cultivar W 2691) and those inoculated with the wheat stem rust fungus (f. sp. tritici, race 126 -ANZ- 6, 7) were incubated in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system. Under these conditions, different {{size classes of}} polypeptides, ranging in molecular weight from 10, 000 to 80, 000, are radiolabeled. Using double-isotope labeling technique, we show that some discrete size classes of polypeptides are synthesized in significantly greater quantitites by polysomes from inoculated leaves compared to the corresponding size classes synthesized by polysomes from healthy leaves. These results confirm our previous observation that there are {{significant changes in the}} wheat leaf polysomal messenger RNA populations at 3 days after inoculation with the rust fungus...|$|R
40|$|Dutch elm disease (DED), {{caused by}} the fungi Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi, has reduced elm populations {{severely}} in Europe and North America. Breeding programmes are in action to find less <b>susceptible</b> elm <b>varieties</b> suitable for re-establishing elm stands. Bark beetles, mainly Scolytus spp., are the only known natural vectors of DED. During twig feeding, beetles transfer Ophiostoma spores to healthy elms. Thus, less palatable elms should run a lower risk of DED infections. In feeding preference bioassays, we offered twigs from elms exhibiting different degree of susceptibility to O. novo-ulmi, together with non-host trees to Scolytus beetles. Scolytus multistriatus preferred wych elm, Ulmus glabra, to 100 % in two-choice tests, whereas S. laevis did not discriminate between a tolerant and a <b>susceptible</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> field elm, U. minor. We suggest that the feeding assay is useful as a low-tech method in breeding programmes for evaluating the suitability of promising elm genotypes to vector insects...|$|R

40|$|Exposure of root {{tissue from}} a <b>susceptible</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> sweet potato to low {{concentrations}} of ethylene induced a resistance to infection by Ceratocystis fimbriata {{and an increase}} in the activity of peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase in the tissue. Susceptible tissue that was inoculated with a pathogenic strain of C. fimbriata or a nonpathogenic strain that can induce resistance liberated more ethylene into closed chambers than tissue inoculated with strains that did not induce resistance. It is suggested that ethylene may be a stimulus that diffuses from infected areas into adjoining tissue to initiate metabolic changes which may lead to disease resistance. Polyphenol oxidase but not peroxidase activity was increased in slices of potato tubers and parsnip roots treated with ethylene. The activity of these enzymes in root tissue of carrot, radish or turnip was not altered by ethylene treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} success of Callosobruchus maculatus Fabricius, the main insect pest of stored cowpea, may vary between strains of this beetle and between <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> the host seeds. Life history parameters of beetle strains {{from three different}} origins in West Africa were compared on two <b>susceptible</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. All beetle strains were assayed in a no-choice and a two-choice test. No major {{differences were found between}} the beetle strains. In a no-choice situation, the developmental period from egg to adult was prolonged on the bean variety Kpodjiguegue. In a two-choice situation, the beetles showed a strong preference for the Californian blackeyed bean variety to oviposit on. Here again the development took longer on Kpodjiguegue beans and the intrinsic rate of increase of the beetle population was lower. Using either equal numbers of beans of the same size or equal weights of beans of undetermined size of the two bean varieties did not affect the outcome of the test...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} temperature and of zinc on development of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in resistant and <b>susceptible</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> tomatoes was conducted under greenhouse conditions. The study included two experiments, one run during late winter and early spring, and the other during late spring and summer, 1963. Each experiment comprised four treatments and two temperatures. Increase in temperature tended to increase virus concentration, although the differences were not significant. Fresh weights of the tomato plants were found to be greater at lower temperatures. Zinc foliar sprays resulted in higher virus concentrations and in production of increased numbers of local lesions. Effects of zinc on fresh weights were not significant. The varieties Hawaii 6832 and OSU- 8 were found highly resistant to the common strain of TMV. California 62 PM 22 was shown to be heterozygous for resistance to this strain of TMV. OSU 435 - 4 was highly susceptible...|$|R
40|$|Calluses {{in growth}} <b>of</b> sugar cane, <b>variety</b> “SP 70 - 1284 ”, were {{radiated}} with {{a source of}} 60 Co. The studied doses were between 10 and 80 Gy. The affectation of the Gamma radiation source 60 Co {{in the growth of}} the callus and the regeneration of plants was evaluated. The results indicated that the dose that diminished the growth of callus in a value under 50 % was the one of 30 Gy, and also the dose that diminished the regenerative capacity of the callus below to the 50 % of the population was the one of 30 Gy. The results showed that for this <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> sugar cane doses superior to 30 Gy of Gamma radiations jeopardizes the growth and the later regeneration of the callus.

40|$|Black bundle {{disease is}} one of the soil borne {{diseases}} of maize caused by Cephalosporium acremonium. It is difficult to detect the disease at an early stage as the symptoms appear only after post-flowering stage of plant growth or milky stage of the kernels. An effort was made to find the early infection by following the standard blotter method using the mycelium suspension cultures of C. acremonium which consisted of various morphological cell types representing stages in the growth cycle. Two <b>susceptible</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> maize, CM 500 and Renuka G- 25 were used in this study. Observations were made on the effect of suspension culture on seedling growth and on the mode of infection, entry of hyphae and development of mycelium within the host tissue. Better visualization of the C. acremonium was attempted by using different stains like trypan blue and toluidine blue. It was clearly evident that C. acremonium treated seeds showed less growth when compared to control. Browning of vascular tissue was also observed in the seedlings of suspension culture treated plates.

The damage observed in the <b>susceptible</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> commercial rose include symptoms affect young steams and tiny leaves causing reddish and brown spots and defoliation; leading to 10 % production losses. The infective behavior of this pathogen was studied {{with the aim of}} increasing the knowledge about the biology of the rose downy mildew. The study of the infective process was performed on the Charlotte variety using micropropagated roses inoculated with suspensions of sporangia. A germinal tube was observed during the germination process, it came from a lateral papilla and reached up to 300 microns in length. During this study, the ability of the pathogen to use vascular sieves as communication systems within the plant was determined. Oogonia and antheridia were also observed inside the epidermal cells, and oospores inside the parenchymal tissue close to xylem vessels. To the best of our knowledge, these sexual structures have not been reported on in Colombia before.

40|$|If a novel, {{resistant}} {{host plant}} genotype arises in the environment, insect populations utilising that host {{must be able}} to overcome that resistance in order that they can maintain their ability to feed on that host. The ability to evolve resistance to host-plant defences depends upon additive genetic variation in larval performance and adult host-choice preference. To investigate the potential of a generalist herbivore to respond to a novel resistant host we estimated the heritability of larval performance in the noctuid moth, Helicoverpa armigera, on a resistant and a <b>susceptible</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> the chickpea, Cicer arietinum, at two different life-stages. Heritability estimates were higher for neonates than for third-instar larvae suggesting that their ability to establish on plants could be key to the evolution of resistance in this species, however further information regarding the nature of selection in the field would be required to confirm this prediction. There was no genetic correlation between larval performance and oviposition preference, indicating that female moths do not choose the most suitable plant for their offspring. We also found significant genotype by environment interactions for neonates (but not third-instar larvae), suggesting that the larval response to different plant genotypes is stage-specific in this species...|$|R
