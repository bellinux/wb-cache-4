50|$|As the subducting plate {{flattens}} {{there is}} an inboard migration in the magmatic arc that can be tracked. In the Chilean flat <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> (~31-32 degrees S), around 7-5 Ma there was an eastward migration, broadening and gradual shutdown down of the volcanic arc associated with slab flattening. This occurs as the previous magmatic arc position on the upper plate (100-150 km above subducting plate) is no longer aligned with the zone of partial melting above the flattening slab. The magmatic arc migrates to a new location that coincides with the zone of partial melting above the flattening slab. Magmatism before the Laramide orogeny migrated {{all the way to}} western South Dakota. Eventually, the magmatic activity above the flat slab may completely cease as the subducting plate and upper plate pinch out the mantle wedge. Upon the failure of the flat slab, the mantle wedge can again start circulating hot asthenosphere (1300 degrees C) in an area that has been heavily hydrated, but that had not produced any melt; this leads to widespread ignimbritic volcanism, which is seen in both the Andean flat slab effected regions and the western United States.|$|E

40|$|Yield line {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} method for design of reinforced concrete slabs, but has been limited to slabs of simple geometry, because up to now {{there has been no}} generally applicable and fully automatic computational procedure for complex-shaped slabs. Herein, a new yield line method that can be applied to any convex polygonal-shaped slab is developed. In this method, the deflections of the <b>slab</b> <b>regions</b> divided by yield lines are measured in terms of the dip and strike angles of the slab surfaces, which can define the geometry of all kinematically admissible collapse mechanisms or yield line patterns. The external work done and the internal energy dissipation at yield lines are evaluated as functions of the dip and strike angles, and the principle of virtual work is used to determine the corresponding load factor. The final solution is obtained by minimising the load factor with respect to the dip and strike angles. A computer program based on this method has been produced. Its correctness is verified by checking against results obtained by others for simple cases, and its versatility is demonstrated by applying it to complicated slabs subjected to point, line, patch and uniformly distributed loads. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The cavities have a uniform probability density in the <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> and the solid is homogeneous and isotropic {{on either side}} of the slab. A general equation for the coherent motion in the solid is derived in terms of the average exciting displacement near a xed cavity. As in Foldy’s approach, it is assumed here that the average exciting displacement near a xed cavity is equal to the average total displacement. With this assumption, the equation for the coherent motion reduces to an integrodi¬erential equation, which is solved in closed form by using a Fourier transform technique. The closed-form solution greatly reduces the computational costs, and allows more direct investigation of the multiple scattering than is done elsewhere.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{progressive collapse}} behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) flat plate structures, {{a reliable and}} efficient numerical approach is developed in this study using spring connection modelling. This connection unit aims to simulate complicate punching shear behavior at critical regions surrounding the columns. Five springs are used as the connection elements: two for flexural and integrity steel bars and three for concrete contributions. The flexural and integrity steel bars embedded in the columns are modeled explicitly, which enables the model to present the structural behavior post punching shear failure. Bending and shear actions are represented by two concrete springs. The third concrete spring is assigned axial action property to restrain two end nodes of the connection on the model. In particular, the punching shear spring controls the connection unit when punching shear failure occurs. To apply the connection unit, the regions of slab-column connections are partitioned from the <b>slab</b> <b>regions</b> according to the critical shear surfaces. Then the connection unit links two corresponding nodes on the two edges formed from the partition. A physical experiment of a RC flat plate substructure under progressive collapse is simulated.

However, further improvement of the modelling technique is necessary to enhance numerical accuracy. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} is an enquiry into {{the circumstances under}} which concurrence and phase entropy methods can give an {{answer to the question of}} quantum entanglement in the composite state when the photonic band gap is exhibited by the presence of photonic crystals in a three-level system. An analytic approach is proposed for any three-level system in the presence of photonic band gap. Using this analytic solution, we conclusively calculate the concurrence and phase entropy, focusing particularly on the entanglement phenomena. Specifically, we use concurrence as a measure of entanglement for dipole emitters situated in the thin <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> between two semi-infinite one-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals, a situation reminiscent of planar cavity laser structures. One feature of the regime considered here is that closed-form evaluation of the time evolution may be carried out in the presence of the detuning and the photonic band gap, which provides insight into the difference in the nature of the concurrence function for atom-field coupling, mode frequency and different cavity parameters. We demonstrate how fluctuations in the phase and number entropies effected by the presence of the photonic-band-gap. The outcomes are illustrated with numerical simulations applied to GaAs. Finally, we relate the obtained results to instances of any three-level system for which the entanglement cost can be calculated.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} Nazca slab, extending over {{a distance}} of ∼ 800 km along the trench is one of enigmatic features in Peruvian subduction zone. Increased buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere alone due to the subduction of Nazca Ridge is insufficient to fully explain such a lengthy segment. We use data from the recent seismic experiment in southern Peru {{to find that the}} subduction-related hydration {{plays a major role in}} controlling shear wave velocities within the upper part of the oceanic crust and overlying materials. We observe substantial velocity reductions of ∼ 20 – 40 % near the top plate interface along- and perpendicular-to the trench from ∼ 40 – 120 km depths. In particular, significant shear wave velocity reductions and subsequently higher P-to-S velocity ratio (exceeding 2. 0) at the flat <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> suggest that the seismically probed layer is fluid-rich and mechanically weak. The dominant source of fluid comes from metasediments and subducted crust (Nazca Ridge). Long-term supply of fluid from the southward migrating Nazca Ridge provides additional buoyancy of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and also lowers the viscosity of the overlying mantle wedge to drive and sustain the flat plate segment of ∼ 800 km along the trench. Also, by comparing calculated seismic velocities with experimentally derived mineral physics data, we additionally provide mechanical constraints on the possible changes in frictional behavior across the subduction zone plate interface. Observed low seismic velocities in the seismogenic zone suggest a presence of low strength materials that may be explained by overpressured pore fluids (i. e., accreted sediment included in the subduction channel) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometry}} and {{properties of the}} interface of the Cocos plate beneath central Mexico are determined from the receiver functions (RFs) utilizing data from the Meso America Subduction Experiment (MASE). The RF image shows that the subducting oceanic crust is shallowly dipping to the north at 15 ° for 80 km from Acapulco and then horizontally underplates the continental crust for approximately 200 km to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). The crustal image also shows {{that there is no}} continental root associated with the TMVB. The migrated image of the RFs shows that the slab is steeply dipping into the mantle at about 75 ° beneath the TMVB. Both the continental and oceanic Moho are clearly seen in both images, and modeling of the RF conversion amplitudes and timings of the underplated features reveals a thin low-velocity zone between the plate and the continental crust that appears to absorb nearly all of the strain between the upper plate and the slab. By inverting RF amplitudes of the converted phases and their time separations, we produce detailed maps of the seismic properties of the upper and lower oceanic crust of the subducting Cocos plate and its thickness. High Poisson's and Vp/Vs ratios due to anomalously low S wave velocity at the upper oceanic crust in the flat <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> may indicate the presence of water and hydrous minerals or high pore pressure. The evidence of high water content within the oceanic crust explains the flat subduction geometry without strong coupling of two plates.

40|$|The Argentine Precordillera is a {{foreland}} fold-and-thrust-belt {{in western}} Argentina that overlies the central Chilean flat <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> of the subducting Nazca plate. The Precordillera has accommodated shortening {{over the past}} ~ 20 million years; over this time, the Nazca slab evolved from a relatively steep subduction angle to horizontal subduction. Because the shortening in the Precordillera spans the shallowing of the slab, changes in the deformation patterns can {{provide insight into the}} relationship between the down-doing slab and the over-riding plate at zones of shallow subduction. In this thesis, I present field-based structural data, cross sections of the Precordillera, and estimates of shortening magnitude and rates for the region in an effort to characterize the impact of a shallowing slab on deformation at the surface. ! To calculate shortening magnitudes for cross sections that have rigorous uncertainty estimates, I developed an algorithm that propagates known input uncertainties through an area balancing calculation and yields both Gaussian and maximum uncertainty estimates. The area balancing method is complementary to the line-length balancing method and allows one to include known initial uncertainties, such as the uncertainty on stratigraphic thicknesses and the location of the decollement, neither of which are included in the "minimum shortening" estimates often cited in line-length balanced shortening calculations. ! I constructed two cross sectional profiles through the Precordillera to determine shortening magnitude and rates since 20 Ma. Calculations for the profiles yield ~ 115 ± 44 (100) km of shortening in the Precordillera, where the uncertainty values are both Gaussian and maximum respectively. This shortening magnitude agrees with other published values of shortening for the Precordillera (72 - 136 km) determined via linelength balancing, and the variation in published values falls within the calculated uncertainty estimates. Variations in shortening rate throughout the Precordillera correlate temporally with changes in the geometry of the Nazca slab. Prior to the shallowing of the slab, the Precordillera accommodated 2 - 3 % of the total plate convergence; after the slab began to shallow, shortening in the Precordillera accommodated 10 - 12 % of the convergence rate...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from three}} seismic arrays {{installed}} in southern Peru were analysed using receiver functions from P, PP and PKP wave phases, {{in order to}} image the subducted Nazca slab. The arrays cover the transition region from flat slab subduction in central Peru to normal subduction with an angle of about 30 ° further south. A previous study used data from the first array in the normal subduction region to image the Moho depth and slab, and showed {{the existence of a}} mid-crustal structure at 40 km depth that is suggested to be a possible underthrusting of the Brazilian shield. Here, we discuss new observations from the other two arrays that span the transition between the two subduction regimes and the flat subduction region. The results provide an image of the flattened slab from the coast to approximately 300 km inland and also across the transition region from flat to 30 ° subduction, which appears to be a bend rather than a tear in the slab. In the flat <b>slab</b> <b>region,</b> the slab is well defined near the coast and flattens out at 100 km depth beneath the Altiplano. The slab appears to start flattening some 400 km in advance of the subduction of the Nazca Ridge and the flattening is maintained for 1300 km after its passage. The Moho begins at a depth of around 30 km near the coast and has a maximum depth of 75 km beneath the Altiplano, consistent with the results of the other arrays. Both arrays also show a positive impedance mid-crustal structure at 40 km depth, which if explainable by underthrusting of the Brazilian shield, would add further support to the observations from the normal subduction region and show the northward and westward extent of the signal. The underthrusting hypothesis would explain the missing crust from the shortening budget needed to support the Altiplano. The Vp/Vs ratios for both arrays exhibit average values between 1. 73 and 1. 75 indicating a lesser likelihood that there is a high degree of partial melting or magma bodies at depth in this region. The receiver function results provide new imaging of the flat slab and transition from normal to flat slab subduction which allows for comparison of different subduction regimes...|$|E
40|$|Southern Peru {{represents}} a subduction transition region from normal subduction in the southernmost part of Peru to flat slab subduction in central Peru. In {{order to learn}} more about the structure of southern Peru, causes of flat slab subduction, and the nature of the transition from normal to flat slab subduction, we installed three seismic arrays utilizing a total of about 100 broadband stations. The first installed array samples the normal subduction region, while the second samples the transition from normal to flat subduction, and the third samples the flat <b>slab</b> <b>region</b> near where the Nazca Ridge is presently subducting. Data from teleseismic events greater than 30 degrees distance from Peru was analyzed using the receiver function method that makes use of P to S converted phases at interfaces such as the Moho to provide information about the structure directly beneath each station. A strong signal from the Moho was observed for each array and was found to have a maximum depth of around 75 km beneath the Altiplano. The average crustal Vp/Vs ratio was also estimated and was found to have an average value of around 1. 75 beneath the Altiplano. The shape of the slab was also clarified for the three arrays. The transition from normal to flat slab subduction appears to be a contortion rather than a break in the slab. In addition to those signals, a positive impedance midcrustal signal at about 40 km depth was widely observed for stations on the eastern side of the arrays. The midcrustal signal is indicative of a velocity increase in the lower crust and is suggested to be an observation of the underthrusting Brazilian shield which would have implications for the timing of uplift in the Andes. Finite difference modeling with velocity models that include a midcrustal structure produces synthetics which are consistent with receiver function observations. Receiver function results and other related methods provide a simple way of making direct observations of key structural interfaces and the current state of the subduction system which has relevance in studies of the tectonic evolution of the region and estimations of causes of flat slab subduction...|$|E
