5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E

He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E
500|$|McDaid's {{involvement}} in the song was noted by a few critics. Kevin Harly of The Independent wrote: [...] "If you didn’t know Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid produced the ballad 'Photograph', its stolid plod through clichés about how lovin' 'can hurt' and 'heal' <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> you". Meanwhile, Dave Hanratty of Drowned in Sound remarked: [...] "... the cloying 'Photograph' ... is co-written and produced {{by a member of}} Snow Patrol should surprise nobody, given that it follows their heartstring-tugging script so resolutely. At least it moves." [...] The Herald Alan Morrison felt that [...] "Photograph" [...] was [...] "identikit Snow Patrol".|$|E

It has been rumored that the crowd noise was added in a studio rather than recorded on stage. Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer, asked Live Undead producer/engineer Bill Metoyer, who had worked on the album in Los Angeles. Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't know if I <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> you ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets?

Instead, this series focuses more on Peter's life, Beatrice and her new baby (Petra), Lyle, and Gloria, the receptionist. Toward {{the end of the}} series Peter begins to suffer from small blackouts. He has some minor tests done to find out the cause of the problem. It is {{revealed}} in the last episode that Peter has Type 2 diabetes. When Peter asks the doctor whether he <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> Beatrice and Petra to get checked out, the doctor revealed that diabetes isn't the only thing they discovered.

Maggie and Glenn discuss the walker {{situation on the}} farm, with Maggie sharing the same attitude as her father Hershel. At the pharmacy, Maggie is attacked by a walker but Glenn intervenes and subdues it before it harms Maggie. Back on the farm, Maggie confronts Lori about being almost killed due to her request, and tells Glenn {{the rest of the}} group is using him as [...] "walker bait". Glenn later tells Lori that she <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> Rick about her pregnancy soon. Lori contemplates the act of raising a child in this world, and decides to take the pills, but after a moment, runs away from their camp to immediately regurgitate them. Rick sees the pills and goes to find Lori, who admits she was in a relationship with Shane before Rick found them. Rick reveals he already knew about this.|$|E
500|$|Tragedy befell Alice on 29 May 1873, {{when her}} {{youngest}} and favourite son, Friedrich, called [...] "Frittie", died after falling 20feet from a window. The child suffered from haemophilia, {{and although he}} regained consciousness, the internal bleeding could not be stopped. Alice never recovered from Frittie's death, writing to her mother two months later: [...] "I am glad {{you have a little}} coloured picture of my darling. I feel lower and sadder than ever and miss him so much, so continually." [...] However, the Queen's attention was more focused on the engagement of her son Prince Alfred to the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Tsar Alexander II and his first wife, Empress Marie Alexandrovna. The Tsar had refused to present his daughter for pre-marriage inspection in England, and instead invited the Queen to meet the family in Germany. Alice supported this suggestion, and on the same day she wrote to the Queen about how much she missed Frittie, the Queen wrote to Alice in scathing terms: [...] "You have entirely taken the Russian side, and I do not think, dear child, that you <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> me...what I ought to do." ...|$|E
