40|$|This master thesis {{project was}} {{performed}} in collaboration with Scania CV AB, Engine Materials group. The purpose with the project was to investigate different ceramic TBC (Thermal Barrier Coating) thermal insulation properties inside the combustion chamber. Experimental testing was performed with a Single-Cylinder engine with TBC deposited on selected components. A dummy-valve was developed and manufactured specifically for this test in order to enable a water cooling system and to ease the testing procedure. The dummy-valve consists of a headlock, socket, valve poppet and valve shaft. Additionally, a copper ring is mounted between the cylinder head and the valve poppet to seal the system from combustion gases. Thermocouples attached to the modified valve poppet and valve shaft measured the temperature during engine test to calculate the heat flux. The TBCs consisted of three different materials: 7 - 8 % yttrium-stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ), gadolinium zirconia and lanthanum zirconia. The 8 YSZ TBC was tested as standard, but also with microstructural modifications. Modifications such as pre-induced segmented cracks, nanostructured zones and <b>sealed</b> <b>porosity</b> were used. The {{results indicated that the}} heat flux of 8 YSZ-standard, 8 YSZ-nano and 8 YSZ-segmented cracks was in level with the steel reference. In the case of 8 YSZ-sealed porosity the heat flux was measured higher than the steel reference. Since 8 YSZ-standard and 8 YSZ-sealed porosity are deposited with the same powder it is believed that the high heat flux is caused by radiative heat transfer. The remaining samples have had some microstructural changes during engine testing. 8 YSZ-nano had undergone sintering and its nanostructured zones became fewer and almost gone after engine testing leading to less heat barrier in the top coat of the TBC. However, for 8 YSZ-segmented cracks and gadolinium zirconia lower heat flux was measured due to the appearance of horizontal cracks. These cracks are believed to act as internal barriers as they are orientated perpendicular to the heat flow. During long-time (5 hour) engine tests the 8 YSZ-standard exhibited the same phenomena: a decrease in heat flux due to propagation of horizontal cracks. One-dimensional heat flux was not achieved and the main reason for that was caused by heating and cooling of the shafts outer surface. However, the dummy-valve system {{has proven to be a}} quick, easy and stable to perform tests with a Single-Cylinder engine. Both water-cooling and long-time engine tests were conducted with minor issues. The dummy-valve has been further developed for future tests. Changes to the valve shaft are the most remarkable: smaller diameter to reduce heat transfer and smaller pockets to ensure better thermocouple positioning. Another issue was gas leakage from the combustion chamber through the copper ring and valve poppet joint. The copper ring will be designed with a 1 mm thick track to improve sealing, hence better attachment to the valve poppet...|$|E

40|$|Developments in turbine {{technologies}} lead {{to higher}} operating temperature and pressure conditions. Parasitic leakage flows around the turbine account for considerable efficiency losses that increase fuel cost dramatically. Brush seal has recently emerged as an improved sealing technology to provide better leakage performance and to replace classical labyrinth seals. In order to optimize efficiency, comprehensive study of the factors causing the leakage is required. The leakage performance of the brush seal is directly related with geometry, operating inlet and outlet boundary conditions, bristle pack configuration. Brush seal flow and pressure profiles with turbine operating conditions become complicated, and analytical formulations remain inadequate to correlate design parameters and leakage performance in operating conditions. Recently brush seals have found ever increasing applications in steam turbines. Literature review indicates that there is very limited studies of brush seal for steam environment. There is also no correlation available for brush <b>seal</b> <b>porosity</b> coefficients in the literature. In an attempt to meet this need, six brush seals have been tested in a rotary test rig up to 100 psi upstream pressure. Analytical correlations and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations have been performed for test seals and results have been correlated with the test data. Axisymmetric CFD models {{have been designed to}} reach anisotropic resistance coefficients for the brush seals based on experiments. Porous Medium Approach has been applied for representing bristle pack. Leakage rate of brush seals (steam environment) has been optimized through CFD models. Moreover, velocity and pressure characteristics in the bristle pack have been illustrated for an optimum solutions. Consequently, empirical correlations for brush <b>seal</b> <b>porosity</b> coefficients have been correlated through a systematic methodology...|$|R

40|$|It {{is crucial}} that the {{engineered}} seals of boreholes {{in the vicinity of}} a deep storage facility remain effective for considerable timescales if the long-term geological containment of stored CO 2 is to be effective. These timescales extend beyond those achievable by laboratory experiments or industrial experience. Study of the carbonation of natural Ca silicate hydrate (CSH) phases provides a useful insight into the alteration processes and evolution of cement phases over long-timescales more comparable with those considered in performance assessments. Samples from two such natural analogues in Northern Ireland have been compared with samples from laboratory experiments on the carbonation of Portland cement. Samples showed similar carbonation reaction processes even though the natural and experimental samples underwent carbonation under very different conditions and timescales. These included conversion of the CSH phases to CaCO 3 and SiO 2, and the formation of a well-defined reaction front. In laboratory experiments the reaction front is associated with localised Ca migration, localised matrix porosity increase, and localised shrinkage of the cement matrix with concomitant cracking. Behind the reaction front is a zone of CaCO 3 precipitation that partly <b>seals</b> <b>porosity.</b> A broader and more porous/permeable reaction zone was created in the laboratory experiments compared to the natural samples, and it is possible that short-term experiments might not fully replicate slower, longer-term processes. That the natural samples had only undergone limited carbonation, even though they had been exposed to atmospheric CO 2 or dissolved in groundwater for several thousands of years, may indicate that the limited amounts of carbonate mineral formation may have protected the CSH phases from further reaction. ...|$|R

40|$|Ureolysis-driven calcite {{precipitation}} {{has potential}} to <b>seal</b> <b>porosity</b> and fracture networks in rocks thus preventing groundwater flow and contaminant transport. In this study urea hydrolysis and calcite precipitation {{rates for the}} model bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii were {{compared with those of}} indigenous groundwater communities under conditions required to precipitate large volumes of calcite (up to 50 g L− 1). We conducted microcosm experiments in oxic artificial and anoxic natural groundwaters (collected from the Permo-Triassic sandstone aquifer at Birmingham, UK) that were inoculated with aerobically grown S. pasteurii. The rate constants for urea hydrolysis, kurea, ranged between 0. 06 and 3. 29 d− 1 and were only affected by inoculum density. Higher Ca 2 + concentration (50 – 500 mM Ca 2 +) as well as differences in fO 2 did not inhibit the ureolytic activity of S. pasteurii and did not significantly impact kurea. These results demonstrate that S. pasteurii has potential to improve calcite precipitation in both oxic and anoxic groundwaters, especially if indigenous communities lack ureolytic activity. Urea hydrolysis by indigenous groundwater communities was investigated in anoxic, natural groundwaters amended with urea and CaCl 2. A notable increase in ureolysis rates was measured only when these communities were stimulated with dilute nutrients (with best results from blackstrap molasses). Furthermore, there was a considerable lag time (12 – 20 days) before ureolysis and calcite precipitation began. Calculated ureolysis rate constants, kurea, ranged between 0. 03 and 0. 05 d− 1 and were similar to kurea values produced by S. pasteurii at low inoculum densities. Overall, this comparative study revealed that the growth of ureolytic microorganisms present within groundwaters can easily be stimulated to enhance rates of urea hydrolysis in the subsurface, and thus can be used to induce calcite precipitation in these environments. The time required for urea hydrolysis to begin is almost instantaneous if an inoculum of S. pasteurii is included, while it may take several weeks for ureolytic groundwater communities to grow and become ureolytically active...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project was to develop and {{validate}} new classes of cost-effective low-permeability ceramic and refractory components for handling molten aluminum in both melting and casting environments. Three approaches were employed with partial to full success to achieve this goal: (1) Develop materials and methods for <b>sealing</b> surface <b>porosity</b> in thermal-shock-resistant ceramic refractories; (2) Develop new ceramic coatings for extreme service in molten aluminum operations, with particular emphasis on coatings based on highly stable oxide phases; and (3) Develop new monolithic refractories designed for lower-permeability applications using controlled porosity gradients and particle size distributions. The results of the research work and the field tests performed utilizing these three approaches are listed below: (1) It was demonstrated that high-density IR heating could be a tool for altering and <b>sealing</b> the surface <b>porosity</b> of fused silica. However, the process was not very cost-effective. (2) A low-cost glaze composition having a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) similar to that of a DFS tube was identified and was successfully tested for its integrity and adherence to DFS. Although the glaze acted as a barrier between the molten aluminum and the DFS, persistent porosity and crazing within the glaze affected its performance during the reactivity tests, thus acting as an obstacle in scaling up production of this glaze. (3) Pyrotek's XL glaze showed great success in improving the life of the DFS tubes. Pyrotek has reported an increasing market demand for the XL-coated DFS tubes, which exhibit useful lifetimes three times better than those of uncoated tubes. (4) A computer model to optimize particle size distribution for reduced permeability was developed and successfully applied to casting formulations. Silica riser tubes produced using these new formulations have been tested in a commercial aluminum casting facility and have been reported to increase the life of the DFS tubes by 700 %.

The NiCoCrAlHfYSi (MCrAlHYS) coating, as the first layer, contained a large number of voids, globular porosities, and micro-cracks with a thickness of 40 - 50 μm, while the Al 2 O 3 · 13 %TiO 2 coating, as the second layer, presented a unique bimodal microstructure with a thickness of 70 - 80 μm. The top layer was a hydrophobic polymer, which effectively <b>sealed</b> the <b>porosities</b> of plasma layers.

Salt creeping into an excavation is expected to show increased porosity and absolute permeability values compared to undisturbed halite.

We present a three-dimensional velocity model beneath the Lucky Strike Volcano with unprecedented spatial resolutions {{of a few hundred}} meters. These new constraints reveal large lateral variations in P wave velocity structure beneath this feature. Throughout the study area, uppermost crustal velocities are significantly lower than those inferred from lower resolution ocean bottom seismometer studies, with the lowest values (1. 8 – 2. 2 [*]km/s) found beneath the three central volcanic cones.

40|$|The Big Clifty is a Chesterian-age Mississippian {{sandstone}} {{member of}} the Golconda Formation that extends from south-central Kentucky into adjacent Illinois and Indiana. Asphaltic deposits and conventional petroleum plays are distributed along the Pennyrile Fault System and Plateau in the southeastern portion of the Illinois basin. In south-central Kentucky anomalous oil-saturation geometries are observed in cored sections of the Big Clifty from wells in Warren and Butler counties along {{the margin of the}} Pennyrile Plateau. Petrographic study of the cores has revealed several diagenetic processes that have contributed to, or are directly responsible for, the anomalous oil saturation geometries and resultant reservoir partitioning. This study utilizes standard transmitted and reflected light microscopy, UVepifluorescence, optical cold-cathode cathodoluminescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and alizarin red S and potassium ferricyanide staining in petrographic examination. Raman microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmitted electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction assisted in identification and compositional analysis of minerals. Quantification of framework grains and cement compositions, porosity, and grain-size distributions was also conducted. This study’s data classified the Big Clifty as a fine to very-fine grained, quartz arenite with predominantly silicious and phyllosilicate cements and a mean of porosity of 7 %. Oil-saturation geometries concordant to rock fabric are due to compaction, weathering of labile grains, and precipitation of authigenic cements (mainly quartz, kaolinite, and pyrite). A paragenetic sequence, established from textural evidence, places quartz, kaolinite, and pyrite phases early in paragenesis with labile grain dissolution, compaction, and precipitation of ferroan carbonate cement, with development of vugular porosity occuring later during burial. These phases and processes enhanced preexisting porosity and permeability heterogeneities within the rock. Nodular pyrite, oil emplacement, and precipitation of poikilotopic calcite are the latest diagenetic events. Nodular pyrite and poikilotopic calcite are responsible for oil-saturation geometries distinctly discordant with rock fabric. Poikilotopic calcite forms interstratal <b>seals,</b> occluding <b>porosity,</b> replacing framework grains and cements, and overprinting primary rock fabric. This study’s preliminary research into the poikiloptopic calcite suggests its occurrence is possibly associated with the cored wells’ shallow depths less than 500 feet (150 meters), and proximity to near-vertical faults and waters from drainage systems of karstified carbonate aquifers updip...|$|R

Rainfall on bare soil breaks soil aggregates, detaching particles, plugging pores and decreasing porosity in the top few mm of soil. This reduces hydraulic conductivity and increases runoff through a process known as surface sealing. The objectives of this study are to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of surface seals developed on bare Mexico silt loam (Aeric Vertic Epiaqualfs) during a simulated rainfall event, to evaluate the effect of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) for maintaining high Ksat, and to evaluate models of <b>sealing</b> using total <b>porosity,</b> pore-size distribution collected with high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRCT). The study used a factorial design. Factors included rainfall duration (0 -, 7. 5 -, 15 -, 30 -, and 60 -min) at 55 -mm hr- 1 intensity, and an untreated soil or a soil amended with 20 -kg ha- 1 PAM. Application of PAM for various rainfall durations maintained from 20 % to 41 % higher Ksat than did untreated soil, for all times tested. Results indicated density ([rho]) increased, and total porosity and pore-size decreased rapidly after a 15 -min rainfall. HRCT-[rho] data helped identify the best model selection for characterizing seal [rho] profile. Although the cost is expensive, HRCT image is a valuable tool to measure soil properties by analyzing soil thickness down to 0. 015 -mm. The study confirms that HRCT-analysis of soil allows accurate and direct measurements of seal effects on water flow and documents the usefulness of PAM for reducing surface sealing...|$|R
40|$|Laser glazing {{has been}} {{revealing}} a high {{potential for the}} improvement of plasma-sprayed (PS) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) by reducing surface roughness, eliminating open porosity on the surface and generating a controlled segmented crack network, although the relationship of the processing parameters with the resultant properties has not yet been completely established. In this investigation, TBCs consisting of atmospheric plasma-sprayed (APS) ZrO 2 – 8 wt. %Y 2 O 3 were subjected to a CO 2 continuous wave laser-glazing process in order to <b>seal</b> its surface <b>porosity,</b> generating an external dense layer. For that purpose, different amounts of radiation resulting from different scanning speeds were applied to the specimens as well as different track overlapping. Results have shown a significant decrease of the surface roughness after the laser treatment. All specimens presented a fully dense and porous free external layer with a polyfaceted columnar microstructure highly adherent to the plasma-sprayed coating. Controlled surface crack networks, extremely dependent on the laser scanning speed and track overlapping, were achieved for each set of processing parameters. The cracks were found to have a tendency to be oriented in two perpendicular directions, one {{in the direction of the}} laser-beam travel direction, the other perpendicular to it. Moreover, the cracks parallel to the beam travel direction are found to be on the overlapping zone, coinciding with the edge of the subsequent track. The cracks are perpendicular to the surface along the densified layer and tend to branch and deviate from the vertical direction below it, within the porous PS coating. XRD results revealed mainly tV nontransformable tetragonal zirconia with a small percentage of residual monoclinic zirconia for the as-sprayed coating. All glazed coatings presented only tV nontransformable tetragonal zirconia with some variations on preferable crystal orientation. Grain sizes varied from 26 to 52 nm, increasing with an increase of laserirradiated energy; microstrain behaved inversely. União Europeia (UE). Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER).

40|$|Significant {{fracture}} and <b>porosity</b> <b>sealing</b> {{characterizes the}} sedimentary cover-basement interface {{in the northwestern}} margin of the Aquitaine Basin (France). Dolomite and calcite (and sometimes fluorite, barite and quartz) constitute most of the fracture fillings. They contain primary inclusions of brines having chlorinities {{in the range of}} 3. 3 to 5. 5 mol Cl/kg solution, with total homogenization temperatures in between 65 and 130 degreesC for quartz and slightly lower for dolomite, barite, fluorite and calcite. Crush-leach analyses indicate that brines are characterized by Na/K ratios of 5 to 40, Na/Li ratios of 20 to 530, and Cl/Br ratios of 200 to 1000, which are rather typical of deep basinal brines. The fluid delta(18) O signature is estimated to be approximate to 6. 6 +/- 1. 8 parts per thousand SMOW for a crystallization temperature of 100 +/- 20 degreesC and the deltaD value is - 30 +/- 10 parts per thousand SMOW. The fluid source for the fracture filling mineral is interpreted as a deep sedimentary brine expelled during a period of maximum subsidence in the Aquitaine Basin, which migrated along the sediment cover/basement, a zone characterized interface which is characterized by high permeabilities below the Toarcian shales. The sealing is likely to be linked to the mixing of the brines with dilute, ascending hot waters. These dilute waters infiltrated from emerged zones, convected and heated at depth, reaching temperatures of 100 degreesC (up to 150 degreesC on the basis of cation geothermometry). Extensional activity, of probable Cretaceous age, related to the Gascogne Gulf rifting could be considered as the most likely cause of a significant fluid migration event at the basement/cover interface all along the margins of the French Massif Central. These processes are large scale as shown by the similarities of mineral sequences, fluid types and general features of most of the F-Ba-Pb-Zn deposits located at the basement-sedimentary cover interface...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent review}} by the U. S. Advanced Ceramics Association, the Aluminum Association, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies (DOE/OIT) {{described}} the status of advanced ceramics for aluminum processing, including monolithics, composites, and coatings. The report observed that monolithic ceramics (particularly oxides) have attractive properties such as resistance to heat, corrosion, thermal shock, abrasion, and erosion [1]. However, even after the developments of the past 25 years, there are two key barriers to commercialization: reliability and cost-effectiveness. Industry research is therefore focused on eliminating these barriers. Ceramic coatings have likewise undergone significant development {{and a variety of}} processes have been demonstrated for applying coatings to substrates. Some processes, such as thermal barrier coatings for gas turbine engines, exhibit sufficient reliability and service life for routine commercial use. Worldwide, aluminum melting and molten metal handling consumes about 506, 000 tons of refractory materials annually. Refractory compositions for handling molten aluminum are generally based on dense fused cast silica or mullite. The microstructural texture is extremely important because an interlocking mass of coarser grains must be bonded together by smaller grains in order to achieve adequate strength. At the same time, well-distributed microscopic pores and cracks are needed to deflect cracks and prevent spalling and thermal shock damage [2]. The focus of this project was to develop and validate new classes of cost-effective, low-permeability ceramic and refractory components for handling molten aluminum in both smelting and casting environments. The primary goal was to develop improved coatings and functionally graded materials that will possess superior combinations of properties, including resistance to thermal shock, erosion, corrosion, and wetting. When these materials are successfully deployed in aluminum smelting and casting operations, their superior performance and durability will give end users marked improvements in uptime, defect reduction, scrap/rework costs, and overall energy savings resulting from higher productivity and yield. The implementation of results of this program will result in energy savings of 30 trillion Btu/year by 2020. For this Industrial Materials for the Future (IMF) project, riser tube used in the low-pressure die (LPD) casting of aluminum was selected as the refractory component for improvement. In this LPD process, a pressurized system is used to transport aluminum metal through refractory tubes (riser tubes) into wheel molds. It is important for the tubes to remain airtight because otherwise, the pressurized system will fail. Generally, defects such as porosity in the tube or cracks generated by reaction of the tube material with molten aluminum lead to tube failure, making the tube incapable of maintaining the pressure difference required for normal casting operation. Therefore, the primary objective of the project was to develop a riser tube that is not only resistant to thermal shock, erosion, corrosion, and wetting, but is also less permeable, so as to achieve longer service life. Currently, the dense-fused silica (DFS) riser tube supplied by Pyrotek lasts for only 7 days before undergoing failure. The following approach was employed to achieve the goal: (1) Develop materials and methods for <b>sealing</b> surface <b>porosity</b> in thermal-shock-resistant ceramic refractories; (2) Develop new ceramic coatings for extreme service in molten aluminum operations, with particular emphasis on coatings based on highly stable oxide phases; (3) Develop new monolithic refractories designed for lower-permeability applications using controlled porosity gradients and particle size distributions; (4) Optimize refractory formulations to minimize wetting by molten aluminum, and characterize erosion, corrosion, and spallation rates under realistic service conditions; and (5) Scale up the processing methods to full-sized components and perform field testing in commercial aluminum casting shops...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the mineralogical composition of salt assemblages and the composition of groundwaters from which these salts precipitated. A comparison was made between salts and waters sampled in the Konya Basin in Turkey and waters sampled in three different regions in Kenya. The chemical composition of waters from rivers entering the Konya Basin is different from the composition of those from rivers in Kenya. The initial composition of these rivers determines the type of minerals that will precipitate during evaporation of these river waters. The ratio of calcium to carbonate at the moment the solution becomes saturated with respect to calcite, usually the first mineral to precipitate, determines whether the final solution will become carbonate-rich or carbonate-poor. The ratio of magnesium to silica and the ratio of calcium to sulphate at the moment the solution becomes saturated with respect to sepiolite and gypsum respectively, determine the magnesium and sulphate content of the final solution. In this way six different types of concentrated brines originate and six different types of salt assemblages precipitate from these brines during evaporation. The concentrated waters and the salt assemblages in the Konya Basin belong mainly to the Na-Mg-SO 4 -Cl-type. The evolution of the groundwater composition and the type of minerals which precipitated from these groundwaters can be explained by assuming successive precipitation of calcite, sepiolite and gypsum. The concentrated waters and the salt assemblages from Kenya belong mainly to the Na-CO 3 -SO 4 -Cl-type. The behaviour of the dissolved species and the type of salt minerals can be explained by assuming calcite and sepiolite precipitation only. The crystallographic properties of some salt minerals were determined by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and the morphological properties by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The presence of halite causes a salt crust to become dense and <b>sealing.</b> The <b>porosity</b> of a salt crust increases when bloedite or trona is present. Prediction of the sequence of salt minerals which will precipitate from a concentrated solution requires an accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of concentrated electrolyte solutions. Unfortunately, these properties are still unknown for carbonate-rich solutions. Only recently a theory was developed for carbonate-poor solutions. The watersamples were evaporated in the laboratory in evaporating dishes under ambient conditions. The mineralogical composition of the precipitates was compared with the assemblages that occur in the field. The carbonate-containing salt assemblages both from the field and from the laboratory experiments were investigated by means of log PCO 2 - log aH 2 O diagrams. It appeared that neither the field nor the laboratory salt assemblages were in equilibrium with the CO 2 - pressures of the solutions from which they precipitated. These CO 2 -pressures were calculated from the analytical data. The carbonate-free salt assemblages from the Konya Basin were investigated by means of Jänecke-diagrams. For a few selected samples the theoretical mineral sequences were calculated under the assumption of equilibrium precipitation {{with the help of the}} computerprogram of Harvie & Weare (1980). It appeared that prediction of mineral assemblages in salt efflorescences is difficult even with a sound thermodynamic theory. Salt assemblages in natural salt efflorescences could best be predicted assuming precipitation under equilibrium conditions, whereas mineral assemblages in evaporating dishes in the laboratory could best be predicted assuming both metastable mineral formation and fractional crystallization. This conclusion is supported by the presence of the two new minerals, konyaite and eugsterite, which have been discovered in this study. Both are metastable minerals under ambient conditions. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of some waters from the Konya Basin in Turkey and of the watersamples from the Amboseli Basin in Kenya were determined. The isotope fractionation caused by evaporation is different in groundwater and surface water. Processes of evaporation and water-rock interaction could be distinguished...|$|R
40|$|The {{sphalerite}} deposit at Newfoundland Zinc Mines near Daniels Harbour, western Newfoundland {{is situated}} in {{the upper part of}} the Lower Ordovician St. George Group, a complex of dolostones, limestones and breccias in the middle of a Lower Paleozoic shallow-water, carbonate platform sequence. It is a zinc-dominated Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposit, a subtype of MVTs that is characteristic of the Appalachians. This study shows that zinc mineralization occurred during one phase of a complex history of repeated dolomitization and fracturing of the host carbonates along northeast-trending lineaments. This history is interpreted through an integrated analysis of the sedimentologic, stratigraphic and structural framework, petrography, cathodoluminescence and geochemistry. [...] The upper St. George Group carbonates were deposited along the edge of the tropical Iapetus Ocean during Early to early Middle Ordovician time when the passive continental margin began to experience the initial effects of plate convergence. Shallow subtidal muddy carbonates (Catoche Formation) shallowed upwards into restricted-water, rhythmically interbedded peloidal grainstones and mudstones (Peloidal or Costa Bay Member) and peritidal laminites and burrow-mottled mudstones (Aguathuna Formation). Deformation and fragmentation of the platform and marine regression during early Middle Ordovician time resulted in the regional St. George Unconformity and the formation of rock-matrix breccias from subsurface karst. The mine stratigraphy records a minimum of 5 stages of faulting, subsurface dissolution and erosion of the platform at this time. The platform was gradually flooded during Middle Ordovician time as the upper member of the Aguathuna Formation and limestones of the Table Point Formation were deposited over the St. George Unconformity. Continued convergence of the continental margin caused collapse of the platform and generation of a foreland basin in which a thick sequence of siliciclastic flysch was deposited and eventually overridden by Taconic thrust sheets. [...] Seven dolomite crystal types or generations (I through VII) crystallized in four major settings. Microcrystalline, syngenetic dolostones (I) with enriched ¹HO replaced subtidal to peritidal mudstones at or near the surface. Some of these dolostones were then incorporated as clasts in conglomerates and solution breccias. Composite diagenetic crystals (II) grew during burial forming turbid, replacive cores near surface and clear rims at depths where pressure solution (> 300 m) was active. Pore-filling, clear, zoned dolomite cements (III) <b>sealed</b> most remaining <b>porosity</b> in early dolostones. [...] Epigenetic coarse dolostone/sphalerite (D/S) complexes overprinted the earlier dolomites. They formed around fracture systems as extensive stratabound bodies within, and local discordant bodies across the Catoche Formation. Their development occurred in 5 main stages: (1) Regional compression generated linear, stratabound fracture zones along faults and around rock-matrix breccias, (2) Xenotopic pre-ore dolomites (IV) replaced dolostone-mottled limestones and formed zebra fabrics along fractures. (3) Hydrothermal (140 ﾟC mode) ore fluids caused extensive dissolution of carbonates. (4) Sulphides precipitated in two stages along fracture zones as fracturing, faulting and dissolution continued. (5) Post-ore hydrothermal dolomites (V, VI), dominated by replacive and pore-filling saddle dolomites with depleted ¹HO, crystallized around widespread, dilatant fractures forming spar breccias, pseudobreccias and coarse sparry dolostones. Faults associated with regional uplift displaced the D/S complexes and formed fluid conduits creating a fourth and final environment for late fault-related, turbid dolomites (VII) which replaced limestones. [...] The genesis of epigenetic dolostones and sulphides is interpreted to be the result of regional fracturing during the initial stages of the Siluro-Devonian Acadian Orogeny. Rising geothermal gradients generated by structural thickening of the crust probably caused warming of basinal fluids, the release of metals and sulphur from minerals in the sediments and basement and the formation of hydrothermal convection in the sedimentary pile. Steep fractures penetrated the base of the sedimentary pile and enabled fluids to rise directly from basement depths of 4 to 6 km. At the deposit site the warm, buoyant fluids rose to the top of fracture aquifers where they displaced cooler formation waters. Cooling, loss of CO₂, sulphate reduction and/or increased pH probably accounted for sulphide precipitation...|$|R
