Different {{features}} have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and <b>spell-checker,</b> which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch. Since it uses a software based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different keyboard layouts without having to change physically. The [...] can display different languages and scripts at the same time.|$|E

In {{addition}} to regular texting, messaging on the [...] is supported by iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to text by speaking into the microphone.

In addition to regular texting, messaging on the [...] supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgements for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language <b>spell-checker</b> which recognises many regional accents of different languages.|$|E

The search engine calculator provides the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. When searching the word [...] "recursion", the <b>spell-checker's</b> result for the properly spelled word {{is exactly the same}} word, creating a recursive link.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{software}} extensions that can be added to ArcGIS for Desktop that provide added functionality, including 3D Analyst, Spatial Analyst, Network Analyst, Survey Analyst, Tracking Analyst, and Geostatistical Analyst. [...] Advanced map labeling is available with the Maplex extension, as an add-on to ArcView and ArcEditor and is bundled with ArcInfo. Numerous extensions have also been developed by third parties, such as the [...] <b>spell-checker,</b> [...] XTools and MAP2PDF for creating georeferenced pdfs (GeoPDF), ERDAS' Image Analysis and Stereo Analyst for ArcGIS, and ISM's PurVIEW, which converts Arc- desktops into precise stereo-viewing windows to work with geo-referenced stereoscopic image models for accurate geodatabase-direct editing or feature digitizing.|$|E
2500|$|Despite being traditionally-based on British English, Malaysian English has, {{in recent}} decades, been {{strongly}} influenced by American English. This can be commonly seen in web-based media and documents produced within organisations. [...] When using computers, the writer is typically unaware {{of the differences between}} British and American English and uses the default settings on their software <b>spell-checker.</b> Most computer software in Malaysia, including Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, come pre-set with American English as the default and these settings are seldom changed to British English, resulting in the proliferation of American English in many places of work, local universities and other places with heavy reliance on documents and content created by using computers. In schools and in the print media however, Malaysians revert to British English.|$|E

50|$|The series {{continues}} {{but mainly}} with add-on {{products for the}} VIEW word processor such as ViewIndex (an automatic index generator) and ViewSpell (<b>spell-checker)</b> as well as newer versions.|$|E
50|$|Spell has {{a simple}} {{command-line}} interface: It goes {{over all the}} words in a given text file, and prints a sorted list of unique misspelled words in that file. It does not provide any interface for looking for those words in the file, or helping to correct the mistakes. In 1983, a different <b>spell-checker,</b> ispell (the interactive <b>spell-checker),</b> was ported to Unix. ispell had a user interface for showing the spelling mistakes in context and suggesting how to correct them. Since then, the original Spell tool has been mostly considered obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|To {{further support}} the Vietnamese language, Cốc Cốc {{automatically}} detects spelling mistakes, underlining and suggesting corrections with 94% accuracy. According to some experiments, Cốc Cốc outperforms Google Chrome's <b>spell-checker</b> in 97 cases out of 100. The developer group estimates that this feature saves users up to 4-10 {{days per year}} to type and review documents.|$|E
50|$|Zim is a {{graphical}} {{text editor}} designed {{to maintain a}} collection of locally stored wiki-pages. Each wiki-page can contain text with simple formatting, links to other wiki-pages, attachments, and images. Additional plugins, such as an equation editor and <b>spell-checker,</b> are also available. The wiki-pages are stored in a folder structure in plain text files with wiki formatting.|$|E
50|$|Enchant {{is a free}} {{software}} project developed {{as part of the}} AbiWord word processor with the aim of unifying access to the various existing <b>spell-checker</b> software. Enchant wraps a common set of functionality present in a variety of existing products/libraries, and exposes a stable API/ABI for doing so. Where a library doesn't implement some specific functionality, Enchant will emulate it.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} step is a language-dependent algorithm {{for handling}} morphology. Even for a lightly inflected language like English, the <b>spell-checker</b> {{will need to}} consider different forms of the same word, such as plurals, verbal forms, contractions, and possessives. For many other languages, such as those featuring agglutination and more complex declension and conjugation, {{this part of the}} process is more complicated.|$|E
50|$|On October 24, 2006, Mozilla {{released}} Mozilla Firefox 2.0. It {{included the}} ability to reopen recently closed tabs, a session restore feature to resume work {{where it had been}} left after a crash, a phishing filter, and a <b>spell-checker</b> for text fields. Mozilla released Firefox 3.0 on June 17, 2008, with performance improvements and other new features. Firefox 3.5 followed on June 30, 2009, with further performance improvements, native integration of audio and video, and more privacy features.|$|E
50|$|The {{system also}} {{supports}} {{the creation of}} data tables, the sorting of these data tables, arithmetic calculations using these data, and a mail-merge operation using these data and the arithmetic results. Through the extensive use of overlays, it manages all that on a 12-bit, 1.2-μs processor with 16 KWords of memory and 256 KB of diskette storage. The limited resources of the system do not permit a <b>spell-checker,</b> though, primarily {{because there was no}} place with adequate storage to contain the dictionary file.|$|E

Guides for beginners are also included, describing each of the major features of Firefox and Thunderbird, from pop-up blocking to <b>spell-checker</b> and download manager. Firemonger also contains quick start guides, providing an overview of both Firefox and Thunderbird's features.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the folly of relying {{completely}} on spell checkers {{is shown in the}} <b>Spell-checker</b> Poem above. It was originally composed by Dr Jerrold H. Zar in 1991, assisted by Mark Eckman, with an original length of 225 words, and containing 123 incorrectly used words. According to most unsophisticated spell checkers, the poem is valid, but most people can tell at a simple glance that most words are used incorrectly. As a result, spell checkers are sometimes derided as spilling chuckers or similar, slightly misspelled names.|$|E
5000|$|Seneca Inc. {{developed}} the original PageMill and SiteMill products. During open beta testing, Adobe acquired {{the company and}} rebranded the product with their own logo. Adobe released PageMill 1.0 in late 1995. It was considered revolutionary at the time, {{as it was the}} first HTML editor that was considered user friendly, cited as the [...] "PageMaker of the WWW". This first version, however, was also criticized for lacking items such as a <b>spell-checker</b> and support for creating HTML tables. Adobe acquired Seneca in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|Several [...] "add-in applications" [...] can be [...] "attached" [...] and activated, {{extending}} Symphony's capabilities, {{including a}} powerful macro manager, a document outliner, a <b>spell-checker,</b> statistics, various communications configurations, and a tutorial, which demonstrates Symphony usage by running macros. The program allows {{the screen to}} be split into panes and distinct Windows, showing different views of the underlying data simultaneously, each of which can display any of the five environments. The user is then {{able to see that}} changes made in one environment are reflected in others simultaneously, perhaps the package's most interesting feature.|$|E

Both Jacques and Kit appear as {{supporting}} characters in the Series of Unfortunate Events books. He also knew Count Olaf in his early life, as the two attended school together. In his youth, Lemony Snicket attended a V.F.D.-run boarding school with several other characters from the series. He received later tuition at a V.F.D. headquarters in the Mortmain Mountains, and was employed by a newspaper called The Daily Punctilio after graduation. Snicket was an obituary <b>spell-checker</b> and theater critic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{analytical}} writing section {{consists of}} two different essays, an [...] "issue task" [...] and an [...] "argument task". The writing section is graded {{on a scale of}} 0-6, in half-point increments. The essays are written on a computer using a word processing program specifically designed by ETS. The program allows only basic computer functions and does not contain a <b>spell-checker</b> or other advanced features. Each essay is scored by at least two readers on a six-point holist scale. If the two scores are within one point, the average of the scores is taken. If the two scores differ by more than a point, a third reader examines the response.|$|E

5000|$|Jaffee {{has contributed}} to {{hundreds}} of Mad articles as either a writer or an artist and often both. These include his long-running [...] "Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions", which present multiple putdowns for the same unnecessary or clueless inquiry, and several articles on inventions and gadgets, which are presented in an elaborately detailed [...] "blueprint" [...] style. Sergio Aragones says of Jaffee, [...] "He is brilliant at many things, but especially inventions. When he draws a machine for Mad, no matter how silly the idea, it always looks like it works.

[...] In a patent file for a self-extinguishing cigarette, the inventor thanked Jaffee for providing the inspiration. Other actual inventions that have since come to pass had appeared earlier in Jaffee articles, such as telephone redial and address books (1961), snowboarding (1965), the computer <b>spell-checker</b> (1967), peelable stamps, multi-blade razors (1979), and graffiti-proof building surfaces (1982).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to develop a simple and {{flexible}} <b>spell-checker</b> for Arabic language. The proposed <b>spell-checker</b> is based on N-Grams scores. For this purpose, eleven matrices are built to present the combination between the Arabic letters word. Each matrix concerns in the connection between a 2 -grams letters. Each cell in the generarated matrix is assigned an integer value 2, 1 or 0. The cell is assigned the value 2 in the corresponding matrix; if the word is ended by these two letter and assigned 1 if there is a connection and the word is not over yet, and is assigned 0 otherwise. On the other side searching process for any word that is by extracting each pair of letters in the word then it examines the value for each pair when the corresponding value is zero then the spell checker will consider the test word as wrong; otherwise it will check if it is assign with 1 that indicates that there is a connection it will be continue until reach to the value of 2 to determine that the word is correct.

40|$|This paper {{sketches}} {{my current}} thinking on (2). What policy to enforce? Least privilege. Policies {{consistent with the}} Principle of Least Privilege depend {{not only on the}} code to be executed but also on what job that code is intended to do. For an extension Ext and some specification Zrxt of a job to be done, we define Id:'riv(Ext, Zrxt) to be the policy that grants the minimum privileges needed for execution of Ext to satisfy Zrxt. (A policy here is a mapping from system histories to sets of privileges.) As an example, specification Zrxt of a <b>spell-checker</b> extension Ext for a word processor might specify that misspelled words be flagged in the word processor's open file F; we would then expect #Jiv(Ext, ZExt) to be a policy that permits the <b>spell-checker</b> read (but not write) access to F, read (but not write) access to a file containing a spelling dictionary, and read/write access to a file containing user-added spellings for local jargon term...|$|E
