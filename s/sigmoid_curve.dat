40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the ways}} for {{determination}} of flow curves is {{the application of a}} ring test. Using this method, friction in the interface between the die and the specimen leads to a bulging of the sample and thereby to an inhomogeneous stress and strain state. The calculation of the flow stress from experimentally determined force–displacement curves implies a uniaxial stress state, but this will produce an error because of the above-mentioned bulging, when friction occurs. One method of avoiding these sources of error is to use the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>curves,</b> but the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>curves</b> are varied by the change of temperature and strain rate. Calculations of numerical <b>sigmoid</b> <b>curves</b> were done by the use of an iterative procedure, applying a corrective function.

Using this approach, we defined the functional border zone as the distance from the perfusion boundary to 97. 5 % of the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>curve's</b> nonischemic asymptote. The lateral extent of the functional border zone, measured 10 min and 3 hr after occlusion, was 32 and 28 degrees of circumference, respectively. To evaluate the severity of nonischemic dysfunction, we measured average systolic wall thickening within the functional border zone. It was reduced from 3. 69 + 1. 10 (mean + SD) mm to 2. 98 + 1. 07 mm (p<. 01) and 2. 74 + 1. 12 mm (p<. 01) early and late after coronary occlusion. Thus, a narrow functional border zone was evident during circumflex coronary occlusion in conscious dogs. Its lateral extent was limited to approximately 30 degrees (similar to findings in open-chest, anesthetized dogs), severe dysfunction was restricted to the immediate vicinity of the perfusion boundary, and the average severity of nonischemic dysfunction within the functional border zone was mild...|$|R

These ribs are somewhat thickened at their posterior extremity and give the summits of the whorls a beaded appearance.

The protoconch {{contains}} 2.5 smooth whorls 2.5, forming a pointed apex. The beginning of the postnuclear whorls has the axial riblets characteristic of the later postnuclear whorls, but here they {{are a little more}} slender and a little more closely approximated. The postnuclear whorls are marked by strong axial ribs that almost form cusps at the anterior termination of the posterior sinal region. They extend only very feebly across the sinal area, which occupies the posterior two fifths of the whorls. On the body whorl these ribs are decidedly enfeebled on the base and evanesce at the junction with the columella. Of the axial ribs, 10 occur upon the first six whorls, 12 upon the seventh and the last whorl. These ribs are about one third as wide as the spaces that separate them, the latter being broad and concave. In addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked by rather strong incremental lines that have a decidedly <b>sigmoid</b> <b>curve,</b> being retractively slanting at the posterior sinal region and protractively anterior to this. The spiral sculpture consists of numerous, closely spaced, microscopic obsolete spiral lines. The base of the shell is moderately well rounded. The columella is short and stubby, and is marked by 12 rather strong sinuous spiral threads and finer spiral lines corresponding to those on the spire andbase. The aperture is moderately large and rather broad, decidedly channeled posteriorly and anteriorly with a feeble stromboid notch. The outer lip is protracted between the posterior angle and the stromboid notch into a clawlike element, while the inner lip is reflected over the columella as a heavy callus, which extends over the parietal wall and projects into the aperture at the posterior sinus as a decidedknob. There is a heavy varix about one sixth of a turn behind the edge of the outer lip.|$|E
5000|$|The {{skull of}} Baryonyx is incompletely known, {{and much of}} the middle and hind {{portions}} are not preserved. The full length of the skull has been estimated to be 950 mm (37.4 in), based on comparison with that of the related genus Suchomimus (which is 20% larger). It was elongated, and the front 170 mm (6.6 in) of the premaxillae formed a long, low snout (rostrum) with a rounded upper surface. The nostrils, far back from the tip, passed horizontally {{from one side of the}} skull to the other. The front 130 mm (5.1 in) of the snout expanded into a spatulate (flared outwards to the sides), [...] "terminal rosette" [...] shape similar to the modern gharial, and the front 70 mm (2.7 in) of the lower margin was downturned (or hooked). The snout was very narrow just behind the rosette. The creature's maxilla and premaxilla fit together in a complex articulation, resulting in a strongly curved tooth row. The gap in the row is comparable to that of Dilophosaurus. The front 140 mm (5.5 in) of the dentary in the mandible curved upwards towards this area, and the gap between the upper and lower jaw is known as the subrostral notch. The snout had extensive pits (which would have been exits for blood vessels and nerves), and the maxilla appears to have housed sinuses.Baryonyx had a rudimentary secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests the presence of a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.Most of the teeth found with the holotype specimen were not attached to the skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles on the front and back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039 in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.The neck formed a straighter S shape (a <b>sigmoid</b> <b>curve</b> typical of theropods) than that seen in other theropods; in fact, the neck was initially thought to lack the S curve. The shape of the cervical vertebrae indicate that they tapered towards the head and were progressively longer front to back. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were low, thin, and were not always sutured to the centra (the bodies of the vertebrae). The axis vertebra, small relative to the size of the skull, had a well-developed hyposphene. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae were similar in size. Like other dinosaurs, Baryonyx reduced its weight (skeletal pneumaticity) with fenestrae (openings) in the neural arches and with pleurocoels (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the transverse processes). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad.|$|E
