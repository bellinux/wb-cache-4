5|$|In 1981, Defender {{established}} <b>scrolling</b> in shoot 'em ups, offering horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later {{games in}} the genre, the player could move in either direction. The game's use of <b>scrolling</b> helped remove design limitations associated with the screen, and though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling shooter with forced <b>scrolling.</b> It was the first <b>scrolling</b> shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. Atari's Tempest, released in 1981, {{is one of the}} earliest tube shooters and an early attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into shooter games. Tempest ultimately went on to influence major rail shooters.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September 2011 the Israel Museum Digital Dead Sea <b>Scrolls</b> site went online.

As of May 2012, five complete <b>scrolls</b> from the Israel Museum have been digitized for the project and are now accessible online: the Great Isaiah <b>Scroll,</b> the Community Rule <b>Scroll,</b> the Commentary on Habakkuk <b>Scroll,</b> the Temple <b>Scroll,</b> and the War <b>Scroll.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Scroll</b> profile plays a {{key role}} in {{determining}} the performance of a <b>scroll</b> compressor. In this study geometric and dynamic characteristics of the <b>scroll</b> profile are analyzed to investigate the influence of its geometric continuity on property of a <b>scroll</b> compressor. Firstly, <b>scroll</b> profiles are created to redesign the geometry of <b>scroll</b> wrap by using the equidistant-curve approach on the basis of a generation line consisting of involute of circle and circular arc. Subsequently, the geometric and dynamic models of the <b>scroll</b> compressor are established. These models are related to parameters of the generation line of <b>scroll</b> profile and rotation angle of a moving <b>scroll.</b> Lastly, some simulation examples of second-order continuity (SOC) <b>scroll</b> profile are compared with first-order continuity (FOC) <b>scroll</b> profiles and some important conclusions are obtained. Results show that SOC <b>scroll</b> profile is superior to FOC profile in terms of volume ratio, stability of gas force, and possible leakage loss in a <b>scroll</b> compressor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>scroll</b> {{compressor}} has the conjugate {{motion of}} meshing by the fixed <b>scroll</b> {{and the planet}} <b>scroll.</b> Several kinds of geometrical curves can be adopted to form the <b>scroll</b> compressor profile such as involute of circle with variable and constant radius, algebraic spiral, and so on, to improve the performance of <b>scroll</b> compressor. This study proposes a new <b>scroll</b> profile design using elliptic involute and two-envelope method {{to create a new}} conjugate meshing <b>scroll</b> of variable cross section. The curve of the <b>scroll</b> section on both sides can be specified as an arbitrary mathematical function. First, the base <b>scroll</b> swept out by the central base circle. Next, the base circle translation path envelope of the planet <b>scroll</b> is moved by the basic involute curve. The base circle translation path envelope is the first envelope. The second envelope generated by the planet <b>scroll</b> conjugate profile is the fixed <b>scroll.</b> By using two-envelope method, the variety of conjugate <b>scroll</b> can be produce with the cross section and symmetrical variables for parametric design...|$|R
5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than <b>scrolling</b> levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and <b>scrolling</b> beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for <b>scrolling</b> and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial <b>scrolling</b> was added, making the <b>scrolling</b> experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E

40|$|The <b>scroll</b> wraps of a <b>scroll</b> {{compressor}} play a {{very important}} role in the compressor’s efficiency due to their impact on leakage and leakage irreversibilities. In this work, a short summary of the <b>scroll</b> compressor geometry is presented. Using the geometry of the <b>scroll</b> wraps, an optimal <b>scroll</b> wrap geometry is derived for a given set of constraints on compressor displacement, <b>scroll</b> wrap thickness and volume ratio. This optimal <b>scroll</b> wrap geometry {{can be used as a}} starting point for further optimization in a detailed compressor model that includes the effects of mechanical losses. 1...|$|R
50|$|Some Orthodox {{insist that}} a <b>scroll</b> of haftarot is not sufficient, nor the <b>scroll</b> of an {{individual}} prophetic book, but require a <b>scroll</b> of the entire Prophetic segment of the Bible (Sefer Navi), which is relatively uncommon, although some would allow such a <b>scroll</b> to be written in ordinary ink or on ordinary paper (unlike Torah <b>scrolls),</b> and if such a <b>scroll</b> is unavailable the entire congregation must read the haftarah for themselves, silently or in a murmur, from books rather than the maftir reciting aloud from {{something other than a}} <b>scroll.</b>|$|R
5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} <b>scrolling</b> effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax <b>scrolling</b> without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E

5000|$|When the <b>scrolls</b> {{were first}} {{completed}} and kept at the Kasuga shrine, the <b>scrolls</b> were carefully protected—with no shrine priest or Kōfukuji monk less than 40 {{years of age}} able to view the <b>scrolls.</b> Moreover, if the <b>scrolls</b> were required at Kōfukuji, {{it was only the}} Tōbokuin sanctuary that was permitted to receive the <b>scrolls.</b> However, for a while, during the late 18th Century, the <b>scrolls</b> became less carefully looked after. The <b>scrolls</b> were most likely treated more casually because of the decline suffered by Kasuga and Kōfukuji at the time.|$|R
25|$|<b>Scrolls</b> can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the <b>scroll</b> around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core <b>scroll</b> has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} <b>scroll,</b> the entire <b>scroll</b> must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the <b>scroll</b> around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double <b>scroll,</b> the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the <b>scroll</b> not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the <b>scroll</b> a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|R

40|$|Too {{often in}} the study of the Dead Sea <b>Scrolls</b> the {{relationship}} between the Temple <b>Scroll</b> and the sectarian <b>scrolls</b> is dismissed as minimal, or non-existent due to one of two general lines of reasoning. The first line of reasoning begins with the premise that whereas the Temple <b>Scroll</b> is concerned for the most part with laws pertaining to the construction and maintenance of the ideal Temple the sectarian <b>scrolls</b> are concerned with the laws pertaining to a particular community or communities. It is assumed that, just as the Temple <b>Scroll</b> shows no concern with the creation or maintenance of a community without a Temple, so too the sectarian <b>scrolls</b> betray little or no interest with the running of the Temple. The second line of reasoning assumes that a relationship may exist, but in this case the Temple <b>Scroll</b> is seen as prescribing an eschatological ideal, whether this is the Temple or the Law for the Land. My thesis contends that the relationship between the Temple <b>Scroll</b> and the sectarian <b>scrolls</b> is both immediate and intimate. It argues that the specific world-view introduced by the Temple <b>Scroll</b> is evident in the sectarian <b>scrolls</b> and that this very world-view is essential for creating the framework upon which the way of life prescribed in the sectarian <b>scrolls</b> is modeled...|$|R
