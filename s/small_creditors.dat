40|$|Within {{the next}} couple of months, the Greek government, is {{supposed}} to persuade private creditors holding about EUR 200 bn in its bonds to voluntarily exchange their existing bonds for new bonds that pay roughly 50 percent less. This may work with large creditors whose failure to participate in a debt exchange could trigger a Greek default, but may not persuade <b>smaller</b> <b>creditors,</b> who will be told that their claims will continue to be fully serviced if they do not participate in the exchange. This paper proposes an approach to dealing with this free rider problem that exploits the fact that with some probability, the proposed exchange might be followed by an involuntary restructuring some time in the future. The idea is to design the new bonds that creditors are offered in the exchange in a way that make them much harder to restructure than the current Greek government bonds. This is easy to do because the vast majority of outstanding Greek government bonds lack standard creditor protections. Hence, creditors would be offered a bond that performs much worse than their current bond if things go according to plan, but much better if things do not. They will accept this instrument if (1) the risk of a new Greek debt restructuring in the medium term is sufficiently high; and (2) there is an expectation that the next restructuring probably will not be voluntary...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{insolvency}} law, the transaction avoidance regime protects creditors from improper actions of insolvent debtors. There is however increasing public awareness that the solvency of <b>small</b> business <b>creditors</b> may be stretched by actions of their larger debtors. This undermines governmental measures to support small businesses. It also has negative implications for the transaction avoidance regime, which has undergone expansion through the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 reforms. The value of these reforms is deflated where small businesses have entered administration/liquidation because their finances have been overborne by the trading practices of larger partners, and established insolvency law remedies for overturning transactions cannot be invoked to return any lost value to the estate. The absence of such remedies, together with the weakness of other mechanisms relied on {{for the protection of}} smaller businesses, lead this paper to propose that tenets of transaction avoidance law offer a route to discerning circumstances in which contractual arrangements with large counterparties should be unravelled in the interests of strengthening the protection of small businesses...|$|R

We develop a model in which a large creditor {{and a group of}} <b>small</b> <b>creditors</b> independently decide, based on private signals of fundamentals, whether to foreclose on a loan. In the absence of common knowledge of fundamentals, the incidence of failure is uniquely determined. Comparative statics on the unique equilibrium provides simple characterization of the role of large creditors. Our results show that the smaller the large creditor is, the more vulnerable the debtor is to premature foreclosure. We also find that information of relatively high precision available to the large creditor reduces the probability of failure. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} empirically {{established}} that {{the differences in the}} lending rates charged by traditional and large lenders to large versus <b>small</b> <b>creditors</b> can be largely attributed to differences in information opacity (Dietrich, 2012; Holmes et. al. 1994). The greater the information possessed by the creditor, the lower the rate charged to the borrower, suggesting again that a risk premium is being charged for information opacity. Securitizing debt with collateral can reduce the lending rate charged, however differences in the rates charged cannot be fully explained by information opacity or availability of collateral. This dual study approach aims at increasing the understanding of loan pricing determinants. The first study uses data from the UK Survey of SME Finances, 2007 to explore factors internal and external to the firm that are significant in influencing credit prices, providing insight on why credit prices fluctuate from firm to firm. The second study uses interviews with firm owners in the Toronto computer animation and visual effects (CA&VFX) industries to effectively capture the intricacies and gain insight on the nuances involved in the pricing of credit for firms in these industries. The results of the first study suggest that the use of collateral, loan amount, loan duration, and firm size are significant credit pricing influencers while a firm’s strategic orientation, specifically product innovation and propensity to export, are of little importance. Results from the second study suggest that firm owner perceptions generally align with the extant literature on collateralization and relationships with lenders...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{a number}} of issues caused by informational asymmetries between firms and investors. It looks at two {{situations}} where problems arise because of asymmetric information, and examines possible solutions, and presents one case where asymmetric information is the solution to a problem. The first situation developed in chapter two provides a theoretical explanation based on reputational concerns for why certification intermediaries like rating agencies may exhibit excess sensitivity to the business cycle and for differences in ratings across agencies. It also analyses how competition in this industry affects the behaviour of these intermediaries and how this depends on reputational disparities among the different competitors. Chapter three looks at the impact of auditor rotation on the gathering and disclosure of information about projects taking into account that longer auditor tenures can generate substantial savings in information collection costs but also make auditors more willing to preserve future expected rents and private benefits. It also shows that the regulation of auditing procedures becomes less relevant if accounting transparency increases. In contrast with the previous two cases, the next chapter finds that co-ordination failures among <b>small</b> <b>creditors</b> during debt renegotiation can be mitigated by the presence of a large and more informed creditor or by a voting requirement. It examines how the strength of these effects depends on the relative precision of private information of the small and large creditors and provides a rationale for a diversified capital structure based on the informational role that some creditors might have in case of financial distress...|$|E

It begins by considering the case of unilateral debt forgiveness; such forgiveness {{is only in the}} mutual interest of creditors and debtors if the country is {{on the wrong side of}} fhe "debt Laffer curve".

It is outlined under what conditions firms can improve the outcome of their financial decisions by choosing seniority structure. The main reason for issuing debt contracts with different priority is that in case of financial distress firms only have to renegotiate with a <b>smaller</b> number of <b>creditors.</b> This outcome makes observation of the firm`s condition by creditors more likely. If observation occurs seniority decreases observation costs. But observation can also harm the owner so that seniority could be inferior to a debt structure which treats all creditors identically. Later on we introduce a financial intermediary into the model. It is outlined how a financial intermediary can be welfare improving on the junior level.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} what differences there are between a credit union that is connected to Sweden’s Credit Association and an independent association, and how these differences have affected the union’s success.   Method: A qualitative study has been made by means of email and telephone interviews. Respondents were chosen from Sweden’s Credit Association, Credit Guarantee Association in Gävleborg and Övre Norrland Guarantee Association. The interviews were then analyzed {{in the light of}} our theoretical studies.   Result and conclusions: We have found that there are three major differences between the unions. One difference is the area they operate in, Övre Norrland credit union has an advantage in operating in a sparsely populated area where demand for these compounds is greater. The second difference is how unions are organized, we have concluded that there is not an advantage to belong to Sweden’s Credit Association. The third major difference we see is the risk awareness among unions, associations that are connected to Sweden Guarantee Association are experiencing {{a false sense of security}} and thereby take risks affecting the business.   Suggestions for future research: In this work the guarantee association in Gävleborg represents all affiliated unions to the Swedish association. A further study could include more of the compounds that are connected to Sweden's Credit Association, in order to get more width in the work. Another suggestion for further research in this area is to investigate members and banks views on credit unions, in order to see how knowledge and awareness of these associations differ between different regions.       Contribution of the thesis: The essay has increased the understanding of the factors that may be crucial to the success of this type of organizations. We have found that the management of credit guarantee associations must be involved in managing the business and establish guidelines. They must also ensure that employees are risk aware and not take unnecessary risks.   Key words: Credit Guarantee, <b>small</b> businesses, <b>creditors,</b> assets, organizational structure...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the twenty}} largest public company {{bankruptcy}} filings from 1980 to the present, seventeen {{have taken place}} since 2001, and ten of those seventeen were filed between March of 2007 and August of 2009. One such example is In re Chrysler LLC, in which Chrysler, on April 30, 2009, filed for protection under Title 11 of the United States Code. For the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2008, the Chrysler companies suffered a staggering $ 16. 8 billion loss. The failure of such large companies {{and the distribution of}} their enormous wealth of assets have and will continue to have major repercussions. The Bankruptcy Code provides these massive businesses with different options for filing bankruptcy, and these options have reverberating economic and societal effects well beyond any one company’s interests. It is thus essential to understand the options provided by the Bankruptcy Code and to ensure they provide for the most advantageous possible outcomes when America’s foundational businesses collapse. While Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code is the traditional guide for corporate reorganization and the payment of creditors over time, Chrysler—following the current corporate trend—chose to proceed pursuant to § 363. Section 363 (b) of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession, such as Chrysler, to “use, sell, or lease” estate property outside the ordinary course of business. Section 363 sales tend to be cheaper and more time efficient than reorganization alternatives. Accordingly, in the last twenty-five years, § 363 (b) asset sales have become standard practice in large corporate bankruptcies. “Proponents of the Chapter 11 liquidation method into which § 363 has evolved extol the speed, efficiency, and competition involved in the sales as indications of its superiority over a more traditional reorganization. ” This trend toward use of § 363 (b) is likely to grow as poor economic conditions continue to increase creditor control over reorganization and {{because of the lack of}} available financing to debtors, both of which tend to fuel § 363 (b) sales. Thus, the “side door” of § 363 (b) may soon “replace the main route of Chapter 11 reorganizations. ” Considering current declining economic conditions, the massive amounts of wealth at stake, and the modern prevalence of § 363 sales in large-scale corporate bankruptcy proceedings, it is prudent to ensure that § 363 (b) provides a competent and just medium to protect the diverse interests of all relevant parties and society as a whole. While § 363 sales, on paper, appear to be the ideal way to maximize value for secured creditors, preserve the going concerns of businesses, and keep workers on the job, there is a well-founded fear that quick asset sales run the risk of circumventing the Chapter 11 process. In re Chrysler LLC highlights the concerns of courts and academics that § 363 fails to adequately protect the interests of companies’ smaller debt and equity holders and ignores some of the fundamental bankruptcy principles and protections. Part II of this Note provides the basic framework of the Chrysler bankruptcy agreement for the purposes of analyzing § 363 and the business justification standard. Part III details the development of § 363 (b) and three of the primary dangers that exist with § 363 (b) asset sales under business justification analysis. Part III then uses the In re Chrysler LLC case to highlight the issues in practice. The first issue is § 363 (b) sales’ vulnerability to construction as “sub rosa” sales, which serve the same purpose of reorganizations but avoid Chapter 11 protection requirements. The second issue is § 363 (b) sales’ potential to allow powerful creditors too much influence and control, thereby subordinating and possibly defeating the protected interests of <b>smaller</b> <b>creditors.</b> The third issue is § 363 sales’exceedingly low return values for the assets sold off in spite of their intended purpose of maximizing decreasing values. Part IV addresses the current standard for approving § 363 (b) sales, the business justification rule, and how the rule wrongly facilitates the approval of dubious asset sales. Part V discusses academic theories for reform of the current business judgment standard as well as its implementation in other areas of the law. Lastly, Part VI synthesizes the differing approaches to the business justification standard and offers a refined framework for assessing § 363 asset sales...|$|R

40|$|This study uses probate {{records to}} explore gender {{patterns}} in testamentary customs from 1800 to 1860 {{as well as}} heretofore-unexamined shifts in testamentary relationships {{between men and women}} in the mid- 1800 s. ^ In western Massachusetts, beginning in the 1830 s, fathers favored wives and daughters over sons as their primary beneficiaries. This finding counters conventional wisdom that nineteenth-century fathers preferred to bequeath property to sons. Fathers 2 ̆ 7 favoring wives and daughters as heirs, plus increasing numbers of “sole and separate” bequests to women, indicates that men protected women with bequests well before the passage of Married Women 2 ̆ 7 s Property Acts in the 1840 s and 1850 s, so this cultural change predated changes in the law. One possible explanation for favoring female beneficiaries is that sons were devaluing themselves as heirs by emigrating, thereby making themselves unavailable for supporting widowed mothers and dependent sisters. Another explanation might be that fathers had already made premortem land grants to sons, reserving only the residue for female heirs. A less quantifiable possibility is that propertied and prudent fathers may have had rising respect for women at a time when men 2 ̆ 7 s character issues such as debt and drinking were a target of public concern. “Sole and separate” bequests, which protected married women 2 ̆ 7 s property from husbands and husbands 2 ̆ 7 creditors, suggest that men 2 ̆ 7 s debt and/or character were primary areas of willmakers 2 ̆ 7 concern. ^ This evidence, along with declining bequests of dower thirds, shows that men challenged socioeconomic traditions to benefit female heirs. If it is true, as Marylynn Salmon asserts, that “control over property is an important baseline for learning how men and women share power in the family,” then testators were engaged in a redistribution of power in western Massachusetts from 1830 to 1860. 1 ^ Finally, because women favored female heirs from 1800 to 1860, property women acquired tended to remain in women 2 ̆ 7 s hands, and because many women served as moneylenders in <b>small</b> towns where <b>creditors</b> were often individuals, women wielded economic influence behind the scenes. ^ 1 Marylynn Salmon, Women and the Law of Property in Early America (1986), xii. ...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the centuries}} {{it became clear}} that sovereigns and states very often do not abide by their {{contractual}} undertakings either because they are unable to do so or because they are merely unwilling due to some or other whim or political reason. Examples of such actions can be found as far back as in the days of Dionysius of Syracuse and Phillip II of Spain, where the person in question either devalued the currency when he was pushed for payment or simply changed the terms of the agreement, amended interest rates and declared a debt standstill when it did not suit him to continue with payment. The reliance on reprisals and attachment of the person or goods of even the citizens of the country involved to ensure that the principle of pacta sunt servanda was properly adhered to continued until the early 1900 s, when it was thought that less violent methods should rather be used to force a sovereign to comply with its obligations. Gunboat diplomacy was no longer {{the order of the day}} and it was left to the creditors to rely on the courts for enforcement of their debts. If an individual or corporation were to renege on their obligations or indicate that they are no longer able to service their debts, insolvency proceedings exist that could be utilised in order to ensure that the creditors are treated equally and are paid. This option is not available in international law: there are no customary international law principles relating to insolvency that can be used to assist the creditors of sovereign debtors. In the past, ad hoc procedures were used to assist the so-called highly indebted poor countries via loans from the International Monetary Fund, negotiations through the Paris and London Clubs, debt restructuring and eventually mainly debt relief. The current situation in Europe is again calling for the establishment of an international insolvency regime that would be applicable to all states. The use of specific clauses in contracts (eg collective action clauses) assists only a <b>small</b> group of <b>creditors</b> and then only the super-majority of those; a code of conduct; the creation of an international insolvency tribunal or even an arbitration tribunal are also possible solutions that can be considered, even the conclusion of a treaty in terms of which these problems can be solved. However, no matter what, if politics do not take a back seat in this car, nothing is going to change. States have to keep to their obligations: it is their contractual and moral duty. Instead of dealing with the problems that arise after a state's insolvency, the focus should be on prevention. Why should a state end up in a situation where it cannot service its debts? Is the provision of credit too cheap? Are the risks properly quantified? The rule normally is that the lower the risk the cheaper the credit and vice versa. Are creditors insisting on the provision of proper security? Is the international community prepared to assist creditors in enforcing their rights against sovereigns in national courts? Unless there is a movement back to the principles of the law and pacta sunt servanda is rigorously enforced, we are not going to have legal certainty in dealings with sovereigns; and unless the international community is going to be prepared to refrain from falling back on politics, there will not be an easy answer and solution to the problem of state bankruptcies...|$|R
