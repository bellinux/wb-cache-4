40|$|As a {{renewable}} energy, {{the assessment}} of wave power potential around a country is crucial. Knowledge of the temporal and spatial variations of wave energy is required for locating a wave power plant. This study investigates the variations in wave power at 19 locations covering the Indian <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> using the ERA-Interim dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The ERA-Interim data is compared with the measured wave parameters in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Along the western <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> of India, the seasonal oscillations lead to variation of the wave power from the lowest seasonal mean value (2. 6 kW/m) in the post-monsoon period (October-January) to the highest value (25. 9 kW/m) in the south-west monsoon (June-September) period. Significant (10 to 20 %) inter-annual variations are detected at few locations. The mean annual wave power along the eastern Indian <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> (2. 6 - 9. 9 kW/m) {{is lower than the}} mean annual wave power along the western part (7. 9 - 11. 3 kW/m). The total annual mean wave power available along the western <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> of India is around 19. 5 GW. Along the eastern <b>shelf</b> <b>seas,</b> it is around 8. 7 GW. In the Indian <b>Shelf</b> <b>seas,</b> the annual mean wave power is highest (11. 3 kW/m) at the southern location (location 11), and the seasonal variation in wave power is also less. Hence, location 11 is a better location for a wave power plant in the Indian <b>shelf</b> <b>seas...</b>|$|R

50|$|Region of Freshwater Influence (ROFI), a term {{coined by}} Prof. John Simpson of the University of Wales, Bangor, and co-authors, in 1993 in Oceanologica Acta for the Rhine river plume. The term refers to regions where rivers debouch into {{estuaries}} and coastal shelf seas where the currents patterns {{are governed by}} density differences between salt sea water and fresh river water. In other words, a ROFI is the region between the <b>shelf</b> <b>sea</b> regime and the estuary where the local input of freshwater buoyancy from the coastal source is comparable with, or exceeds, the seasonal input of buoyancy as heat which occurs all over the shelf. Americans usually use the term river plume where Europeans use ROFI.|$|E

There is some suggestion of strengthening of stratification beyond the normal inter-annual variability.

40|$|The Arctic Ocean, in {{particular}} the wide Eurasian <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> comprise {{some of the most}} sensitive elements of the global environment which are believed to respond at a very early time to Global Change. The renewed interest in the Arctic, the large scale international research efforts devoted to the Arctic, as well as the presently available new technology to carry out research in ice-infested areas, have opened many new avenues to conduct investigations on the variability of the depositional environments of the Eurasian <b>shelf</b> <b>seas.</b> The Laptev Sea is of particular importance in the string of the Eurasian <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> because feeding the Transpolar Drift of the Arctic sea-ice cover it exports relatively the largest amounts of sea ice into the open Arctic Ocean, because it is farthest away from the influence of the Atlantic and Pacific waters, and because it is under the influence of rapidly changing fresh water fluxes from the Siberian hinterland. The morphology of the seafloor, the rapidly changing coast lines of the fragil Lena Delta Island frame work as well as the presence of submarine permafrost are examples for the dynamics of the entire Laptev Sea System.

50|$|The Norwegian Sea {{was formed}} about 250 million years ago, when the Eurasian plate of Norway and the North American Plate, {{including}} Greenland, {{started to move}} apart. The existing narrow <b>shelf</b> <b>sea</b> between Norway and Greenland began to widen and deepen. The present continental slope in the Norwegian Sea marks the border between Norway and Greenland as it stood approximately 250 million years ago. In the north it extends east from Svalbard and on the southwest between Britain and the Faroes. This continental slope contains rich fishing grounds and numerous coral reefs. Settling of the shelf after {{the separation of the}} continents has resulted in landslides, such as the Storegga Slide about 8,000 years ago that induced a major tsunami.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{change and}} global warming {{reflects}} {{the notion of the}} modern climate. The changes of climate over the past century, have been attributed to various factors which have resulted in a global warming. This warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Some effects on both the natural environment and human life are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the IPCC suggests that glacier retreat, ice shelf disruption such as that of the Larsen Ice <b>Shelf,</b> <b>sea</b> level rise, changes in rainfall patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are attributable in part to global warming. Other expected effects include water scarcity in some regions and increased precipitation in others, changes in mountain snowpack, and adverse health effects from warmer temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The general {{circulation}} in the North Sea and Skagerrak is simulated using the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Although HYCOM was originally de- veloped for simulations {{of the open}} ocean, it has a design which should make it applicable also for coastal and shallow <b>shelf</b> <b>seas.</b> Thus, {{the objective of this}} study has been to examine the skills of the present version of HYCOM in a coastal shelf application, and to identify the areas where HYCOM needs to be further developed. To demonstrate the capability of the vertical coordinate in HYCOM, three exper- iments with different configurations of the vertical coordinate were carried out. In general, the results from these experiments compares quite well with in situ and satellite data, and the water masses and the {{general circulation}} in the North Sea and Skagerrak is reproduced in the simulations. Differences between the three experiments are small compared to other errors, which are related to a combined effect of model setup and properties of the vertical mixing scheme. Hence, it is difficult to quantify which vertical coordinate configuration works best for the coastal region. It is concluded that HYCOM can be used for simulations of coastal and <b>shelf</b> <b>seas,</b> and further suggestions for improving the model results are given. Since HYCOM also works well in open ocean and basin scale simulations, it may allow for a realistic modelling of the transition region between the open ocean and coastal <b>shelf</b> <b>seas...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Shelf</b> <b>seas</b> are an {{important}} global carbon sink. In the seasonal thermocline, the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) supports almost half of summer shelf production. Using observations from the seasonally stratified Celtic Sea (June 2010), we identify wind-driven inertial oscillations as a mechanism for supplying the SCM with the nitrate needed for phytoplankton growth and carbon fixation. Analysis of wind, currents, and turbulent dissipation indicates that inertial oscillations are triggered by {{a change in the}} wind velocity. High magnitude, short-lived dissipation spikes occur when the shear and wind vectors align, increasing the daily nitrate flux to the SCM by a factor of at least 17. However, {{it is likely that the}} sampling resolution of turbulent dissipation does not always capture the maximum wind-driven peak in mixing. We estimate that wind-driven inertial oscillations supply the SCM with ~ 33 % to 71 % of the nitrate required for new production in <b>shelf</b> <b>seas</b> during summer...|$|R
50|$|The lake is of glacial-tectonic {{origin and}} is a small remnant of a larger body of water which existed in this area during an Ice Age. In {{geologic}} terms, the lake is rather young, formed - like almost all lakes in northern Europe - through the carving activity of the inland ice sheets {{in the latter part}} of the last Ice Age, about 12,000 years ago: In the Paleozoic Era (300-400 million years ago) the entire territory of the modern basin of the lake was covered with a <b>shelf</b> <b>sea</b> lying near the ancient, near-equatoric Baltic continent. Sediments at that time - sandstone, sand, clay and limestone - form a 200-meter thick layer covering the Baltic Shield which consists of granite, gneiss and greenstone. The retreat of the Ice Age glaciers formed the Littorina Sea. Its level was first 7-9 meters higher than at present, but it gradually lowered, thereby decreasing the sea area and forming several lakes in the Baltic region.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the parish}} is {{dominated}} by Carboniferous deposits deposited on the submarine platform of the Askrigg Block, which was a relatively high area forming a <b>shelf</b> <b>sea</b> buoyed up by Devonian Wensleydale Granite. It is separated from the Craven Basin {{to the south and}} west by the Craven Fault system. The lower Carboniferous deposits are dominated by the 200 m thick Great Scar limestones laid down during the Viséan stage. A mature karst landscape has formed where it outcrops, with bare limestone pavements, subterranean streams, and major solutional cave systems such as White Scar Caves and Meregill Hole. Scales Moor on the Whernside flanks of Chapel-le-Dale has one of the largest exposures of pavement in the Dales, measuring some 4 km long 800 m wide. On Whernside and Ingleborough above the flat plateau formed by the top of the Great Scar limestone, are the Brigantian and Namurian aged Yoredale cyclothem sequences of sandstone, limestone, and shales which were deposited {{on the edge of a}} huge delta. The upper ramparts of these hills are capped by thick beds of Grassington Grit, a course poorly-sorted sandstone laid down in shallower water as the delta prograded south.|$|E
5000|$|The northeastern active fold belt of Iran, the Kopet Dagh, {{is formed}} on the Hercynian metamorphosed {{basement}} at the southwestern {{margin of the}} Turan Platform. The belt is composed of about 10 kilometres of Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments (mostly carbonates) and, like the Zagros, was folded into long linear northwest-southeast trending folds during the last phase of the Alpine Orogeny, in the Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene time. No magmatic rocks are exposed in Kopet Dagh except {{for those in the}} basement in the Aghdarband and some Triassic basic dikes. This basin was located in the northeastern Iran. From Middle Jurassic, it was covered with a vast continental <b>shelf</b> <b>sea.</b> In this period of time and due to transgression as well as rapid subsidence basin, the western part became deeper. In this basin, a thick sequence of continuous marine and continental sediments was deposited (about 10 km). No major sedimentary gap or volcanic activities during Jurassic to Miocene have ever been reported. This sedimentary complex provides suitable conditions for accumulation of hydrocarbons. Kopet Dagh sedimentary rocks were placed in their current position due to uplifting {{at the end of the}} Miocene. The Kopet Dag Range, itself, is made chiefly of Cretaceous rocks with a smaller portion of Jurassic rocks in the southeastern parts. The mountains were mainly formed in the Miocene during the Alpine orogeny. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise rotation of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed against the Turan Platform. This collision folded the entire rocks that had been deposited in this geosyncline or basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene and formed the Kopet Dag Mountains.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{methods to}} predict the {{effects of climate change}} on the biomass and {{production}} of marine communities are predicated on modelling the interactions and dynamics of individual species, a very challenging approach when interactions and distributions are changing and {{little is known about the}} ecological mechanisms driving the responses of many species.

These capture the properties of food webs that describe energy flux and production at a particular size, independent of species' ecology. We couple a physical-biogeochemical model with a dynamic, size-based food web model {{to predict the}} future effects of climate change on fish biomass and production in 11 large regional <b>shelf</b> <b>seas,</b> with and without fishing effects.
