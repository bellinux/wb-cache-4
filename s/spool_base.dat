40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to study the}} static pressure distribution among the layers of an optical fiber cable <b>spool</b> <b>based</b> on the force analysis of the cable system. Using the distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technique, the static pressures within the fiber cable layers of the spool were measured according to the Bragg wavelength shifts of the FBGs embedded in the cable. The effects of the cable spool shrinkage owing to the pressure from outer fiber cable layers on the cable tension and the radial pressure were analyzed in detail. As a result, {{the relationship between the}} applied static pressure upon the fiber and the resulted Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG was deduced. The static pressure distribution of the fiber optical cable spool is obtained both in theory and experiment. Theoretical simulations coincide with experimental results. This technology provides us a real-time method to monitor the inner pressure among the fiber cable layers during the optical cable winding process...|$|R

40|$|Within the Oil industry, subsea {{pipelines}} {{are used}} to transport hydrocarbons from one location to another. After the installation of a subsea pipeline, the final connection between the pipeline ant the interconnecting facilities are done by using tie-in spools. In principle, tie-in spools serve two purposes. First, it needs to provide an interface that bridges the inaccuracies associated with offshore pipeline installation. Inaccuracies related to pipeline installation are numerous, but {{can be related to}} the existing seabed infrastructure, orientation/position of the tie-in facilities with respect to pipeline installation vessel, bathymetry & soil accuracy of data among others. These factors cause the tie-in spool to be measured, fabricated and installed after the pipeline has been laid in order to make up the connection. Secondly, the tie-in spool needs to be a flexible element as pipelines expands during operational conditions because of heat and pressure differences between installation and operational stages. By the tie-in spool being flexible, the forces in connectors are reduced in order to ensure safe transportation of hydrocarbons. These key requirements can have significant impact of the overall cost of a project as they will affect all necessary operations related to tie-in spools. This report assesses key requirements related to tie-in spools by a detailed review about issues related to the design, fabrication, installation and operation of tie-in spools. By presenting details from the design of an actual installed tie-in spool in the southern North Sea this is sought achieved. By presenting a tie-in spool and its important design parameters, load steps that it is subjected to, and the results from loading analysis it is wanted to educate about the importance of tie-in spools. A modification of the tie-in spool where done to develop a simple technique to quickly assess the preliminary design/configuration of a tie-in <b>spool</b> <b>based</b> on bending moment capacity of the associated connector. The design parameters, such as pipeline expansion, where extracted from the presented tie-in analysis. Four different analysis methods where used in order to give recommendations on which method are most suited for spool piece analysis. By comparing results with the actual installed spool, calculated results showed that three methods can be suited for simplified spool piece analysis. In order to qualify one of the analysis methods, a downscaled tie-in <b>spool</b> was manufactured <b>based</b> on the modified spool. By innovative use of simple mechanical equipment, the tie-in spool was applied pipeline expansion via a winch. The bending moment in the connector where measured using an adjustable torque wrench. Measured bending moment was compared to the analysis methods and by comparison it was evident that numbers did not correlate. Due to this, no further recommendation on suitable analysis method could be given. A search for possible error sources contributing to no correlation was conducted. It is also proposed further development of experiment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeakage due to wear {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of aero-hydraulic spool valves. This paper {{established}} a practical coupling wear model for aero-hydraulic <b>spool</b> valves <b>based</b> on dynamic system modelling theory. Firstly, the experiment for wear mechanism verification proved that adhesive wear and abrasive wear did coexist during the working process of spool valves. Secondly coupling behavior of each wear mechanism was characterized by analyzing actual time-variation of model parameters during wear evolution process. Meanwhile, Archard model and three-body abrasive wear model were utilized for adhesive wear and abrasive wear, respectively. Furthermore, their coupling wear model was established by calculating the actual wear volume. Finally, from the result of formal test, all the required parameters for our model were obtained. The relative error between model prediction and data of pre-test was also presented to verify the accuracy of model, which demonstrated that our model was useful for providing accurate prediction of spool valve’s wear life...|$|R
40|$|Pyrotechnics {{accomplish}} many functions {{on today}} 2 ̆ 7 s spacecraft, possessing minimum volume/weight, providing instantaneous operation on demand, and requiring little input energy. However, functional shock, safety, and overall system cost issues, combined with emergence {{and availability of}} new technologies question their continued use on space missions. Upon request from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (NASA) Program Management Council (PMC), Langley Research Center (LaRC) conducted a survey to identify and evaluate state-of-the-art nonexplosively actuated (NEA) alternatives to pyrotechnics, identify NEA devices planned for NASA use, and investigate potential interagency cooperative efforts. In this study, over 135 organizations were contacted, including NASA field centers, Department of Defense (DOD) and other government laboratories, universities, and American and European industrial sources resulting in further detailed discussions with over half, and 18 face-to-face briefings. Unlike their single use pyrotechnic predecessors, NEA mechanisms are typically reusable or refurbishable, allowing flight of actual tested units. NEAs surveyed include spool-based devices, thermal knife, Fast Acting Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN), paraffin actuators, and shape memory alloy (SMA) devices (e. g., Frangibolt). The electro-mechanical spool, paraffin actuator and thermal knife are mature, flight proven technologies, while SMA devices have a limited flight history. There is a relationship between shock, input energy requirements, and mechanism functioning rate. Some devices (e. g., Frangibolt and <b>spool</b> <b>based</b> mechanisms) produce significant levels of functional shock. Paraffin, thermal knife, and SMA devices can provide gentle, shock-free release but cannot perform critically timed, simultaneous functions. The FASSN flywheel-nut release device possesses significant potential for reducing functional shock while activating nearly instantaneously. Specific study recommendations include: (1) development of NEA standards, specifically in areas of material characterization, functioning rates, and test methods; (2) a systems level approach to assure successful NEA technology application; and (3) further investigations into user needs, along with industry/government system-level real spacecraft cost benefit trade studies to determine NEA application foci and performance requirements. Additional survey observations reveal an industry and government desire to establish partnerships to investigate remaining unknowns and formulate NEA standards, specifically those driven by SMAs. Finally, there is increased interest and need to investigate alternative devices for such functions as stage/shroud separation and high pressure valving. This paper summarizes results of the NASA-LaRC survey of pyrotechnic alternatives. State of-the-art devices with their associated weight and cost savings are presented. Additionally, a comparison of functional shock characteristics of several devices are shown, and potentially related technology developments are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Coiled tubing in {{combination}} with a downhole electric drilling motor has many advantages. The rotation speed of the drill bit can be precisely controlled. The electric conductors trans-mit downhole data with high speed and allow logging while drilling. One task within the PDT-COIL project was the integration of electric conductors into {{the wall of a}} spoolable fatigue resistant thermoplastic composite tube for electric drilling appli-cations. Up to now no fatigue resistant electric conductor solution has been available to withstand the excessive axial elongation and compression induced by <b>spooling</b> operations. <b>Based</b> on theoretical models and experimental verifications, a new type of highly elastic elec-trical conductor has been developed. A prototype has been industrially produced having 2 kV rated voltage and 20 A continuous current. This cable with a cross section of < 30 mm 2 is able to transfer over 40 kW of electric power and withstands high axial deformations. The main concept is based on synchronous radial contraction of all conductor elements when subjected to axial elongation and bending. Comparative experiments on conventional solid conductors revealed a very high degree of radial flexibility and high tensile capability of the new concept. Survival with up to 40 % elastic tensile strain has been achieved compared to 0. 1 % of conventional annealed copper. The hyperelastic conductor may function as component for energy transmission and also for powering sensors as well as actuators in intelligent composite material systems. Due to its unique axial elasticity, the complete structure can be exposed to high mechanical stress without damaging the embedded electric system...|$|R

The delivery of pipe spools {{at the right time}} in order to be installed in the site, is very important. Therefore, effective scheduling and control of the fabrication shop has a direct effect on the productivity and successfulness of the whole construction projects. This research developed a genetic algorithm (GA) in order to generate a feasible and near-optimal schedule for the operational level of pipe <b>spool</b> fabrication shop <b>based</b> on the concepts and methods of job shop scheduling problems. In the proposed algorithm, an improved chromosome representation is used to conveniently represent a schedule for the fabrication shop. Operation-based global selection and Operation-based local selection are designed to generate high-quality initial population in the initialization stage. To adapt to the special chromosome structures and the characteristics of the problem, precedence order-based crossover (POX), two-point crossover, and uniform crossover are used. In addition, different mutation operators for operation sequence part and machine assignment part of the chromosome are used. The data which consist of operations processing time, and dimension of spools and stations are collected from an industrial fabrication shop. The proposed algorithm is applied by using the collected data to obtain a feasible and near-optimal schedule for the operational level of pipe spool fabrication shop. The results showed that the productivity of the fabrication shop by using the proposed algorithm for scheduling fabrication processes has increased to 178 percent...|$|R

The main objective of this thesis is to design horizontal subsea spools at a water depth of more than 1000 m that is able to accommodate a 1 m pipeline expansion whilst complying with the limitations set by the hub capacities. An analysis was carried out for different spool shapes in order to judge their ability to accommodate the imposed loads.

40|$|Construction {{management}} is {{inextricably linked to}} the awareness and control of 3 D geometry. Progress tracking, quality assurance/quality control, and the location, movement, and assembly of materials are all critical processes that rely {{on the ability to}} monitor 3 D geometry. Therefore, advanced capabilities in site metrology and computer vision will be the foundation {{for the next generation of}} assessment tools that empower project leaders, planners, and workers. 3 D imaging devices enable the capture of the existing geometric conditions of a construction site or a fabricated mechanical or structural assembly objectively, accurately, quickly, and with greater detail and continuity than any manual measurement methods. Within the construction literature, these devices have been applied in systems that compare as-built scans to 3 D CAD design files in order to inspect the geometrical compliance of a fabricated assembly to contractually stipulated dtolerances. However, before comparisons of this type can be made, the particular object of interest needs to be isolated from background objects and clutter captured by the indiscriminate 3 D imaging device. Thus far, object of interest extraction from cluttered construction data has remained a manual process. This thesis explores the process of automated information extraction in order to improve the availability of information about 3 D geometries on construction projects and improve the execution of component inspection, and progress tracking. Specifically, the scope of the research is limited to automatically recognizing and isolating pipe spools from their cluttered point cloud scans. Two approaches are developed and evaluated. The contributions of the work are as follows: (1) A number of challenges involved in applying RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) to pipe spool recognition are identified. (2) An effective spatial search and pipe <b>spool</b> extraction algorithm <b>based</b> on local data level curvature estimation, density-based clustering, and bag-of-features matching is presented. The algorithm is validated on two case studies and is shown to successfully extract pipe spools from cluttered point clouds and successfully differentiate between the specific pipe spool of interest and other similar pipe spools in the same search space. Finally, (3) the accuracy of curvature estimation using data collected by low-cost range-cameras is tested and the viability of use of low-cost range-cameras for object search, localization, and extraction is critically assessed...|$|R
