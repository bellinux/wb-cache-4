5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make <b>stoppers</b> for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{reports of}} a sniper {{shooting}} cars along I-96 in four counties led to a federal investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25shootings had been linked to one suspect. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime <b>Stoppers</b> offered a $102,000 reward {{for information leading to}} the arrest of the perpetrator. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60charges in one case, with a second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, the suspect pleaded no contest, but mentally ill, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the bottle, {{which has}} {{remained}} the same since the 1924 redesign, the <b>stopper</b> has gone through numerous modifications. The original <b>stopper</b> was a small glass plug. The octagonal <b>stopper,</b> which became a brand signature, was instituted in 1924, when the bottle shape was changed. The 1950s gave the <b>stopper</b> a bevel cut and a larger, thicker silhouette. In the 1970s the <b>stopper</b> became even more prominent but, in 1986, it was re-proportioned so its size was more harmonious with {{the scale of the}} bottle.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stopper</b> knot (or simply <b>stopper)</b> is a knot {{that creates}} a fixed thicker point on an {{otherwise}} uniform thickness rope {{for the purpose of}} preventing unreeving: stopping the rope at that point from slipping out of a narrow passage. <b>Stopper</b> has three distinct meanings in the context of knotting and cordage. A decorative <b>stopper</b> knot may be referred to as a lanyard knot.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>stopper</b> club (German Stopselclub) is {{a social}} club, the members of which always have to carry a bottle cork or <b>stopper</b> with them.

In the 2008 murder of Eve Carson, at the time UNCCH's undergraduate student body president, a $25,000 reward had led to the killers' arrest.

25|$|The {{production}} {{of bread and}} beer were closely linked, since barley was the same key ingredient used for both, {{and most of the}} tools used in beer production, such as mortars, querns and winnowing baskets were also the same as for bread making. Archaeological evidence specific to beer making is thus uncommon, and earlier indications were that the ancient Israelites did not often drink beer. More recently, Iron Age sites in Israel have produced remains such as beer jugs, bottles, strainers and <b>stoppers,</b> all of which provide evidence that the Israelites drank beer. Nonetheless, the widespread cultivation of grapes, used primarily for winemaking, indicates that wine drinking was probably far more common than beer drinking.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the child's remains, police made a public appeal for information that could help identify her, based on items that were found with the suitcase including children's clothing and a distinctive hand-made quilt. After more than 1,200 calls to Crime <b>Stoppers,</b> one caller was able to identify the quilt as one made by the child's grandmother, who had died in 2012 believing her daughter and granddaughter were living interstate. Positive identification was achieved by comparing DNA extracted from the child's skeletal remains with DNA retained from a neonatal heel prick test. A national DNA search then linked the child's remains with the profile of her mother, the previously unidentified remains found in the Belanglo State Forest.|$|E

25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the glass stopper can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating glass <b>stoppers</b> act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|E
25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the <b>stoppers</b> to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E
25|$|As {{a wealthy}} and {{powerful}} nation with limited winemaking resources, England had a marked {{influence on the}} development of sparkling Champagne. Non-sparkling Champagne became popular in London society following the arrival of epicurean Charles de Saint-Évremond in 1661. At parties and banquets, Saint-Évremond feverishly promoted the wines of the Champagne region. Soon some of the most powerful and fashionable men of London, such as the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Buckingham as well as the Earl of Arlington were making regular orders of cases of Champagne. The wine was non-sparkling, or at least it was intended to be. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels and merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glassmakers used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than wood-fired French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of cork <b>stoppers,</b> once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted, leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly.|$|E
