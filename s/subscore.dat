In this paper we describe steps toward a simultaneous (one-stage) estimation system for constrained MIRT models, using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches to obtain the item parameters and conventional IRT computation to produce scale scores that are augmented <b>subscores.</b> Such a system would provide, in a single integrated analysis, more efficient estimates of <b>subscores</b> for mutually exclusive sets of items (“independent clustering”) that are computed by the Wainer et al. (2001) procedure, as well as <b>subscores</b> for tests in which the assignment of items to subscales is not mutually exclusive (the latter has been referred to as “multi-component mapping”). Combined with modification of a test’s item specifications to include items that more specifically measure individual skills, and multi-component mapping, useful <b>subscores</b> (or “skill scores”) may be computable from data obtained with tests very much like current large-scale assessments...|$|R

There are increasing demands to report <b>subscores</b> in educational and psychological assessments. <b>Subscores</b> provide unique information about examinees (Sinharay, Puhan & Haberman, 2011). However, {{there has been}} much debate about reporting <b>subscores</b> because <b>subscores</b> require meeting certain standards and psychometric qualities as a prerequisite to reporting them. Because there is an increasing need for improving the methods of estimating <b>subscores,</b> multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) is one of the methods to estimate <b>subscores.</b> One MIRT model is the item bi-factor model, which includes a general dimension on which all items load and specific dimensions corresponding to the subdomains from which the items come (Holzinger & Swineford’s, 1937; Gibbons & Hedeker, 1992). However, there is a challenge to interpreting the specific dimension scores in the item bi-factor model while the general dimension score is readily interpreted. The specific dimension scores are residuals from the general factor and residuals can be difficult to interpret. To solve this issue, a restricted bi-factor model was proposed in this paper. This paper contains a real data study and a simulation study to evaluate this model. The results of two studies, interpretation of the model, and practical application of the model were discussed...|$|R

If so, we reasoned that ataxia speech <b>subscores</b> should be associated with ataxia scores and involve high interobserver agreement, including those for internationally applicable Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) syllable repetition tasks (SARASRT). METHOD: Three independent paediatric neurologists and a speech therapist scored speech in 52 healthy children (mean age 10 y, range 4 - 16 y) and 40 individuals with EOA (mean age 15 y, range 5 - 34 y). We compared ataxia speech <b>subscores</b> for the association with age and ataxia scores as well as interobserver reliability. RESULTS: In healthy children, ataxia speech <b>subscores</b> were moderately associated with age (International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale [ICARS]: r=- 0. 515; SARA: r=- 0. 321; p< 0. 05) and with ataxia scores (ICARS: r= 0. 552; SARA: r= 0. 336; p< 0. 05), and revealed slight to moderate interobserver agreement (ICARS-intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0. 380; SARA-ICC: 0. 185; SARASRT-ICC: 0. 509). In EOA, speech <b>subscores</b> have a strong association with ataxia scores (ICARS: r= 0. 735; SARA: r= 0. 730; p< 0. 001) and revealed substantial to nearly perfect interobserver agreement [ICARS-ICC: 0. 812; SARA-ICC: 0. 854; SARASRT-ICC: 0. 724]. INTERPRETATION: Early-onset ataxia speech <b>subscores</b> are associated with ataxia and also reveal high interobserver agreement, including those internationally applicable to SARASRT. We conclude that SARASRT appears to be applicable for EOA databases. However, before syllable repetition tasks are included, we would advise to wait for the results published by the international Childhood Ataxia and Cerebellar Group...|$|R

We studied the lateralized effects of unilateral Vim thalamotomy and Vim DBS in ET patients. Methods Vim thalamotomy was performed in 6 patients and Vim DBS in 6.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2013. Major: Educational Psychology. Advisor: Michael C. Rodriguez. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 197 pages, appendices A-C. The importance of subscores in educational and psychological assessments is undeniable. Subscores yield diagnostic {{information that can}} be used for determining how each examinee's abilities/skills vary over different content domains. One of the most common criticisms about reporting and using subscores is insufficient reliability of subscores. This study employs a new reliability approach that allows the evaluation of between-person <b>subscore</b> reliability as well as within-person <b>subscore</b> reliability. Using this approach, the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) and multidimensional IRT (MIRT) models are compared in terms of <b>subscore</b> reliability in simulation and real data studies. Simulation conditions in the simulation study are subtest length, correlations among subscores, and number of subtests. Both unidimensional and multidimensional subscores are estimated with the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) method. <b>Subscore</b> reliability of ability estimates are evaluated in light of between-person reliability, within-person reliability, and total profile reliability. The results of this study suggest that the MIRT model performs better than the UIRT model under all simulation conditions. Multidimensional <b>subscore</b> estimation benefits from correlations among subscores as ancillary information, and it yields more reliable <b>subscore</b> estimates than unidimensional <b>subscore</b> estimation. The subtest length is positively associated with both between-person and within-person reliability. Higher correlations among subscores improve between-person reliability, while they substantially decrease within-person reliability. The number of subtests seems to influence between-person reliability slightly but it has no effect on within-person reliability. The two estimation methods provide similar results with real data as well...|$|E

Objective: To describe the development and initial results of an HVC <b>subscore</b> of the Internal Medicine In-Training Examination (IM-ITE). Design: The HVC concepts were introduced to IM-ITE authors during question development. Three physicians independently re-viewed each examination question for selection in the HVC sub-score according to 6 HVC principles. The final <b>subscore</b> was deter-mined by consensus. Data from the IM-ITE administered in October 2012 were analyzed at the program level. Setting: U. S. IM residency programs. Participants: 362 U. S. IM residency programs with IM-ITE data for at least 10 residents. Measurements: Program-level performance on the HVC <b>subscore</b> was compared with performance on the overall IM-ITE, the Dart-mouth Atlas hospital care intensity (HCI) index of the program’s primary training hospital, and residents ’ attitudes about HVC as-sessed with a voluntary survey. Results: The HVC <b>subscore</b> comprised 38 questions, including 21 (55 %) on managing conservatively when appropriate and 14 (37 %) on identifying low-value care. Of the 362 U. S.
