5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse <b>spider.</b> In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, it was shown that host Adam Savage survived a bite from the <b>spider.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This {{group of}} <b>spiders</b> {{comprises}} mostly heavy bodied, stout legged <b>spiders</b> including tarantulas, Australian funnel-web <b>spiders,</b> mouse <b>spiders,</b> and various families of <b>spiders</b> commonly called trapdoor <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] medically important <b>spiders</b> of southern Africa {{can be divided into}} neurotoxic and cytotoxic groups. The neurotoxic <b>spiders</b> belong to the genus Latrodectus (button or widow <b>spiders)</b> and the cytotoxic <b>spiders</b> are represented chiefly by the genera Cheiracanthium (sac <b>spiders)</b> and Loxosceles (violin or recluse <b>spiders)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The genus {{name is a}} {{combination}} of Agelena (Eurasian grass <b>spiders),</b> a genus of similar <b>spiders,</b> and Greek -opsis [...] "to look like". They are harmless <b>spiders.</b> Although most <b>spiders</b> use their webs to catch prey, the grass <b>spider's</b> web lacks adhesive ability. The <b>spiders</b> make up for that with their fast running.|$|R
5|$|Alien Spidy has {{a minimal}} plot. The story follows the Spidy, a <b>spider</b> {{from the planet}} Aracnia, who has crash-landed on Earth during an attempt to rescue a lady <b>spider,</b> Virgi. Spidy must locate Virgi and collect pieces of his {{spacecraft}} in order to return to Aracnia.|$|E
5|$|Alien Spidy is a {{platformer}} {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade), and PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network). It {{was developed by}} Enigma Software Productions and published by Kalypso Media. Players control an extraterrestrial <b>spider</b> who has crash-landed on Earth, as he seeks to repair his spacecraft and rescue a fellow extraterrestrial <b>spider.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. <b>Spider</b> venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for <b>spider</b> venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because <b>spider</b> silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web <b>spider</b> Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web <b>spider</b> Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web <b>spider.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow <b>spider</b> in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic <b>spider,</b> he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another <b>spider</b> (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot <b>spider</b> webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
5|$|Many horror {{films have}} {{featured}} the <b>spider,</b> including 1955's Tarantula, exploiting America's fear of atomic radiation during the nuclear arms race, the 1975 low-budget cult film The Giant <b>Spider</b> Invasion, and Kingdom of the Spiders, a 1977 film starring William Shatner, depicting {{the consequence of}} hungry spiders deprived of their natural food supply due to pesticides.|$|E
2500|$|Hobo <b>spiders</b> do {{not have}} two {{distinct}} longitudinal dark stripes on the top side of the cephalothorax, instead showing indistinct or diffused patterns. Washington <b>spiders</b> with distinct dark stripes include <b>spiders</b> from the genera Agelenopsis and Hololena and possibly some wolf <b>spiders.</b> (These <b>spiders</b> {{do not have}} common names.) ...|$|R
50|$|Wolf <b>spiders</b> {{resemble}} nursery web <b>spiders</b> (family Pisauridae), but wolf <b>spiders</b> {{carry their}} egg sacs by attaching {{them to their}} spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the wolf <b>spider's</b> eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery web <b>spiders</b> whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The recluse <b>spiders</b> {{or brown}} <b>spiders,</b> genus Loxosceles (...) , {{also known as}} fiddle-backs, violin <b>spiders,</b> or reapers, are a genus of venomous <b>spiders</b> known for their bite, which {{sometimes}} produces a characteristic set of symptoms known as loxoscelism. Recluse <b>spiders</b> are now identified {{as members of the}} family Sicariidae, having formerly been placed in their own family, the Loxoscelidae. Although recluse <b>spiders</b> have a bad reputation, they are usually not aggressive.|$|R

5|$|Species used {{to control}} <b>spider</b> mites include the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseilus californicus, and Amblyseius cucumeris, the predatory midge Feltiella acarisuga, and a {{ladybird}} Stethorus punctillum. The bug Orius insidiosus has been successfully used against the two-spotted <b>spider</b> mite and the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis).|$|E
5|$|Spiders are {{depicted}} in Indigenous Australian art, in rock and bark paintings, and for clan totems. Spiders in their webs {{are associated with}} a sacred rock in central Arnhem Land on the Burnungku clan estate of the Rembarrnga/Kyne people. Their totem design is connected with a major regional ceremony, providing a connection with neighboring clans also having <b>spider</b> totems in their rituals. Nareau, the Lord <b>Spider,</b> created the universe, according to the traditional Cosmology of Oceania's Kiribati islanders of the Tungaru archipelago (Gilbert Islands); similarly, Areop-Enap ("Old Spider") plays an important part in the creation myth of the traditional Nauru islanders of Micronesia. In the Philippines, there is a Visayan folk tale version of The <b>Spider</b> and the Fly which explains why the <b>spider</b> hates the fly.|$|E
40|$|The {{ecology of}} <b>spiders</b> (Araneae) in lowbush {{blueberry}} (Vaccinium angustifolium (Aiton)) fields in Washington County, Maine, was studied during the summers of 2000 and 2001. The abundance {{and distribution of}} <b>spiders</b> was investigated, and predation by one family of <b>spiders,</b> the wolf <b>spiders</b> (Lycosidae) was evaluated. The abundance and distribution of <b>spiders</b> was examined by capturing <b>spiders</b> using pitfall traps. Traps were set in conventionally managed, reduced input, and organic fields at different distances from the field edge (forest border or windbreak).

50|$|Epocilla is a genus of <b>spiders</b> in {{the family}} Salticidae (jumping <b>spiders).</b> These <b>spiders</b> are {{primarily}} natives of southeast Asia. As most jumping <b>spiders,</b> they hunt prey by jumping, secured to a location by a thread of silk.|$|R
5000|$|Dolomedes [...] is a genus {{of large}} <b>spiders</b> {{of the family}} Pisauridae. They are also known as fishing <b>spiders,</b> raft <b>spiders,</b> dock <b>spiders</b> or wharf <b>spiders.</b> Almost all Dolomedes species are semi-aquatic, with the {{exception}} of the tree-dwelling D. albineus of the southwestern United States. Many species have a striking pale stripe down each side of the body.|$|R
5|$|The 10th Century Saint Conrad of Constance is {{sometimes}} {{represented as a}} bishop holding a chalice with a <b>spider.</b> According to this story, while he was celebrating Easter Mass, a <b>spider</b> fell into the chalice. Ignoring the commonly-held belief {{of the time that}} all or most spiders were poisonous; as a token of faith, Conrad nevertheless drank the wine with the <b>spider</b> in it.|$|E
5|$|The Linyphiidae {{generally}} make horizontal but uneven sheets, with tangles {{of stopping}} threads above. Insects {{that hit the}} stopping threads fall onto the sheet or are shaken onto it by the <b>spider,</b> and are held by sticky threads on the sheet until the <b>spider</b> can attack from below.|$|E
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive <b>spider.</b> Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the <b>spider</b> is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the <b>spider</b> will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the <b>spider</b> may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the <b>spider</b> will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E
5000|$|Drymusa is a genus of <b>spiders</b> {{placed in}} its own family Drymusidae. They are also called false violin <b>spiders</b> or leaf-litter <b>spiders.</b> They {{resemble}} violin <b>spiders</b> (genus Loxosceles, Sicariidae), but other than these build a web. [...] Also unlike Loxosceles, which are highly venomous to man, <b>spiders</b> in Drymusidae are not believed to be harmful to humans.|$|R
25|$|The monophyly of {{the family}} Salticidae is well {{established}} through both phylogenetic and morphological analyses, but no consensus exists on what other group of <b>spiders</b> are most {{closely related to the}} jumping <b>spiders.</b> Suggested sister groups have included the oxyopids (lynx <b>spiders),</b> thomisids (crab <b>spiders),</b> clubionoids (sac <b>spiders),</b> and web-building <b>spiders.</b> A 2016 phylogenetic analysis suggests that the sister group may be a clade consisting of the families Eutichuridae and Philodromidae, although this relationship is only weakly supported.|$|R
2500|$|Theridiidae is a {{large family}} of <b>spiders,</b> {{also known as the}} tangle-web <b>spiders,</b> cobweb <b>spiders</b> and comb-footed <b>spiders.</b> The diverse family {{includes}} over 2,200 species in over 100 genera of three-dimensional space-web-builders found throughout the world. Theridiid <b>spiders</b> are entelegyne (have a genital plate in the female) araneomorph ecribellate (use sticky capture silk instead of woolly silk) <b>spiders</b> that often build tangle space webs and have a comb of serrated bristles (setae) on the tarsus of the fourth leg.|$|R
5|$|The redback <b>spider</b> {{has been}} {{historically}} {{responsible for more}} envenomations requiring antivenom than any other creature in Australia, however by 2017 the <b>spider</b> was blamed for only 250 envenomations requiring antivenom annually. Estimates {{of the number of}} people thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia range from 2,000 to 10,000. The larger female <b>spider</b> is responsible for almost all cases of redback <b>spider</b> bites. The smaller male was thought to be unable to envenomate a human, although some cases have been reported; their rarity is probably due to the male's smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs, rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking potent venom. The bite from both juvenile and mature females appears to have similar potency. The male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain. Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April, in the afternoon or evening. As the female redback is slow-moving and rarely leaves her web, bites generally occur as a result of placing a hand or other body part too close to the <b>spider,</b> such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities. Bites often also occur when a hidden <b>spider</b> is disturbed in items such as clothes, shoes, gloves, building materials, garden tools or children's outdoor toys.|$|E
5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from <b>spider</b> bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of <b>spider</b> bites may represent incorrect diagnoses, {{which would make}} it more difficult to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} or cutting the nest. If the resident <b>spider</b> eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident <b>spider</b> tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other <b>spider</b> as it re-enters the nest, or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey <b>spider</b> retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey to move out, and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E
