25|$|Mating {{outside the}} fertile window of their ovarian cycle may incur {{considerable}} costs for females, {{such as in}} time and energy usage. To counteract these costs, the male assistance hypothesis argues that females exhibit extended sexuality to obtain resources from males. These resources vary between species, but can include food, <b>social</b> <b>alliance,</b> and protection of the female and her offspring. For example, in the Trobriand tribe, men give women gifts in exchange for sexual access. From this hypothesis, three predictions can be made.|$|E
25|$|Payments {{made in the}} 20th {{century as}} reparations for damage to the Bikini Atoll and the islanders' way of life have {{elevated}} their income relative to other Marshall Island residents. It has caused some Bikini islanders to become economically dependent on the payments from the trust fund. This dependency has eroded individuals' interest in traditional economic pursuits like taro and copra production. The move also altered traditional patterns of <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> and political organization. On Bikini, rights to land and land ownership were the major factor in social and political organization and leadership. After relocation and settlement on Kili, a dual system of land tenure evolved. Disbursements from the trust fund were based in part to land ownership on Bikini and based on current land tenure on Kili.|$|E

Gladstone was associated with the Charity Organization Society's first annual report in 1870.

40|$|International audienceFrance's {{model of}} {{capitalism}} experiences a crisis with multiple aspects. First, the French model of capitalism has undergone deep reforms since the 1980 s. Second, the French political life {{is characterized by}} a political crisis: the vanishing of the space for mediation between the divergent expectations of the social groups composing the dominant social bloc. These crises are linked. First, because the institutional reforms undertaken since the 1980 s have changed French capitalism, its institutional complementarities, the profile of socio-political groups, and have contributed to destabilizing <b>social</b> <b>alliances.</b> Second, because the political crisis has pushed policy-makers to turn to institutional change as a necessary condition for opening up new spaces of mediation. This contribution surveys the main changes experienced by the French model over the past 30 years, analyses the break-up of the traditional <b>social</b> <b>alliances</b> and presents the elements of the political crisis in relation to neoliberal structural reforms...|$|R
