25|$|The Fulton surface-to-air {{recovery}} system (STARS) {{is a system}} developed in the early 1950s by CIA paramilitary officers for retrieving persons on the ground from a MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft. It uses a harness and a self-inflating balloon that carries an attached lift line. An MC-130E engages the line with its V-shaped yoke and the individual is reeled on board. Project COLDFEET was a very successful mission in 1962 in which two military officers parachuted into a remote abandoned Soviet site in the Arctic. The two were subsequently extracted by the Fulton <b>sky</b> <b>hook.</b> The team gathered evidence of advanced research on acoustical systems to detect under-ice US submarines and efforts to develop Arctic anti-submarine warfare techniques.|$|E

At Thunderballs release, there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the breathing bag, while the alternative open-circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not. It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted, with a small mouthpiece attached. For this reason, when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater, the answer was [...] "As long as you can hold your breath." ...|$|E

She is later tracked down by Robin, who, after pickpocketing it from her jacket, is allowed to read the letter.

2500|$|The album's most {{positive}} review to date came from Cameron Adams, {{writing for the}} Brisbane-based newspaper The Courier-Mail. Adams approved the band's decision {{to follow up on}} the sound of their commercially successful debut album, Conditions, marking the album as [...] "faithful" [...] in his one-word description of the album. Adams noted [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together" [...] as the album's two potential hits, describing them as [...] "better than 90-per-cent of what's in the charts and on the radio now." [...] While he felt that the album [...] "bit over-thought in parts - like they needed help to do what once came naturally to get the blasted record out", he concluded his review by stating that Thick as Thieves was [...] "undeniably strong, if lacking risks - this is everything The Temper Trap do very well indeed." [...] Also approving of the reversion to the sound of Conditions was Jules LeFevre of Australian music magazine website FasterLouder, who noted, [...] "at first glance [...] appears to be an attempt to reclaim the spotlight on the festival stages, but on closer inspection reveals a sturdy core." [...] LeFevre praised Mandagi's falsetto vocals as the album's strongest element, claiming it to be the band's [...] "edge", on top of the [...] "colossal, anthemic choruses, <b>sky</b> high <b>hooks,</b> [...] guitar lines that push and push and push and explode." [...] LeFevre continued by praising the largely guitar-driven composition of the record, in spite of Lorenzo Sillitto's exit, and commented positively on the [...] "simpler, gritter, more blues and classic rock driven" [...] guitars helmed by Joseph Greer. Contrasting to this, however, is LeFevre's sharp criticism of the album's lyricism, describing them as [...] "cringe-worthy", and disapproving of songs such as [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together", although stating that the lyrics felt [...] "comfortable" [...] in context of the music itself. Matt Collar of the American-based online music guide AllMusic noted that the departure of Sillitto and Greer's move into the role as lead guitarist had virtually no effect on the band's music. In writing a positive review for AllMusic, he also praised Mandagi's vocals as a [...] "powerful and emotive" [...] presence on the album, commenting on the [...] "scintillating" [...] combination of his vocals and the album's [...] "thick wave of electric guitars, pulsing synths, and drums", comparing the sound to the music of Cee Lo Green and The Killers. Collar additionally described Thick as Thieves as [...] "a heartfelt love letter to The Temper Trap's fans who have stuck with them since Conditions." ...|$|R
