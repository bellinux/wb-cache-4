25|$|Like other Western Romance languages, many {{varieties}} of Sardinian offer {{an example of}} sandhi where the rule of intervocalic lenition extends across word boundaries. Since it is a fully active <b>synchronic</b> rule, lenition is not normally indicated in the normal orthography.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to postulate that the long vowels and diphthongs should be counted as separate single phonemes, because they can be treated as sequences of two vowels. They are in fact historically derived from two-syllable sequences. This is easily seen in the <b>synchronic</b> co-existence of allomorphic pairs of Hawaiian forms such as kolu with -kou, both meaning 'three'.|$|E
25|$|Prefixed nouns {{distinguish}} two genders, {{masculine and}} feminine; two numbers, singular and plural; and two states, conventionally {{referred to by}} their French names as état libre (free state) and état d'annexion (annexed state) and glossed as EL and EA. Gender and number are all explicitly marked, but historical and <b>synchronic</b> sound changes have in some cases resulted in the neutralization {{of the difference between}} EL and EA.|$|E
25|$|No {{systematic}} <b>synchronic</b> {{description of}} Romansh vocabulary {{has been carried}} out so far. Existing studies usually approach the subject from a historical perspective, taking particular interest in pre-Roman substratum, archaic words preserved only in Romansh, or in loan words from German. A project to compile together all known historic and modern Romansh vocabulary is the Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun, first published in 1904, with the 13th edition currently in preparation.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, {{linguists}} analysed {{language on}} a diachronic plane, which was historical in focus. This {{meant that they}} would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language {{from the point of}} view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with Saussurean linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more <b>synchronic</b> approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.|$|E
25|$|The centum–satem {{division}} {{forms an}} isogloss in <b>synchronic</b> descriptions of Indo-European languages. It is not {{thought that the}} Proto-Indo-European language split first into centum and satem branches from which all the centum and all the satem languages, respectively, would have derived. Such a division is made particularly unlikely by the discovery that while the satem group lies generally {{to the east and}} the centum group to the west, the most eastward of the known IE language branches, Tocharian, is centum. Each of the ten branches of the Indo-European family independently developed its status as a centum or satem language.|$|E
25|$|Sociolinguistics is {{the study}} of how {{language}} is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the <b>synchronic</b> approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, Saussure {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between diachronic and <b>synchronic</b> analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the langue- parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue) from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole). Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a structural approach to language came from The Prague school, Leonard Bloomfield, Charles F. Hockett, Louis Hjelmslev, Émile Benveniste and Roman Jakobson.|$|E
25|$|Interpretation, thus, {{is not an}} act (be it {{successful}} or inherently {{condemned to}} failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since {{there are many different}} incommensurable games existing {{at the same time and}} since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in <b>synchronic</b> and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman’s logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} section of the song, the protagonist (Will Estes [...] )sees the ghost of the plane fly over the {{graveyard}} at Kenny's funeral. <b>Synchronic</b> with the lyrics relating to [...] "winter" [...] ("freeze"; [...] "no leaves on the trees") in this verse, some of the mise-en-scene is minimal. It shows his father as a family man during the day but an abusive alcoholic all the time. The line [...] "He hit me again, and again, and again" [...] {{is accompanied by a}} baseball scene, rather than visually depicting the violence of [...] "hit" [...] that the autobiographical elements suggest.|$|E

2500|$|Respectively {{equivalent}} to syntagmatic and paradigmatic are the terms [...] "diachronic" [...] and [...] "synchronic". Diachronic covers {{the sort of}} analysis that conveys a sense of traversing the highs and lows of a story, like riding the pattern of a sine wave. The second term, <b>synchronic,</b> is where the story is instead absorbed as a whole, like the pattern of a circle. Most literary analyses are <b>synchronic,</b> offering {{a greater sense of}} unity among the components of a story. Although both structural analyses convey partial information about the story, each angle of analysis delivers a different set of information.|$|E
2500|$|Fronting of vowels after palatals and j yielded dual inflectional class o : jo and a : ja, whereas palatalizations {{affected}} stem as a <b>synchronic</b> process (N sg. vlьkъ, V sg. vlьče; L sg. vlьcě).

2500|$|During the Early Bronze Age the [...] "epicampaniform style", a late {{expression}} of the Bell-Beaker culture, became spread both in Sardinia and Corsica. From this cultural period the Nuragic civilization would arise, paralleling similar architectural developments in southern Corsica, {{in such a way}} that the Gallura Nuragic facies shows a <b>synchronic</b> evolution with the Nuragic torrean civilization.|$|E
2500|$|Although nasalization as {{a feature}} also occurs in most Scottish Gaelic dialects, {{it is not}} shown in the orthography on the whole as it is <b>synchronic</b> (i.e., the result of certain types of nasals {{affecting}} a following sound), rather than the diachronic Irish type sonorization (i.e., following historic nasals). For example taigh [...] "house" [...] → an taigh [...] "the house".|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} <b>synchronic</b> lenitions {{involving}} opening, {{or loss of}} occlusion, rather than voicing is found for post-vocalic [...] in much of Tuscany, in Central Italy. Stereotypical Florentine, for example, has the [...] of /kasa/ as [...] casa 'house' in a post-pause realization, [...] in casa 'in (the) house' post-consonant, but [...] la casa 'the house' intervocalically. Word-internally, the normal realization is also : [...] buco 'hole' → [...]|$|E
2500|$|Before the 20th century, {{the term}} philology, first attested in 1716, was {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} the science of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus. Since Ferdinand de Saussure's insistence on the importance of <b>synchronic</b> analysis, however, this focus has shifted and the term [...] "philology" [...] is now generally used for the [...] "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in the United States (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the [...] "science of language").|$|E
2500|$|<b>Synchronic</b> lenition in Scottish Gaelic affects {{almost all}} consonants (except [...] which {{has lost its}} lenited {{counterpart}} in most areas). Changes such as [...] to [...] involve the loss of secondary articulation; in addition, [...] → [...] involves the reduction of a trill to a tap. The spirantization of Gaelic nasal [...] to [...] is unusual among forms of lenition, but is triggered by the same environment as more prototypical lenition. (It may also leave a residue of nasalization in adjacent vowels. The orthography shows this by inserting an h (except after l n r): ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} <b>synchronic</b> lenition in American English {{is found in}} {{flapping}} in some dialects: the [...] of a word like wait [...] becomes the more sonorous [...] in the related form waiting [...] Some dialects of Spanish show debuccalization of [...] to [...] {{at the end of}} a syllable, so that a word like [...] "we are" [...] is pronounced [...] An example of diachronic lenition can be found in the Romance languages, where the [...] of Latin [...] ("father", accusative) becomes [...] in Italian [...] and [...] in Spanish , while in French [...] and Portuguese [...] it has disappeared completely. Along with assimilation, lenition is one of the primary sources of phonological change of languages.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{language}} has no obstruents other than voiceless stops, other sounds are encountered, as in Finnish, where the lenited grade {{is represented by}} chronemes, approximants, taps or even trills. For example, Finnish {{used to have a}} complete set of spirantization reflexes for , though these have been lost in favour of similar-sounding phonemes. In Pohjanmaa Finnish, [...] was changed into , thus the dialect has a <b>synchronic</b> lenition of an alveolar stop into an alveolar trill [...] Furthermore, the same phoneme [...] undergoes assibilation [...] → [...] before the vowel , e.g. root vete- [...] "water" [...] → vesi and vere-. Here, vete- is the stem, vesi is its nominative, and vere- is the same stem under consonant gradation.|$|E
2500|$|Taking a <b>synchronic</b> {{point of}} view, Sinhala place names {{are more common}} in the Sinhala {{speaking}} areas in the South, whereas Tamil place names are {{more common in the}} Tamil speaking areas in the North and East. On a diachronic point of view, things are more complicated, and both Sinhala settlements in the North and Tamil settlements in the South have been claimed to have been more common in the past. The motivation behind such analyses is not always scientific; [...] political goals also play a role in claiming a certain area for a certain language group, see the next section for more discussion of this. The following statements have to be interpreted with this caveat in mind.|$|E
2500|$|Althusser and Balibar's contemporary, Henri Lefebvre, was sharply {{critical}} {{of what he}} saw as these writers' fetishization of a fixed, abstract and purely structural notion of [...] "general" [...] <b>synchronic</b> space subsuming diachronic or historical processes. By contrast, Lefebvre's own [...] "turbulent spatiality" [...] which [...] "would restore geography to history, history to geography", together with his rhythmanalysis, shares at least a common vocabulary with Bloch's multispatial and multitemporal dialectics. Lefebvre {{was also one of the}} first commentators to link uneven development to the production of space on a global scale: [...] "The law of unevenness of growth and development, so far from becoming obsolete, is becoming world-wide in its application — or, more precisely is presiding over the globalization of a world market".|$|E
2500|$|Historical {{linguists}} {{study the}} history of specific languages as well as general characteristics of language change. The study of language change is {{also referred to as}} [...] "diachronic linguistics" [...] (the study of how one particular language has changed over time), which can be distinguished from [...] "synchronic linguistics" [...] (the comparative study of more than one language at a given moment in time without regard to previous stages). Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. However, there was a shift to the <b>synchronic</b> approach {{in the early twentieth century}} with Saussure, and became more predominant in western linguistics with the work of Noam Chomsky.|$|E
2500|$|Diachronic lenition is found, for example, in {{the change}} from Latin into Spanish, in which the [...] voiceless stops [...] first changed into their voiced {{counterparts}} , and later into the approximants or fricatives : vita > vida, lupa > loba, caeca > ciega, apotheca > bodega. One stage in these changes goes beyond phonetic to have become a phonological restructuring, e.g. /lupa/ > /loba/ (compare /lupa/ in Italian, with {{no change in the}} phonological status of /p/). The subsequent further weakening of the series to phonetic , as in [...] is diachronic {{in the sense that the}} developments took place over time and displaced [...] as the normal pronunciations between vowels. It is also <b>synchronic</b> in an analysis of [...] as allophonic realizations of /b, d, g/: illustrating with /b/, /bino/ 'wine' is pronounced [...] after pause, but with [...] intervocalically, as in [...] 'of wine'; likewise, /loba/ → [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Sanskrit deva- [...] {{originally}} an adjective meaning [...] "celestial" [...] or [...] "shining", {{which is}} a (not <b>synchronic</b> Sanskrit) vrddhi derivative from the root *diw meaning [...] "to shine", especially as the day-lit sky. The feminine form of deva is Devi, meaning [...] "female deity". Also deriving from diw and thus cognates of deva, are Lithuanian Dievas (Latvian Dievs, Prussian Deiwas), Germanic Tiwaz (seen in English [...] "Tuesday") and the related Old Norse Tivar (gods), [...] and Latin deus [...] "god" [...] and divus [...] "divine", from which the English words [...] "divine", [...] "deity", [...] French [...] "dieu", Portuguese [...] "deus", Spanish [...] "dios" [...] and Italian [...] "dio", also [...] "Zeys/Ζεύς" [...] - [...] "Dias/Δίας", the Greek father of the gods, are derived. It is related to *Dyeus which while from the same root, may originally have referred to the [...] "heavenly shining father", and hence to [...] "Father Sky". The bode of the Devas is Dyuloka.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{all modern}} {{linguistics}} was historical in orientation. Even {{the study of}} modern dialects involved looking at their origins. Ferdinand de Saussure's distinction between <b>synchronic</b> and diachronic linguistics is fundamental {{to the present day}} organization of the discipline. Primacy is accorded to <b>synchronic</b> linguistics, and diachronic linguistics is defined as the study of successive <b>synchronic</b> stages. Saussure's clear demarcation, however, has had both defenders and critics.|$|E
50|$|In linguistics, a <b>synchronic</b> {{analysis}} {{is one that}} views linguistic phenomena only at a given time, usually the present, though a <b>synchronic</b> analysis of a historical language form is also possible. This may be distinguished from diachronic, which regards a phenomenon in terms of developments through time. Diachronic {{analysis is}} the main concern of historical linguistics; however, most other branches of linguistics are concerned with some form of <b>synchronic</b> analysis.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "weak suppletion" [...] is {{sometimes}} used in contemporary <b>synchronic</b> morphology {{in regard to}} sets of stems (or affixes) whose alternations cannot {{be accounted for by}} current phonological rules. For example, stems in the word pair oblige/obligate are related by meaning but the stem-final alternation is not related by any <b>synchronic</b> phonological process.
