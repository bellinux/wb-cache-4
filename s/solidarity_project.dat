40|$|Abstract Each year {{thousands}} of Norwegian students spend {{one day of}} their education to collect money for different aid projects. These projects aim at giving youth in developing countries the opportunity to education and {{are referred to as}} Solidarity Projects. The projects are organized by different NGO s. The first organizations that started offering solidarity projects were Operation Day´s Work. This organization was founded in 1964, and is run for, by and with youth. Participation in solidarity projects are based on volunteerism. There is a strong focus on that students should participate out of solidarity, not because the feel sorry for the students in a developing context or because the feel guilty. ODW is still the main contributor of solidarity projects in Norwegian context with over 120 000 participating students each year. The later years there has, however, been a {{decrease in the number of}} participation schools doing ODW. There may be many possible reasons for this decrease. One of the main reasons is that other NGOs like e. g. PLAN Norge, Hei Verden! and other organizations offers schools to make their cause into a <b>solidarity</b> <b>project.</b> In addition, some schools choose to develop their own solidarity projects by collaborating with a local NGO in a developing context or a single school in an area. The findings this study is based on are collected through qualitative interviews with students and school leaders at four different schools in Oslo. Two of the schools participated in ODW s project, while two schools collaborated with other organizations for their <b>solidarity</b> <b>project.</b> The purpose of the interviews was to find out about student motivation and school rationale for participation in solidarity projects. The study applies The Volunteer Function Inventory (Clary et al, 1998) as a framework to analyze the student motivation. Motivation is compared between the different types of projects as well as across school level. In addition school leaders justifications for participation are compared...|$|E

40|$|Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw ends her {{landmark}} essay “Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color” with {{a normative}} claim about coalitions. She {{suggests that we}} should reconceptualize identity groups as “in fact coalitions,” {{or at least as}} “potential coalitions waiting to be formed. ” In this essay, I explore this largely overlooked claim by combining philosophical analysis with archival research I conducted at the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Historical Society Archive in San Francisco about Somos Hermanas, the <b>solidarity</b> <b>project</b> of the Alliance Against Women’s Oppression, based in the San Francisco Women’s Building (1984 – 90). I extend my analysis into the present by drawing on the oral history and published works of Carmen Vázquez, a key organizer in both Somos Hermanas and the Women’s Building. I argue that conceptualizing identities as in fact coalitions—as complex, internally heterogeneous unities constituted by their internal differences and dissonances and by internal as well as external relations of power—enables us to organize effective political coalitions that cross existing identity categories and to pursue a liberatory politics of interconnection...|$|E

The overarching goal of ITSC is to promote solidarity among worker-led transnational organizations in Mexico, the U. S. and Canada.

The Institute works in close collaboration with strategic partners in Mexico, the U.

The idea to organize labor delegations and encourage worker-to-worker solidarity in support key campaigns that exemplified the importance of global solidarity emerged during our December 2014 meeting in Los Angeles. Participants of that tri-national meeting discussed the need to practice international labor solidarity from the grassroots level. The present report highlights five campaigns where international labor solidarity has {{played a critical role}} in shaping outcomes of the conflict. The main goal in documenting these experiences is not only to learn about the truly remarkable campaigns undertaken by workers at the local level facing global companies, but also to highlight the fact that international workers alliances are integral to their success...|$|E

From 1970, the year in which Emaús established itself in Vizcaya, to the present day, the organization has experienced an evolution which has led it to change its management direction. Gone are the days when they were only known as “the rag and bone men of Emaus” with all the connotations that were associated with that name.

Through this case, the problems that arise for the organization with reference to the management of Human Resources are analysed.

40|$|Excerpt] In Our Unions, Our Selves, Anne Zacharias-Walsh {{provides}} an {{in-depth look at}} the rise of women-only unions in Japan, an organizational analysis of the challenges these new unions face in practice, and a firsthand account of the ambitious, occasionally contentious, and ultimately successful international <b>solidarity</b> <b>project</b> that helped to spark a new feminist labor movement. In the early 1990 s, {{as part of a}} larger wave of union reform efforts in Japan, women began creating their own women-only labor unions to confront long-standing gender inequality in the workplace and in traditional enterprise unions. These new unions soon discovered that the demand for individual assistance and help at the bargaining table dramatically exceeded the rate at which the unions could recruit and train members to meet that demand. Within just a few years, women-only unions were proving to be both the most effective option women had for addressing problems on the job and in serious danger of dying out because of their inability to grow their organizational capacity. Zacharias-Walsh met up with Japanese women 2 ̆ 7 s unions at a critical moment in their struggle to survive. Recognizing the benefits of a cross-national dialogue, they teamed up to host a multiyear international exchange project that brought together U. S. and Japanese activists and scholars to investigate the links between organizational structure and the day-to-day problems nontraditional unions face, and to develop Japan-specific participatory labor education as a way to organize and empower new generations of members. They also gained valuable insights into the fine art of building and maintaining the kinds of collaborative, cross border relationships that are essential to today’s social justice movements, from global efforts to save the environment to the Fight for 15 and Black Lives Matter...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} instrumental benefits {{of civil society}} discourse for Muslim civil society organizations and their pursuit of conservative agendas. Since early 1990, informal religious communities in the Muslim world have been reestablishing themselves as formal NGOs at unprecedented rates. Additionally, they are joining forces and forming transnational coalitions. The constituents' goals of religious support and solidarity remain unchanged {{in terms of their}} commitment to conservative and religious norms. By contrast, existing transnational civil society literature is dominated with assumptions of liberal and secular agendas. Yet, despite the seemingly inherent contradiction, the members of these faith-based organizations and coalitions persistently position themselves within the sphere of civil society. This dissertation problematizes this conflict and asks: Why are the previously informal Islamist networks adopting the discourse of civil society, transforming into formal NGOs, and establishing transnational coalitions? In this study, I examine one of the largest Muslim NGO coalitions to date - the Union of the NGOs of the Islamic World (UNIW). With its 193 member NGOs from 46 countries, the UNIW aims to consolidate faith-based Muslim NGOs and to coordinate member actions for the welfare of Muslim communities around the world. Based on fieldwork conducted in Turkey, Germany, the U. S., Malaysia and Cambodia, I employ qualitative and ethnographic methods and draw on diverse sources of data including in-depth interviews, participant observation and document analysis. My findings suggest that framing this transnational religious <b>solidarity</b> <b>project</b> as a transnational civil society network provides Islamist groups additional channels of power. Specifically, previously informal communities find opportunities to increase their social capital through membership in a transnational coalition, engage in mutually profitable relationships with states, and claim legitimacy as global political actors. The empirical findings of the dissertation challenge several assumptions of the constructivist and sociological institutionalist literature. These perspectives' contributions to the study of transnational advocacy networks, international NGOs, and transnational NGO coalitions have prioritized ideational and normative concerns over instrumental and interest-based motivations in transnational non-state actor politics. In this dissertation I argue that ideational motivations of transnational non-state actors regularly intersect with instrumental concerns. By demonstrating the instrumental motivations of norm-oriented networks, this dissertation moves beyond the instrumental/ideational divide that permeates the literature on transnational non-state actors...|$|E
