25|$|The United States Department of Labor {{has sought}} to address {{one of the main}} causes of homelessness, a lack of {{meaningful}} and <b>sustainable</b> <b>employment,</b> through targeted training programs and an increase in access to employment opportunities that can help homeless people to develop sustainable lifestyles. This has included the development of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which addresses homelessness on the federal level in addition to connecting homelesss individuals to resources at the state level. All individuals who are in need of assistance are able, in theory, to access employment and training services under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government, with veterans also being able to use the Veterans Workforce Investment Program.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1960s, {{successive}} governments have implemented various schemes to alleviate poverty, under central planning, that {{have met with}} partial success. In 2005, the government enacted the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), guaranteeing 100days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in all the districts of India. In 2011, it was widely criticised and beset with controversy for corrupt officials, deficit financing {{as the source of}} funds, poor quality of infrastructure built under the programme, and unintended destructive effects. Other studies suggest that the programme has helped reduce rural poverty in some cases. Yet other studies report that India's economic growth has been the driver of <b>sustainable</b> <b>employment</b> and poverty reduction, though a sizeable population remains in poverty.|$|E
