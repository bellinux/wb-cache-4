5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to {{one side or the other}} told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain who shot first.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some <b>say)</b> <b>for</b> the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain that the suit failed.|$|E

5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to {{one side or the}} other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E

25|$|After the {{coronation}} {{of the king}} in 2008 it suddenly became the habit in Tonga to add 'lord' to the address, something that was absolutely not done before. Therefore, nowadays one would rather <b>say</b> <b>for</b> example: lord Tuʻivakanō (or even honourable lord Tuʻivakanō), (as meanwhile Fielakepa himself was promoted to baron).|$|E

25|$|Some Muslims take a relativist {{approach}} to hijab. They {{believe that the}} commandment to maintain modesty must be interpreted {{with regard to the}} surrounding society. What is considered modest or daring in one society might not be considered so in another. It is important, they <b>say,</b> <b>for</b> believers to wear clothing that communicates modesty and reserve.|$|E
25|$|Pathogenic coevolution, a counterhypothesis, {{posits that}} common alleles are under {{greatest}} pathogenic pressure, driving positive selection of uncommon alleles—moving targets, so to <b>say,</b> <b>for</b> pathogens. As pathogenic {{pressure on the}} previously common alleles decreases, their frequency in the population stabilizes, and remain circulating in a large population. Despite great MHC polymorphism at the population level, an individual bears at most 18 MHC I or II alleles.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{attachment}} of accretionary texts {{to the original}} Insular/Anglo-Saxon book relating to the Benedictine Abbey at Cerne in Dorset, there are even questions concerning {{whether or not this}} codex was ever physically housed at this monastery. All one can <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain based on codiclogical evidence is that at some point after the Dissolution in the 16rth century and by 1697 that these accretionary documents from Cerne Abbas were attached to the original Insular/Anglo-Saxon core.|$|E

25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver has something to <b>say.</b> <b>For</b> commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with her}} theosophical activities, Besant {{continued}} to actively participate in political matters. She {{had joined the}} Indian National Congress. As the name suggested, this was originally a debating body, which met each year to consider resolutions on political issues. Mostly it demanded more of a <b>say</b> <b>for</b> middle-class Indians in British Indian government. It had not yet developed into a permanent mass movement with local organisation. About this time her co-worker Leadbeater moved to Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Let's <b>say,</b> <b>for</b> example, that an {{individual}} takes a test that measures the ionized calcium in the blood, resulting in a value of 1.30mmol/L, and a reference group that appropriately represents the individual has established a reference range of 1.05 to 1.25mmol/L. The individual's value {{is higher than the}} upper limit of the reference range, and therefore has less than 2.5% probability of being a result of random variability, constituting a strong indication to make a differential diagnosis of possible causative conditions.|$|E

25|$|James {{called a}} Parliament at Inverness Castle in late August 1428, at which Alexander, Margaret and 'nearly all the notable {{men of the}} north' were arrested. One theory is that James wanted to replace Alexander with his uncle John Mór as Lord of the Isles, but {{he was forced to}} release Alexander either as a result of John's death in 1429 or as a {{precondition}} set by John before he would negotiate. Some sources say Alexander was imprisoned for a few weeks, others <b>say</b> <b>for</b> a year; three other chiefs were executed.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the city centre is the Anglia Square {{shopping}} centre. The centre and the surrounding area is to be redeveloped; demolition work was due to commence in 2010 after an archaeological dig (conducted in 2009 and due to the centre being located around the site of a Saxon fortified settlement). The new development is planned to be a mixture of shops and housing, unlike the original which consisted of offices, shops and a cinema. In February 2009, it was announced that, due to the economic climate, plans for the area have been delayed and the developers are unable to <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain when work will commence.|$|E
25|$|The special {{property}} of entanglement {{can be better}} observed if we separate the said two particles. Let's put {{one of them in}} the White House in Washington and the other in UC Berkeley (think about this as a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (<b>say,</b> <b>for</b> example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.|$|E
