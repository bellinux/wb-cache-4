Figure 7 {{can be used to}} give insights about the transmission of track vibrations to the car body. The car body displacements relative to the track inputs indicate effective absorption of shocks and vibrations that stem from the rail irregularities by the designed damping and stiffness elements. Therefore, the selected <b>suspension</b> <b>coefficients</b> provide decent passenger ride comfort with significantly reduced amplitude of vibrations of car body. The rail irregularities range in between ± 15 mm (Fig. 3), which can be considered to be very high for rapid transit tracks.

The practical usage of a model is linked and restricted by the model complexity and reliability. The object {{of this study is}} development and analysis of a refined quarter car suspension model, which includes the effect of series stiffness, to estimate the response at higher frequencies; resulting Maxwell's model representation does not allow straightforward calculation of performance parameters. Governing equations of motion are manipulated to calculate the effective stiffness and damping values. State space model is arranged in a novel form to find eigenvalues, which is a unique contribution. Analysis shows the influence of suspension damping and series stiffness on natural frequencies and regions of reduced vibration response. Increase in the <b>suspension</b> damping <b>coefficient</b> beyond optimum values was found to reduce the modal damping and increase the natural frequencies. Instead of carrying out trial simulations during performance optimization for human comfort, an expression is developed for corresponding <b>suspension</b> damping <b>coefficient.</b> The analysis clearly shows the influence of the series stiffness on suspension dynamics and necessity to incorporate the model in performance predictions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the reduction of short-span bridge dynamic responses to heavy vehicle crossing events. The reductions are achieved through adjustment of the vehicle <b>suspension</b> damping <b>coefficient</b> just before the crossing. Given pre-calculations of the response of a vehicle-bridge system {{to a set of}} 2 ̆ 7 unit 2 ̆ 7 road disturbances, it is shown that a single optimum damping coefficient may be determined for a given velocity and any specified road profile. This approach can facilitate implementation since the optimum damping is selected prior to the bridge and {{there is no need to}} continuously vary the damping coefficient during the crossing. The concept is numerically validated using a bridge-vehicle interaction model with several road profiles, both measured and artificially generated. The bridge-friendly damping control strategy is shown to reduce bridge dynamics across a typical range of vehicle velocities, proving most effective for road profiles that induce large vibrations in the vehicle-bridge system...|$|R
40|$|An {{interpretation}} {{is given to}} the wavenumber-dependent effective diffusion coefficient extracted from the scattered light spectra of a microemulsion system. At high concentrations of <b>suspension</b> this diffusion <b>coefficient</b> shows a minimum in its variation with wavenumber in a region well below the diffraction maximum in the static structure factor. The {{interpretation is}} based on an analogy with the Lorentz model, where particles diffuse in a random, static medium. Since a similar wavenumber variation is also found in the Lorentz problem, it is suggested that this behaviour is characteristic of correlated dynamical interactions between the diffusing particle and a structureless but dense medium. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Therefore, the monitoring of soil pH is very important. In this paper the values of soil pH are obtained by measurement of the samples in three media: H 2 O, KCl and CaCl 2. The sampling was conducted at 18 locations on 11 soil types and 15 lower systematic units. The aim of this work was to establish functional connections between the pH values in all three media. Repeatability of measurement expressed through the relative standard deviation, ranged from 0. 21 % to 3. 87 % in the H 2 O suspension, from 0. 19 % to 7. 74 % in the KCl suspension and from 0. 25 % to 4. 19 % in the CaCl 2 <b>suspension.</b> Correlation <b>coefficients</b> varied in the classes: strong, very strong and absolute. The correlation coefficients for all measured samples were: r= 0. 96 for the pH KCl/H 2 O; r= 0. 97 for the pH KCl/CaCl 2 and r= 0. 99 for the pH H 2 O/CaCl 2 (absolute correlation). The correlation coefficients determined in the acid soils were: r= 0. 97 for the pH KCl/CaCl 2 and pH H 2 O/CaCl 2; r= 0. 91 for the pH KCl/ H 2 O (absolute correlation). In the neutral soils, the correlation coefficient for the pH KCl/CaCl 2 was r= 0. 69 (strong correlation), correlation coefficient for the pH KCl/H 2 O was r= 0. 80 (very strong correlation) and the correlation coefficient for the pH H 2 O/CaCl 2 was r= 0. 92 (absolute correlation).

Filtration {{operations}} {{were conducted on}} porous membrane to evaluate the specific contribution of the main fractions encountered in raw water (solids in suspension, soluble, or colloidal compounds) on the system permeability evolution during industrial operations. Experiments were conducted in a frontal filtration mode with single or mixed synthetic suspensions (clay, ferric hydroxide, activated carbon, latex, and humic acids). Results showed a wild specific resistance coefficient (α. W) difference between mineral and organic suspensions. The α. W coefficient increased with suspended solids concentrations. On the other hand, no actual differences were observed between the tested mineral suspensions, which also presented no actual differences in particle size distribution. In the same condition, latex suspensions composed by smaller elements induced higher hydraulic resistance, comparatively to mineral <b>suspension,</b> the resistance <b>coefficient</b> values were ten to one hundred {{times greater than the}} mineral suspensions. Nevertheless, a latex suspensions conditioning with FeCl 3 allowed a notably reducing of the resistance coefficient. Moreover, experiments on humic acid suspension pointed out the membrane fouling during filtration, which could disappear in the presence of activated carbon in the suspension.

40|$|Advani, Suresh G. Short-fiber {{reinforced}} {{composite materials}} are widely {{in use in}} the manufacturing industries to bridge the property gap between continuous-fiber composites and unreinforced materials. Short-fiber composites can effectively strengthen the matrix materials along the fiber length direction, and can still be processed by highly-automated and economical methods such as injection or compression molding. It’s essential to understand and predict the fiber orientation and its influence on the mechanical properties of the composite. However, the hydrodynamic interactions between the matrix and the fibers, and the inter-fiber interactions are not fully understood yet. Sometimes circular particles {{are added to the}} matrix for toughening and this may also influence the orientation of the short fibers during flow. In this thesis, we adopt a two-dimensional direct simulation method to investigate, for the first time, the effect of the presence of circular particles on the fiber orientation of short-fiber suspensions. To deal with the collision between fibers or fibers and particles, an ad-hoc method is proposed and developed. We predict the time-evolution of the elliptical fiber orientation as the volume fraction and aspect ratio increases, and compare it with that of the fiber-particle <b>suspensions.</b> The interaction <b>coefficient</b> C 1 is calculated and compared with existing models.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} the initial {{step in a}} more rigorous approach {{to the study of}} the hydrodynamic and heat transfer behaviour of gas-solids suspension flows. General Probabilistic Multiphase flow equa- tions were developed and used as the basis for analyzing pressure drops and pipe wall to <b>suspension</b> heat transfer <b>coefficients</b> meas- ured in dilute, vertical, fully developed suspension flows. Hydrody- namic experiments were carried out with sand ((2 ̆ 7) d(,p) = 172, 249 (mu) m) and glass bead ((2 ̆ 7) d(,p) = 65 (mu) m) suspensions in a 12 m high, 20 mm ID transport line installation designed to allow pressure drops, solids and gas flowrates and mean solids concentrations to be measured. Heat transfer experiments were carried out with 249 (mu) m sand suspen- sions in the same installation with a modified test section. A thinned-walled stainless steel pipe was heated electrically in order to provide a constant heat flux from the test section wall to the suspension flowing inside.;The general equation analysis showed pressure drops in dilute vertical suspension flows to be dependent on particle-wall coeffi- cients of restitution and the local solids concentration and velocity in the vicinity of the pipe wall. The lack of information available on solids concentration and velocity profiles prevented the develop- ment of a final pressure drop expression in terms of mean values, averaged across the pipe cross-section. The hydrodynamic results did nevertheless suggest that reduced concentration and velocity profiles were independent of the mean solids concentration in dilute flows. This conclusion and an asymptotic analysis of the energy equations allowed the development of a general expression for the variation of fully developed heat transfer coefficients as a function of loading ratio. Heat transfer coefficient ratios were predicted to either increase, decrease, or pass through a minimum and then increase depending on the relative magnitudes of three coefficients which are fully determined by the hydrodynamics of the system. The general predicted variation was confirmed experimentally and numerical values of the hydrodynamic coefficients were determined...|$|R
40|$|Technological advancements in the {{automotive}} industry have led to various improvements in vehicle safety, ride quality and aesthetics. Vehicle safety {{is one of the}} foremost issues that {{the automotive}} industry is constantly working on {{to reduce the risk of}} injury and discomfort to passengers. Humans are sensitive to vibrations and excessive vibrations can cause injury or discomfort such as back pain, fatigue, mental stress and unseating of passengers. Road holding and vehicle stability is affected by road disturbances, suspension characteristics and directional motion of the vehicle. Ride quality is also influenced by vibrations induced from the road as well as imbalances in the tire/wheel assembly. In order to analyze and suppress vehicle vibrations and increase vehicle safety, a non-linear multi-body quarter car model and a linear quarter car model have been developed using bond graph methodology. [...] Active suspension system has been developed in this research using a linear quadratic controller and applied to the linear quarter car and the multi-body model. The multi-body model has been characterized to obtain the parameters for <b>suspension</b> and damping <b>coefficients</b> that can be used in the linear quarter car model. Non-linearity has been introduced in the multi-body model with the use of non-linear components (springs and dampers) and/or use of geometric non-linearity of the suspension. A gain factor is applied to the actuator force of the active suspension system of the multi-body model to compensate for the kinematic differences between the linear model and the non-linear model. A comparison study is performed in frequency and time domain for both the models and four cases have been developed to study the effectiveness of the linear quadratic controller on the multi-body model as well as the linear quarter car model. The results show that the multi-body model performs better than the linear quarter car model when there is low geometric non-linearity. When component non-linearity and high geometric non-linearity are introduced in the multi-body model, the performance of the linear quadratic controller deteriorates in comparison to the linear quarter car, particularly for the ride quality scenarios. The active suspension system for the multi-body model performs better than the passive system in all the four cases.
