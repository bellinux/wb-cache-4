The correlations of the two weld appearances and other elements (such as microstructure, microhardness, and joint's tensile properties) were analyzed. The results show that the weld with near X <b>shape</b> <b>cross-section</b> during the welding process is more stable than that with nail <b>shape</b> <b>cross-section,</b> and the welding spatter of the former is smaller than that of the latter. The microstructure of the weld zone is columnar grains and equiaxed grains, the columnar grains are formed near the fusion line and growing along the vertical direction of the fusion line, the equiaxed grains are distributed {{in the center of the}} weld zone. The secondary dendrite of the grains in the center of the weld with nail <b>shape</b> <b>cross-section</b> grows better, and gradually forms to equiaxed dendrite, while the grains size of the weld with near X <b>shape</b> <b>cross-section</b> is relatively finer, exhibiting equiaxed cellular grain.

The investigated fancy yarns are of traditional structure, i. e., their effect intermediate product composed of two yarns as well as of complex structure – their effect intermediate product made of three yarns.

Theoretical values of the coil length of the binder yarn of 29 types of investigated fancy yarns are compared with the experimental data. The experimental comparison was performed for various structure fancy yarns specially manufactured for this investigation and using data presented by the other authors. The comparison between the calculated coil length values and experimental data shows good agreement for 21 results (according to the 1 st and 2 nd method). Here the deviations not exceed 5 %.

Zrv-IIB forms multi-level channels in planar lipid (diphytanoyl phosphatidyl- choline) bilayers in response to cis positive voltages. Analysis of the voltage and concentration dependence of macroscopic conductances induced by Zrv-IIB suggests that, on average, channels contain ca. 13 peptide monomers. Analysis of single channel conductance levels suggests a similar value. The pattern of successive conductance levels is consistent with a modified helix bundle model in which the higher order bundle are distorted within the plane of the bilayer towards a "torpedo" <b>shaped</b> <b>cross-section,</b> The kinetics of intra-burst switching between adjacent conductance levels are shown to be approximately an order of magnitude faster for Zrv-IIB than for Ahn.

40|$|Steady, fully {{developed}} flows of second order fluids in curved pipes {{of circular cross-section}} have previously been studied using regular perturbation methods. These perturbation solutions are applicable for pipes with small curvature ratio: The cross sectional radius of the pipe divided by the radius of curvature of the pipe centerline. It was shown by Jitchote and Robertson that perturbation equations could be ill-posed when the second normal stress coefficient is nonzero. Motivated by the singular nature of the perturbation equations, here, we study the full governing equations without introducing assumptions inherent in perturbation methods. In particular, we examine the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the full governing equations for second order fluids. We show rigorously that {{a solution to the}} full problem exists and is locally unique for small non-dimensional pressure drop, in agreement with earlier results obtained using a formal expansion in thecurvature ratio. 12 The results obtained here are valid for arbitrarily <b>shaped</b> <b>cross-section</b> (sufficiently smooth) and for all curvature ratios.

40|$|Abstract. Vertical {{instability}} of a tokamak plasma {{can be controlled}} by nonaxisymmetric magnetic fields localized near the plasma edge {{at the bottom and}} top of the torus. The required magnetic fields can be produced by a relatively simple set of parallelogram-shaped coils. The tokamak is the most widely used device in large scale experimental facilities for magnetic confinement fusion research. In this paper we show that vertical {{instability of}} the tokamak plasma, which imposes an important constraint on tokamak design, can be controlled by nonaxisymmetric magnetic fields localized near the plasma edge at the bottom and top of the torus. The required magnetic fields can be produced by a relatively simple set of parallelogram-shaped coils (Fig. 1) placed near the bottom and top of the torus. Since the late 1960 ’s, the tokamak has evolved from an axisymmetric device with circular cross-section to an axisymmetric device with strongly <b>shaped</b> <b>cross-section.</b> It is natural to ask whether it would be advantageous to add some nonaxisymmetric shaping.

40|$|Tie {{channels}} connect rivers to floodplain lakes on many lowland {{rivers and}} thereby {{play a central}} role in floodplain sedimentology and ecology, yet they are generally unrecognized and little studied. here we report the results of field studies focused on tie channel origin and morphodynamics in three contrasting systems: the Middle Fly River, Papua New Guinea, the Lower Mississippi River, and Birch Creek in Alaska. Across these river systems, tie channels vary by an order of magnitude in size but exhibit the same characteristic morphology and appear to develop and evolve by a similar set of processes. In all three systems, the channels are characterized by a narrow, leveed single-thread morphology with maximum width approximately one tenth the width of the mainstem river. The channels typically have a V <b>shaped</b> <b>cross-section,</b> unlike most fluvial channels. These channels develop as lakes become isolated from the river by sedimentation. Narrowing of the connection between river and lake causes a sediment-laden jet to develop. Levees develop along the margins of the jet leading to channel emergence and eventual levee aggradation to the height of the mainstem levees. Bi-directional flow in these channels is common. Outflows from the lake scour sediment and prevent channel blockage. We propose that channel geometry and size are then controlled by a dynamic balance between channel narrowing by suspended sediment deposition and incision and widening by mass failure of banks during outflows. Tie channels are laterally stable and may convey flow for hundreds to a few thousand of years...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{energy is}} one of the most commercially {{developed}} and quickly evolving renewable energy technologies worldwide. Wind turbines are commonly supported on tubular steel towers. As the turbines are growing and the towers are elevating, an increase in structural strength and stiffness is required to withstand the applied forces. Recent studies established concrete as a more economic and durable alternative to steel especially when the tower height exceed 240 ft. Presently, concrete towers are not common due to their perceived heavy weight and assembly complexity. One of the systems that have been mentioned in the literature consists of precast rings that are post-tensioned together and assembled at the turbines site. While the tubular shape is compatible with wind variation and behavior, its construction process can be burdensome, demanding and expensive. In this thesis, an effort to reduce the construction cost is proposed by developing a precast prestressed concrete system that consists of vertical columns and horizontal panels. Composed of simple precast elements, this system is easy to transport, assemble and erect, plus it will reduce the post-tensioning costs. The proposed system has a triangular <b>shaped</b> <b>cross-section</b> that consists of three columns at each corner of the triangle connected together with commonly used precast concrete wall panels. The tower has a tapered profile to reduce the area subjected to wind thus lower the total weight and applied moment. It will also enhance the dynamic response of the tower and improve its overall stability. This thesis presents analysis and design of 240 ft and 320 ft high supporting systems under dead, wind and seismic loading. A comparison between the proposed system and current concrete and steel systems is also presented in terms of behavior, ease of construction and cost. Advisors: Maher Tadros and George Morcous...|$|E
