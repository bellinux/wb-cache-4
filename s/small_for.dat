30|$|In summary, {{based on}} the {{numerical}} results and analysis, {{we have found that}} the parameters of the flow regulators and the service curves in the sensor nodes {{play an important role in}} modelling on a guaranteed QoS model for the WSNs, and have obtained the following findings: (1) the upper bound on buffer queue length is <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> larger service rate with high-values, and it is <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> larger evolution time or larger Hurst parameter, and it is <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> <b>smaller</b> latency or smaller service rate with low-values; (2) the upper bound on (multi-hops/single-hop) delay/jitter is <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> larger service rate or larger Hurst parameter, and it is <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> <b>smaller</b> latency or smaller hops; (3) the upper bound on (multi-hops/single-hop) effective bandwidth is larger for larger service rate, and it is <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> larger latency or larger hops or larger Hurst parameter. In order to obtain network performance optimization and the guaranteed QoS of the WSNs, including low delay for tracking, we can reduce the upper bounds on (end-to-end) delay/jitter or increase the upper bounds on (end-to-end) effective bandwidth by designing the rational regulator parameters, including the average arrival rate and the burst tolerance, and the rational scheduler parameters such as the service rate and the latency, of sensor nodes.|$|R

5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> the naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> the concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
5|$|Four {{decades after}} its construction, Union Station was proving too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> {{its role as}} the {{principal}} railroad hub of Berkshire County. In 1908 local residents began agitating for a larger station, and William H. MacInnis made it a platform of his mayoral candidacy. In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three-man committee (one {{a director of the}} B) to lobby the railroad authorities to replace Union Station. Financial constraints at first hampered their efforts. but in April 1912 the B agreed to support the project. In 1913, the NYNH acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of a {{decrease}} in trade costs on the spatial distribution of industry in a multi-regional economy, when a rise in the regional population of workers generates higher urban costs. When the number of cities is unaffected by falling trade costs, small cities become <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> large trade costs, medium-sized cities become <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> medium values of trade costs, and large cities become <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> <b>small</b> trade costs. Furthermore, when urban costs are ‘identical,’ we show that there exists a path of stable equilibria such that the industry, first, experiences progressive agglomeration into a decreasing number of cities and, then, dispersion into a growing number of cities. The second phase arises because of the increasing urban costs associated with the process of agglomeration. agglomeration; city; multi-regional system; multiplicity of equilibria; transport costs; urban costs...|$|R

Though impractically <b>small</b> <b>for</b> modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex.

5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> their {{agricultural}} needs, {{and came to}} the conclusion that the population would benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E

5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen who are trained {{to become a part}} of the club’s professional teams. In a simple ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential center for the youngsters.|$|E
