40|$|Good {{communication}} in English {{produced by the}} students {{is one of the}} goals of language learning. The students are required to have good pronunciation. Nevertheless, the teacher seldom explains pronunciation in details which makes it as obstacles for the students to produce good pronunciation in English. Mispronunciation that produced by the students will make the listeners get wrong idea about their statement. In this study, the writer attempted to find out the kinds of vowel sound shifts and the causes of the vowel sound shifts produced by the eighth grade students at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari. In conducting the study, the writer used descriptive research with 32 students of eighth grade at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari chosen randomly as the research subjects. The instruments used by the writer to collect the data were performance assessment and interview. The findings of this study revealed that the students shifted 19 sounds from 20 vowel sounds. The vowel sound of /ɒ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʊ/. The vowel sound of /ə/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. The vowel sound of /ʌ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/. The vowel sound of /ɜ:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɪ/, /i:/, and /e/. The vowel sound of /aʊ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /i:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /e/. The vowel sound of /aɪ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ə/, /ɪ/, /e/, and /eɪ/. The vowel sound of /Ã¦/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /aɪ/, /eɪ/, and /e/. The vowel sound of /u:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /əʊ/, /Ã¦/, /ʊə/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/, and /e/. The vowel sound of /eə/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /e/ and /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /ɪ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʌ/, /ʊ/ and /aɪ/. The vowel sound of /əʊ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/ and /ʊ/. The vowel sound of /eɪ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ə/, /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. The vowel sound of /ɪə/ shifts into/e/, /ɪ/, and /ə/. The vowel sound of /ɔ:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/ and /eɪ/. The vowel sound of /e/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /ʊ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /ɑ:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /e/ and /ə/. The vowel sound of /ʊə/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/. It was influenced by native language, age, exposure, innate phonetic ability, and motivation and concern or good pronunciation. To sum up, pronunciation is an important feature when the learners are speaking. A single word that shifts will make different meaning...|$|R
50|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, {{the area}} was {{occupied}} by Japan and the university was moved to Chengdu in Sichuan. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, Yenching University remained open, although under control of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1952, after the entry of China into the Korean War, its arts and science faculty were <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> Peking University and other institutions, its politics and law faculty were <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> China University of Political Science and Law, its economics faculty were <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> Central University of Finance and Economics, its sociology faculty were <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> Minzu University of China, and other faculty <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> other institutions. At the same time, its engineering section was merged with Tsinghua University, and Peking University obtained the former Yenching campus. In 1952 Peking University moved from central downtown Beijing to the previous Yenching campus in the city's Haidian District.|$|R

Recently, septum site determining protein (Ssd) was discovered in this bacteria as a septum inhibitor, leading to elongated cells (not only in this species but also in Mycobacterium smegmatis). The bacterial filament ultrastructure is consistent with inhibition of FtsZ polymerization (previously described). Ssd is believed {{to be part of a}} global regulatory mechanism in this bacteria that promotes a <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> an altered metabolic state.|$|E
25|$|The UC system's ties to {{the three}} {{laboratories}} have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked {{with the development of}} nuclear weapons.

25|$|Demographically, {{the parish}} of Terra Chã (as with other {{communities}} {{on the island}} of Terceira) was marked by emigration, first to Brazil, then to the United States and finally to Canada. Also, the 1 January 1980 earthquake, which caused major damage on the island, triggered a wave of resettlements into Terra Chã. The effect of this demographic <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> the parish, caused by the resettlements into the Bairro da Terra Chã, are visible in the numbers after 1991 when the population of the parish almost doubled.|$|E

While the band's early {{releases}} were {{played in a}} style closer to traditional punk rock, In God We Trust, Inc. (1981) marked a <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> hardcore. Similar to Black Flag and Youth Brigade, Dead Kennedys released their albums on their own label, which in DK's case was Alternative Tentacles. While not {{as large as the}} scene in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area hardcore scene of the 1980s included a number of noteworthy bands, including Crucifix, Flipper, and Whipping Boy.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Chapman made a {{successful}} <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> a more mainstream audience with his album The Great Adventure. The album garnered Chapman two more Grammys, for the album {{and for the}} title track video. After Sparrow Records was purchased by EMI/Liberty, they began to market the album to a broader audience, pushing it to gold status in 1993. The success of the album prompted Chapman to record one of his concerts and release it as The Live Adventure, both as a video and a CD. This continuation won Chapman more GMA Awards, and also a new award from American Songwriter magazine for Songwriter and Artist of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Psychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists {{may play}} punk-style power chords one moment, and then <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or {{by using the}} tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice. Guitarists often use 1950s-style tube {{amplifiers}} such as by makers such as Fender and {{it is common to}} see stacks of two speaker cabinets. As with rockabilly guitarists, the overdrive tone usually comes from what is produced naturally by overdriving the tube amp, rather than by plugging into a distortion pedal.|$|E

25|$|Nobel laureate {{economist}} Milton Friedman, {{author of}} A Monetary History of the United States, {{on the other}} hand, blamed this prolonged economic crisis on {{the imposition of a}} new gold standard, part of which he referred to by its traditional name, The Crime of 1873. This forced <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> a currency whose supply was limited by nature, unable to expand with demand, caused a series of economic and monetary contractions that plagued the entire period of the Long Depression. Murray Rothbard, in his book History of Money and Banking of the United States, argues that the long depression was only a misunderstood recession since real wages and production were actually increasing throughout the period. Like Friedman, he attributes falling prices to the resumption of a deflationary gold standard in the U.S. after the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is None of Your Business. He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E
