5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new <b>self-diagnostic</b> abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E

25|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with a CD player instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger chrome-plated grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the intake plenum is below the fuel injectors and fuel rail), {{a change in the}} vehicle's <b>self-diagnostic</b> system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires.

40|$|The {{history of}} Dynamic Positioning {{shows that in}} most {{incidents}} the DP operator is involved. Reducing the amount of operator related DP incidents could therefore significantly increase the safety and reliability of DP operations.

By splitting DP operations into three different operational modes this workload problem could be resolved such that the operator’s performance will improve. To allow for this split in operational modes a <b>self-diagnostics</b> system and an operator support function should be added to a DP system.

50|$|The new {{generation}} of sensors use sound waves to measure wind speed and direction. The measurement {{is based on the}} time it takes for an ultrasonic pulse to travel from one transducer to another, which varies depending on - among other factors - the wind speed. The transit time is measured in both directions for several (usually two or three) pairs of the transducer heads. Based on those results, the sensor computes wind speed and direction. Compared to mechanical sensors, the ultrasonic sensors offer several advantages such as no moving parts, advanced <b>self-diagnostic</b> capabilities and reduced maintenance requirements.|$|E

Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to respond defensively to self-threats, and because minority opinions are more <b>self-diagnostic</b> than majority ones, individuals may hold these opinions to shield themselves from threat of uncertainty.
