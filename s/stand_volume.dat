In the study {{the accuracy of}} the standwise forest inventory was estimated by comparing the growing stock volume of the standwise inventory with the accurate (instrumental) re-measurements. Comparison was done with 4515 mature stands of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), birch (Betula spp.), aspen (Populus tremula L.) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.). The stands’ measurements by callipers or by harvesters (recalculated to growing stock volume) were used for accurate re-measurements. The study results show that the volume of standwise forest inventory have relative bias of 17. 6 % (volume is underestimated by 17. 6 %) and relative root mean square error 27. 5 % for the whole data.

40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} study a dynamic stand growth model for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

In this model, the initial stand conditions {{at any point in}} time are defined by three state variables (dominant height, basal area and number of trees per hectare), and they are used to estimate <b>stand</b> <b>volume</b> for a given projection age. The model uses three transition functions to project the stand state variables at any particular time and a state function to estimate the <b>stand</b> <b>volume.</b> Two of these transition functions were derived by expanding a base model and considering two site-specific parameters and the third one was derived considering one site-specific parameter. All the functions were fitted simultaneously using full information maximum likelihood and the base-age-invariant dummy variables method. The values of the critical error statistic for <b>stand</b> <b>volume</b> and the RMSE relative to the mean <b>stand</b> <b>volume</b> indicated that the overall model provides satisfactory predictions for time intervals up to 25 years...|$|E
