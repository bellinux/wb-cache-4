5|$|Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, {{proved that}} an object moving under the {{influence}} of gravity must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} plants are {{integrated}} with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.|$|E

50|$|The manaul is {{a mythical}} king {{who became a}} bird. He was {{believed}} to have caused the seas and the <b>skies</b> <b>to</b> fight against each other. The clash between the seas and <b>skies</b> resulted <b>to</b> {{the formation of the}} Philippine islands.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
5|$|Captain Nikos– Featured in the God of War comics #2, #3, and #4, Captain Nikos was a Spartan who Kratos met {{after he}} had slain the Hades Phoenix. Captain Nikos and his men {{assisted}} Kratos in his search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius. Nikos was injured in battle against Poseidon's champion Herodius, but survived. Hades later sent fireballs from the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> stop the Spartan army. As a fireball was about to strike Kratos, Nikos sacrificed himself to save him. Before dying, he passed the rank of Captain to Kratos. During Kratos' second journey, Nikos' corpse, {{and those of other}} Spartans, were reanimated by Hades, but Kratos easily defeated them.|$|E

5|$|Compared to the {{original}} source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of {{the contours of the}} waves with the yellow <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> give rise to an area of white space.|$|E
5|$|In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of {{the monastery}} of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, Æthelberht was {{sufficiently}} distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open <b>sky,</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from performing sorcery. The monks impressed Æthelberht, {{but he was not}} converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.|$|E
5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} animal can {{integrate}} cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the earth's magnetic field or from the <b>sky)</b> <b>to</b> identify {{where they are and}} so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source.

Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E

5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|Lana {{attempts}} to convince everyone {{that it is}} just a rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky finds out that Lana is planning to have sex with Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells <b>Sky</b> <b>to</b> leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E

50|$|AMC-21 was launched, {{along with}} the Superbird 7 {{satellite}}, by an Ariane 5ECA rocket on 14 August 2008. The satellite separated from the carrier rocket in a geosynchronous transfer orbit. An onboard IHI-500N engine then raised it to an operational geosynchronous orbit and placed it at a longitude of 125° West of the Greenwich Meridian.After successful completion of in-orbit testing, SES Americom took operational control of AMC-21 in September 2008. In September 2009, SES Americom merged with SES New <b>Skies</b> <b>to</b> form SES World <b>Skies,</b> <b>to</b> which all of its operational satellites, including AMC-21, were transferred.|$|R
