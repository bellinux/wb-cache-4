5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{storm surge}} using the <b>SLOSH</b> model, {{which is an}} abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes. The model is accurate to within 20percent. <b>SLOSH</b> inputs include the central pressure of a tropical cyclone, storm size, the cyclone's forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds. Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, {{as well as other}} physical features, are taken into account in a predefined grid referred to as a <b>SLOSH</b> basin. Overlapping <b>SLOSH</b> basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S. Some storm simulations use more than one <b>SLOSH</b> basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina <b>SLOSH</b> model runs used both the Lake Ponchartrain / New Orleans basin, and the Mississippi Sound basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall. The final output from the model run will display the maximum envelope of water, or MEOW, that occurred at each location.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the <b>SLOSH</b> model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this amount of precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in Manatee County.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand <b>SLOSH</b> runs. These studies have been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane {{that will result in}} flooding, in each area of the county.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sloshing</b> is the {{oscillation}} of {{a liquid}} within a partially full container. In {{the study of}} <b>sloshing,</b> efforts are usually made to suppress <b>sloshing,</b> due to its potentially harmful effects in storage and transport [1], [2] and [3]. On the other hand, <b>sloshing</b> has an inherent ability to dissipate kinetic energy via shearing of the fluid. Hence, liquid <b>sloshing</b> may be employed as an effective energy sink to provide protection for light and flexible structures exposed to excessive levels of vibration [4], [5] and [6]. In a <b>sloshing</b> absorber, frequency of <b>sloshing</b> is tuned {{to be the same}} as a critical structural frequency. Tuning of the <b>sloshing</b> frequency involves designating the free surface length and the liquid depth in a rectangular container. Studies on the effect of the <b>sloshing</b> absorber's shape on its control performance, are limited at best [7]. In the published literature, practical application has mainly been limited to rectangular [8], cylindrical [9] and toroidal shapes [10]. The lack of a comprehensive investigation on the shape of a <b>sloshing</b> absorber was the motivation to study the <b>sloshing</b> of the raw content of a hen's egg by So and Semercigil [11]. ...|$|R

5|$|The Virginia Emergency Management Agency was {{activated}} on September 15, {{about three}} days prior to Isabel making landfall and entering the state. Officials in Hampton issued the first mandatory evacuation in the state on September 17, about 35hours prior to landfall. Elevenhours later, a mandatory evacuation was issued for some residents in Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, with a recommended evacuation for some residents {{in the city of}} Suffolk and Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Richmond, and York counties. Later on September 17 Governor Mark Warner provided authorization for all recommended evacuations to become mandatory. By the time Isabel entered Virginia late on September 18, evacuations were also issued for Accomack County, Chincoteague, Gloucester County, Lancaster County, Mathews County, Newport News, Poquoson, Portsmouth, and Westmoreland County. The zones ordered to evacuate included residents along waterfronts, in areas prone to flooding, potentially affected by storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane, low-lying areas, health care facilities, or islands.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} ExxonMobil’s evolution ofa direct <b>sloshing</b> {{assessment methodology}} to resolve several challenging technical {{issues that are}} essential for evaluating the integrity of LNG containment systems.

40|$|The {{significant}} rise {{in demand}} for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the economic aspects of its transportation have resulted {{in an increase in}} the number and size of LNG carriers. One of the principal design issues for LNG carriers is <b>sloshing</b> as the containment systems have no internal structures to damp out the liquid motion. Furthermore, because the mass of ship and cargo are comparable, the coupling effect between ship motions and LNG <b>sloshing</b> requires carefu investigation. Considerable increases in the capacity of LNG carriers have renewed interest in the assessment of <b>sloshing</b> loads, and analysis of floating liquefaction and re-gasification installations (floating LNG) requires the inclusion of the <b>sloshing</b> dynamics in a seakeeping model. Recent incidents of <b>sloshing</b> damage onboard LNG carriers 1 have added further urgency to the improvement of <b>sloshing</b> analysis in LNG carriers and floating LNG design. The costs of repair of <b>sloshing</b> damage to the containment system and consequent loss of revenue can be significant. Design optimisation or the use of a numerical wave tank to gather statistical <b>sloshing</b> data requires <b>sloshing</b> simulations with long durations. The full assessment of loading times for offshore LNG (approximately 12 – 18 hours per condition) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is not feasible with currently available computational resources and methods. Membrane containment systems are considered to be at greater risk from <b>sloshing</b> damage than spherical tanks, and detailed <b>sloshing</b> studies are required to determine the <b>sloshing</b> characteristics of a new tank design or vessel operating profile. Model testing at the experimental scale is often used for the comparative assessment of <b>sloshing,</b> but the scaling of impact pressures between model and full scale is often problematic. Full-field numerical techniques such as CFD can capture strongly non-linear <b>sloshing</b> at full scale, but large computational requirements restrict their application and they are unsuitable for the analysis of longer time series due to excessive computational requirements and their susceptibility to growth of numerical errors. Analytical approaches such as multimodal analysis can be computed in faster than realtime, but they are limited to linear and some cases of weakly non-linear <b>sloshing...</b>|$|R

After making landfall, the hurricane quickly weakened, deteriorating to tropical storm status within 12hours.

Additionally, since this storm, only a hurricane in 1946 has made landfall in the area. In the past few decades especially, local officials have been concerned about a major hurricane impacting the area due to population increases, older building codes, storm surge projections, and complacency among some residents. The combined population of Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties has increased from about 135,000people in 1921 to approximately 2.7million by 2011.

40|$|A {{concept for}} a non-intrusive <b>sloshing</b> {{guidance}} {{system based on}} a phenomenological Rapid <b>Sloshing</b> Model is proposed to reduce the operational risk of <b>sloshing</b> damage to LNG carriers. A numerical <b>sloshing</b> model is implemented in a commercial Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code which uses a volume-of- fluid approach for the simulation of multi- fuid problems. The effect of spatial and temporal discretisation and turbulence is investigated using systematic variation. Dimensional analysis of the multiphase flow regime and examination of the relative velocity at the fluid interface show that an inhomogeneous multiphase model is appropriate for the simulation of a violent <b>sloshing</b> flow. This is conrmed by the good agreement with the experimental data of Hinatsu. The effect of fluid compressibility is investigated for <b>sloshing</b> impacts and a criterion based on wave propagation is developed to assess the importance of compressibility. When modelling <b>sloshing</b> with large air bubble entrainment, the choice of fluid compressibility model is shown {{to have a significant}} influence on pressure magnitude and frequency of oscillation required for structural assessment and a thermal energy model is required. The Rapid <b>Sloshing</b> Model (RSM) is based on the observation that the centre of mass of a <b>sloshing</b> fluid tends to follow a particular trajectory. Using a phenomenological modelling approach, the forces affecting the <b>sloshing</b> response are approximated with mathematical functions for restoring force, damping and <b>sloshing</b> impacts. Calculation times for the resulting equations are typically 0. 1 % of real time on a desktop PC. A case study of <b>sloshing</b> induced by periodic rotation and translation of two-dimensional longitudinal and transverse sections of membrane LNG tanks is carried out using RSM. RSM is set up using one CFD simulation not considered in the case study and the RSM solutions are then compared to the independent CFD solutions. The fluid momentum from RSM is usually within 5 %{ 15 % of the CFD solution for excitation at and near the first resonant period at a filling level near the critical depth. An irregular surge motion profile from an ITTC two-parameter spectrum is applied to the tank and the mean error from the RSM solution remains below 15 % when using momentum and transverse force. When applied to <b>sloshing</b> with a 10 % filling level excited by an irregular seaway a mean error of 9. 6 % is obtained. Compared to existing phenomenological modelling approaches the RSM methodology reduces the error by an order of magnitude in <b>sloshing</b> scenarios of practical interest. A non-intrusive <b>sloshing</b> guidance system based on the Rapid <b>Sloshing</b> Model which is suitable for installation on existing and newbuild LNG carriers can be implemented by applying motion data measured onboard to the RSM to provide operator guidance on the <b>sloshing</b> severity in partially filled LNG tanks.

40|$|For {{the upper}} {{stage of the}} future version of the Ariane 5, the A 5 ME, it is {{important}} to know the motion of the liquids inside it.

40|$|AbstractThe Rapid <b>Sloshing</b> Model {{methodology}} {{developed by}} Godderidge et al.

Subsequently irregular translatory motions obtained with a realistic wave spectrum and simultaneous translatory and rotational motions are applied to the tank cross sections. The validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) methodology from Godderidge et al.

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} with partially filled {{storage tanks}} may experience <b>sloshing</b> {{of the cargo}} when exposed to waves. Inventive use on the topside result in storage tanks which are built as an integrated part of the deck structure. Weight control and available space is often a critical issue for offshore projects and can be improved by this application. CB&I have decided {{to carry out a}} research related to the occurrence of <b>sloshing</b> and impact pressures for these, so called, in-deck tanks. The <b>sloshing</b> assessment procedure {{is an important part of}} the structural strength checks. <b>Sloshing</b> occurs when the natural period of the fluid coincides to the motions of the storage tank. Four factors mainly contribute to the <b>sloshing</b> phenomenon. Namely, tank dimensions, fill, fluid properties and motion characteristics. However, the complex, chaotic and non-linear behaviour of <b>sloshing</b> makes it hard to predict or estimate impact pressures. In-deck tanks are applied at the topside of the Aasta Hansteen SPAR project, carried out by CB&I. The application of these tanks faced difficulties concerning the <b>sloshing</b> assessment procedure. There is no method applicable related to this situation. Therefore, a conservative method has been defined as a temporary solution. For future implementation of these tanks, better understanding and knowledge of fluid behaviour is essential. In order to tackle this problem, a CFD analysis is carried out in two phases and concludes with a statistical analysis in order to estimate <b>sloshing</b> impact pressures. The first phase relates to a general 2 D CFD simulation for various cases. The second phase includes 2 D long time simulations of <b>sloshing</b> cases extracted from the first phase. The results of the first phase show that no <b>sloshing</b> occurs for the Aasta Hansteen SPAR related cases. Where the motion period of 60 seconds is too far away from the period of the 1 st wave mode, which is around 8 seconds. FPSO related cases contain a period around 10 seconds and show <b>sloshing</b> impact behaviour. The impacts occur specifically for longer tank lengths and higher filling levels as these cases coincide better with the motion behaviour of the tank. Noted that the combination of input parameters for which <b>sloshing</b> occurs is highly dependent on the forced excitation on the tank, where <b>sloshing</b> behaviour is sensitive to changes of these parameters. Furthermore, a motion case analysis is added and different sea states are assessed from mild to harsh tank motion excitations. Resulting in <b>sloshing</b> for harsher sea states and higher accelerations. Overall, <b>sloshing</b> impacts conclude in the order of 100 kPa - 300 kPa. The impact area includes the vertical wall and 2. 4 meters on the top of the tank. In the event of non-impulsive oscillating behaviour (no <b>sloshing),</b> one can apply the linear theory for an accurate prediction of the pressures. However, when the fluid motion becomes chaotic and non-linear, there is no method able to accurately predict the impact pressures. The results of the second phase contain the <b>sloshing</b> impact order of magnitude for eight individual <b>sloshing</b> cases. With difference in fluid, tank length, fill and motion type. Six of these cases can be compared to one another and resulted in a fill/length ratio of 0. 063 for the highest impact pressures. A lower viscosity of the fluid seems to increase the sensitivity to <b>sloshing</b> behaviour. Filling levels of 50 % - 70 % show high <b>sloshing</b> impacts, where 80 % fill does not result in <b>sloshing</b> anymore. The increase of tank lengths results in higher <b>sloshing</b> impacts. Briefly summed up: 7 m no <b>sloshing,</b> 12 m semi <b>sloshing,</b> 15 m <b>sloshing</b> impact order 150 kPa - 200 kPa and 20 m <b>sloshing</b> impact order 300 kPa - 500 kPa. Two fitting curves are used in order to establish the Exceedance Probability Function. Namely, the Generalized Pareto and Kernel Smoothing. Both show a good fitting, but present different behaviour in the so called 'tail' of the Probability Density Function. A good distribution of this 'tail' result in a better Exceedance Probability Function. A decision on the best fitting curve is not made due to the lack of sufficient simulated statistical data. The sensitivity analysis proved the Kernel Smoothing fitting more robust compared to the Generalized Pareto. Also, the reduction of statistical data resulted in the highest sensitivities within the sensitivity analysis. Which underlines the need of more simulation and statistical data for improvement of the results.

2500|$|The {{architecture}} of the Space Needle {{is the result of}} a compromise between the designs of two men, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham, Jr. The two leading ideas for the World Fair involved businessman Edward E. Carlson's sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground (see the gently sloping base) and architect John Graham's concept of a flying saucer (see the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck). Victor Steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower. The Space Needle was built to withstand wind speeds of 200mph (322km/h), double the requirements in the building code of 1962. The 6.8 [...] Nisqually earthquake jolted the Needle enough in 2001 for water to <b>slosh</b> out of the toilets in the restrooms. The Space Needle will not sustain serious structural damage during earthquakes of magnitudes below 9. Also made to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds, the Space Needle sways only 1inch per 10mph (16mm per 10km/h) of wind speed.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work <b>sloshing</b> inside closed {{aquaculture}} plants at sea {{has been investigated}} by both experimental methods and linear <b>sloshing</b> theory. An experiment conducted in the student towing tank at NTNU during the project thesis fall 2016 investigating <b>sloshing</b> inside a closed upright circular cylindrical fish tank subjected to regular waves is presented and re-analysed. Two degrees of freedom were considered in the experiment, surge and pitch. For a closed aquaculture plant with a free-surface, the natural <b>sloshing</b> frequencies and corresponding natural modes are non-trivial solutions of the boundary value problem for the liquid inside the plant with zero plant excitation. The experimental results showed that violent <b>sloshing</b> occurs for an incoming wave frequency which is 6. 4 % higher than the natural frequency of the first <b>sloshing</b> mode. This is due to coupling with the motions of the model. At incident wave frequency, the body-fixed response amplitude of the free-surface elevation inside the model is measured to be 3 - 4 {{times larger than the}} incoming wave amplitude. The free-surface elevation inside the cage is simulated with linear modal theory, assuming prescribed motions measured in the experiment. Comparing with the experimental free-surface elevation, the numerical results were not satisfactory. Because of unreliable measurements of the motions in the experiment, the sensitivity of the response of the numerical free-surface elevation inside the model was investigated regarding the prescribed motions. The sensitivity of the response of the numerical free-surface elevation inside the fish cage is high {{in the vicinity of the}} natural frequency of the first <b>sloshing</b> mode. Based on the sensitivity analysis, corrections of the motions were made and the free-surface elevation was calculated with the new motions. The numerical and experimental free-surface elevation inside the plant do now coincide for a large frequency domain and the violent <b>sloshing</b> response is predicted well by the linear modal theory. Still, the experimental and numerical results do not fully agree in the vicinity of the natural frequency of the first mode. Investigation of time series of the experimental free-surface elevation identified rotary wave motions inside the model known as swirling. A nonlinear analysis of the experimental data was performed and showed that nonlinearities were present in the vicinity of the natural frequency of the first <b>sloshing</b> mode. Resonant <b>sloshing</b> is a highly nonlinear phenomenon and linear <b>sloshing</b> theory has therefore strong limitations when it comes to estimating the <b>sloshing</b> response in the vicinity of the natural frequency of the first <b>sloshing</b> mode. However, linear <b>sloshing</b> theory gives useful results for nonresonant <b>sloshing...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sloshing</b> of an {{inviscid}} {{liquid in}} a two-dimensional container performing arbitrary motions is considered. In particular, three special cases are considered : (1) The free oscillations {{of the liquid}} surface in a stationary container,(2) <b>Sloshing</b> due to in-plane accelerations of the container and (3) <b>Sloshing</b> due to the pitching motion of the container. Equations are written in the body fitted coordinates. A finite difference scheme is used to solve these equations and analytical results have been obtained to linearized equations. The presenl simple numerical scheme does not permit large amplitudes of <b>sloshing.</b> 13; However, {{it is possible to}} calculate the general <b>sloshing</b> motion for moderate amplitudes. The analytical results give an insight into many aspects of the motion and help build confidence in the computational procedure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{simulated}} the non-linear <b>sloshing</b> effects under typical dynamic actions. The <b>sloshing</b> simulation {{is realized}} with the Arbitrary Lagrangian Euleria (ALE) formulation plus bi-phase hydrodynamic biomaterial liquid gas materials. The study first investigated two dimensional (2 D) <b>sloshing</b> problems under harmonic excitations. Through calibration studies in standard rectangular tanks, {{the case study}} demonstrated reasonable agreement with numerical results published by other researchers. The study was then extended to more complicated three dimensional (3 D) <b>sloshing</b> problems, with the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) considered. The simulation well reflected the <b>sloshing</b> behaviours in a steel tank subject to given seismic excitations and provided available prediction for structural performance. The obtained {{results show that the}} used method is helpful for seismic design of liquid tanks...|$|R
