40|$|This {{full text}} paper was peer {{reviewed}} {{at the direction}} of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 2011 proceedingsNowadays wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted a great deal of study due to their low cost and widerange applications. Most of the sensors used so far are point sensors which have a disc-shaped sensing region. In this paper, we study a new type of sensor: the fiber optic <b>cable</b> <b>sensor.</b> Unlike a traditional point sensor, this type of sensor has a rectangular sensing region with a processor installed on it to do processing and communication. Like wireless sensor networks with point sensors, energy-efficient communication is still an important issue in wireless <b>sensor</b> networks with <b>cable</b> <b>sensors</b> because of the need to efficiently use limited resources. To address the issue, we propose a Cable Mode Transition (CMT) algorithm, which determines the minimal number of active sensors to maintain Kcoverage of a terrain as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it allocates periods of inactivity for <b>cable</b> <b>sensors</b> without affecting the coverage and connectivity requirements of the network based only on local information. Before presenting CMT, we first show the relationship between coverage and connectivity, then the eligibility algorithm permitting a <b>cable</b> <b>sensor</b> to decide whether to stay active. CMT calls the eligibility algorithm to schedule cables. Simulation results show that our scheme is efficient in saving energy and thus can prolong the lifetime of wireless <b>cable</b> <b>sensor</b> networks. supported by NSF grant CBET 072969...|$|R

40|$|On-site PD {{measurements}} on HV cables have {{to concentrate on}} the cable accessories because there is a remaining risk for assembling faults on site. PD sensors with an appropriate coupling behavior to accessory-internal PD give sensitivities of a few pC or even better. Unfortunately, two main reasons prevent the general use of PD sensors in cable accessories. First of all, the costs for PD sensors have to be balanced with the costs of the accessories, importance of the cable link, consequential costs for outages etc. This is the reason why PD sensors were mainly used for EHV cable systems. The second reason is limited accessibility: the PD <b>sensor</b> <b>cable</b> at the accessory has to be connected to a PD detection unit. Accessibility is much more difficult for direct buried cable systems than for cable terminations and for tunnel-laid cable systems: the <b>sensor</b> <b>cable</b> must pass the ground and end up in a box on the surface to provide access. This solution causes additional costs and new problems like sealing the <b>sensor</b> <b>cable</b> against humidity, capability to withstand sheath testing etc. By looking for alternative access to PD signals from cable joints of long cable systems, a very simple solution proved suitable: detecting PD at the cross-bonding links. To investigate the high frequency propagation of PD pulses in cross-bonding links, computer simulations and laboratory measurements were done. On-site PD measurements at cross-bonding links of a 220 -kV-XLPE cable system showed unexpected hig...|$|E

In an adhesive application campaign in 2014 three large monopile structures were successfully equipped and withstood the high energy pile driving into the North Sea.

On the one hand, small sensors for measuring the actual strain and accelerations of the large steel structure should be bonded with thin films and a structural strength, considering additional thin primer layers, if applicable. These layers assure minimal damping effects. On the other hand, all structures for protecting the <b>sensors,</b> <b>cables,</b> and monitoring equipment can be embedded into a thick elastic adhesive layer of about 5 – 10  mm and lower semi-structural strength. A boosted moisture-curable PUR adhesive applied on appropriate primer coatings was successfully applied with all hardware of the measurement system.|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{developments}} in fire sensor technology over the past ten years. Some, such as incipient smoke detection systems, have become readily available, while others remain in the research, pre-production, or newly released stage. This second group of sensors utilizes technologies ranging from optical fibers and wax, to integrated video and infrared sensors controlled by artificial intelligence algorithms. This paper presents an overview of several less known, yet promising, fire sensor technologies. Although it does not address specific applications, it illustrates the wide range solutions available for addressing a variety of fire detection needs. HEAT SENSOR DEVELOPMENTS There have been several developments in heat sensor technology in recent years. Two promising approaches are in the use of fiber optic cables as line-type heat de-tectors, and the detection of thermal fluc-tuations instead of temperature increase. Ericsson, a Swedish company, has devel-oped a very sensitive line type heat detec-tion system using laser and optical fiber technology. l The <b>sensor</b> <b>cable</b> can be up to 2 km long, and when the length of heated cable is at least 200 mm, the fire location can be pinpointed with an accuracy of about +/- 1 m. Up to 100 of these fire or overheat locations can be detected with the +/- 1 m accuracy as long as the separation between hot points is at least 3. 5 m. The activation temperature (alarm temperature) of the sensor is between 40 °C and 90 °C with a +/- 1 °C resolution. Although a specific ac-tivation temperature within this range can be selected, it is a function of the sensor materials, and is not currently field ad-justable. The <b>sensor</b> <b>cable</b> itself is composed of three primary components: an optical fiber, a wax-filled tube, and a protective covering material (jacket). The optical fi-ber is in parallel I with the wax filled tube, connected to it by an aramid thread (Figure 1).

40|$|Daylight {{illuminance}} uniformity is {{a common}} criterion when assessing the performance of fenestration and solar control. To evaluate a design according to this requirement, a grid of horizontal illuminance readings for a given time is required. In simulation based assessments, this can be calculated by defining sensor points at working plane level and running a simulation for a single time step, or an annual simulation to assess the uniformity for a typical year. Backing such predicted assessments with measured data has been a task involving installation and calibration of <b>sensors,</b> <b>cabling</b> and data acquisition systems, which typically render the assessed space unusable for the time of assessment. Using sequential readings from handheld devices as a convenient alternative ignores the dynamics of daylight, as the sky conditions cannot be assumed constant during {{the time required to}} record the illuminance at the required amount of locations. We propose instantaneous image-based measurements of horizontal illuminance for assessments of daylight uniformity. Instead of <b>cabled</b> <b>sensors,</b> near-Lambertian reflectors are placed at working plane level in the assessed space. High Dynamic Range (HDR) images of the working plane with markers are taken and the luminance of the marker surfaces is extracted from the corresponding pixel values. These luminance values can be used to calculate horizontal illuminance for each marker location, assuming Lambertian reflection. As direct sunlight at working plane is considered to exceed the range of acceptable illuminance for uniformly lid spaces, only readings below a threshold of 3000 lm/m 2 are considered...|$|R

40|$|The oxidoreduction {{potential}} (Eh) is {{of growing}} interest in dairy research and the dairy industry.

Moreover, data comparisons and interpretations are often difficult due to an absence of standardised expression of the results.
