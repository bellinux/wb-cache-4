5|$|The {{arrival of}} AjChan and his {{subsequent}} baptism {{was an important}} diplomatic coup for Ursúa, who used the visit for his own political advancement, promoting the embassy as the peaceful final <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> the Itza kingdom to the Spanish Crown. This formal <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> the Itza kingdom to Spain was a critical turning point, since from a Spanish legal viewpoint the Itza were now subjects and the royal prohibition on military conquest could be sidestepped. AjChan left Mérida with his companions and a Spanish escort {{in the middle of}} January 1696 and arrived back at Tipuj around the end of the month. After a few days at Tipuj he learnt of violent events unfolding around Lake Petén Itzá including the battle at Ch'ich' and the subsequent killing of two Franciscans. Fearing the response of his Spanish escort, he abandoned them and fled back to Yalain.|$|E
