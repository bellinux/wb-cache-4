40|$|According to the RCA and RCA # {{the beef}} sub-sector in South Africa {{has shown a}} {{revealed}} comparative disadvantage for 17 out of the 22 years to 2002, while the maize sub-sector showed a revealed comparative advantage for 18 {{out of the same}} 22 years. However, this article argues that these results do not show the real state of competitiveness that exists in these sub-sectors, mainly because RCA measures should not be used to make definitive conclusions whether an industry, <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector</b> is competitive, nor whether it uses scare resources efficiently. RCA measures explain in more accurate ways, relative to a simple analysis of export trends, how a country features in the context of world trade. Hence, one possible application of RCA measures is to deduce the impact of changes in trade policies on an industry, <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector.</b> Cognisance should also be taken that the RCA measures fail to distinguish between a region’s factor endowments. Finally, it appears as if both the beef and maize sub-sectors have adjusted favourably since the implementation of the Marrakech agreement and subsequent deregulation of the domestic market. Favourably in this context means that both sub-sectors appear to have discounted the changing trade and regulatory environments into their respective supply chains. The question of how competitive these sub-sectors are relative to their international counterparts however remains unanswered, and will require a more in-depth analysis of the complete chains for these sub-sectors...|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{problem for}} {{institutional}} money managers that are focussed on one <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector</b> of financial markets {{is to know}} to what degree they depend on the broad markets they aim at diversifying away from. This is a special problem for fund of fund (FoF) managers because with {{an increasing number of}} target funds, the marginal contribution from diversification decreases and active bets of target funds may be cancelled out. Furthermore, when appropriate tools to hedge or reduce risks are unavailable for the respective sectors, investments in derivatives on a more general universe or index may become necessary. Both problems make an appropriate method for estimating sector FoF risk exposure to the general markets necessary. We provide a solution for sector portfolios that is especially comforting when being applied to small datasets. Our parsimonious approach of using only short time spans for estimating broad market dependence of the sector portfolio is particularly interesting for practical applications, as it is in line with requirements in the industry where very recent and frequently updated risk measures are used and demanded for by regulators...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 to 15 years the senior living {{industry}} {{has grown to}} become a $ 315 billion nationwide business. This has spurred the development of healthcare focused {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) and large-scale senior living operators (REOCs), thus, beginning to consolidate a fragmented industry. In contrast with other real estate sectors, the REITs and REOCs are aligned or partnered with each other due to the vital focus on operational capability. They are also partnered because growth in senior living requires acquisitions of existing senior living businesses. While the large-scale operators bring their managerial expertise, the REITs bring their access to capital with which to acquire smaller operators. Despite the strong levels of growth, in the last few years, healthcare real estate is seen as a sub-sector within the core real estate sectors. With healthcare trading at the highest price to net asset value (NAV) of any real estate <b>sector</b> (<b>or</b> <b>sub-sector),</b> many investors and real estate professionals are still catching on to the idea of senior living as a highly profitable real estate investment area. It is likely the heavy operational focus (and subsequent risk) deters more real estate firms from entering the space...|$|E
40|$|With the {{technological}} advancement {{in almost every}} sphere of human life, {{there has been an}} increased tendency to focus on the conservation of scarce resources by acquiring higher levels of resource use efficiency in the production process. However, there also remains a visible element of haste in policy planning towards the achievement of these goals, particularly in the developing world. The economic viability of such haste would have been positive had this helped in reducing the social cost of delayed policy actions taken in the preceding period. Conversely, the policy planning efforts continue to be ignorant of long-term consequences of current actions, as well as deficient in integrating various components of the <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector</b> of the economy which can not be viewed in isolation. These design defects in policies are largely ignored in post-impact evaluations of programmes, and failures are often incorrectly attributed to implementation, or simply referred to as managerial snags. Nevertheless, these inherent design defects become the primary contributors towards non-sustainability of development programmes. Pakistan’s agriculture, with its declining share in the economy over time, is still the single largest sector accounting for 23 percent in the GDP. Whereas its share has steadily declined in favour of rising manufacturing and services sectors, its rate of growth has remained rather erratic. ...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{policies}} {{form the}} main economic 'buffer' between one national economy and another, i. e. the general and specific elements of each nation's trade policy interact {{directly or indirectly}} {{with those of other}} nations in all economic transactions across international borders. A nation's trade policy involves specific actions to encourage and promote or discourage foreign trade through the legal, financial and institutional environment within which foreign transactions occur. This study evaluates the trade policy applicable to the beef and maize sub-sectors in South Africa. Issues that are investigated include whether trade policy provides more or less protection than needed, whether it creates more openness for trade and the revealed comparative advantage of beef and maize. According to the RCA and RCA# the beef sub-sector in South Africa shows a revealed comparative disadvantage for 17 out of the 22 years since 1980. The maize sub-sector, on the other hand, shows a revealed comparative advantage for 18 out of the 22 years since 1980. It appears as if both the beef and maize sub-sectors have adjusted favourably since the implementation of the Marrakesh Agreement and subsequent deregulation of the domestic market. Favourably in this context means that both sub-sectors appear to have discounted the changing trade and regulatory environments into their respective supply chains. It is however important to take note that the results do not show the real state of competitiveness that exists in these sub-sectors. The {{reason for this is that}} the RCA measures should not be used to make definite conclusions whether an industry, <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector</b> in a country is competitive nor whether it uses scare resources in an efficient manner. The RCA measures explain in more accurate ways, relative to a simple analysis of export trends, how a country features in the context of word trade. Hence, one possible application of RCA measures is to deduct the impact of changes in trade policies on an industry, <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector.</b> Cognisance should also be taken that the RCA measures fail to distinguish between a region's factor endowments. The study also shows that the ERP calculation is lower than the NRP for beef and higher for maize. This means that the protection for inputs is higher than that of the output in the case of the beef sub-sector and vice versa in case of the maize sub-sector. The results from the ERP calculations show that the beef sub-sector is taxed, whilst the maize sub-sector are subsidized. Furthermore, this study recommends the market niche should be exploited more. However it is necessary to give attention to: (i) Small scale farmers (ii) Increased efficiency and (iii) Considering issues such as food safety.

40|$|The European Union has {{unilaterally}} {{decided to}} implement a cap & trade scheme to contain greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, starting on 1 January 2005. After the First Phase of the Scheme had been concluded on 31 December 2007, emissions from the sectors covered by the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) had actually increased. That {{is not enough to}} tell that the scheme didn’t work: there are too little data to perform a credible assessment. The literature on the issue is not unanimous. It seems plausible, however, that some permits over-allocation occurred in 2005, that might explain the not-so-exciting performance of the scheme. In fact, to some extent some overallocation was also acknowledged by the European Commission itself, which adopted more stringent criteria for the Second Phase of ETS (2008 - 2012). Now the criteria and the rules for the Third Phase (2013 - 2020) are being debated, with an emphasis over defining even more stringent criteria and a shift from a grandfatherin system in the initial allocation (whereby allowances are initially given free-of-charge on the basis of historical track records for emissions), towards a partial auctioning system (whereby permits are initially given to the highest bidders), with a goal of a full auctioning in 2027. At the same time, safeguard measures are being considered in order to prevent “carbon leakage” (i. e. delocalization due to higher costs of energy) in the energy-intensive economic <b>sectors</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sectors</b> that are exposed to international competition. This paper examines the guidelines for the Energy Policy for Europe by assessing its effectiveness in achieving the stated environmental targets, assuming not {{every country in the world}} will be willing to pursue similar targets. Subsequently, it identifies the major shortcomings in the European policies, that mostly depend on the complexity and possible politicization of the ETS. Finally, it reviews the possible alternatives, by emphasizing the benefits that a revenue-neutral carbon tax might deliver both in terms of reaching the environmental goals, and of the policy’s efficiency and allocational efficiency. Two models of carbon tax are considered: one defined on the basis of the expected social cost from GHGs emissions, the other dependent on a state function that measures the degree of global warming in any given year. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} Small Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) were {{introduced}} by the South African government {{by way of the}} Small Business Act No. 102 of 1996. Here SMMEs are defined as small business entities that are managed by one or more owner(s) while operating in any <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector</b> of the national economy. The main roles of SMMEs are to alleviate poverty, reduce unemployment and uplift the South African economy. South African SMMEs are responsible for employing {{more than half of the}} national workforce and are believed to contribute up to 34. 8 % towards the national Gross Domestic Product. Unfortunately an estimated 80 % of South African SMMEs fail within their first 5 years of existence; particularly due to the realisation of micro economic factors and macroeconomic factors. Included in micro economics factors which influence SMMEs is the utilisation of formal financial performance measures. For this research study the main objective of this paper was to establish the extent to which cash budgets (a formal financial performance measure) assist SMME leaders to make sound business decisions in the Cape Metropolis. The study was descriptive in nature and quantitative research methods were used to collect data from 51 SMME leaders. All respondents had to adhere to a set of pre-determined delineation criteria. From the analysed data it is evident that SMME leaders (managers and/or owners) regard cash budgets as important to make sound business decisions however, respondents made limited use thereof...|$|E
40|$|To {{address a}} gap in the {{literature}} that deals with official quality labels, the article proposes a methodology for analysis and a conceptual framework that are subsequently applied to two such quality labels from the south west region of France : ‘Volaille Fermières des Landes’ and ‘Jambon de Bayonne’. The proposed framework seeks to facilitate a comparative and historical analysis that will allow general lessons to be derived from a detailed study of individual configurations. To do so, the research question regarding the creation and development of these labels is positioned in the economic and political spheres. This allows for an examination of both the means of productive organisation and the means of legitimacy that are mobilised by the industry sectors that are concerned by such quality labels as PGI (Protected Geographic Indicator). The authors consider the PGI labels are linked to sectors or sub-sectors of activity whose structure can be interpreted using four basic conventions: effort, quality, state and finance. These conventions are declined more or less specifically depending on the <b>sector</b> <b>or</b> <b>sub-sector.</b> The analysis of the PGI labels thus focuses on the specificities of the interpretation of these conventions in each case {{in order to determine the}} degree of continuity and/or discontinuity that the adoption of the label entails. When applied to the two cases and their recent evolutions, the framework highlights in particular the key role of the quality convention. Destabilising this convention emerges as a major factor leading to economic and political restructuring of the sector concerned. PGI, Food Industries, Quality, Convention...|$|E

Therefore, it’s useful to turn back to a less visible thing, placed behind or aside of the other front stage things. It’s {{about the quality of}} the quality drivers, the quality of software, the quality into the software industry. The last thing is treated more carefully in this study and the intention is nothing else than a closer look and reveal of those elements which create some quality particularities coming up from those „specialties” of the so much particular software domain. Of course, quality principles are truly the same but their interpretation and implementation are slightly particular.
