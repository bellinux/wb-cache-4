50|$|On {{the morning}} of March 23, 1975, the 1924 high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> caught fire and burned to the ground. The school board quickly set up an {{election}} for April 17, 1975 to replace the building on a bond in excess of $200,000. The bond passed with more than the two-thirds majority needed and a new high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was built and in service the following school year. By 1980 a separate middle <b>school</b> <b>building</b> had also been added to campus and in 1983 a new gymnasium was constructed; in 1982 the gymnasium that had been attached to the 1924 high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was destroyed by fire. By {{the end of the}} 1990s increased enrollment, especially from the rural areas of the district, necessitated the need of a larger and more modern high school. With the construction and opening of this new high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> in the early 2000s, the 1975 high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> became the district’s new middle <b>school</b> <b>building</b> and elementary <b>school</b> students occupied both the 1981 middle <b>school</b> <b>building</b> and the 1965 elementary <b>school</b> <b>building,</b> which is currently the oldest building on a campus that dates its original educational origins to the 1888 bond issue.|$|R

5|$|Public {{schools in}} some {{counties}} {{in the path of}} the hurricane were scheduled to be closed for two weeks. In some areas this was necessary because the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> were damaged or destroyed: all 59of Osceola County's schools were damaged, and one-third of Charlotte County's were destroyed by Charley's impact. DeSoto County schools saw $6million in damage, while Orange County Public Schools saw $9million in damage to their educational infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E
5|$|Daman {{did most}} of its damages on Cikobia island, which has a {{population}} of around 120. Damage on Cikobia included extensive damages to houses, <b>school</b> <b>buildings,</b> crops, fruitbearing trees and foliage. Water pipes were damaged by fallen trees as a result of high winds from the storm. Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss of life was recorded due to the storm. This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia. The Fijian Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone Daman was located near Rotuma.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida {{to draw up}} a blueprint for the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard would come out of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built {{at the end of this}} boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. Desks had been used for firewood, <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on voluntary contributions from the populace.|$|E

5|$|The {{old school}} {{building}}, the Oregon Institute, burned down in December 1872 leaving University Hall {{as the only}} building on campus. As a result, all departments were housed in the building including the College of Law from 1884 to 1923 when it moved to Eaton Hall and the Medical School from 1867 until 1880 when it moved to Portland. University Hall remained the only permanent campus building from 1872 when the Oregon Institute building burned down until 1906 when the Medical Building (now Art Building) was built. Other <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> such as the first Lausanne Hall were located off campus.|$|E
5|$|When Faye {{struck the}} central {{portion of the}} Philippines, three people were {{initially}} reported as missing. The typhoon brought heavy rainfall to Luzon, resulting in overflowing rivers, which in turn flooded low-lying areas. Numerous roads and bridges were washed out. Coconut trees were uprooted, while sugarcane and rice suffered severe damage. There, damage to crops, <b>school</b> <b>buildings,</b> and fish ponds totaled $1.5million. When the typhoon veered toward the island nation for the second time, school classes were briefly halted and six flights of the Philippine Airlines were called off. Typhoon warnings were posted {{for much of the}} northern portion of the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary <b>school</b> <b>buildings,</b> with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|Local {{chapters}} of the American Red Cross organized first-aid stations and shelters; transportation was provided {{to those who were}} unable to reach the shelters. In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba. The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves, while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland. The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort Myers, and the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers from the Florida Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm. The state also opened all of the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> in Dade County as emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in Oahu. Public <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.|$|E
