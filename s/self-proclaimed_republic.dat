5|$|Nationalism in Soviet Georgia gained {{momentum}} in 1989 with {{the weakening of}} the Soviet Union. The Kremlin endorsed South Ossetian nationalism as a counter against the Georgian independence movement. On 11 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Georgia, responding to South Ossetia's attempt at secession, abolished the region's autonomy. Georgia declared its restoration of independence on 9 April 1991, thus becoming the first non-Baltic state of the Soviet Union to do so. A military conflict, which had broken out between Georgia and South Ossetia in January 1991, lasted until June 1992. The separatists were aided by the former Soviet military units now under Russian command. By June 1992, {{the possibility of a}} full-scale war between Russia and Georgia increased as bombing of Georgian capital Tbilisi in support of South Ossetian separatists was promised by Russian authorities. In order to prevent the escalation between Russia and Georgia, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 24 June 1992. Georgian, South Ossetian, Russian and North Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetian conflict zone under the Joint Control Commission's (JCC) mandate. Some, mostly ethnically Georgian parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast remained under the Georgian control. The Tskhinvali-based separatist authorities of the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of South Ossetia were in control of one third of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast before the 2008 war.|$|E

5|$|The Russo-Georgian War was a {{war between}} Georgia, Russia and the Russian-backed <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>republics</b> of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The war took place in August 2008 {{following}} a period of worsening relations between Russia and Georgia, both formerly constituent republics of the Soviet Union. The fighting {{took place in the}} strategically important Transcaucasia region. It was regarded as the first European war of the 21st century.|$|R

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{ethnic cleansing}} accompanying the Croatian War of Independence that was committed by Serb-led JNA and rebel militia {{in the occupied}} areas of Croatia (<b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of Serbian Krajina) (1991–1995). Large numbers of Croats and non-Serbs were removed, either by murder, deportation or by being forced to flee. According to the ICTY indictment against Slobodan Milosevic, there was an expulsion of around 170,000 Croats and other non-Serbs from their home, {{in addition to an}} estimated 10,000 Croats that were also killed.|$|E
25|$|The ousting of Yanukovych {{prompted}} Vladimir Putin {{to begin}} preparations to annex Crimea on 23 February 2014. Using the Russian naval base at Sevastopol as cover, Putin directed Russian troops and intelligence agents to disarm Ukrainian forces and {{take control of}} Crimea. After the troops entered Crimea, a controversial referendum was held on 16 March 2014 and the official result was that 97 percent wished to join with Russia. On 18 March 2014, Russia and the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of Crimea signed a treaty of accession of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in the Russian Federation. The UN general assembly responded by passing resolution 68/262 that the referendum was invalid and supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine.|$|E

On February 18, 2015 DPR authorities announced the establishment of their control over the city. Alexander Afendikov was appointed to the post of mayor. On February 19 restoration work began.|$|R
25|$|By mid-June 1919, however, Armenia {{succeeded in}} {{establishing}} control over Nakhchivan {{and the whole}} territory of the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>republic.</b> The fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army {{and by the end}} of July, Armenian troops were forced to leave Nakhchivan City to the Azeris. Again, more violence erupted leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed. Meanwhile, feeling the situation to be hopeless and unable to maintain any control over the area, the British decided to withdraw from the region in mid-1919. Still, fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued and after a series of skirmishes that took place throughout the Nakhchivan district, a cease-fire agreement was concluded. However, the cease-fire lasted only briefly, and by early March 1920, more fighting broke out, primarily in Karabakh between Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijan's regular army. This triggered conflicts in other areas with mixed populations, including Nakhchivan.|$|E
25|$|At around 19:00 on 7 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili {{announced a}} unilateral ceasefire {{and called for}} peace talks. However, escalating assaults against Georgian villages (located in the South Ossetian conflict zone) were soon matched with gunfire from Georgian troops, who then proceeded {{to move in the}} direction of the capital of the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of South Ossetia (Tskhinvali) on the night of 8 August, reaching its centre in the morning of 8 August. One Georgian diplomat told Russian newspaper Kommersant on 8 August that by taking control of Tskhinvali, Tbilisi wanted to demonstrate that Georgia wouldn't tolerate killing of Georgian citizens. According to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer, the Ossetian provocation was aimed at triggering the Georgian response, which was needed as a pretext for premeditated Russian military invasion. According to Georgian intelligence, and several Russian media reports, parts of the regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian Army had already moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military action.|$|E
500|$|The JNA {{initially}} {{tried to}} keep Croatia within Yugoslavia by occupying all of Croatia. [...] After this failed, Serb forces established the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of Serbian Krajina (RSK) within Croatia. After the ceasefire of January 1992 and international recognition of the Republic of Croatia as a sovereign state, the front lines were entrenched, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed, and combat became largely intermittent in the following three years. During that time, the RSK encompassed , {{more than a quarter}} of Croatia. In 1995, Croatia launched two major offensives known as Operation Flash and Operation Storm, which would effectively end the war in its favor. The remaining United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) zone was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia by 1998.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>republics</b> that act {{similarly}} to monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and {{passed down from}} father to son. North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control. Neither of these states are officially monarchies. There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has occurred in practice.|$|R

500|$|On June 2, 1992, the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of Artsakh, a {{de facto}} {{independent}} republic in South Caucasus claimed by Azerbaijan, adopted a flag derived from the flag of Armenia, with only a white pattern added. A white, five-toothed, stepped carpet pattern {{was added to the}} flag, beginning at the two verges of the cloth's right side and connecting at a point equal to one-third of the distance from that side. The white pattern symbolizes the current separation of Artsakh from Armenia proper and its aspiration for eventual union with [...] "the Fatherland". This symbolises the Armenian heritage, culture and population of the area and represents Artsakh as being a separated region of Armenia by the triangular shape and the zigzag cutting through the flag. The pattern is also similar to the designs used on rugs. The ratio of the flag's breadth to its length is 1:2, same as the Armenian Tricolor.|$|E
2500|$|August 8 - After {{returning}} fire, Georgian troops advanced {{towards the}} capital of the <b>self-proclaimed</b> <b>Republic</b> of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali, during the night. President Saakashvili later stated that Russia had already sent tanks to South Ossetia before he gave the order for Georgian forces to launch a military operation. Several hours after Georgian troops had assaulted Tskhinvali, Russia attacked Georgia, claiming to be conducting [...] "peace enforcement" [...] operation to defend peacekeepers and civilians. Russian military captured Tskhinvali in five days and expelled Georgian forces. Russia also launched airstrikes against military infrastructure in Georgia. Russia justified its actions by Georgia's [...] "aggression" [...] and perpetration of [...] "genocide" [...] in South Ossetia.|$|E
