25|$|Social work is an {{academic}} discipline and profession that concerns itself with individuals, families, groups and communities {{in an effort}} to enhance social functioning and overall well-being. Social functioning refers {{to the way in which}} people perform their social roles, and the structural institutions that are provided to sustain them. Social work applies social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, political science, public health, community development, law, and economics, to engage with client systems, conduct assessments, and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems; and create social change. <b>Social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> is often divided into micro-work, which involves working directly with individuals or small groups; and macro-work, which involves working communities, and within social policy, to create change on a larger scale.|$|E

40|$|This study {{indicated}} {{that the number of}} studies on psychiatric <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> has not necessarily been increased compared to those of social welfare since psychiatric social workers became nationally certified. Psychiatric <b>social</b> <b>work</b> is a field of interdisciplinary studies. This interdisciplinarity has an advantage in solving problems proactively through multidisciplinary cooperation; however, this also has the disadvantage of having to gather them in one place when performing academic conceptualization and theorization of practices developed in this field. Thus, the result showed in the beginning does not mean that studies on psychiatric <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> have not been advanced, but rather that outcomes of psychiatric social studies have dispersed to different fields of study, and have not been systematically accumulated. The lives of people with mental illness can be improved, if we can academically integrate psychiatric <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices,</b> and effectively disseminate knowledge and skills. To achieve that, much attention must be paid to improving the quality of each study as well as accumulating them...|$|R
40|$|Although {{self-determination}} {{of clients}} is paramount in <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices,</b> respect for it often {{runs counter to}} social benefit when providing assistance, and difficulties frequently arise when it is prioritized exclusively. Accordingly, measures have become necessary for avoiding opposition between the diverse senses of values of e. g. clients and social workers. After first elucidating what characterizes values in <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices,</b> we consider concrete measures for consensus building in such cases. Although subjects possessing values vary widely, normative values play important roles in supporting <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> when viewed in terms of standards of normalized values and those of real phenomena such as decisions and consequent actions. However, processes by which real phenomena affect normative values also exist. We revealed that consensus building approaches where the client’s sense of value diverges from others’ {{can be divided into}} three types: 1. Measures to rethink senses of values dominant in society; 2. Measures to create novel, shared senses of values; and 3. Measures to make clients internalize changed senses of values. These three measures do not unilaterally coerce one side to a specific sense of values, but rather involve cooperation among all related parties to find a shared course of action, as in consensus building. If consensus building in <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> is understood from a sense of value perspective, it can be considered as a process for discovering best practices that incorporate various senses of values and achieving mutual understanding while respecting individual senses of values...|$|R

2500|$|Social {{work with}} groups {{represents}} a broad domain of direct <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> (Garvin, Gutierrez & Galinskey, 2004). Social workers {{work with a}} variety of groups in all settings in which social work is practiced. While some have proposed that <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> with groups reflects any and all groups within which social workers participate, other definitional parameters have been established (Garvin et al., 2004). Middleman and Wood (1990) have proposed that for practice to qualify as social work with groups four conditions must be met: the worker should focus attention on helping the group members become a system of mutual aid; the group worker must understand the role of the group process itself as the primary force responsible for individual and collective change; the group worker seeks to enhance group autonomy; the group worker helps the group members experience their groupness upon termination (Middleman & Wood, 1990).

2500|$|After psychotherapy, {{social work}} is the most {{important}} beneficiary of the humanistic psychology's theory and methodology.

Most values and principles of the humanistic <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice,</b> described by Malcolm Payne in his book Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice, namely creativity in human life and practice, developing self and spirituality, developing security and resilience, accountability, flexibility and complexity in human life and practice, directly originate from the humanistic psychological theory and humanistic psychotherapy practice.|$|E

40|$|This paper examines, then disproves, {{the claim}} that <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> based upon postmodern thought are either anti-science, {{or at the very}} least, weak on their respect for and {{application}} of scientific knowledge. Postmodern thought does attack the epistemological theory of positivism as well as the correspondence theory of truth. Hence, postmodern <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> do seek to displace the role that scientific knowledge plays in guiding the helping situation. Rather than diagnosing causes and effects in a problem-solving endeavor, science is used to circumscribe the boundaries within which a postmodern endeavor at consciousness- raising takes place.

2500|$|Although {{social work}} has been {{historically}} defined by these institutionalized and deinstitutionalized periods, informal community design programs have always existed. In fact, informal community-based programs predate human service applications of this approach. In 1990, Bernice Harper illustrated {{this point in the}} book <b>Social</b> <b>Work</b> <b>Practice</b> with Black Families: A Culturally Specific Perspective in regards to African American communities, by writing that: Blacks have always cared for the sick at home, yet it was never labeled 'home care.' Blacks have been dying at home and receiving care in the process, yet it was never called 'hospice care.' Blacks have relieved each other from the caring and curing processes, yet it was never seen as 'respite care.'
