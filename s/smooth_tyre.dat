40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} study of tyre/road contact {{within the framework of}} rolling noise prediction. A macro-scale approach based on inter-summit contact description between road asperities is used for solving the contact problem between a real road surface and an elastic half-space representing the tyre tread. For efficient applications to road surfaces, an appropriate partition of the surface has been used in addition with an analytical load/penetration relation for a single road asperity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the method, numerical contact forces for a small sample of road are compared to those obtained with a classical matrix inversion method. It is concluded that the model is accurate enough to predict tyre/road contact forces for rolling noise estimation. Then numerical evaluation of dynamical contact forces for a <b>smooth</b> <b>tyre</b> rolling on a road surface over several meters is presented, allowing the calculation of force spectra...|$|E
40|$|In {{the aim of}} {{reducing}} noise emissions, {{it is important to}} better understand and model tyre rolling noise which is the main source of traffic noise at medium and high speed. Air pumping is a major source of tyre/road contact noise. This noise source is still not well understood and includes several mechanisms. In this context, a modelling approach using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is presented. The approach consists of highlighting some mechanisms of air pumping occurring in the cavities at the contact area without any volume variation. The dynamic deformation of the rubber is not considered. The goal is to model some phenomena such as air compression and air drainage by considering air flow in the contact zone. A 3 D CFD model of air compression and release phenomena caused by the rolling of a <b>smooth</b> <b>tyre</b> over road cavities is implemented. The model is applied to academic configurations such as a cylindrical cavity and an open transversal groove. The noise reduction due to the ventilation of the contact zone by a longitudinal groove is also investigated. This work shows the relevance of modelling air flow to study air pumping, and gives further insights into this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Internoise 2014, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIE, 16 -/ 11 / 2014 - 19 / 11 / 2014 Several {{mechanisms}} {{induced by}} the tyre/road interaction contribute to the generation of rolling noise. The road texture has {{a significant role in}} this process, together with the possible porosity of the road pavement. The latter may influence the noise sources in the high frequency range in which air pumping is supposed to contribute. Even on dense road surfaces with no vertical porosity, possible air flow allowed by the road texture in the contact patch is equivalent to the effect of a so-called 'lateral' porosity which is reckoned to have an influence on the source strength. In this paper, the effect of this lateral porosity is studied with a modelling approach using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This approach allows the highlighting of some phenomena occurring in the contact patch such as air compression due to the tyre rolling process or air drainage. Simulations are carried out for a <b>smooth</b> <b>tyre</b> and road textures made of more or less connected cavities. A parametric study is presented {{in the case of a}} 2 D academic configuration to show the influence of air flow resistance in the contact zone on air pumping noise. Finally, air pumping mechanism is simulated for a 3 D configuration...|$|E
40|$|Most {{traditional}} tyre models {{concern the}} low and middle frequency ranges. For improved accuracy in tyre/road interaction models {{it is necessary}} to include higher frequencies. Often only the radial direction is included, although the tangential direction may be important, especially studying stick slip motion in the contact between tyre and road surface. Designing accurate and efifcient models requires insight into the behaviour of the tyre structure at higher frequencies to make the models as complete as necessary without creating tools that are computationally too costly. To add insight to this area, experimental studies were done on four different tyres with the same internal design but with different tread patterns. Point mobilities were measured and compared with two different tyre models, a two-layer plate model based on the elastic field equations and an orthotropic plate model. The results of this study underline the importance of the local deformation when there are forces that act with small excitation areas on the tread. Adequate consideration of the tread properties in the tyre/road interaction models is thus of extreme importance to obtain the correct local contact force distribution. This is most important for the tangential driving point mobility. Tread patterns are shown mainly to modify the flexural stiffness in comparison to <b>smooth</b> <b>tyres,</b> while block resonances are not expected to be located in the frequency range in which tyre/road noise is important...|$|R
40|$|The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV {{carried out}} an {{inspection}} of the tyres of approximately 6000 cars in the Netherlands during November 1976 {{in order to measure}} their tread-depths. The sample was taken at the parking lots of roadside restaurants, motels, and modern shopping centres and showed a slight bias in favour of newer cars. By weighting the sample a representative picture was obtained for all cars used on the roads. The weighting was carried out using data from the monthly car survey of the central bureau of statistics in the Netherlands. The percentage of cars with <b>smooth</b> tread <b>tyres</b> was much smaller than obtained by other inspections of select samples. Only 1. 3 per cent of the cars had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1 mm (the legal minimum); a further 4. 9 per cent had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of 1 to 1. 6 mm. These percentages were slightly lower than the results which the SWOV obtained in 1974 during a comparable inspection. There are indications that the situation in 1979 hardly differs from that in 1976. Although the percentage of <b>smooth</b> tread <b>tyres</b> is small, the annual number of fatal and injury accidents in the Netherlands would decline by about 500 if all tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1. 6 mm were to be replaced. The SWOV emphasizes that an insufficient tread-depth is not the only tyre aspect which threatens the safety of car occupants. Other tyre characteristics which can {{have a negative effect on}} road safety are: low tyre pressure, dried-out tyres, holes and tears, irregular wear, and combining diagonal-ply and radial-ply tyres on the same car...|$|R

40|$|Free {{and forced}} {{vibrations}} of a tyre are predicted using a wave/finite element (WFE) approach. A short circumferential {{segment of the}} tyre is modelled using conventional finite element (FE) methods, a periodicity condition applied and the mass and stiffness matrices post-processed to yield wave properties. Since conventional FE methods are used, commercial FE packages and existing element libraries can be utilised. An eigenvalue problem is formulated {{in terms of the}} transfer matrix of the segment. Zhong's method is used to improve numerical conditioning. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors give the wavenumbers and wave mode shapes, which in turn define transformations between the physical and wave domains. A method is described by which the frequency dependent material properties of the rubber components of the tyre can be included without the need to remesh the structure. Expressions for the forced response are developed which are numerically well-conditioned. Numerical results for a <b>smooth</b> <b>tyre</b> are presented. Dispersion curves for real, imaginary and complex wavenumbers are shown. The propagating waves are associated with various forms of motion of the tread supported by the stiffness of the side wall. Various dispersion phenomena are observed, including curve veering, non-zero cut-off and waves for which the phase velocity and the group velocity have opposite signs. Results for the forced response are compared with experimental measurements and good agreement is seen. The forced response is numerically determined for both finite area and point excitations. It is seen that the size of area of the excitation is particularly important at high frequencies. When the size of the excitation area is small enough compared to the tread thickness, the response at high frequencies becomes stiffness-like (reactive) and the effect of shear stiffness becomes importan...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in the design, construction and utilization of rubber tracks for agriculture and earth moving machinery has increased considerably. The development of such types of tracks was initiated by the efforts to invent a more environmentally friendly vehicle-terrain system. These tracks are also {{the result of the}} continuous effort to develop more cost-effective traction systems. A rubber-surfaced and friction-based prototype track was developed and mounted on the patented modification of a new Allis Chalmers four wheel drive tractor. The track is propelled by <b>smooth</b> pneumatic <b>tyres</b> by means of rubber-rubber friction and the tractive effort of the track is mainly generated by soil-rubber friction between the rubber surface of the track elements and terrain. The experimental track layer tractor, based on an Allis Chalmers 8070 tractor (141 kW) was tested on concrete and on cultivated sandy loam soil at 7. 8 %; 13 % and 21 % soil water content. The contact pressure and the tangential force on an instrumented track element, as well as the total torque input to one track, was simultaneously recorded during the drawbar pull-slip tests. Soil characteristics for pressure-sinkage and friction-displacement were obtained from the field tests by using an instrumented linear shear and soil sinkage device. By applying the approach based on the classical bevameter technique, analytical methods were implemented for modelling the traction performance of the prototype track system. Different possible pressure distribution profiles under the tracks were considered and compared to the recorded data. Two possible traction models were proposed, one constant pressure model, for minimal inward track deflection and the other a flexible track model with inward deflection and a higher contact pressure at both the front free-wheeling and rear driving tyres. For both models, the traction force was mainly generated by rubber-soil friction and adhesion with limited influence by soil shear. For individual track elements, close agreement between the measured and predicted contact pressure and traction force was observed based on the flexible track model. The recorded and calculated values of the coefficient of traction based on the summation of the traction force for the series of track elements were comparable to the values predicted from modelling. However, the measured values of drawbar pull coefficient were considerably lower than the predicted values, largely caused by internal track friction in addition to energy dissipated by soil compaction. The tractive efficiency for soft surface was also unacceptably low, probably due to the high internal track friction and the low travel speeds applied for the tests. The research undertaken identified and confirmed a model to be used to predict contact pressure and tangential stresses for a single track element. It was capable of predicting the tractive performance for different possible contact pressure values. Thesis (PhD (Argricultural Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|High {{frequency}} (above 1 kHz) {{noise generation}} from the tyre/road interaction {{is still not}} fully understood and accurately modelled. Two noise generation mechanisms previously suggested in the literature are reviewed: air pumping and noise generation cased by adhesive effects between the tyre tread and road surface. These mechanisms are located in and near the tyre/road contact zone, and a deterministic description of these mechanisms requires a tyre model that is able to describe the high frequency behaviour of the tyre, including local deformation in both the radial and tangential directions. A three-dimensional two-layer plate tyre model based on the elastic field equations is suggested as a model that would fulfil these requirements. This model was developed earlier [1], and is now extended to allow for comparison to mobility measurements on real tyres. The overall agreement between the model and measurements is surprisingly good {{in view of the}} simplicity of the model. However, some limitations of the model are also presented. The tyre model is used in two investigations focusing on the dynamic behaviour of tyres in both the radial and tangential directions in the frequency range from 50 Hz to 4 kHz; (i) investigation of the dynamic behaviour of <b>smooth</b> and patterned <b>tyres</b> at high frequencies for both radial and tangential directions, and (ii) a parameter study investigating the relation between internal tyre parameters and the response at the outermost surface. It was found that the radial point mobility is greatly influenced by properties of the local deformation at high frequencies and/or small excitation areas. The tangential point mobility is affected by local deformation in almost the whole frequency range. Hence, it is mainly the properties of the tread cap and the pattern that determine the response at high frequencies and in the tangential direction. The radial response is determined by the combined properties of the belt and the tread cap at medium frequencies, while it is the dimension and the pre-tension in the plies that determines the low frequency response...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the grip of winter tyres on ice and snow deteriorates with age {{to such an extent that}} winter tyres above a certain age e. g. 10 years should be {{forbidden}} to use. Little research data do however exist. This investigation has been carried out by VTI in order to get a better background for legal decisions. The results would also be of use for ordinary consumers as a guidance. This investigation that was carried out on wet smooth ice is the third of three part studies. The first was on smooth ice at - 3 °C and the second on rough ice at - 3 °C. They have been reported in VTI meddelande 923 and VTI notat 34 - 2003. The aim of the investigation is to investigate the correlation between ice grip of winter tyres and their age, tread depth and tread rubber hardness and for studded tyres also stud protrusion and stud force. The investigation comprises 23 studded and 42 non studded winter tyres and four summer tyres mainly of the in Sweden popular brands Gislaved, Michelin and Good Year, primarily of size 195 / 65 R 15. Most of the tyres had been driven in ordinary traffic and were manufactured from 1981 to 2003. A small number of new winter tyres were also tested. As reference some new summer tyres were tested as well. The steering and braking performance of the tyres has been measured in a special climate controlled indoor high speed flat bed test facility developed by the VTI. Very good correlation has earlier been found between results from the facility and lap time results from ice track circuit tests with cars as well as pure braking and cornering tests with cars on ice tracks. No age related deterioration of the ice grip was found for the fully studded winter tyres with stud protrusion 1 mm and higher. The ice grip deteriorated with increasing age for non studded winter tyres and studded tyres with stud protrusion less than 0, 9 mm. The results also show that on wet <b>smooth</b> ice studded <b>tyres</b> with stud protrusion 1 mm and higher are much superior to non studded tyres including the specialised studless winter tyres often called "friction tyres". The differences in friction within the groups are however quite large...|$|R
40|$|The regular {{tyre tread}} pattern design process is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior tyre tread pattern noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important tyre tread pattern noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on <b>smooth</b> roads, the <b>tyre</b> tread pattern geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three tyre tread pattern noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior tyre tread pattern noise. From these tyre tread pattern noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the tyre tread pattern noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of tyre tread patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of tyre tread pattern sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current tyre tread patter design process...|$|R
