5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E

25|$|After Henry Cow disbanded in 1978, Cutler created Recommended Records in London, an {{independent}} label and distribution network for RIO artists. The record label quickly filled the gap left by commercial labels and {{soon began to}} also release non-RIO bands and musicians. Recommended Records's aim was to produce records of high technical and musical quality, placing the musicians' interests first and profits second. This strategy, however, led to the label experiencing financial difficulties from time to time, but it stuck to its principles and has survived for over 25 years. There {{are a number of}} musicians whose work would never have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day {{had it not been for}} Cutler's label.|$|E
500|$|Kurosawa {{decided to}} write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less {{expensive}} to produce. The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail, based on the Kabuki play Kanjinchō and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the occupation of Japan had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly [...] "feudal" [...] and banned the work. (It would not be released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, Ikiru, was also released.) Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and [...] "democratic" [...] (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most {{probably would not have}} <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 23, 1910. The film had a wide national release, theaters which showed the film are noted in Indiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. Reviews of the film were mixed, with the The Moving Picture World describing the film as a [...] "heart story which will interest because it presents more or less unpleasant possibilities of this character. The acting is well done, and the film will prove popular with most audiences." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer found the film to be interesting, but stated that it [...] "would have seemed more natural had [...] not recognized [...] as her son until the appearance of , into whose care she had given her child. If two of the scenes had been broken {{it might have been}} more consistent. The men came up to plot their robbery too soon after Jack's hiding.

500|$|Roughly a {{year into}} development, the team {{discovered}} that their second producer—the first having quit Origin {{near the beginning of}} development—had left the project. Neurath later said that [...] "neither [...] had much involvement" [...] in the game, and that, following the second's departure, the team spent time without any producer at all. Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue, assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as [...] "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, [...] "Warren understood immediately {{what we were trying to}} accomplish with the game, and became our biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure Ultima Underworld would have ever <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day." [...] Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and [...] "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game.

2500|$|Leonardo da Vinci {{through his}} Virgin of the Rocks (1483–1486, Louvre, Paris) {{influenced}} {{the use of}} chiaroscuro {{to create the illusion}} of depth however, the term is most often associated with the works created in Mannerism and Baroque. In the Renaissance, the technique became essential to all [...] "religious" [...] painters who followed the visions of Bridget of Sweden, who claimed to have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of Christ. In the paintings with religious scenes, the Renaissance artists reassigned this holy light as the predominant source of illumination, relying heavily on the chiaroscuro technique. This compositional approach has been extensively used in The Last Supper of Tintoretto (1592–1594). If the religious chiaroscuro of the Renaissance served to create quiet and calm scenes, painters such as Caravaggio, Baglione, Veronese, and Georges de La Tour, had the tendency to use this style for a dramatic effect.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the proper}} {{interval}} {{between themselves and}} the Lights had developed, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade forward. The Heavies were also hit—Lucan himself [...] was slightly wounded, and his horse hit twice – but these men would have suffered more casualties {{had it not been}} for the charge of [...] the 150 men of the Chasseurs d'Afrique. The French cavalry had formed up to the left of the British position. When they had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Brigade cut up, Major Abdelal led an attack up the Fedioukine Heights to charge the flank of the Russian battery, forcing them to drag away their guns. Yet it was now that Lucan – concluding that the Light Brigade would be wiped out before they reached the Russians at the end of the valley — ordered the Heavy Brigade to halt their advance and retire, leaving Cardigan's men without support. Turning to Lord Paulet, he justified his action and his desire to preserve at least half of his cavalry division, [...] "They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not have the Heavy, if I can help it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Christopher A. Hartwell {{provided}} a critical {{assessment of the}} book in a review published in German Studies Review. He described the book as [...] "interesting, but ultimately disappointing" [...] and argued that the authors committed several egregious errors, with the most prominent being the whitewash of Red Army crimes on the Eastern Front, while denigrating those [...] who do mention them [...] "as contributing to the exoneration of the Wehrmacht". He noted that the book tends to suffer {{from a lack of}} perspective [...] "on the effect the German generals had on the broader American perception of the war [...]" [...] Furthermore, Hartwell stated that the effect and influence of those [...] "romancers" [...] on American culture was not [...] "impressively support" [...] in the thesis, and the case that [...] "romancers" [...] were able to [...] "effectively spread the myth of the innocent Wehrmacht" [...] was not made out. Due to the lack of perspective, the book tended to lump together [...] "those with an interest in military history and those who actually subscribe to neo-Nazi beliefs", and Hartwell concluded: [...] "As it stands now, however, this tome has the feel of a dissertation that is trying too hard to find a niche that hasn't <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day".|$|E

2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour. In some instances, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wore T-shirts depicting Jackson during the performances.|$|E
