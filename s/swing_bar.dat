5000|$|Lowers {{the speed}} of the <b>swing</b> <b>bar,</b> making it easier to hit the [...] "sweet spot".|$|E
50|$|Having {{more of the}} Accuracy Stat {{reduces the}} {{distance}} a ball will travel once it lands, decreases {{the speed of the}} <b>swing</b> <b>bar,</b> reduces the possible landing area of any given shot. In addition to this Accuracy also increases the total size of the “sweet spot” on the <b>swing</b> <b>bar.</b> The more Accuracy a character has, the more Mentality will be used with each shot.|$|E
50|$|The higher a character’s Power Stat {{the farther}} {{you will be}} able hit the ball, and the farther the ball will roll once it lands. In {{addition}} to this, Power makes the <b>swing</b> <b>bar</b> move faster, increases the possible landing area of any given shot, and decreases the size of the “sweet spot” on the <b>swing</b> <b>bar.</b> The more Power a character has, the more Stamina will be used with each shot as well.|$|E
5000|$|X Knocks The Spot: Players {{stand on}} a platform, across from their partner, {{in the shape of}} an [...] "X," [...] and have to jump over and duck under <b>swinging</b> <b>bars.</b> A team loses if both {{partners}} fall off their individual platforms.|$|R
50|$|As Giselle, {{the player}} uses the control pad to {{navigate}} through {{the game by}} performing cartwheels, climbing walls, and <b>swinging</b> on <b>bars.</b>|$|R

50|$|The actual {{game of golf}} {{makes use}} of a {{standard}} 3 click <b>swing</b> <b>bar</b> seen in many other golf games. Players click once to start their swing, again to set power, and a third time to set the accuracy of their shot.|$|E
50|$|Determines {{the size}} of the character’s Mentality Pool. The amount of Mentality used per shot is {{proportional}} to the amount of the Accuracy statistic a character has. Having more Accuracy will increase the amount of Mentality used. If your Mentality is reduced to 10% or less of its total pool size, your <b>swing</b> <b>bar</b> will move much faster while putting.|$|E
50|$|Prior to World War II, Brach's {{produced}} several candy bars, {{including a}} chocolate-covered, honeycombed, peanut butter <b>Swing</b> <b>Bar</b> {{as well as}} a mint and almond nougat bar. After the war Brach's concentrated on bulk and bagged candies. It was in the period after the war that Halloween Trick or Treating became a popular activity. Brach's promoted its candy corn and other fall-themed candies, available in single-serve, pre-packaged packets.|$|E
5000|$|Out On A Limb: A structure, {{with four}} platforms, is {{suspended}} 30 {{feet above the}} water. Each team must advance in unison from platform to platform by using a <b>swinging</b> <b>bar,</b> {{and there will be}} a bell at the end of the last platform in which each team must ring. Each successive platform becomes farther and more difficult for each team to reach. The team to advance the farthest or ring the bell in the fastest time wins, while the last-place team is automatically sent to The Jungle.|$|R
50|$|Although {{not seen}} on all {{chainsaw}}s, when present chainsaw dogs are mounted where the bar meets the power head. Chainsaw dogs provide stability {{and serve as}} a sort of fulcrum for <b>swinging</b> the <b>bar</b> through the item being cut.|$|R

50|$|The Fairview Regional Aquatic Centre was a $3.4M {{collaborative}} project taken {{on by the}} Town of Fairview and the M.D. of Fairview No. 136. The facility has a waterslide, a zero depth wading pool, a 25m lap pool, a tarzan <b>swing,</b> monkey <b>bars,</b> a whirlpool, and a climbing wall. The facility {{is home to the}} Fairview Olympians swim club and offers various programming.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding the {{apparent}} certainty {{of the young}} man, instead of going forth to meet his friends, he withdrew a step, and with his own hand drew the bolt that Faith had just desired might be fastened; taking care {{at the same time}} to let fall a <b>swinging</b> <b>bar</b> of wood, which gave additional security to the fastenings of the postern. His apprehensions, if any such had induced this caution, were however unnecessary; for ere he had time to make, or even to reflect on any further movement, admission was demanded in the well-known voice of the son of him who owned the valley. The bustle of the arrival, for with Content entered a group of companions loaded with venison, put an end to the dialogue. Faith seized the opportunity to glide away in the obscurity, in order to announce to her mistress that the hunters had returned--an office that she performed without entering at all into the particulars of her own interview with Eben Dudley.|$|R
6000|$|... "How about a <b>swing</b> {{from one}} <b>bar</b> to the next?" [...] called out Ned Lowe. Ned {{was known as}} the chief singer of the school and was very handy with a mandolin.|$|R
30|$|Top-coal caving {{hydraulic}} support {{is a key}} equipment for LTCC operations. During the last 20  years, top-coal caving {{hydraulic support}} was gradually developed from high position top-coal caving support, middle position top-coal caving support, to low position top-coal caving support. Currently, the low position top-coal caving support is widely used, which is a chock-shield hydraulic support with positive four-link bar, reverse four-link <b>bar</b> and single <b>swing</b> link <b>bar.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{are faced}} with a {{challenge}} that evening. Three contestants from each team have to compete. The challenge is an endurance test where the contestants have to keep ducking under or jumping over a <b>swinging</b> <b>bar.</b> Contact with the bar will cause it to break and eliminate the contestant. Roger hits his bar and is out first. Bernie is second. The challenge goes {{for a long time and}} Roger tries to broker a deal with the Black Team to make it a draw. They do not accept. Dan is then eliminated, leaving only Jay for the Blue team against Maggie and Brittany. The next one out is Maggie. Brittany claims she will never give up and she is correct. After several more rounds, Jay finally gets out and Brittany wins for the Black team. The prize was that the Black Team gets to pick two players from the Blue Team to weigh in immediately — 24 hours earlier than everyone else, thus losing the benefits of a last chance workout.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work 1 {{was to develop a}} new 2 D gymnast - high bar model with {{horizontal}} bar endpoint dynamics included. To this end, a three-spring high bar model was extended with a 5 segment gymnast model followed by validation and sensitivity analysis. Validation over a complete giant <b>swing</b> was favourable (<b>bar</b> position rms errors < 0. 017 m, centre of mass angular position rms error < 11 °). Single parameter perturbations (10 %) caused little deterioration in model performance (lower half of giant <b>swing,</b> - <b>bar</b> position rms errors < 0. 006 m, arms' angle rms error < 0. 9 °). Combinations of parameter perturbations gave bar position rms errors < 0. 008 m and arms' angle rms error < 1. 8 °. Model performance was most sensitive to errors in high bar stiffness values...|$|R
60|$|<b>Swinging</b> {{the heavy}} <b>bar</b> once around he struck {{the bottom of}} the joist which {{supported}} the shoring over head, and the heavy timbers, put up insecurely because they were to be used but temporarily, fell with a crash.|$|R
5000|$|Cordes adds proudly: [...] "I {{learned to}} <b>swing</b> on monkey <b>bars</b> — which I {{could not see}} well — over asphalt. I learned that if you fall it hurts, so {{you try not to}} fall. But it’s still worth swinging." ...|$|R
50|$|A small extension, {{known locally}} as the Aldi Park and/or the Co-Op Park, is set across the road by the town's Aldi store. Both parks have many facilities, {{including}} monkey <b>bars,</b> <b>swings,</b> football pitches and basketball courts. Together the three parks measure approx. 45,000m2.|$|R
50|$|Mitchell Playground {{was both}} {{the first public}} {{playground}} in Charleston {{as well as in}} South Carolina. The park served the upper wards of Charleston predominantly, but it was convenient to the main trolley lines too. The park was a turf field surrounded by a hedge and shade trees with gates into the playground at each corner. Paths crossed diagonally through the park. Equipment included <b>swings,</b> monkey <b>bars,</b> and joggling boards. The playground had live tennis courts, a basketball court, a football field, and other amenities.|$|R
60|$|Still Carl sat aloof {{on a pair}} of {{horizontal}} <b>bars,</b> <b>swinging</b> his legs with agitated quickness, while the others covertly watched him--slim, wire-drawn, his china-blue eyes blurred with fury, his fair Norse skin glowing dull red, his chest strong under his tight football jersey; a clean-carved boy.|$|R
50|$|The Playground of Dreams has {{a wooden}} castle-like {{structure}} with artwork {{that looks like}} a spaceship, farm, house and pirate ship along with more local themes including the Blue Bridge and the Cable Bridge. There is also a <b>swing</b> set, monkey <b>bars,</b> climbing wall and an obstacle course.|$|R
50|$|The {{gameplay}} of Tomb Raider Chronicles {{is closely}} tied to that of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. Lara now can walk on a tightrope, grab and <b>swing</b> on horizontal <b>bars,</b> and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. Lara sports a new camouflage snow-suit and a black catsuit suitable for infiltration.|$|R

50|$|The {{playground}} has {{a pirate}} ship that is {{adorned with a}} Lake Michigan design. It is also outfitted with a lighthouse, monkey <b>bars,</b> <b>swings,</b> a sandbox, balance beams, as well as tunnels and a police car. Some of the swings are specially fashioned to give more support to children who have little muscle strength.|$|R
50|$|A {{playground}} {{surface is}} {{the material that}} lies under and around <b>swings,</b> slides, monkey <b>bars</b> and other playground equipment. The surfaces are usually made of wood or rubber and designed specifically for aesthetics, child safety, and/or ADA wheelchair accessibility. Playground safety surfacing often {{involves the use of}} recycled rubber tire products such as poured rubber, rubber tiles or loose rubber mulch.|$|R
60|$|The snow {{continued}} the next day, {{and it was}} so windy and unpleasant outdoors that the battalion had to dispense with its outdoor parade and spend that time in a drill in the gymnasium. After this was over the Rovers and some of their chums amused themselves on the <b>bars,</b> <b>swinging</b> rings, and with the exercising machines the gymnasium afforded.|$|R
50|$|The Princess Diana Park {{is a large}} park {{situated}} between Prescott Close and Edmunds Road in the Bretch Hill {{estate of}} Banbury, neighbouring Orchard Fields Community School. It has many facilities including monkey <b>bars,</b> <b>swings,</b> football pitches and basketball courts. It measures approx 40,000m2. The 30-year-old Princess Diana Park was upgraded and gained a 'Wheeled activity' park with a concrete roller-skating arch during 2010.|$|R
50|$|The swing {{installation}} {{came to an}} end in March 2006 {{when both}} the <b>swing</b> and the <b>bar</b> holding it up were removed and a fence installed to block the entrance to the space where the swing was installed. This may have been done to thwart any future attempts to replace the swing, as well as deter homeless people from sleeping in the space between buildings.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} project, {{which was}} {{presented}} to the team by Kevin Maher (President of Advanced Therapeutic devices), was to develop a product prototype for safe, vestibular stimulation for children with developmental disabilities. Vestibular stimulation is a form of therapy that increases muscle coordination. It works by stimulating the canals and sacs within the inner ear that detect accelerations. The project targeted children from ages two to seven years old, under 48 inches tall, and less than 100 lbs. The production device also sought to differ from stimulation devices found in hospitals in a few respects: it would cost under $ 5000, reside in a patient’s home, be hand-powered, and be controlled by an average person. The final device needed to support a 200 lb. load {{at the edge of the}} structure and adjust for the center of gravities for the range of children. After sessions of brainstorming, the team produced three workable layouts, only one was adequate. The final setup had a structure of ¼ in. aluminum structural pipe similar to a football field goal. This structure mounted on a single bearing housing and steel shaft. The final design had two bars to mount weights in order to adjust the center of gravity. The prototype, however, used a <b>swinging</b> <b>bar,</b> lock, and a sliding weight. The final prototype had an adjustable footrest and a five-point restraint harness. The final cost and weight was $ 1700 and no more than 500 lb. The design met all of the requirements and had adequate safety for any child’s needs, but the team thought the design needed significant changes before it became a final product...|$|R
50|$|The kip is an {{important}} skill that is used as both a mount and an element or connecting skill in a bar routine. The kip allows the gymnast to <b>swing</b> below the <b>bar</b> to arrive in a front support on the bar. From the front support, the gymnast may then perform any number of skills. The glide kip is {{the most commonly used}} mount on the women's uneven bars.|$|R
50|$|Jackson {{was born}} in Cookeville, Tennessee, and moved as a youngster {{with his family to}} Detroit, Michigan. He began playing country and Western <b>swing</b> in local <b>bars</b> as a teenager, and served in the Navy during World War II. He fronted a band called The Cowboy Swingsters, then simply The Swingsters for nearly 50 years, playing rhythm guitar and singing. Other musicians in his bands, such as Jimmy Franklin during the 1950s, {{sometimes}} sang.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} the bailiff D'Aubusson bade Gervaise {{accompany}} him to the palace of the grand master. Here he introduced him to Orsini, an old and feeble man, who, after a few kind words, handed {{him over to the}} chamberlain, who, in turn, led him to the official {{who was in charge of}} the pages. That officer took him down to the courtyard, where four young knights were engaged in superintending the military exercises of the pages. The scene was exactly the same as that to which Gervaise had been accustomed at the House in London. Some of the lads were fighting with blunted swords, others were <b>swinging</b> heavy <b>bars</b> of iron, climbing ropes, or vaulting on to the back of a wooden horse. All paused as the official entered with his charge.|$|R
5000|$|During Lo's {{first term}} he gained a {{reputation}} for being [...] "verbally and physically violent". He was often at the center of several brawls that occasionally occurred within the Taiwanese legislature, once allegedly <b>swinging</b> an aluminum <b>bar</b> at his political rivals during a dispute. He threatened legislators who opposed him, telling one rival: [...] "One day, you may not know how you die." [...] He once insulted a DPP legislator for twenty minutes during a legislative session.|$|R
