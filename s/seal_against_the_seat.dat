40|$|This is {{the final}} report of an {{experiment}} done by UMTRI to determine the inflation pressure required to fail 16 inch light truck tires, when improperly mounted on 16. 5 inch wheels. In an interim report titled "Report on Failure Testing of Thirty Tires" UMTRI reported on the test results of thirty tires fro six different manufactures. In this final report, the test results of twelve more tires from two additional manufactures are also considered. It is possible to improperly mount a 16 inch tire (metric 215 / 85, in this case) on a 16. 5 inch tire wheel. When this is the case, the tire bead makes an air tight <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> improper <b>seating</b> generates excessive stresses in the tire bead wire. Eventually, failure of the wire and explosive deflation of the tire will occur as the integrity of <b>the</b> bead <b>seat</b> is lost. Such a failure was obtained {{for each of the}} forty-two tires tested...|$|R

50|$|The whistle {{is pushed}} into the mouth fold-first. The curved open side of the U is {{the mouth of the}} whistle - where the air exits. <b>The</b> lips <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> outside of the curved edges, such that the inside of the fold can be seen between the lips. <b>The</b> fold is <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tongue when in use. Air travels over the tongue, through the top hole, past the top of the bottom hole, and out of the mouth between the lips.|$|R
50|$|At first, the insert has a sealing function. With its o-ring on {{the pipe}} end side, <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pipe is achieved. <b>The</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{connecting}} part {{is done by}} the F37-Seal or a bonded seal. If the connecting part has a soft seal on the face side, an insert with a flat face has to be used. For the connection of two pipes, an insert with cones on both sides, which are soft sealed by o-rings, can be used as well.|$|R

50|$|A {{floating}} ball valve {{is one where}} the ball is not {{held in place by}} a trunnion. In normal operation, this will cause the ball to float downstream slightly. This causes <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> mechanism to compress under <b>the</b> ball pressing <b>against</b> it. Furthermore, in some types, in the event of some force causing <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> mechanism to dissipate (such as extreme heat from fire outside the valve), the ball will float all the way to metal body which is designed to <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ball providing a somewhat failsafe design.|$|R

50|$|A final {{consideration}} in selecting a menstrual cup is firmness or flexibility. Some companies offer {{a range of}} firmness levels in their cups. A firmer cup pops open more easily after insertion and may hold a more consistent <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> vaginal wall (preventing leaks), but many women find softer cups more comfortable.|$|R
5000|$|The common convex {{shape of}} the fitting allows the concave tip of the grease gun to <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fitting easily from many angles, yet with a {{sufficiently}} tight seal to force the pressured grease to move the ball and enter the fitting, rather than simply oozing past this temporary annular (ring-shaped) seal.|$|R

40|$|A {{feedthrough}} bushing for a {{high voltage}} diode provides for using compression sealing for all sealing surfaces. A diode assembly includes a central conductor extending through the bushing and a grading ring assembly circumferentially surrounding and coaxial with the central conductor. A flexible conductive plate extends between and compressively <b>seals</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> central conductor and the grading ring assembly, wherein {{the flexibility of the}} plate allows inner and outer portions of the plate to axially translate for compression <b>sealing</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> central conductor and the grading ring assembly, respectively. The inner portion of the plate is bolted to the central conductor for affecting sealing. A compression beam is also bolted to the central conductor and engages the outer portion of the plate to urge the outer portion toward the grading ring assembly to obtain compression sealing therebetween...|$|R

5000|$|The goal {{of modern}} engine break-ins is the {{settling}} of piston rings into an engine's cylinder wall. A cylinder wall is not perfectly smooth {{but has a}} deliberate slight roughness to help oil adhesion.
