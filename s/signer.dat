5|$|Francis Lightfoot Lee (October 14, 1734 – January 11, 1797); <b>signer</b> of the United States Declaration of Independence. Married Rebecca Tayloe, {{daughter}} of John Tayloe II of Mount Airy. Tayloe built Menokin {{for his daughter}} and her new husband.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Pickett married Sally Harrison Minge, the {{daughter}} of Dr. John Minge of Virginia, the great-great-grandniece of President William Henry Harrison, and the great-great-granddaughter of Benjamin Harrison V, a <b>signer</b> of the United States Declaration of Independence. Sally died during childbirth that November, at Fort Gates, Texas.|$|E
50|$|Some {{collectors}} may {{specialize in}} specific fields (such as Nobel Prize winners) or general topics (military leaders participating in World War I) or specific documents (i.e., <b>signers</b> of the Charter of the United Nations; <b>signers</b> of the U.S. Constitution; <b>signers</b> of the Israeli Declaration of Independence; <b>signers</b> of the Charter of the European Common Union; <b>signers</b> of the World War II German or Japanese surrender documents).|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} ability to use prosodic cues when parsing Intonational Phrases (IPs) in American Sign Language (ASL) by four different populations, i. e. ASL <b>signers,</b> Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) <b>signers,</b> Non-Signers and second language (L 2) <b>signers</b> of ASL. ^ ASL <b>signers,</b> Non-Signers and L 2 <b>signers</b> showed similar performance in terms of accuracy when identifying prosodic boundaries. Although hearing participants (i. e. Non-Signers and L 2 <b>signers)</b> do not have a phonology for gestures, they are able to use superficial visual cues to mark prosodic boundaries based on their “gestural competence”; that is, their experience using co-speech gesture. Native HKSL signers’ performance was better overall demonstrating a greater ability to be accurate and fast when parsing ASL clauses than even native ASL <b>signers.</b> I argue that the ASL signers’ ability may be affected by lexical or semantic interference. Long reaction times and low accuracy levels revealed the complexity of the mental process involved in this task. ^ When data were analyzed within group, Non-Signers as well as L 2 <b>signers</b> showed a better performance when stimuli contained more cues. Contrary to hearing participants, the native <b>signers</b> groups did not show changes on accuracy depending on the number of cues. Data shows that 3 - 4 cues are sufficient for HKSL and ASL <b>signers</b> to be accurate, whereas Non-Signers and L 2 <b>signers</b> needed more cues. ^ HKSL <b>signers</b> as well as Non-Signers and L 2 <b>signers</b> parse ASL clauses based on a broader range of cues whereas ASL <b>signers</b> focus just on a couple of cues when parsing ASL clauses, that is, ASL <b>signers</b> are sensitive to fewer cues. ...|$|R
5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black <b>signers</b> {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White <b>signers</b> did not know. Older <b>signers</b> are more likely to use variant signs than younger <b>signers.</b> Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger <b>signers</b> of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older <b>signers</b> have and use these innovative signs.|$|R
5|$|Charles Carnan Ridgely {{frequently}} entertained prominent {{guests in}} the Mansion's 51ft.x21ft. (16 m by 6.4 m) Great Hall, such as Charles Carroll of Carrollton, {{who was a}} <b>signer</b> of the Declaration of Independence, and Revolutionary War general, the Marquis de Lafayette. Charles Carnan served as governor of Maryland between 181619. When Governor Ridgely died in 1829, he freed Hampton's slaves in his will.|$|E
5|$|Unlike ASL, BASL {{allows for}} the {{frequent}} use of syntactic repetition. In {{a study conducted by}} McCaskill, of 26 signers (13 Black and 13 White), Black signers had 57 instances of repetition compared to 19 from White signers, and of those 19 instances, 18 were made by a single <b>signer.</b> The use of repetition by BASL signers is considered to be pragmatic rather than as a way to clarify meaning.|$|E
5|$|William Whipple, a <b>signer</b> of the Declaration of Independence who {{had fought}} in the war, freed his slave Prince Whipple because of revolutionary ideals. In the postwar decades, other slaveholders also freed their slaves; from 1790 to 1810, the {{percentage}} of free blacks in the Upper South increased to 8.3 percent from {{less than one percent}} of the black population. All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804.|$|E
40|$|Conversation {{spaces of}} sign {{language}} <b>signers</b> were analysed {{according to the}} four following aspects: 1. Analysis of <b>signers</b> conversation' outset. Two conditions for starting a conversation between two <b>signers</b> have been found, that is to say, eye contact or being {{in a range of}} possibilities in which <b>signers</b> can touch each other. 2. Anlysis of the distance and angle between two standing <b>signers.</b> The most suitable distance for conversation is about 200 cm, and the most suitable postion is facing each other. 3. Analysis of the distance and angle between two sitting <b>signers</b> on a table. When <b>signers</b> are adjacent to each other, the conversation becomes difficult, and they tend to incline their backs. 4. Readability is greatly controlled by eyesight and eye agreement...|$|R

50|$|Multisignature: A multisignature {{represents}} {{a certain number}} of <b>signers</b> signing a given message. Number of <b>signers</b> is not fixed and <b>signers</b> identities are evident from a given multi-signature. A multisignature is much shorter (sometimes constant) than the simple collection of individual signatures.|$|R
5|$|SS Samuel Huntington was an American liberty ship during World War II. She was the 248th liberty ship {{authorized}} by the United States Maritime Commission and was {{named in honor of}} Samuel Huntington, a <b>signer</b> of the American Declaration of Independence. SS Samuel Huntington was launched in 1942 and sailed to ports in the Pacific, South America, Africa, and the United Kingdom. She was one of a select group of liberty ships that were outfitted to carry a limited number of either troops or prisoners of war. As part of a convoy to resupply the Allied troops at Anzio, she sank after a successful German bomb attack in January 1944.|$|E
5|$|William Henry Harrison {{was born}} on February 9, 1773 on Berkeley Plantation in James City County, Virginia. His father was the wealthy and {{influential}} Benjamin Harrison, a <b>signer</b> of the Declaration of Independence and Governor of Virginia. Houseguests at Berkeley while Harrison was a child included George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. Harrison was sent to Hampden-Sydney College in 1787, where he developed a lifelong interest in Roman history, and then to Philadelphia to study medicine with Dr. Benjamin Rush.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} {{that he be}} buried with his ardent friend and cousin, Judge Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a <b>signer</b> of the Declaration of Independence). The body of Judge Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed to be raised over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave was forgotten and long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and Judge Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of Judge Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of Judge Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and others of the family.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of visual}} {{feedback}} during {{the production of}} American Sign Language was investigated by comparing the size of signing space during conversations and narrative monologues for normally sighted <b>signers,</b> <b>signers</b> with tunnel vision due to Usher syndrome, and functionally blind <b>signers.</b> The interlocutor for all groups was a normally sighted deaf person. <b>Signers</b> with tunnel vision produced {{a greater proportion of}} signs near the face than blind and normally sighted <b>signers,</b> who did not differ from each other. Both groups of visually impaired <b>signers</b> produced signs within a smaller signing space for conversations than for monologues, but we hypothesize that they did so for different reasons. <b>Signers</b> with tunnel vision may align their signing space with that of their interlocutor. In contrast, blind <b>signers</b> may enhance proprioceptive feedback by producing signs within an enlarged signing space for monologues, which do not require switching between tactile and visual signing. Overall, we hypothesize that <b>signers</b> use visual feedback to phonetically calibrate the dimensions of signing space, rather than to monitor language output. We thank Victor Ferreira, Tamar Gollan, Robert Slevc, and Bencie Woll for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript and Michael Schilling II for help with data collection. Finally, {{we would like to thank}} all the deaf and deaf-blind <b>signers</b> who participated in this research. No conflict of interest declared. Correspondence should be sent t...|$|R
5|$|A {{study in}} 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male <b>signers</b> used {{constructed}} action, {{with or without}} constructed dialogue, more often than White <b>signers,</b> but never used constructed dialogue by itself. These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black <b>signers</b> not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white <b>signers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Signers</b> {{who began}} {{learning}} after 1983 were not inconsistent in this way. Across multiple <b>signers</b> and multiple scenes, <b>signers</b> would {{apply the same}} rotated representation. Senghas and Coppola suggested that this meant that “spatial modulations are {{being used as a}} shared grammatical element among this age cohort”.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York <b>signer</b> to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{supported}} Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in {{an unsuccessful}} {{effort to prevent}} the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following {{the overthrow of the}} Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic <b>signer</b> of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|John White Stevenson {{was born}} May 4, 1812, in Richmond, Virginia. He {{was the only}} child of Andrew and Mary Page (White) Stevenson. His mother—the granddaughter of Carter Braxton, a <b>signer</b> of the Declaration of Independence—died during childbirth. Stevenson was sent to live with his {{maternal}} grandparents, John and Judith White, until he was eleven; by then, his father had remarried. His father, a prominent Virginia lawyer, rose to political prominence during Stevenson's childhood. He was elected to Congress, eventually serving as Speaker of the House and was later appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James's (now called the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom) by President Martin Van Buren, where he engendered much controversy by his pro-slavery practices. Because of his father's position, young Stevenson had met both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.|$|E
40|$|A (t, n) {{threshold}} signature {{scheme is}} one which enables any t or more shareholders to cooperatively generate a group signature. Based on the traceability of the <b>signers,</b> threshold signatures can further be classified into (1) threshold traceable signatures, where {{the identities of}} the <b>signers,</b> who generate the signature, can be traced by the system; and (2) threshold untraceable signatures, where the <b>signers</b> of a signature cannot be traced. This paper distinguishes the applications of threshold signatures of both types and also proposes a threshold untraceable signature scheme. The new signature scheme can be augmented to give the original <b>signers</b> the ability to prove that they are the true <b>signers...</b>|$|R
5|$|When asked, many <b>signers</b> in the South gave anecdotal {{accounts}} {{of differences between}} the signing of Black and White <b>signers.</b> These differences {{turned out to be}} aspects of the differing phonology of BASL.

50|$|The Giving Pledge is a {{campaign}} to encourage wealthy people to contribute a majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes. As of 2017, the pledge has 158 <b>signers,</b> either individuals or couples; some of the 158 <b>signers</b> have since died. Most of the <b>signers</b> of the pledge are billionaires, and their pledges total to over $365 billion.|$|R
5|$|Richard Bellingham died on 7 December 1672. He was {{the last}} {{surviving}} <b>signer</b> of the colonial charter, and was buried in Boston's Granary Burying Ground. He was survived by his son Samuel {{from his first marriage}} and his second wife Penelope, who outlived him by 30 years. His landholdings at Winnessimmett became tied up in legal action lasting more than 100 years, and involved court and procedural decisions {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic to resolve. Under the terms of his will, some of his properties in Winnessimmett were set aside for religious uses. His son challenged the will, which was eventually set aside. The litigation continued, carried on by his heirs and succeeding owners and occupants of the properties, and was finally concluded in 1785. The town of Bellingham, Massachusetts is named in his honor, and a number of features in Chelsea, including a square, a street, and a hill, bear the name Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, <b>signer</b> Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|Upon Schlumberger's arrival, the Turk {{debuted in}} Boston, Mälzel {{spinning}} {{a story that}} the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to Philadelphia for three months. Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to Baltimore, where it played {{for a number of}} months, including losing a match against Charles Carroll, a <b>signer</b> of the Declaration of Independence. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel's machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.|$|E

5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a <b>signer</b> with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
5|$|In 1707 a deed {{was found}} among the ancient files of York County, Maine, near where Wheelwright had brought his flock to settle in Wells. The deed, dated 17 May 1629, showed Wheelwright as being one of several {{recipients}} of land from the Indian sagamores of southern New Hampshire, and a <b>signer</b> of the document. The deed thus implied that Wheelwright was present in New England in 1629, {{even though he was}} known to be the vicar of Bilsby in Lincolnshire at the time. While many historians declared the deed to be a forgery, Charles H. Bell, in his biography of Wheelwright in 1876, presented the case that the deed could be legitimate. It was known that as the vicar of Bilsby, Wheelwright was required to send a transcript of the parish registers to a central repository once a year, and this was done in March. However, of the several transcripts found with Wheelwright's signature attached, the one for March 1629 could not be found, leaving the door wide open to the possibility that Wheelwright had come to New England during this time frame and then returned to England. Sometime after Bell published his book on Wheelwright, the missing transcript was found, proving almost conclusively that Wheelwright had never left England during his ministry at Bilsby, and demonstrating with certainty that the deed of 1629 was a forgery. Sometime before his death, Governor Bell acknowledged the sequence of events and that the deed was an ingenious fabrication, and stated this in an undated letter to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.|$|E
25|$|Words may {{be written}} {{from the point}} of view of the <b>signer</b> or the viewer.

40|$|Similar {{working memory}} (WM) for lexical items has been {{demonstrated}} for <b>signers</b> and non-signers while short-term memory (STM) is regularly poorer in deaf than hearing individuals. In the present study, we investigated digit-based WM and STM in Swedish and British deaf <b>signers</b> and hearing non-signers. To maintain good experimental control we used printed stimuli throughout and held response mode constant across groups. We showed that deaf <b>signers</b> have similar digit-based WM performance, despite shorter digit spans, compared to well-matched hearing non-signers. We found no difference between <b>signers</b> and non-signers on STM span for letters chosen to minimize phonological similarity or in the effects of recall direction. This set of findings indicates that similar WM for <b>signers</b> and non-signers can be generalized from lexical items to digits and suggests that poorer STM in deaf <b>signers</b> compared to hearing non-signers {{may be due to}} differences in phonological similarity across the language modalities of sign and speech...|$|R
