30|$|The barcode gap {{analysis}} revealed highest intraspecific distance (> 2  %) in 9 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> rbcL and 6 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> matK, while low intraspecific distance (< 2  %) in 11 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> rbcL and 9 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> matK. Here, low intraspecific distance (< 2  %) suggests low species resolution, thus leading to species overlap.|$|R
40|$|Out <b>of</b> 514 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> {{caught and}} {{analyzed}} fish, there were 250 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> chub, 94 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> spirlin, 78 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> stream barbel, 57 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> bleak, 35 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> barbel. All populations were checked for 9 morphometric and 5 meristic parameters. Although analyzed morphometric parameters showed constant values {{in accordance with}} the literature used, all 5 meristic values of chub, barbel and stream barbel were different from freshwater fish species determination key that is valid for this part <b>of</b> Europe. Some <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> spirlin had deviation in the number of scales above and below the lateral line, while bleak had different number of unforked and forked rays in dorsal fin. This indicates that further investigation is necessary in order to introduce additional values to the existing key...|$|R
5|$|Computer {{modeling}} of a well-preserved <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> P. tubicen, with more complex air passages {{than those of}} P. walkeri, has allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} possible sound its crest produced. The main path resonates at around 30Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of a {{fractured}} hip bone {{was found in}} a <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> Iguanodon, which had an injury to its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called osteophytes.|$|E
5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs {{also have}} been found in the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> a hadrosaur appears to have been scavenged by a shark).|$|E
40|$|Results <b>of</b> {{analyses}} <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> {{plant or}} animal origin for various mycotoxins are presented. Analyses for aflatoxins, ochratoxins and zearalenone were most frequently requested. Aflatoxin B 1 {{was found in}} one <b>of</b> 474 <b>specimens</b> {{at a level of}} 60 ppb in a sample of hay. Ochratoxin A was detected in four <b>of</b> 148 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> grains and two <b>of</b> 19 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> corn at levels up to 500 ppb. Trichothecenes were qualitatively found in two <b>of</b> 108 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> forage, three <b>of</b> 182 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> feeds and one <b>of</b> 148 <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> grains. Ergot was detected qualitatively in three <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> rye and one of forage. An overall detection rate of 3. 8 % of potent mycotoxins suggests that acute or chronic mycotoxicoses may occasionally occur in farm livestock or poultry...|$|R
50|$|Green <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> {{the crab}} brittlegill, Russula xerampelina, can {{be mistaken for}} R. aeruginea.

5|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{is measured}} using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular <b>specimen,</b> <b>of</b> which the dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23.

5|$|I. valdensis, a {{renaming}} of Vectisaurus valdensis by Ernst van den Broeck in 1900. Originally {{named by}} Hulke {{as a distinct}} genus in 1879 based on vertebral and pelvic remains, {{it was from the}} Barremian stage of the Isle of Wight. It was considered a juvenile <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, or an undetermined species of Mantellisaurus, but is indeterminate beyond Iguanodontia.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, {{physician}} Johann Friedrich Engelhardt discovered some vertebrae and leg bones at Heroldsberg near Nuremberg, Germany. Three {{years later}} German palaeontologist Hermann von Meyer designated {{them as the}} type <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> a new genus, Plateosaurus. Since then, remains of well over 100 individuals of Plateosaurus have been discovered at various locations throughout Europe.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, {{based on a}} skin in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. He suggested that this was actually the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues. Walter Rothschild, however, believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar. In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> the grey trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Thulborn {{suggested}} that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a secondary sex characteristic. According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> the related Abrictosaurus, which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, who argued that the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> Abrictosaurus; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 Briggs and Nedin {{reported}} from South Australia a new <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> Myoscolex {{that was much}} better preserved than previous specimens, leading them to conclude {{that it was a}} close relative of Opabinia—although this interpretation was later questioned by Dzik, who instead concluded that Myoscolex was an annelid worm.|$|E
50|$|Some {{overlap in}} the {{distributions}} (not {{indicated in the}} map, right) occurs, with both occurring in a broad band north to south through France, and scattered <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> S. c. cinerea west to Ireland, western France, and Morocco; scattered <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> S. c. oleifolia occur east to the Netherlands. <b>Specimens</b> <b>of</b> S. c. oleifolia in southern Scandinavia are planted or naturalised, not native. Intermediate specimens also occur.|$|R
30|$|The LT <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> {{all species}} and LR <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> hinoki, keyaki, and tochinoki had small density {{fluctuations}} in the xy-plane or earlywood widths smaller than λ (Figs.  4, 5 a, e, f), while the LR <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> sugi, akamatsu, and kiri had large density {{fluctuations in the}} xy-plane and earlywood widths close to or larger than λ (Fig.  5 b–d). This is why the amplitude and phase of the transmitted wave for LR <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> sugi, akamatsu, and kiri were {{different from those of}} the wave without a specimen on the basis of the diffraction model.|$|R
