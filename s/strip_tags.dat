A secondary goal is {{to determine whether a}} given message expresses pro or con arguments with respect to the discussion. We employed a combination of POS-driven query expansion and a textclassification technique from [6]. The results of those previous experiments indicated that the technique best performed in extracting protein-protein interaction pairs from MEDLINE. The original email corpus was extremely heterogeneous. We first applied the Tidy HTML parser to <b>strip</b> <b>tags</b> and to identify data such as the sender, thread history, and subject of the messages. We then linked messages into threads in two ways. The corpus provides thread index files for email communications. These thread indexes are composed of hieratically structured multiple discussion threads and single thread. For multiple discussion threads, we unified them into a thread document. We also combined single documents when they had the same subject. 1. 1 Method This is a supervised because the system was developed a small set of training data by taking a subset of discussion threads and manually tagging them.

40|$|Abstract—In {{two decades}} the web became a {{standard}} framework for Internet applications. This involved changing from an initially simple hypermedia access platform {{to a complex}} blob of different technologies. This complexity associated to the increasing filtering of TCP/UDP ports everywhere in the Internet, turned web applications into favourite targets for cyber-criminals. The Web Application Protection (WAP) tool aims to secure web applications by analysing and automatically fixing their source code [1] 1. WAP currently handles PHP code, in which most web applications are written. As of April 2014, WAP {{has been used to}} process more than 1. 5 million lines of code. This short paper briefly presents the tool and ongoing work on evolving it. I. THE WAP APPROACH The WAP approach brings to source code analysis a tension observed in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). These systems have been classified in two main categories. Knowledge-based IDSs contain a database of attack signatures created manually by human beings. Behaviour-based IDSs, on the contrary, learn about attacks – or normal behaviour – automatically using labelled data sets. Our approach uses a hybrid of two analog approaches. WAP searches for input validation vulnerabilities in PHP source code: cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, remote and local file inclusion, path traversal, OS command injection, and a few more. First, the tool has knowledge crafted manually about how to find these vulnerabilities. More specifically, it does taint analysis: it verifies if inputs can reach sensitive functions (sensitive sinks) without proper sanitisation or validation (taint analysis in Fig. 1). The lists of input entry points, sensitive sinks, and sanitisation/validation functions are produced by humans. Examples for XSS are in Table I Entry points Sensitive sinks Sanitisation functions $ GET echo htmlentities $ POST print htmlspecialchars $ COOKIE printf <b>strip</b> <b>tags</b> $ REQUEST die urlencod...|$|E

25|$|Seals {{are used}} {{primarily}} to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There {{are two main}} ways in which a seal may be attached to a document. It may be applied directly to {{the face of the}} paper or parchment (an applied seal); or it may hang loose from it (a pendent seal). A pendent seal may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner's livery colors), or to the two ends of a <b>strip</b> (or <b>tag)</b> of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a plica) to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or tongue, but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the seal's reuse. If a forger tries to remove an applied seal from its document, it will almost certainly break. A pendent seal is easily detached by cutting the cords or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because the cords or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.|$|R

5000|$|If {{the search}} engine {{supports}} multiple document formats, documents {{must be prepared}} for tokenization. The challenge is that many document formats contain formatting information in addition to textual content.

Format analysis is also referred to as structure analysis, format parsing, <b>tag</b> <b>stripping,</b> format stripping, text normalization, text cleaning and text preparation. The challenge of format analysis is further complicated by the intricacies of various file formats.
