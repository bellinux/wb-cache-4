50|$|The {{restoration}} {{inside the}} shed at Loughborough {{seems to be}} in the final stages and boiler work is yet to be undertaken off site, along with a new BR1B Tender to replace the original, which was sold off while the locomotive was at Barry. Later on during restoration new components were manufactured and fitted to the cab. These were a duplex ejector, <b>sanding</b> <b>valves</b> and a blower, all of which are new to the design, similar to that of 60163 Tornado. This would make it more suitable for mainline work than the other four preserved Standard 5s, but the restoration group has not publicly released any intentions to do this.|$|R

30|$|Removal of {{iron and}} {{manganese}} from groundwater for domestic use and for drinking water purposes using aerobic oxidation is a difficult and lengthy process and is not satisfactory in many cases for the following reasons: (1) {{it is difficult to}} complete the oxidation process to remove both ions at the same water conditions due to the different pH required to oxidize iron and manganese. (2) The growth of iron bacteria on <b>sand</b> filters or <b>valves,</b> cause water discoloration and increases its turbidity (Oliveira Barud et al. 2015; Shankar and Rhim 2015). Therefore, ion exchange method {{is considered one of the}} most promising methods for removing iron and manganese ions from the groundwater, as their concentration does not exceed 5  mg/L (Bilal et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|NASA {{personnel}} at Kennedy Space Center's Material Science Laboratory have developed new environmentally sound precision cleaning and verification techniques for systems and components {{found at the}} center. This technology is required to replace existing methods traditionally employing CFC- 113. The new patent-pending technique of precision cleaning verification is for large components of cryogenic fluid systems. These are stainless steel, <b>sand</b> cast <b>valve</b> bodies with internal surface areas ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 9 m(exp 2). Extrapolation of this technique to components of even larger sizes (by orders of magnitude) is planned. Currently, the verification process is completely manual. In the new technique, a high velocity, low volume water stream impacts the part to be verified. This process {{is referred to as}} Breathing Air/Water Impingement and forms the basis for the Impingement Verification System (IVS). The system is unique in that a gas stream is used to accelerate the water droplets to high speeds. Water is injected into the gas stream in a small, continuous amount. The air/water mixture is then passed through a converging-diverging nozzle where the gas is accelerated to supersonic velocities. These droplets impart sufficient energy to the precision cleaned surface to place non-volatile residue (NVR) contaminants into suspension in the water. The sample water is collected and its NVR level is determined by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis at 880 C. The TOC, in ppm carbon, is used to establish the NVR level. A correlation between the present gravimetric CFC- 113 NVR and the IVS NVR is found from experimental sensitivity factors measured for various contaminants. The sensitivity has the units of ppm of carbon per mg-ft(exp 2) of contaminant. In this paper, the equipment is described and data are presented showing the development of the sensitivity factors from a test set including four NVR's impinged from witness plates of 0. 05 to 0. 75 m(exp 2) ...|$|R
40|$|The stage-regulated HASPB and SHERP {{proteins}} of Leishmania major {{are predominantly}} expressed in cultured metacyclic parasites that are competent for macrophage uptake and survival. The role of these proteins in parasite {{development in the}} sand fly vector has not been explored, however. Here, we confirm that expression of HASPB is detected only in vector metacyclic stages, correlating with the expression of metacyclic-specific lipophosphoglycan and providing the first definitive protein marker for this infective sand fly stage. Similarly, SHERP is expressed in vector metacyclics but is also detected at low levels in the preceding short promastigote stage. Using genetically modified parasites lacking or complemented for the LmcDNA 16 locus on chromosome 23 that contains the HASP and SHERP genes, we further show {{that the presence of}} this locus is essential for parasite differentiation to the metacyclic stage in Phlebotomus papatasi. While wild-type and complemented parasites transform normally in late-stage infections, generating metacyclic promastigotes and colonizing the <b>sand</b> fly stomodeal <b>valve,</b> null parasites accumulate at the earlier elongated nectomonad stage of development within the abdominal and thoracic midgut of the sand fly. Complementation with HASPB or SHERP alone suggests that HASPB is the dominant effector molecule in this process...|$|R
40|$|Chitinases of trypanosomatid parasites {{have been}} {{proposed}} to fulfil various roles in their blood-feeding arthropod vectors but so far none have been directly tested using a molecular approach. We characterized the ability of Leishmania mexicana episomally transfected with LmexCht 1 (the L. mexicana chitinase gene) to survive and grow within the permissive sand fly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Compared with control plasmid transfectants, the overexpression of chitinase was found to increase {{the average number of}} parasites per sand fly and accelerate the escape of parasites from the peritrophic matrix-enclosed blood meal as revealed by earlier arrival at the stomodeal valve. Such flies also exhibited increased damage to the structure of the stomodeal valve, which may facilitate transmission by regurgitation. When exposed individually to BALB/c mice, those flies with chitinase-overexpressing parasites spent on average 2. 4 - 2. 5 times longer in contact with their host during feeding, compared with flies with control infections. Furthermore, the lesions that resulted from these single fly bite infections were both significantly larger and with higher final parasite burdens than controls. These data show that chitinase is a multifunctional virulence factor for L. mexicana which assists its survival in Lu. longipalpis. Specifically, this enzyme enables the parasites to colonize the anterior midgut of the sand fly more quickly, modify the <b>sand</b> fly stomodeal <b>valve</b> and affect its blood feeding, all of which combine to enhance transmission...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to monitor valve {{condition}} monitoring by using acoustic emission technique. Two conditions were considered in this study which are good condition valve and leak valve. There are two objective of the study which is to detect acoustic emission parameter {{and to develop a}} classification method to monitor valve condition by using acoustic emission technique. The study is accomplished by analyzing the parameter hits and average rms. A hydraulic bench was used to provide water to the test rig. The first experiment is to monitor good valve condition. It is done by analyze the hits and rms collected for every rotation of the wheel handle. Then, the graph of hits plotted is compared between the graphs plotted by Hafizi (2008) to see the different characteristic of different valve. The second experiment is to monitor the leak valve. Two different valves were used in the second experiment which are gate valve and check <b>valve.</b> <b>Sand</b> and then screw was put in the valve as to make the valve leak. Then, the parameter hits and rms is measured to analyze the different between good condition valve and leak valve. The results show that there is acoustic emission activity occur when there is leak in the valve and the activity can be detected by using the acoustic emission sensor. It is also prove that the different leak will emit different acoustic emission energy...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation of {{extracellular}} Leishmania promastigotes {{within their}} sand fly vector, termed metacyclogenesis, {{is considered to}} be essential for parasites to regain mammalian host infectivity. Metacyclogenesis is accompanied by changes in the local parasite environment, including secretion of complex glycoconjugates within the promastigote secretory gel and colonization and degradation of the <b>sand</b> fly stomodeal <b>valve.</b> Deletion of the stage-regulated HASP and SHERP genes on chromosome 23 of Leishmania major is known to stall metacyclogenesis in the sand fly but not in in vitro culture. Here, parasite mutants deficient in specific genes within the HASP/SHERP chromosomal region have been used to investigate their role in metacyclogenesis, parasite transmission and establishment of infection. Metacyclogenesis was stalled in HASP/SHERP mutants in vivo and, although still capable of osmotaxis, these mutants failed to secrete promastigote secretory gel, correlating with a lack of parasite accumulation in the thoracic midgut and failure to colonise the stomodeal valve. These defects prevented parasite transmission to a new mammalian host. Sand fly midgut homogenates modulated parasite behaviour in vitro, suggesting a role for molecular interactions between parasite and vector in Leishmania development within the sand fly. For the first time, stage-regulated expression of the small HASPA proteins in Leishmania (Leishmania) has been demonstrated: HASPA 2 is expressed only in extracellular promastigotes and HASPA 1 only in intracellular amastigotes. Despite its lack of expression in amastigotes, replacement of HASPA 2 into the null locus background delays onset of pathology in BALB/c mice. This HASPA 2 -dependent effect is reversed by HASPA 1 gene addition, suggesting that the HASPAs may have a role in host immunomodulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} throw more {{light on the}} {{formation}} of submarine bars and offshore bars or barrier beaches and the minor shore forms beach cusps and ripple marks a series of experiments {{was made in the}} new laboratory for experimental geology of the Geological Institution of the University at Leiden. The experiments were carried out in a tank, measuring six by four meters and half a meter in depth in which waves could be produced artificially varying in height from two to about twelf centimeters. The effects of waves on sandy beaches running parallel to or approaching the beach at an angle of fifteen degrees were traced, the beach itself having a slope of two, four or six degrees. Finally especially to detect possible rules for the formation of beach cusps in relation to the slope of the beach and the height and period of the waves some experiments were carried out with valves and valvegrit, for the principal part derived from Macta subtruncata Dac., and with fine pumice-stone-gravel the so-called „bims” Lapilli (original from the vulcanic Laacher-See country in Germany) ranging in diameter from 0. 2 to 2 centimeters in which the beach also had a varying slope. Neither of those last two series of experiments gave the results hoped for with regard to the problem mentioned. Many {{of the results of the}} effect of waves during the experiments may be found in the numerous photographs and figures in chapter III. The development and the pushing backwards of the offshore bar by the waves are clearly visible in the figures 39, 40, and 41. In all cases the offshore bar was formed by a gradual lateral growing of a number of subaquatic accumulations of sand which were at the same time slowly pushed higher up the slope of the beach. The subaquatic bar and the channel at the back of it, the latter formed by the excavation through the breaking waves, both had a practically stationary position. An almost horizontal terrace was formed between the channel and the foot of the front slope of the offshore bar, the latter being then pushed backwards to its final position and this taking the slope of a beach ridge. When the waves were running parallel to the beach this terrace was covered with somewhat irregular symmetric oscillation-marks and in case of experiments with waves obligue to the beach with slightly asymmetric combined current- and oscillation-ripples. A number of profils through the beach were taken at the end of most experiments. A careful examination of these profiles gave the following results. 1 °. The height of the submarine bar increases until the depth above it measured from the mean water-level is equal to half the height of the waves measured from trough to crest (diagram 1, fig. 85). 2 °. Only in the experiments with the beach sloping four and six degrees the submarine bar grows beyond the original profile. 3 °. The maximal depth of the channel at the back of the submarine bar is approximately equal to the height of the waves (diagram 3, fig. 87). 4 °. The height of the offshore bar, driven back to its ultimate position, above the mean water-level is proportional to one third of the height of the waves (diagram 4, fig. 88). 5 °. The actual height of the offshore bar, i. e. the height above the original slope of the beach, proved to be almost independent of the height of the waves (diagram 5, fig. 89). It thus turned out that the offshore bar is pushed back more or less according to the height of the waves without any real increase in height and volume. The number of profiles was not great enough to determine the influence of the slope of the beach though it may be established that indications tend to show a relatively small effect. The transportation of sand from the offshore zone to the beach and in the reverse direction and the transport along the beach by oblique wave attack were discussed at much length. In order to separate the zones in which the waves eroded the sea bottom from those in which sedimentation took place two neutral lines were introduced. The first, seaward one already introduced by Cornaglia where the land- and seaward components of the ground waves are supposed to be exactly balanced, inside of which the motion of debris is landward and out-side of which it is seaward. The second, nearer to the beach, where the eroding force of the waves is changed into a constructive agency. The position of this last line giving at the same time the depth at which the waves will break. The diagram 7 in fig. 91 proves this depth below mean water-level to be equal to three quarters of the height of the waves. The neutral line of Cornaglia was located at a maximal depth of two and a half times the height of the waves, a figure very well in accordance with those given by Cornaglia, Heiser and von Boschitsch for the Mediterranean, the Baltic and the Black Sea. It is generally supposed that the material in the offshore zone, deposited on the abrasion platform, cannot be considered as definitely lost for the formation of shore forms though the transport of sand up the sea-bottom slope is still a quite uncontrolable factor in the development of shores. This supposition however is not directly based on the experimental research but for the greater part on a study of the literature and reports of facts, observed in nature. It needs further experiments with coloured sand to prove the exactness of this opinion which are impossible to be carried out in nature on account of the big amounts of sand required. As to the transportation of sand along the beach it was stated that while in nature the litoral drift is divided into beach drifting- and offshore drifting sand, the former due to the oblique advance of the waves, the latter due to wind-generated and tidal currents, in the experiments the beach drifting only is of prime importance. The principal part of the longshore transportation consequently took place in the zone landward from the surfline. The deflection of the outlets, intersecting the full, by the gradual growing of the windward ridge could be seen in the experiments (exp. XIV). The experiments proved that all waves in the very first place tend to form a profile of equilibrium on the one hand by throwing much material on the beach and pushing this back on the other hand by pulling it down to greater depth. Whilst this is happening the transversal transportation of sand predominates strongly the alongshore transportation, the latter getting more importance when the profile of equilibrium approaches its completion. Much attention was paid to the formation of the low and ball of a sandy shore. The conditions during the experiments resemble closely those of a shore line of emergency along which the formation of submarine- and offshore bars is typical. The coast, the sea-bottom offshore over a varying distance from the coastline and the neighbouring coasts must be considered the sources of the material required for their upbuilding. The results of the experiments and a study of the facts brought forth by other investigators lead the author to the conclusion that the submarine bars, parallel to the shore, are formed by the loss of transporting power of the waves at the surfline. The undertow being only a factor in the regulation of the position of this line and not a determinative factor in the formation of the bars. The socalled „Zuwachsriff” of Braun (lit. 3), a transitional form between the submarine bars and the offshore bar, must be formed by the uprush of the waves after the final breaking. The channel at the back of the submarine bar is in the experiments merely due to the excavating action of the surf but in reality tidal- and wind-generated currents will also have some influence on its formation. The changes in form and position of the three or four, sometimes even more parallel bars are believed to be greatest in the zones nearest to and farthest from the beach. The latter, exposed to the effect of all changes in the height of waves, protects the inner zones to a large extent against a stronger attack by an increasing height of the waves. The former being exposed to the relatively greatest changes in depth and receiving much material eroded from the higher beach and the coast. Any submarine bar, build up to its maximum height by one series of waves will suffer erosion from a higher series and probably be driven landwards more or less. The complex of bars in general is a stabile phenomenon with regard to the external form as to the material it is a dynamic and by no means a static equilibrium. The submarine bars being considered fore runners of the offshore bars only a few remarks need be made about the formation of the latter. I wholly accept de Beaumont’s theory according to which the longshore transportation of debris is a factor completely superfluous for the formation of the offshore bars. Even without the slightest litoral drift bars will be build up consisting of material eroded from sea-bottom farther offshore, the slope of the offshore itself and during periods of rough weather from the coast also. The formation of offshore bars as the „Flugelriffe” after von Cholnoky’s theory is strongly rejected. „Flügelriffe” could be called „delta wing-bars”, a name expressing the connection with delta’s to which the bars are attaced and of which they derive their material after the theory mentioned above. The fifth chapter deals with the formation of beach cusps. Observations in the laboratory and along the Dutch shore show that conditions for their formation only are favourable when regular waves advance and retreat strikingly parallel to the beach. It is thought that the backwash plays an important part in the formation of this minor shore form. Starting its course without any momentum it is more apt to be captured and divided into a number of small streams, running down the slope, by small irregularities and depressions in the surface of the beach. The uprush or swash, which swirls over the slope, will try to erase those irregularities as often could be observed in the experiments. Beach cusps are only formed when the eroding power of the backwash slightly exceeds the constructive power of the uprush. In this case an equilibrium will be attained after a small partial erosion of the slope of the beach concentrated in the bays intervening the beach cusps. Whenever the difference between the two agencies becomes greater the whole slope will be eroded. Along the Dutch shore the beach cusps are buid up out of <b>sand,</b> <b>valves</b> and valve grit of Mactra subtruncata Dac. and the little tubes of Pectinaria belgica Pall. and Terebella conchilega Pall. Those consisting of sand are only found in connection with beach ridges, the seaward slope of which is a subject to erosion in the manner described above. The formation of ripple marks during the experiments did not have the authors special interest. It may only be stated that oscillationripples as well as current-ripples were formed. During the experiments with waves parallel to the beach, all oscillation-ripples formed were parallel to the beach. In the experiments with waves running oblique to the beach, the oscillation-ripples in the deeper zones trended parallel to the waves, in the higher zones parallel to the beach while on the terrace at the back of the channel combined current- and oscillation-ripples were formed at a considerable angle with the beach. True current-ripples appeared in the outlets where they were parallel to the beach and with a general trend at right angles to the beach at the back of the offshore bar. The latter are quietly buried by the transgression of the offshore bar in a manner strictly comparable to the fosilization of ripple marks in delta deposits and by the wandering of banks. The author hopes to have found a new ripple-mark, the „backwash sand-wave” which being always parallel to the beach in a fossil state will give fairly good evidence of the position of the ancient beach. And if these sand-waves are found over some distance in a direction at right angles to their trend they clearly show changes in the water-level, which may be due to the pushing of water against a coast, but in sediments with a marine facies is the result of the tides. These ripples, formed by the back wash, show a slightly arched form measuring some fourty to fifty centimeters in length and not more then one or two centimeters in height. They may cover the whole width of the beach after a period of stormy weather and high tide but under normal circumstances, they are formed on the seaward slope of the ridges lying at the front of the beach near to the low-tide line...|$|R
