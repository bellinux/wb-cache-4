Introduction: The {{importance}} of the farming industry can hardly be overestimated. Without it no other could exist. In just {{so far as the}} industry is important those engaged in it are of importance. Of course natural fruits and wild animals exist in sufficient abundance to support a small population. But dependence on these sources alone for food and raiment makes progress impossible. On the products of the soil is founded the material wealth of a nation. Nowhere has this been more true than in the United States. Since farming is indispensable it follows that the farmer should be one, so far as the power to promote welfare goes, having no superior in the land. He must study and grow in usefulness. His vocation is such that it must be kept to the front. The coming farmer must look ahead, move forward, and not linger along behind the rest of the world. Vigilance <b>and</b> farsightedness <b>are</b> the elements of success...|$|R

50|$|A {{curriculum}} {{framework is}} part of an outcome-based education or standards based education reform design. The framework is the first step, defining clear, high standards which will be achieved by all students. The curriculum is then aligned to the standards, and students are assessed against the standards. As compared with traditional education which is concerned only about delivering content, a standards based education reform system promises that all will succeed if all are held to high expectations. When the standards are reached, there will be no achievement gap where some groups are allowed to score lower than others, or the disabled are offered different opportunities than others. All will meet world class standards and be qualified for good colleges and trained for good jobs which pay good wages. In a traditional education system, the curriculum was defined by those who created textbooks rather than government bodies which assembled groups of stakeholders to create standards based on consensus of what students <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the differences, {{there were}} points of {{agreement}} among all sponsors. Sponsors agreed that their interventions should be developmentally appropriate—that is, models {{take account of}} where students are in their development as learners. Second, everyone agreed that teaching and learning should be responsive {{to the needs of}} individual learners. Third, they agreed that all students—even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds—could learn to the level of their more fortunate peers. Fourth, classroom management procedures that create an appropriate learning environment should be emphasized. Fifth, school should be a place where students experience both high self-esteem and academic success. Ironically, the last point of agreement—as far as Maccoby and Zellner were concerned—was that all interventions should have very clear objectives about the content and skills that students <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do. This last detail is worth noting for two reasons. First, the program outcome goals that were provided by sponsors appeared relatively broad. For example, the sponsors of the Tucson Early Education Model explain that [...] "there is relatively less emphasis on which items are taught and on the transmission of specific content, and more emphasis on 'learning to learn'". Likewise, teachers of the Cognitive Curriculum design their own approaches to instruction (including the specification of learning goals), with assistance from sponsors and fellow staff members. While the outcome goals might commonly be described as high levels of academic achievement or mastery of basic and higher-order thinking skills, exactly how students demonstrate these skills is missing in the Follow Through literature. During sponsor meetings, there were several heated arguments between some sponsors about the degree of specificity to which they should link facets of their models to student outcomes or behaviors. Follow Through administrators could not investigate models more thoroughly because of limited time; indeed, only eight months separated the selection of the sponsored model approach and the start of the experiment. Because Congress had already reduced the program budget, there was legitimate concern among planners that a delay in implementation could be disastrous to the program. Another reality was simply the lack of alternate interventions. Because such a large-scale experiment in education had never been done before, the Office of Education had no arsenal of interventions to try out.|$|E

Aims: To explore the presence and personal disturbance of key patient reported disease-related symptoms in patients affected by DSM- 5 schizophrenia who are in treatment in outpatient psychiatric services in Spain. Method: The exploration of the presence and personal disturbance of key patient reported disease-related experiences and symptoms in schizophrenia uses the Scale for the Assessment of Passively Received Experiences (PRE), a 121 items self-report focusing on the key symptoms of schizophrenia and asks respondents whether each PRE experience has happened during the past month (YES/NO) and how personally disturbing each present experience was (rated from 0 to 10, {{as bad as you}} can imagine). Participants’ view about the PREexperiences was also reported, in particular regarding the importance of such disturbing experiences for their life, about their expectations that treatment could target their disturbing experiences, and about their expectations that their doctor <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> aware about their disturbing experiences. Results: Data were collected from 70 participants affected by DSM- 5 schizophrenia (male 72. 9 %, mean age 41 y;SD 10. 57; Min 21 -Max 65) who were in treatment in outpatient psychiatric services in Spain (Málaga, Barcelona and Cádiz). The patients (94. 3 %) were in treatment with antipsychotics. The patients reported a relevant number of PRE experiences, both as present and as disturbing.

The personal disturbance due to the PRE experiences was frequently rated by the patients as severe. The average number of PRE experiences per patient with a disturbance rated from 8 to 10 was 16. 14 (SD 13. 90; Median 14. 50; Min 0, Max 53). 92, 9 % of the patients had at least one PRE experience causing a disturbance they rated 8 - 10, and 55. 7 % had at least tenPRE experiences causing a disturbance they rated 8 - 10.

The average number of items per patient with a disturbance rated by the patient 10 was 6. 39 (SD 9. 67 : Median 3; Min 0, Max 52). 70 % of the patients had at least one item they rated with a 10 disturbance, and 20 % of the patients had at least ten items causing a disturbance they rated as 10.
