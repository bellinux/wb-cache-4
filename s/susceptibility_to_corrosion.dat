40|$|The {{blasting}} process {{generates a}} renewed surface {{on the surface}} of metallic biomaterials with a different topography and a different chemical composition. The impact of particles on the metallic surface increases both the surface roughness and susceptibility pitting corrosion. The aim of this work is to smoothen the sharp edges of blasted Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy surfaces by means of oxidation treatment and the evaluation of their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> pitting <b>corrosion</b> after this thermal oxidation. Oxidation treatments were performed at 500 and 700 °C for 1 h on samples blasted with SiO 2 /ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles. Compositional, microstructural and topographical characterization of the blasted surfaces were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface reactivity and corrosion behaviour of the samples were assessed by scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) and by anodic polarization curves. The <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> pitting <b>corrosion</b> of the Ti 6 Al 4 V blasted surfaces becomes higher as roughness increases. The oxidation treatment of the Ti 6 Al 4 V blasted surfaces causes the presence of nuclei of oxides that cover the area free of particles, especially in the samples treated at 700 °C, giving rise to a higher micro-nano roughness. The presence of the oxide, covering the blasted Ti 6 Al 4 V, decreases the surface reactivity leading to a lower passive current and wider pasivation region, decreasing the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> pitting <b>corrosion.</b> © 2010 Elsevier B.

The lack of chrome lining is unique for an AK and consistent with other Zastava built rifles of Soviet design (such as the Yugoslavian M59 or M59/66).

40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of the natural gas industry, gas transmission pipelines have been developed rapidly in terms of safety, economy and efficiency. Our recent studies have shown that an important factor of main pipelines serviceability loss under their long-term service is the in-bulk metal degradation of the pipe wall. This leads to the loss of the initial mechanical properties, primarily, resistance to brittle fracture, which were set in engineering calculations at the pipeline design stage. At the same time stress corrosion cracking has been identified as one of the predominant failures in pipeline steels in humid environments, which causes rupture of high-pressure gas transmission pipes as well as serious economic losses and disasters. In the present work the low-carbon pipeline steels with different strength levels {{from the point of view}} of their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking in the as-received state and after in-laboratory accelerated degradation under environmental conditions similar to those of an acidic soil were investigated. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether {{the development}} of higher strength materials led <b>to</b> greater <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking and whether degraded pipeline steels became more susceptible <b>to</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking than in the as-received state. The procedure of accelerated degradation of pipeline steels was developed and introduced in laboratory under the combined action of axial loading and hydrogen charging.
