50|$|Since {{the passing}} of the statute, an estate given to a man and the heirs of his body has been known as an <b>estate</b> <b>tail,</b> or an <b>estate</b> in fee <b>tail</b> (feudum talliatum).

5000|$|It {{is claimed}} that the {{operation}} of the statute produced innumerable evils: [...] "children, it is said, grew disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside; farmers were deprived of their leases; creditors were defrauded of their debts; innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the land they had fairly bought; treasons also were encouraged, as <b>estates</b> <b>tail</b> were not liable to forfeiture longer than for the tenant's life".|$|R

The rear tray could be had as a wellside, styled with the Cortina MkIII <b>estate's</b> <b>tail</b> lights, or fitted with a flatdeck or purpose built body.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the construction of mixed asset portfolios and the case for property as a risk diversifier rests on correlations measured over the whole of a given time series. Recent developments in finance, however, focuses on dependence in the tails of the distribution. Does property offer diversification from equity markets when it is most needed - when equity returns are poor. The paper uses an empirical copula approach to test tail dependence between property and equity for the UK and for a global portfolio. Results show strong tail dependence: in the UK, the dependence in the lower tail is stronger than in the upper tail, casting doubt on the defensive properties of real estate stocks.

50|$|Before 1806, when general {{citizenship}} {{was largely}} nonexistent in the Holy Roman Empire, its inhabitants {{were subject to}} varying estate regulations.

"in {{the reign}} of Ed. 4 ... the judges ... determined, that even a nominal and fictitious recompense, {{descending}} to the issue in tail, should be an effectual bar, {{not only to the}} issue in tail, but also to the persons entitled in remainder and reversion. This, though not expressly so decided, is the inference drawn from the determination of the judges in the celebrated case 12 Ed. 4, known as Taltarum's case. The case was thus:— J. S. being seised in fee of the lands in question, gave them to one William Smith, to hold to him, and the heirs of his body, by force of which he was seised. William Smith died, leaving Humphrey, his eldest son, on whom these lands descended, who entered and was seised [...] "per formam doni". Humphrey enfeoffed one Tregos of the said lands in fee, who rendered them to the said Humphrey and Jane, his wife, and to the heirs of their two bodies, remainder in fee to the said Humphrey, by force of which they were seised. Some time afterwards Jane died, on which Humphrey became sole seised of the lands in tail, and, being thus seised, one Taltarum brought a writ of right against Humphrey, and counted of his possession against him. Humphrey made defence, and vouched to warranty one R. King, who entered into the warranty, and joined the demise on the mere right. Afterwards R. King, the vouchee, made default, and departed in contempt of the court, in consequence of which final judgment was given, that the demandant, Taltarum, should recover the lands in question against Humphrey, and that Humphrey should recover lands of equal value of R. King, the vouchee. Humphrey afterwards died, without leaving heirs of his body; and the question was, whether Richard, the brother of Humphrey, who was heir in tail to those lands, should be barred by this recovery? It was determined by all the judges, that the <b>estate</b> <b>tail</b> was not barred by this recovery, because the tenant in tail was not seised of the <b>estate</b> <b>tail</b> {{at the time of the}} recovery, but of another estate; and as the recovery value goes according to the estate whereof the tenant was seised at the time of the recovery, and not in recompense of the estate he had not, the issue in tail could have no recompense in this case, and, therefore, was not barred by the recovery. It follows, therefore, that, if Humphrey had been seised of the <b>estate</b> <b>tail</b> of the gift of J. S. at the time of the recovery, Richard, who, be it observed, was tenant in tail in remainder, would have been barred" ...|$|R

50|$|Next follows an {{elaborate}} discussion upon {{what are called}} estates upon condition - a class of interests that occupied a large space in the early common law, giving rise, on one side, to <b>estates</b> <b>tail,</b> and, on another, to mortgages. In Littleton's time, a mortgage, which he carefully describes, was merely a conveyance of land by the tenant to the mortgagee, with a condition that, if the tenant paid to the mortgagee a certain sum on a certain day, he might reënter and have the land again. If the condition was not fulfilled, {{the interest of the}} mortgagee became absolute, and Littleton gives no indication of any modification of this strict rule, such as was introduced by courts of equity, permitting the debtor to redeem his land by payment of all that was due to the mortgagee although the day of payment had passed, and his interest had become, at law, indefeasible. The remainder of the work is occupied with an exposition of a miscellaneous class of modes of acquiring rights of property, the analysis of which would occupy too large a space.|$|R
50|$|Lady Corbet (one of the {{recipients}} of the estate after Ann Bold's death) settled her fourth part of Shelvock estate on her grandson Corbet Kynaston and in 1702 her sisters Beatrice Thornes and Francis Ironsides transferred their shares (subject to their life interests) to her. In 1707, the remaining fourth was bought from John Price by Corbet Kynaston's trustees for £400. Another deed of family arrangement was executed on August 7, 1707, conveying the manor and manor house of Shelvock and its demesnes to Corbet Kynaston, and other pieces of land nearby to the Bolds and others in fee. Corbet Kynaston became sole owner of Shelvock {{on the death of}} the Bolds some time between 1707 and 1738, when he executed a deed barring his <b>estate</b> <b>tail</b> {{in a part of the}} property. He died unmarried June 17, 1740. He left all his real estates, including Sundorne (inherited from his father) and Shelvock, to Andrew Corbet, whose grandmother was his great-aunt; but Andrew Corbet died April 15, 1741 without issue, and was succeeded by his brother John Corbet.|$|R

50|$|The centre {{that is now}} Rodgau’s biggest {{constituent}} {{community had}} its first documentary mention as early as 786 when the Rotaha Monastery was bequeathed to the Lorsch Abbey.

During floods, it was once known to run red (rot in German). Whereabouts the monastery lay is to this day unknown. Finds, however, confirm that people were settling in what is now Nieder-Roden long before the Christian Era.
