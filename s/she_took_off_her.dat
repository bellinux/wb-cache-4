25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} on the set list of the Loud Tour, which began with the stage decorated as a stylized S set. The singer performed Prince's [...] "Darling Nikki" [...] with three semi-nude female dancers whom she spanked, groped and pretended to smack with a cane. [...] "Darling Nikki" [...] then transitioned into [...] "S" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> white tuxedo, revealing a white bondage corset and handcuffs. [...] "S" [...] was featured on the set list of Spears' Femme Fatale Tour (2011), {{as part of a}} medley with [...] "...Baby One More Time". Rihanna performed [...] "S" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the third song on the set list. The song was included on most of Rihanna's 777 Tour in November 2012; a seven-date and seven-day-long promotional tour in support of the release of her seventh studio album, Unapologetic.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{live for}} the first time the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. During the performance she danced with her male backup dancers and the official video of the song was played on a screen behind them. Later, in May 2012, Beyoncé performed a funky version of the song as a part of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey at Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Then she makes some of the most thorough and gold-plated declarations of self-worth ever rendered in pop. 'There’s nothing not to love about me,' she sang... without needing to make a joke out of it." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice was also positive about the performance of the song, saying, [...] "Live, she threw herself into the track, from tsk-tsk-tsk opening to impassioned ending; after that, the song's frenetic beat got transformed into an extended outro that showcased her band's prowess in such a convincing way, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shoes to dance along with it." [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was included in the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014).|$|E

500|$|The show {{opened with}} a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged {{at the top of}} the {{staircase}} in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of [...] "...Baby One More Time". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and [...] "I Will Be There". After a dance interlude, Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". When she returned to the stage, she performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again". Spears addressed the audience again before the [...] "Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker?" [...] interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage. Spears took to the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] to the boy. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> jacket to reveal a pair of black pants that featured a sequined red heart in the back and performed [...] "The Beat Goes On". After two interludes that presented her dancers and band, Spears appeared onstage to perform [...] "Sometimes". The encore consisted of a dance-oriented performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time".|$|E
500|$|During [...] "White Heat"—which {{featured}} dialogues {{from the}} 1949 James Cagney {{film of the}} same name—a video screen displayed {{a scene from the}} film, with Cagney saying the dialogue: [...] "A copper... a copper fellas". The video screen moves up and Madonna appears, wearing a lamé jacket and holding a plastic gun in her right hand. A large cut out of Cagney appears in the middle and Madonna finishes singing the song, while pointing the revolver towards her dancers and pretending to fire at them, as sounds of gunshots are heard. She followed it with [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] which ended with Madonna pointing to her dancers and musicians across stage and uttering the line [...] "He/She's got the moves baby" [...] numerous times. For [...] "The Look of Love" [...] the spotlight was focused on her. The introductory music of the song started and Madonna roamed around the stage, pretending that she was lost. She wanted to portray her Who's That Girl film character Nikki, when she was lost in a similar sequence in the film. After she finished singing the song, Madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through the air, as the conveyor belt took her backwards, ultimately taking her away from the stage. Then a red phone booth appears on the stage, in which Madonna's silhouette appears to be changing costume. She emerges from the booth wearing the Edna Everage inspired costume and starts singing [...] "Dress You Up". Then she sang [...] "Material Girl", while stretching her legs on stage and showing her underwear and followed by [...] "Like a Virgin", during which <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> outfit piece by piece, until she was standing in the same outfit {{from the beginning of the}} show, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom.|$|E
2500|$|In September, Roxette {{began their}} [...] "Join the Joyride! Tour". Opening on September 4 in Helsinki, the tour {{would see the}} band playing to over 1.7 million people during its 100 shows in Europe, Australia and North and South America. The South American leg of the tour was {{particularly}} successful, with the band playing to nearly 350,000 people at thirteen concerts, resulting in a 27% increase in album sales. The North American leg of the tour received mixed reviews. A review for the Los Angeles Times claimed that Fredriksson was [...] "squandering her talents in pop's low-rent district. She's clearly superior to Roxette's uncomplicated, hook-crammed material"; Jon Pareles of The New York Times criticized their show for its [...] "careful mimicry of MTV. On a set painted in Piet Mondrian primary colors, Miss Fredriksson struts, leans on the other band members, makes symmetrical arm motions, pouts and straps on a guitar {{to take a few}} chords; <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> leather jacket and later her long sleeves, like a G-rated stripper." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bábís {{were divided}} {{somewhat}} between those that viewed the {{movement as a}} break with Islam, centered around Táhirih, and those with a more cautious approach, centered around Quddus. As an act of symbolism, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> traditional veil {{in front of an}} assemblage of men on one occasion and brandished a sword on another. The unveiling caused shock and consternation amongst the men present. Prior to this, many had regarded Táhirih as the epitome of purity and the spiritual return of Fatimah, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad. Many screamed in horror at the sight, and one man was so horrified that he cut his own throat and, with blood pouring from his neck, fled the scene. Táhirih then arose and began a speech on the break from Islam. She quoted from the Quran, [...] "verily, amid gardens and rivers shall the pious dwell in the seat of truth, {{in the presence of the}} potent King" [...] as well as proclaiming herself the Word al-Qa'im would utter on the day of judgement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), chapter [...] Judah left his {{brothers}} {{to live near}} an Adullamite named Hirah. Judah married {{the daughter of a}} Canaanite named Shua and had three sons named Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah arranged for Er to marry a woman named Tamar, but Er was wicked and God killed him. Judah directed Onan to perform a brother's duty and have children with Tamar in Er's name. But Onan knew that the children would not be counted as his, so he spilled his seed, and God killed him as well. Then Judah told Tamar to remain a widow in his house until Shelah could grown up, thinking that if Tamar wed Shelah, he might also die. Later, when Judah's wife died, he went with his friend Hirah to his sheep-shearers at Timnah. When Tamar learned that Judah had gone to Timnah, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> widow's garments and put on a veil and sat on the road to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up and Judah had not given her to be his wife. Judah took her for a harlot, offered her a young goat for her services, and gave her his signet and staff as a pledge for payment, and they cohabited and she conceived. Judah sent Hirah to deliver the young goat and collect his pledge, but he asked about and did not find her. When Hirah reported to Judah that the men of the place said that there had been no harlot there, Judah put the matter to rest {{so as not to be}} put to shame. About three months later, Judah heard that Tamar had played the harlot and become pregnant, and he ordered her to be brought forth and burned. When they seized her, she sent Judah the pledge to identify, saying that she was pregnant by the man whose things they were. Judah acknowledged them and said that she was more righteous than he, inasmuch as he had failed to give her to Shelah. When Tamar delivered, one twin – whom she would name Zerah – put out a hand and the midwife bound it with a scarlet thread, but then he drew it back and his brother – whom she would name Perez – came out. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E
