This new iterative scheme, the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) has been formulated into a computer code using published papers as a resource and tested using the Successive Over-Relaxation (<b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>R.)</b> method {{as a means for}} comparison. As an example, the PCG method using a symmetric coefficient matrix, took approximately one-fourth as many iterations to converge than the <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>R.</b> method with an optimum over-relaxation factor and was substantially more accurate. For the nonsymmetric coefficient matrix, the PCG method took approximately one-fifth as many iterations as did <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>R.</b> All of this work was accomplished on an IBM-PC XT. A general description of the method is given, followed by three example problems.

It continued in production of the Z-42 and Z-43 series but the sales were rapidly falling and the sales network became disorganized as the company organization did not adapt to the market changes from centrally organized eastern markets to the free competition. Also the aircraft design was outdated (mainly engines) and the company could not find customers for its specific advantages (reliability and simple maintenance). The company suffered financial problems in 2002, it was renamed Moravan-Aeroplanes a.s. and it continued production of upgraded variants of Z-242L and Z-143L with improved wing design and Lycoming engines. It also prepared the Z-143Lsi variant with fuel injection engine. However, the financial situation became even worse and the company declared bankruptcy in 2005.
