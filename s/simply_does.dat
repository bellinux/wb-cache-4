25|$|In {{addition}} to the proposals of Motor Theory and Direct Realism about the relation between phonological features and articulatory gestures, Kenneth N. Stevens proposed another kind of relation: between phonological features and auditory properties. According to this view, listeners are inspecting the incoming signal for the so-called acoustic landmarks which are particular events in the spectrum carrying information about gestures which produced them. Since these gestures are limited by the capacities of humans' articulators and listeners are sensitive to their auditory correlates, the lack of invariance <b>simply</b> <b>does</b> not exist in this model. The acoustic properties of the landmarks constitute the basis for establishing the distinctive features. Bundles of them uniquely specify phonetic segments (phonemes, syllables, words).|$|E

25|$|Key {{reasons of}} China's {{interest}} on Africa {{are to be}} found in China itself. Chinese economy, industry, energy and society have a special shape. Chinese economy and industry turn toward export markets. These industries and associated works and investment provide the Chinese society the recent two-digit yearly economic growth, job chances, and life standard improvement, but dramatically rely on coal (70%) and oil (25%) sources (for 2003), as well as raw materials. Notable are the frequent electric shortages. A US Congress hearing noticed that energy shortages have already led to rationing of the electric supply, slowing down manufacturing sector and consequently overall economic growth. On other raw materials side, China <b>simply</b> <b>does</b> not have enough natural resources of its own to meet its growing industrial need.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it.

The cause of the development is spiritual.

Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

Epic has implemented a dual analog layout (one stick controls movement while the other stick controls aim) which sounds good in theory, but is horrid in practice.

Similarly, Spins Annie Zaleski wrote that the [...] "nuanced but proud" [...] rendition of the song [...] "marked the start of Madonna’s Serious Phase, one where she balanced youthful coquettishness with a more mature, introspective outlook".

In his review of Madonna's second greatest hits album, GHV2 (2001), Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave a more critical reception, as he felt the track was out of place among other Madonna songs; [...] "the very presence of 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' [...] <b>simply</b> <b>does</b> not feel comfortable next {{to the rest of the}} savvy, modern music".
