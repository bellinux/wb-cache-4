25|$|When insured parties {{experience}} {{a loss for}} a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> for <b>the</b> covered amount of loss as specified by the policy.

Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and for overhead costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's profit.|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{insurance}} policies inevitably contain a curious exclusion of coverage for regulatory takings claims. Many courts have interpreted this exclusion broadly, applying {{it to all}} land-use litigation. Other courts have interpreted the exclusion narrowly. Both interpretations are problematic. The former {{is at odds with}} policy language and the normal rule that {{insurance policies}} are to be construed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurer.</b> <b>The</b> latter creates an opportunity for plaintiffs to craft their pleadings explicitly to trigger or to avoid triggering the municipality’s insurance coverage. Plaintiffs seeking a quick settlement are well advised to plead around the exclusion so as to settle with <b>the</b> <b>insurer.</b> But plaintiffs seeking to have the local government capitulate should avoid the insurance coverage, forcing the local government to bear its own litigation costs and the risk of an adverse judgment. The possibility of such pleading arbitrage is problematic, and this Article argues that states should find ways to extend insurance to cover Fifth Amendment regulatory takings claims...|$|R
50|$|Marine {{surveying}} {{is often}} {{closely associated with}} marine insurance, damage and salvage, accident and fraud investigation as <b>insurers</b> generally lack <b>the</b> training and skills required to perform a detailed assessment of the condition of a vessel.

Independent marine surveyors are often employed by the clients of marine insurers to provide evidence in support of damage claims made <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurer.</b> Insurance companies cannot require customers to use specific marine surveyors (although they often provide a list of recommended or pre-approved marine surveyors who are known to them).|$|R

40|$|Using the {{representative}} agent approach as in Kaplow (Am Econ Rev 82 : 1013 – 1017, 1992 b), this paper shows that providing tax deductions for the individual's net losses is socially optimal when <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> faces <b>the</b> risk of insolvency. We further {{show that the}} government should adopt a higher tax deduction rate for net losses when <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> is insolvent than when <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> is solvent. Thus, tax deductions for net losses could be used to provide an insurance for individuals <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurer's</b> risk of insolvency. These findings could also be used to explain why a government provides supplementary public insurance or government relief. Finally, we discuss that, if the individuals are heterogeneous in terms of loss severity, loss probability, or income level, providing a tax deduction for the individual's net losses may not always achieve a Pareto improvement, and cross subsidization should be taken into consideration.

40|$|To ensure {{long-term}} persistence, organisms must {{adapt to}} climate change, but an evolutionary {{response to a}} quantified selection pressure driven by climate change has not been empirically demonstrated in a wild population.

We show that strong viability <b>selection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> brown morph occurs, but only under snow-rich winters. As winter conditions became milder in <b>the</b> last decades, <b>selection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> brown morph diminished. Concurrent with this reduced selection, the frequency of brown morphs increased rapidly in our study population during the last 28 years and nationwide during the last 48 years.

50|$|In 2008, {{financial}} setbacks endangered the city's viability. The {{economic crisis}} severely affected tourism, which generates the most revenue, {{and that just}} {{at the time when}} the city had finalized a $18 million settlement over a property lawsuit. As the municipal budget was typically $14 million or less, city fathers had issued bonds with annual payments of approximately $1 million over 25 years. As a result of these combined fiscal obstacles, the threat of bankruptcy was very real. Dozens of meetings were held in order to decide where the budget should be cut and finally 75% of municipal employees were laid off and replaced with contract workers. Also, employee contributions toward retirement benefits were raised. However, the city council sought to regain the money paid in the settlement, believing that it should have been paid by <b>the</b> city's <b>insurers.</b> A lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurers</b> was decided in 2013 and <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> ordered to pay more than $13 million to the city; the costs of the lawsuit had been partially covered by the Association of Bay Area Governments.|$|R

40|$|This study {{predicts the}} {{ultimate}} {{probability of survival}} of a newly arisen drug resistant mutant in a population of malaria parasites, {{with a view to}} understanding what conditions favour the evolution of drug resistance. Using branching process theory and a population genetics transmission model, the probabilities of survival of one- and two-locus new mutants are calculated as functions of the degree of drug pressure, the mean and variation in transmission rate, and the degree of natural <b>selection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mutant. Probability of survival increases approximately linearly with drug pressure, the slope of the line increasing with mean transmission rate. Thus increased drug pressure, especially in combination with high transmission rates, strongly favours the evolution of drug resistance. These conclusions also hold for the case of multiple drug resistance where it is coded for by two unlinked loci: the greater effective recombination breakdown in high transmission areas is counteracted by greater effective selection so that the net effect of higher transmission rates is to favour the evolution of multiple drug resistance. High variability in transmission rate and natural <b>selection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mutants are unfavourable to mutant survival, though these are relatively weak forces...|$|R
