5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in <b>South</b> <b>Australia</b> were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and <b>South</b> <b>Australia</b> was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and <b>South</b> <b>Australia</b> were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E
