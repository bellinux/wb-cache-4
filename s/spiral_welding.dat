By creating dynamic value stream maps makes it possible to analyze more complex systems than traditional VSM. Simulation can be used with value stream mapping to give it power and flexibility in order to dynamically change the state of the system.   The <b>spiral</b> <b>welding</b> production line has been working for many years.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} strain capacity of <b>spiral</b> <b>welded</b> pipelines displays to some extents unexplained behaviour. Therefore, {{they are not}} (yet) used extensively in offshore applications and harsh conditions, demanding a strain based design. An important factor that influences the tensile strain capacity is the quantity of anisotropy {{in terms of strength}} and toughness. Starting from an anisotropic hot rolled highstrength steel skelp, the process of helical forming and post-treating of the pipe adds heterogeneity and changes the level of anisotropy of the product. A parameter that should be examined with respect to anisotropy is the crack driving force, a measure for the toughness of the pipeline steel. Additional to the mode I loading (opening of the crack), the mode III component drives the in-plane shear motion of a crack in the <b>spiral</b> <b>weld</b> when the pipe is subjected to longitudinal deformation. This action, not present in longitudinal welded pipes, shows a decreasing contribution with increasing plasticity. FE simulations have demonstrated a rise of crack driving force in anisotropic cases with respect to an isotropic reference. However, exact data and variation of various parameters, along with experimental testing need to be conducted. The outcome analysis of such simulations and tests can validate existing models, or help create a better understanding of anisotropic and heterogenic influences on the tensile strain capacity of <b>spiral</b> <b>welded</b> pipes...|$|R

The specimen was a 2. 5 inches OD carbon steel tube covered with a layer of Inconel 625 weld overlay. Residual strains in the carbon steel and weld overlay layers were determined using the ferritic (211) and austenitic (311) reflections, respectively. Residual stresses in each material were derived from the measured strains using Hooke`s law and appropriate elastic constants. Tensile stress regions were found not only in the weld metal but also in the heat affected zone in the carbon steel. The maximum tensile stress was located in the weld overlay layer and was found to be 360 MPa, or about 75 % of the yield strength of the weld metal. The experimental data were compared with a finite element analysis based on an uncoupled thermal-mechanical formulation. Overall, the modeling results were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data, although the hoop strain (stress) appears to have been overestimated by the finite element model.

40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally welded tubes in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally welded tubes and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally welded tubes. Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally welded tubes with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (<b>spiral</b> <b>welds</b> and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined.
