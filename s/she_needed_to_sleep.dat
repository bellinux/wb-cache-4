Lara Masters, who is a {{wheelchair}} user herself, was upset at how the photographer had hidden their disabilities, but the other judges dismissed her comment, stating that not all the photos have to show their disabilities. Mark Summers commented about Jessica holding the watering can. Without her wrist splints, Jessicas hands are paralysed, but she showed how her fingers naturally curled up {{and she was able}} to hold the watering can by her fingers. When she was asked how much sleep <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> (which had been an issue through the series) she replied that there is no telling when <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
50|$|A mysterious woman {{known as}} the Phantom Warrior (Gen'ei no Senshi) who aids the Rebel Army. In reality, her true {{identity}} is Leina, the Exiled Warrior and the true victor of the last Queen's Blade tournament who had given up her title as Queen to her half-sister Claudette to travel the world. However during her travels, she contracted a mysterious disease that requires her <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> 16 hours a day. Not only does <b>she</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> that long, <b>she</b> also experiences sudden cases of narcolepsy, often requiring her to retreat to her hideout whenever she feels drowsiness. Nonetheless, she is a well-revered warrior who is loved by many. Due to the fighting spirit ingrained in her body, even when she falls asleep due to her curse, she viciously attacks all who approach her carelessly. She has joined and helped Annelotte's party on several occasions, but {{has a tendency to}} act alone. Although she does not have a gamebook in Rebellion, she has appeared in all other media. Created by Hirokazu Hisayuki.|$|R

She was hunted by humans until she met Zakuro, a necromancer who became her first friend. <b>She</b> doesn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> {{as long as she}} wears her name tag although she does wear her Jiangshi tag every morning as a wake-up call but without the tags she {{is little more than a}} human corpse and can not move. Rin says that she hates the starry sky, having been on the run for so long with no roof <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> under, and staying outside during the night began to cause her fear. Due to being constantly bullied by her human classmates during childhood, she loathed humans until being saved by Akina. She now works in a delivery store.|$|R
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down.

40|$|Sleep has a {{substantial}} effect on health status where good sleeping habits proves positive on learning. The {{aim of the}} present study was to map the views and perceptions of sleep and its effects on health and school performance on 12 -year olds. The goal is to visualize these views to give teachers the possibility to better plan the education in concordance with the students’ abilities. The study is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews where 12 students aged 12 have partaken. The results show that while the majority of children interviewed know how long they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for optimal performance but many think that they are not sleeping sufficiently due to temptation from digital media. The children have the perception that we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>to</b> gather energy and for the brain to rest. In agreement with this, they are aware that too little sleep can impact school performance in a negative way. However, they are unaware that bad sleeping habits can have a negative impact also on the physical health...|$|R
