50|$|RESPOND is a {{sponsored}} {{research program}} of Indian Space Research Organization whose main {{objective is to}} establish strong links with Universities/Institutions {{in the country to}} carry out quality research and developmental projects which are of relevance to space and derive useful outputs of such R&D to support ISRO programmes. The programme provides opportunity to the non-ISRO scientists and engineers, who are working with the recognized institute, to contribute to the Indian space programme. The contribution is mostly in areas of design and development of orbiting satellites for scientific research and space applications, sounding <b>rockets</b> and <b>satellite</b> launch <b>vehicles.</b> Non-academic R & D institutions can also participate in this programme.|$|R

30|$|The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), with {{a humble}} {{beginning}} about 60  years ago, developed <b>rockets,</b> <b>satellite</b> building, communication, and remote sensing technologies.

The first planetary mission was Chandrayaan- 1, an orbiter mission to the Moon, which was realised in late 2008.
