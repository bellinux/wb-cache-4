50|$|The US {{line has}} been critiqued as being either too high or too low.

Others, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>economist</b> Ellen Frank, argue that the poverty measure is too low as families spend much less of their total budget on food than they did when the measure was established in the 1950s. Further, federal poverty statistics do not account for the widely varying regional differences in non-food costs such as housing, transport, and utilities.|$|E
