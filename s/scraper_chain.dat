40|$|A load to an {{armoured}} {{face conveyor}} (AFC) during coal mining is changeable and very difficult or even {{impossible to be}} predicted. Changes of the load to the upper <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> affect the load of the driving motor and generate changes in a <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> tension. Impact of increasing the external load to the upper <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> on the operation of electric motors and on the <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> tension is presented. The developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor enabled identifying the places of the <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> high tension or places of its loosening. An impact of changing frequency of driving motor voltage on AFC’s operational conditions was tested and analysed using the AFC’s numerical model. During tests, tension of the <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> on the discharge end and the return end was recorded. High tension of the <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> and its loosening during the changeable load were also recorded on upward and downward transportation of run-of-mine material...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of stress analysis of blade wheels, one way Fluid-Structure Interaction method was introduced based on the comparisons of existing methods. Finite element analysis software ANSYS along with CFD software FLUENT were comprehensively used for the strength analysis of dual-chamber couplings. According to the simulation results from CFD, the node loads at the interface of pump wheel and the working fluid were obtained and the torque and axial force were predicated. Then the static stress of pump wheel was analyzed with ANSYS. The detail processes were described in this paper. The {{results show that the}} blades of pump wheel is loaded by alternating forces, and the maximum stress, which is 64 MPa, locates at the junction area of the blades and shell. And the coupling analyzed in this study meets the strength requirement. Introducion Hydrodynamic couplings are the most commonly used soft-start equipments for armored face conveyors in mining face. A coupling is arranged between the motor and speed reducer to make the conveyor start up smoothly, protect the motor and <b>scraper</b> <b>chains</b> when overloading occurs and improve the transmission quality. Considering the narrow space and explosive risk under coal mine, the large power coupling used in mining face adopts dual-chamber structure and pure water as th...|$|R
6000|$|Apart from hooks, and lines, and {{ordinary}} nets, fishermen have, from time immemorial, {{made use of}} two kinds of implements for getting at sea- creatures which live beyond tide-marks--these are the [...] "dredge" [...] and the [...] "trawl." [...] The dredge is used by oyster-fishermen. Imagine a large bag, the mouth of which has {{the shape of an}} elongated parallelogram, and is fastened to an iron frame of the same shape, the two long sides of this rim being fashioned into <b>scrapers.</b> <b>Chains</b> attach the ends of the frame to a stout rope, so that when the bag is dragged along by the rope the edge of one of the scrapers rests on the ground, and scrapes whatever it touches into the bag. The oyster-dredger takes one of these machines in his boat, and when he has reached the oyster-bed the dredge is tossed overboard; as soon as it has sunk to the bottom the rope is paid out sufficiently to prevent it from pulling the dredge directly upwards, and is then made fast while the boat goes ahead. The dredge is thus dragged along and scrapes oysters and other sea-animals and plants, stones, and mud into the bag. When the dredger judges it to be full he hauls it up, picks out the oysters, throws the rest overboard, and begins again.|$|R
40|$|The {{ballast bed}} {{as part of}} the railway track fulfils the {{important}} functions as the binding element between sleepers and substructure. Fouling increases over the years for various reasons. When the necessary good functioning is no longer assured, ballast bed cleaning must be performed. The machines, that perform that task, are equipped with various complex mechanics - hydraulic systems that ensure high productivity, efficiency and quality of the works. In this article is presented one way of studying the work of the machine for excavating ballast from the ballast bed to the sieving machine.

40|$|The {{safety of}} coal ploughs {{was to be}} {{enhanced}} by reducing servicing and repair operations, which are carried out in critical working areas, in cramped conditions and with poor visibility and insecure footing. Based on the experience so fara with pretensioning systems for <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> conveyors, new systems for coal ploughs were constructed and tested. Failures like chain rupture followed by crash situations can be prevented by constant monitoring and optimised control of the plough chain tension. This will also help to prevent secondary damage which requires long repair times. Optimal pretensioning will also prolong the life of chains and other components by reducing power, vibrations and wear.

40|$|Armoured face {{conveyors}} (AFCs) {{of length}} even up to 500 meters {{are used in}} coal mines for transportation of run-of-mine. The method of their installation depends on the geological and mining conditions and on a coal seam position. Operation of AFC in a horizontal or inclined position is allowed. The maximum accepted inclination {{is determined by the}} machine manufacturer. Two directions of longitudinal inclination of the conveyor have to be considered: upward and downward transportation of excavated material. Both the angle and the direction of inclination of the conveyor {{have a significant impact on}} the dynamics of its operation. Change in inclination of AFC results in tension of the chain. Loosening the <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> can lead to blockage, what can be a reason of damage. Excessive chain tension results in speeding up frictional wear of conveyor components. Determination of an impact of longitudinal inclination of the conveyor on a degree and a place of loosening or excessive tension of the chain was the objective of the numerical analyses, the results of which are presented. Analysis were performed using the developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor. These analyses are a part of the preparatory work aiming at development of the control algorithm of AFC, to prevent the formation of unfavorable dynamic effects during the conveyor operation...|$|E

40|$|The basic {{behavior}} of mining crushed goods in <b>chain</b> <b>scraper</b> conveyors was examined using a special test stand. The characteristics resistance {{lines of the}} upper end-piece were determined for conveyor idle {{as a function of}} the determinative crushed good characteristics (granular structure, moisture content, type of goods) on the size of the conveyor load, on the conveyor construction and on the stopped time of the conveyor. Crushed goods with a narrow granular profile and sphere-like grains caused about 35 % greater resistance than fine coal and raw coal with broad granular profile. For goods containing water more than 10 % by weight, the solids friction retreated in favor of flow friction. The coefficient of resistance decreased considerably in the range of lower speeds and then increased with increasing conveyor speed. The conveyance of sandstone ore required about 280 % greater specific drive than the conveyance of raw coal. Resistance coefficients for coal and raw coal showed no dependence on the design of the conveyor. Start-up of loaded conveyors after longer stop times was simulated and the specific break-loose force was determined...|$|R
