40|$|Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) are the photon {{detectors}} {{chosen for}} the tracking read-out in NEXT, a neutrinoless beta beta decay experiment which uses a high pressure gaseous xenon time projection chamber (TPC). The reconstruction of event track and topology in this gaseous detector is a key handle for background rejection. Among the commercially available sensors {{that can be used}} for tracking, SiPMs offer important advantages, mainly high gain, ruggedness, cost-effectiveness and radio-purity. Their main drawback, however, is their non sensitivity in the emission spectrum of the xenon <b>scintillation</b> (<b>peak</b> at 175 nm). This is overcome by coating these sensors with the organic wavelength shifter tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). In this paper we describe the protocol developed for coating the SiPMs with TPB and the measurements performed for characterizing the coatings as well as the performance of the coated sensors in the UV-VUV range...|$|E
40|$|A solar SCIDAR (scintillation {{detection}} and ranging) technique is proposed {{for measuring the}} heights of turbulent layers using the Sun itself, instead of the binary stars used in night-time SCIDAR. A formula for the technique is derived under various assumptions: uniform intensity distributions on the solar surface and sparse speckle distributions on the image plane. It indicates that the cross-correlation of <b>scintillation</b> shadows yields <b>peaks</b> at positions corresponding to layer heights, although the shapes of peaks are blurred by both an extended seeing disc and a finite-sized field stop. A knife-edge effect caused by field stops in an observational system is also described, which yields another peak at {{the centre of the}} correlation plane. Observations were conducted using a solar SCIDAR system developed at the Hida Observatory in Japan. In many results, peaks on correlation planes demonstrated a contrast high enough for them to be distinguished from the background. Most of the distances to turbulent layers derived from the <b>scintillation</b> <b>peaks</b> were found to be between 2. 5 and 3. 5 [*]km. Use of a high-performance adaptive-optics system upstream of the SCIDAR system is suggested in order to provide better results...|$|R
40|$|An {{optical link}} has been {{established}} between the Canary Islands La Palma and Tenerife. A 1064 -nm transmitting laser was located on La Palma whereas a BPSK communication receiver and measurement instruments were installed in ESA's OGS on Tenerife. Beside the demonstration of a high-data-rate coherent signal transmission, {{the goal of the}} experiment was to measure the effects of the atmosphere on the beam propagation in order to estimate its impact on optical links. Wavefront distortions have been investigated by means of a DIMM instrument and scintillation was observed by imaging the pupil of the OGS telescope on a CCD camera. Strong scintillation was observed during the entire campaign with <b>scintillation</b> <b>peaks</b> at sunsets and sunrises, and saturation at about noon. Because of the narrowness of the beam (10 -μrad divergence), beam wander has been a serious issue. Statistical results are compared with theory...|$|R

40|$|We analyze data {{recorded}} from October 2010 to September 2011, {{during the}} ascending {{phase of the}} 24 th solar cycle, from an Advanced Ionospheric Sounder-Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia ionosonde and a GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and total electron content (TEC) monitor scintillation receiver, colocated at low latitude in the Southern American longitudinal sector (Tucumán, 26. 9 °S, 294. 6 °E, magnetic latitude 15. 5 °S, Argentina). The site offers the opportunity to perform spread-F and GPS scintillation statistics of occurrence under the southern crest of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly. Spread-F signatures, classified into four types (strong range spread-F (SSF), range spread-F, frequency spread-F (FSF), and mixed spread-F), the phase and amplitude scintillation index (σΦ and S 4, respectively), the TEC, {{and the rate of}} TEC parameter, marker of the TEC gradients, that can cause scintillations, are considered. The seasonal behavior results as follows: the occurrence of all four types of spread-F is higher in summer and lower in winter, while the occurrence of <b>scintillations</b> <b>peaks</b> at equinoxes in the postsunset sector and shows a minimum in winter. The correspondence between SSF and scintillations seems to be systematic, and a possible correlation between S 4 and FSF peaks is envisaged at the terminator. The investigation focused also on two particular periods, from 12 to 16 March 2011 and from 23 to 29 September 2011, both characterized by the simultaneous presence of SSF signatures and scintillation phenomena, allowing to discuss the role of traveling ionospheric disturbances as a strong candidate causing ionospheric irregularities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{developed}} a new approach for analyzing complex α-emitting radionuclide mixtures. The approach is based on liquid-liquid extraction using appropriate extractive liquid scintillation (LS) cocktails, followed by LS counting (LSC), and processing of spectra using RadSpectraDec software. This software fits the sample spectrum with a linear combination of spectra from individual radionuclides that have been measured previously. Using extraction with liquid complexing agents and counting via a LS counter, {{it was possible to}} increase the relative resolution of <b>scintillation</b> α <b>peaks</b> to 9 – 10 %, which is sufficient for the RadSpectraDec program. This approach was successfully applied to the analysis of real environmental and technological samples, and good results have been obtained. The limitations of this approach are also considered...|$|R
50|$|The crystal is {{transparent}} and emits light {{when it is}} hit by gamma rays and x-rays, making it useful as a detector of ionizing radiation. Its <b>peak</b> <b>scintillation</b> wavelength is 480 nm (with emission range between 380-660 nm), and efficiency of 13000 photons/MeV. It has a relatively high light yield, its light output is about 40% of NaI(Tl), but the time of scintillation is quite long (12−15 μs). It is often used in computed tomography. Combining the scintillator crystal with externally applied piece of boron carbide allows construction of compact detectors of gamma rays and neutron radiation.|$|R
30|$|Figure  13 {{shows the}} {{dependence}} of S 4 max on altitude in various forms. Figure  13 a, b shows S 4 max values {{as a function of}} local time and altitude for Tucumán and Taiwan, respectively. Figure  13 c, d shows the same dependence as Fig.  13 a, b but for the locations at the geomagnetic equator, which are magnetically conjugated with Tucumán and Taiwan, respectively. Figure  13 e, f presents the S 4 max values as a function of season and altitude for Tucumán and Taiwan, respectively. It is obvious that the altitude range of ~ 200 – 300  km, which is the region of the largest electron densities, dominantly contributes to <b>scintillations.</b> Another <b>peak</b> appearing near ~ 100  km in Taiwan corresponds to the Es layer. The occurrence of the Es layer was significantly lower in Tucumán. These results are consistent with the study of Arras et al. (2008), who showed that the Es layer occurs relatively rarely over South America likely because of the South Atlantic anomaly.|$|R
40|$|Three months 2 ̆ 7 {{observations}} {{obtained at}} Brisbane of the scintillations of the 20 Mc/s transmissions from Explorer VII have been analysed in detail. The scintillations have a Gaussian distribution of amplitude and a <b>scintillation</b> rate which <b>peaks</b> at 2 c/s. The phenomenon is mainly a night-time one but some slight activity persists into the daylight hours. There {{is no evidence}} of a correlation with sporadic-E but the scintillations are found to be associated with both the frequency-spreading and range-spreading types of spread-F. The scintillation activity is found to increase with zenith angle in a manner which can be interpreted in terms of the same system of irregularities, at heights of the order of 200 - 600 km, producing both the scintillations and spread-F...|$|R
30|$|On {{comparing}} the IMF Bz northward (Bz >  0) and southward (Bz ≤  0) {{conditions in the}} bottom panels of Figs.  4 and 5, it can be observed that in general for Bz southward conditions, <b>scintillation</b> occurrence <b>peaks</b> in the 18 – 02  h MLT sector and that the associated scintillation occurrence percentage is higher. It can also be observed that for southward Bz conditions, scintillation occurs in the magnetic local noon sector during the strong solar maximum period. The IMF components are measured at the L 1 Lagrangian point and therefore the IMF components have to be shifted {{to account for the}} convection time delay from the L 1 point to the magnetosphere. However, as this study dealt with a statistical representation, the IMF components have not been shifted and this could be the possible reason for the relatively smaller percentage of scintillation occurrence observed during northward IMF Bz conditions. The top panels of Figs.  4 and 5 show that there are no significant differences in the scintillation occurrence pattern for positive and negative values of IMF By. The analysis of Figs.  4 and 5 confirms that scintillation occurrence at Bronnoysund is strongly associated with southward IMF Bz conditions. This could possibly be linked to the occurrence of polar cap patches during southward IMF Bz (Valladares et al. 1994 and the references therein).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the first results from {{measurements}} of scintillation and {{total electron content}} (TEC) from an equatorial station, Lagos (Latitude 6. 5 N, Longitude 3. 4 E, magnetic latitude 3. 03 S), Nigeria, using a Novatel GSV 4004 B GPS ionospheric scintillation and TEC monitor. Details are presented for data collected between February 2010 and August 2010. The {{results show that the}} presence of some large scale depletions of TEC or plasma bubbles may be noted during the evening hours and that TEC depletions correspond to increased rate of change of TEC (ROT). This confirms that plasma bubbles are associated with large scale irregularities. It is also established that enhanced amplitude scintillation (S 4) corresponds quite well with TEC depletions and increases in ROT. The diurnal and seasonal percentage occurrence for different levels of <b>scintillation</b> activity has <b>peaks</b> in the equinox months (March and April) at 23 : 00 LT...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the ionospheric responses observed in Hong Kong to a Typhoon, namely, Tembin, from {{the aspects of}} the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities and scintillations, using Global Positioning System (GPS) observations from a ground-based GPS scintillation monitoring station in Hong Kong and from GPS receivers on board the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites. The ionospheric irregularities and scintillations are characterized by the rate of total electron content variation index (ROTI) and the amplitude scintillation index S 4, respectively. The typhoon Tembin formed over the western North Pacific during 18 – 30 August 2012 and approached Hong Kong during 24 – 27 August 2012 with the closest distance 290 km from Hong Kong at around 17 universal time (UT) on 25 August 2012. The ground-based observations indicate that in the nighttime period of 20 : 00 – 02 : 00 local time (LT = UT + 8 h) on 26 August when Tembin passed closely to Hong Kong, the ionospheric irregularities and scintillations of GPS signals were observed {{in the south of}} Hong Kong, over the area of 13 °N ~ 23 °N in latitude and 110 °E ~ 120 °E in longitude. From the COSMIC observations, it shows that the number of radio occultation <b>scintillation</b> events <b>peaks</b> on 26 August 2012 during the passage of Tembin. Without the presence of strong geomagnetic or solar activity, it is suspected that gravity waves might be generated in the lower atmosphere and likely seed the formation of ionospheric plasma irregularities. This work for the first time from Hong Kong observes the sign of coupling between the lower atmosphere and ionosphere in a tropical cyclone event, combining both ground- and space-based GPS observation data.

40|$|Rapid {{fluctuation}} in the amplitude and {{phase of}} transionospheric radio signals caused by small scale ionospheric plasma density irregularities {{is known as}} scintillation. Over the high latitudes, irregularities causing scintillation are associated with large scale plasma structures and scintillation occurrence is mainly enhanced during geomagnetic storms. This paper presents a statistical analysis of scintillation occurrence on GPSL 1 C/A signal at a high latitude station located in Bronnoysund (geographic latitude 65. 5 °N, geographic longitude 12. 2 °E; corrected geomagnetic (CGM) latitude 62. 77 °N), Norway, during the periods around the peaks of solar cycles 23 (2002 – 2003) and 24 (2011 – 2013). The analysis revealed that the scintillation occurrence at Bronnoysund during both the solar maximum periods maximises close to the midnight magnetic local time (MLT) sector. A higher occurrence of scintillation is observed on geomagnetically active days during both the solar maximum periods. The seasonal pattern of <b>scintillation</b> occurrence indicated <b>peaks</b> {{during the summer and}} equinoctial months. A comparison with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) components By and Bz showed an association of scintillation occurrence with the southward IMF Bz conditions...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} using a 3 D liquid scintillator (LS) detector system for the verification and characterization of proton beams in real time for intensity and energy-modulated proton therapy. A plastic tank filled with liquid scintillator was irradiated with pristine proton Bragg <b>peaks.</b> <b>Scintillation</b> light produced during the irradiation was measured with a CCD camera. Acquisition rates of 20 and 10 frames per second (fps) were used to image consecutive frame sequences. These measurements were then compared to ion chamber measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. The light distribution measured from the images acquired at rates of 20 and 10 fps have standard deviations of 1. 1 % and 0. 7 %, respectively, in the plateau region of the Bragg curve. Differences were seen between the raw LS signal and the ion chamber due to the quenching effects of the LS and due to the optical properties of the imaging system. The authors showed that this effect can be accounted for and corrected by Monte Carlo simulations. The liquid scintillator detector system has a good potential for performing fast proton beam verification and characterization...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{climatology}} of ionospheric scintillations and the zonal drift velocities of scintillation-producing irregularities are depicted for a station located under the southern {{crest of the}} equatorial ionization anomaly. Then, the α [*]−[*] μ ionospheric fading model {{is used for the}} first- and second-order statistical characterization of amplitude scintillations. In the statistical analyzes, data are used from single-frequency GPS receivers acquired during ∼  17  years (September  1997 –November  2014) at Cachoeira Paulista (22. 4 ° S; 45. 0 ° W), Brazil. The results reveal that the nocturnal occurrence of scintillations follows the seasonal distribution of plasma bubble irregularities observed in the longitudinal sector of eastern South America. In addition to the solar cycle dependence, the results suggest that the occurrence climatology of scintillations is also modulated by the secular variation in the dip latitude of Cachoeira Paulista, since the maximum occurrence of <b>scintillations</b> during the <b>peak</b> of solar cycle 24 was ∼  20  % lower than that observed during the maximum of solar cycle 23. The dynamics of the irregularities throughout a solar cycle, as investigated from the estimates of the mean zonal drift velocities, presented a good correlation with the EUV and F 10. 7  cm solar fluxes. Meanwhile, the seasonal behavior showed that the magnitude of the zonal drift velocities is larger during the December solstice months than during the equinoxes. In terms of modeling, the results for the α [*]−[*] μ distribution fit quite well with the experimental data and with the temporal characteristics of fading events independently of the solar activity level...|$|R
