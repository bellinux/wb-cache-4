5|$|In the United Kingdom, Conservative {{party leader}} and future Prime Minister David Cameron urged people {{to watch the}} film in order to {{understand}} climate change. In Belgium, activist Margaretha Guidone persuaded the entire Belgian government to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hitchcock {{did most}} of the {{promotion}} on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews, certainly preserved the secret.|$|E
5|$|Before the film's {{worldwide}} release date, Pixar {{granted a}} wish from 10-year-old Colby Curtin to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> before she died. Colby {{had been diagnosed}} with cancer and was too sick to go to a theater. A Pixar employee flew to the Curtins' house with a DVD of the finished film and screened it for her and her family. Curtin died seven hours later at 9:20 pm, shortly after seeing the film.|$|E

5|$|Latter Days {{was filmed}} in several {{locations}} in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget. After Cox had financed {{the search for}} initial backing, funding was acquired from private investors who wanted to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> made. However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained difficult. It was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, who picked it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico was {{released}} into UK cinemas on 26 April 1949; {{the film was}} financially successful. For the US release on 23 October 1949, soil was imported and {{placed in front of}} the cinema; commissionaires in the uniform of a British policeman would hand out mock passports and invite passers-by to step onto English soil to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> The film was shown at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, although it was not entered into the competition.|$|E
5|$|The first commercially {{released}} domestic {{feature film}} {{to deal with}} the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers– although in many cases audiences were required to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students. Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, such use of the film has become less common. Although the film's artistic aspects remain well-received, its misrepresentation of history has been criticised.|$|E

Their response was described as appearing to be sound in specific aspects by American skeptic Jim Lippard, who had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> at that time. Having <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> he described it as trying to hide its own creationism, which becomes increasingly apparent as <b>the</b> <b>film</b> progresses.|$|R
500|$|On 6 July 2004, the 40th {{anniversary of}} <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> world premiere, a private {{cast and crew}} reunion {{screening}} was hosted in London by DVD producer Martin Lewis. The screening was attended by McCartney, actors Victor Spinetti, John Junkin, David Janson and many crew members. In media interviews at the event, McCartney disclosed that while he had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> many times on video, he had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> on <b>the</b> [...] "big screen" [...] since its 1964 premiere.|$|R
5|$|Union {{announced}} that Soeara Berbisa {{would be released}} {{to coincide with the}} Eid al-Fitr holiday, which began on 22 October 1941, and advertisements for screenings in Medan, in northern Sumatra, date to early November 1941. A review in the Surabaya edition of De Indische Courant, however, indicates that the film had only premiered in the east Javan city on 14 January 1942. That newspaper gave a positive review, describing Soeara Berbisa as a tense film with humorous moments and beautiful scenery. Its review ended with a recommendation that young people and their parents <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people would <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end}} of 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook.|$|E
5|$|Prospects for a {{successful}} release did not look good. Aykroyd and Belushi had left SNL {{at the end of}} the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and critical failure of 1941 {{at the end of the}} year. One day after the editing was done, Wasserman invited Landis up to his office to speak with Ted Mann, head of the Mann Theatres chain, which dominated film exhibition in the Western United States. He told Landis that he would not book the film at any theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods, such as Westwood. Not only did Mann not want black patrons going there to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> he surmised that white viewers were unlikely to see a film featuring older black musical stars. Ultimately The Blues Brothers got less than half the bookings nationwide for its initial release than a typical big-budget studio film of the era, which did not bode well for its success at the box office.|$|E

5|$|The Chumscrubber premiered on January 25, 2005 at the Sundance Film Festival. It {{went on to}} {{be shown}} at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival in June 2005, where it won the Audience Award. The film was {{released}} theatrically in the United States on August 5, 2005, playing in 28 theaters. It earned US$28,548 on its opening weekend, ranking 59th at the box office. It closed after two weeks in release with a total domestic gross of $52,597. The film's highest-grossing overseas releases were in Australia with $96,696, Germany with $81,323, and Greece with $71,100. It earned only £36 from its single-weekend release in the United Kingdom, meaning that only six people paid for a ticket to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> With a total foreign gross of $298,804, the film's total worldwide gross was $351,401 and was a box office bomb.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the boys}} begin swearing in class, and {{are sent to}} Mr. Mackey, the school counselor, who informs their mothers.

Kenny immolates himself and ultimately dies, leading to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman being grounded. Kenny is sent to Hell, where he is tormented by Satan and Saddam Hussein. Back on Earth, the parents of South Park organize a boycott against Canada and Terrance and Phillip, which is led by Kyle's mother, Sheila. Terrance and Phillip are arrested as war criminals. When the United States refuses to release the duo, Canada retaliates by bombing the residence of the Baldwin brothers.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} a {{commercial}} success, {{though it was}} highly controversial for its portrayal of black men (many played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force. There were widespread African-American protests against The Birth of a Nation, such as in Boston, while thousands of white Bostonians flocked to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> The NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film.
