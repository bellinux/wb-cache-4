40|$|The AHMCT Research Center, {{together}} with Caltrans, has been leading a multi-year research {{effort to develop}} innovative high production crack <b>sealing</b> <b>equipment,</b> which improves safety while reducing costs. The Sealzall Machine development project is {{the latest version of}} a line of successful longitudinal crack sealing machine prototypes developed and deployed with Caltrans on California highways. The program’s key technical element has been the application of automation technologies and custom engineering solutions to achieve increased sealing efficiencies and to eliminate the workers ’ exposure to highway traffic. The preceding Transfer Tank Longitudinal Sealer (TTLS) development project produced a prototype high production longitudinal sealing application vehicle and a large capacity transfer kettle trailer designed to efficiently resupply and support high production highway sealing operations. Defective commercial sealant melting equipment had rendered the TTLS equipment effectively unusable for general deployment. In addition to replacing deficient components, Caltrans requested inclusion of additional features to further enhance functionality.

40|$|At present, {{many high}} gas and {{outburst}} mines have poor gas drainage effects. An important reason influencing the gas drainage {{effect is a}} poor hole-sealing effect. Most studies on gas drainage borehole sealing focus on local and foreign borehole sealing methods, borehole <b>sealing</b> <b>equipment,</b> and borehole sealing materials. Numerical simulations of initial drilling sealing depth are insufficient because studies on this subject are few. However, when the initial sealing depth of the borehole is not chosen reasonably, air can enter the gas drainage drill hole through the circumferential crack of roadway surrounding rocks {{under the influence of}} suction pressure of the drainage system. This phenomenon ultimately affects the hole-sealing effect. To improve the drilling hole sealing of gas drainage boring, we deduced the expression formulas of the crushing zone, plastic zone, and elastic zone around the coal-seam floor stone drift and conducted a stress–strain analysis of the coal-seam floor stone drift of the 2145 working surfaces of the Sixth Coal Mine of Hebi Coal Mine Group Company by using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and on-scene verification. Finally, we obtain the initial drilling sealing depth, which is a main contribution of this study. The results prove the following. The performed hole-sealing process with an initial drilling sealing depth of 8 m has a gas drainage efficiency of 55...|$|E

40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{established}} the Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) in 1975 as a cooperative endeavor with the cruise vessel industry. VSP' {{goal is to}} assist the industry {{to develop and implement}} comprehensive sanitation programs to protect the health of passengers and crew aboard cruise vessels. Every cruise vessel that has a foreign itinerary, carries 13 or more passengers, and calls on a U. S. port is subject to biannual operational inspections and when necessary, re-inspection by VSP. The vessel owner pays a fee, based on gross registered tonnage (GRT) of the vessel, for all operational inspections. The Vessel Sanitation Program Operations Manual (VSP Operations Manual), which is available on the VSP Web site (www. cdc. gov/nceh/vsp), covers details of these inspections. Additionally, cruise vessel owners or shipyards that build or renovate cruise vessels may voluntarily request plan reviews, on-site shipyard construction inspections and/or final construction inspections of new or remodeled vessels before their first or next operational inspection. The vessel owner or shipyard pays a fee, based on GRT of the vessel, for on-site and final construction inspections. VSP does not charge a fee for plan reviews or consultations. Section 3. 0, Procedures for Making Requests for Plan Reviews and Construction-Related Inspections covers details pertaining to plan reviews, consultations, or construction inspections. The Recommended Shipbuilding Construction Guidelines for Cruise Vessels Destined to Call on U. S. Ports, has been renamed as the Vessel Sanitation Program Construction Manual (referred to in this documents as "these guidelines". The main purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework of consistent construction and design guidelines that protect passenger and crew health. CDC is committed to promoting high construction standards to protect the public's health. Compliance with these guidelines will help to ensure a healthy environment on cruise vessels. CDC reviewed many references {{from a variety of sources}} to develop this document. These references are indicated in Section 32. 2, Standards, Codes and Other References Reviewed for Guidance. These guidelines cover various components of the vessel's facilities related to public health, including food storage, preparation, and service; water bunkering, storage, disinfection, and distribution. Vessel owners and operators may select the design and equipment that best meets their needs. However, the design and equipment must also meet the sanitary design criteria of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or equivalent organization, and VSP'sroutine operational inspection requirements. These guidelines are not meant to limit the introduction of new designs, materials or technology for shipbuilding. A shipbuilder, owner, manufacturer, or other interested party may request VSP to periodically review or revise these guidelines in relation to new information or technology. VSP reviews such requests in accordance with the criteria described in Section 2. 0, "Revisions and Recommended Changes. " New cruise vessels must comply with all international code requirements (e. g., International Maritime Organization [IMO] Conventions). Those include requirements of the Safety of Life-at-Sea Convention (SOLAS), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), Tonnage and Load Line Convention, International Electrical Code (IEC), International Plumbing Code (IPC), and International Standards Organization (ISO). This document does not cross-reference related and sometimes overlapping standards that new cruise vessels must meet. These guidelines went into effect on June 1, 2005. They apply to vessels that lay keel or perform any major renovation (e. g., any changes to the structural elements of the vessel covered by these guidelines) after this date. The guidelines do not apply to minor renovations such as the installation or removal of single pieces of equipment, (refrigerator units, bains-marie units, etc.) or single pipe runs.

40|$|The {{formation}} of copper sulphide within oil filled high voltage electrical equipment {{can lead to}} the failure of the equipment. Incidents involving large transformers have been attributed to such contamination. <b>Sealed</b> <b>equipment,</b> working under high loads and containing mineral oil with high sulphur content, appear to be most at risk. The failure is caused by copper sulphide deposits which produce a low resistance path across and through the cellulose insulation and can lead to internal discharge and flash-over. However, the mechanism for how and why the copper sulphide forms on copper is largely an open question. A simple heating test, using strip copper, is available which indicates the likelihood of copper sulphide formation when using a mineral oil type. This paper outlines a series of experiments using variations to this heating test. The results suggest a mechanism for how copper sulphide forms on the copper itself...|$|R

40|$|The {{deposition}} of copper sulphide within oil filled high voltage equipment is the {{symptom of the}} use of sulphurous oil. In some cases, severe copper sulphide contamination has resulted in expensive equipment failure. It has been shown that <b>sealed</b> <b>equipment,</b> containing sulphurous oils and operating at elevated temperatures, are the more susceptible to the copper sulphide deposits. Recent work has suggested a mechanism for the deposits in the paper covering the copper conductors. Other work has suggested that the deposition {{may be the result of}} thermally driven gassing. However, the overall mechanism of copper sulphide formation and its deposition on the copper is still a topic of interest. The problem is complicated by the lack of a complete chemical characterisation of the various industrially available oils. A better understanding of the presence of the sulphur containing chemical species present in the oil and their thermal dependence will give a clearer insight into the mechanism of copper sulphide formation. This may ultimately lead to improved preventative methodologies which can be employed in the future. This paper will detail results from the use of various chemical analysis techniques applied to oil known to cause copper sulphide deposits. The results from X-ray fluorescence, UV/Vis spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy are used in conjunction to reveal how the sulphur and copper concentrations change with the depletion of corrosive action...|$|R
