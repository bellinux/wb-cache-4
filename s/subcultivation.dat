40|$|Verocytotoxins VT 1 and VT 2, {{produced}} by Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC), are encoded on temperate bacteriophages. Several studies reported {{the loss of}} the vtx genes after multiple <b>subcultivation</b> steps or long preservation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if {{the loss of the}} verocytotoxin genes can already occur during the first <b>subcultivation</b> step. Consequently, the stability of the vtx genes were tested in 40 isolates originating from 40 vtx-positive fecal samples after the first <b>subcultivation</b> step following the isolation procedure. The loss occurred in 12 out of 40 strains tested and was rather rare among the O 157 strains compared to the non-O 157 strains. This is the first study demonstrating that the loss of the verocytotoxin genes can already occur after the first <b>subcultivation</b> step. This may lead to an underestimation of VTEC positive samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{variability}} in the morphology, modal number of chromosomes, TCR expression and functional reactivity of a CII-specific T-cell hybridoma at continuous <b>subcultivation</b> have been investigated. As the number of passages increased, besides the oval semiadherent cells (normal phenotype), fibroblast-like cells (transformed phenotype) were also observed. The two cell subpopulations differed in their karyotype characteristic, {{as well as in}} their functional reactivity. The cell population with a normal phenotype was characterized by a tetramodal number of chromosomes (30, 40, 48 and 70) and trisomies of chromosomes 6 and 14, while the cell population with a transformed phenotype was characterized by a trimodal number of chromosomes (11, 68 and 74) and trisomy of chromosome 12. A nullisomy of sex chromosomes was established in both types of cells. In the initial passages of <b>subcultivation,</b> 73. 04 % of the cells with a normal morphological phenotype expressed TCR-CD 3 complexes on their surface and possessed high functional reactivity. After a two-week <b>subcultivation,</b> the values of these indices went down considerably: 46. 11 % of the cells expressed functional TCR-CD 3 complexes, as a result of which their functional reactivity decreased. Only 2. 71 % of the cells with a transformed morphological phenotype expressed functional TCR-CD 3 complexes on their surface. In these cells, a total loss of reactivity towards the specific antigens was established. The achieved results show that at continuous <b>subcultivation</b> the T-cell hybridomas are unstable, and with {{the increase in the number}} of passages there appear chromosome rearrangements, leading to loss of their functional reactivity...|$|E

We found serial <b>subcultivation</b> of the co-culture could enhance the yield of 2 -KGA by 16 % in comparison to that of the ancestral co-culture. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics and interaction mechanisms of the two microbes, we performed iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analyses of the pure cultures of K. vulgare, B. cereus and their co-culture during serial <b>subcultivation.</b> Hierarchy cluster analyses of the proteomic data showed that the expression level of a number of crucial proteins associated with sorbose conversion and oligopeptide transport was significantly enhanced by the experimental evolution. In particular, the expression level of sorbose/sorbosone dehydrogenase was enhanced in the evolved K. vulgare, while the expression level of InhA and the transport efficiency of oligopeptides were increased in the evolved B. cereus. The decreased sporulating protein expression and increased peptide transporter expression observed in evolved B. cereus, together with the increased amino acids synthesis in evolved K. vulgare suggested that serial <b>subcultivation</b> result in enhanced synergistic cooperation between K. vulgare and B. cereus, enabling an increased production of 2 -KGA...|$|E

More than 50 % regeneration efficiency {{was obtained by}} optimizing the osmotic stabilizer concentrations and modifying the plating procedure. Preparation and regeneration of protoplasts were studied by both phase-contrast and electron microscopy. After cell wall degradation with lysozyme, protoplasts about 1, 000 to 1, 500 nm in diameter appeared. The reversion process exhibited normal and aberrant regeneration of protoplasts to hyphae and to spherical cells, respectively. Spherical cells contained no α, ε-ll-diaminopimelic acid and were colorless or red after Gram staining. They showed consistent stability during at least five subsequent <b>subcultivations.</b> However, the omission of glycine from the precultivation medium reduced the unusual process of regeneration almost completely.

Ionic liquids (ILs) are effective solvent for lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment, however the adverse effect of IL to cellulase has been demonstrated. Here, a lignocellulose degrading microbial consortium was newly bred from saline soil in rice paddle field in Thailand by successive <b>subcultivations.</b> To study the IL-tolerant property, activities of partially purified cellulase produced from CT- 1 were evaluated {{in the present}} of an IL, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([C 2 mim][OAc]).

These structures are key mediators {{in the definition of}} host-microbial interactions and known to change their expression pattern in response to environmental pressure. Aims:  The present work is focused on the identification of new H. pylori cell-surface glycosides. Special attention is further devoted to provide insights on the impact of in vitro <b>subcultivation</b> on H. pylori cell-surface phenotypes. Methods:  Cell-surface glycans from H. pylori NCTC 11637 and two clinical isolates were recovered from the aqueous phase resulting from phenol:water extraction of intact bacteria. They were evaluated in relation to their sugars and glycosidic-linkages composition by CG-MS, size-exclusion chromatography, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. H. pylori glycan profile was also monitored during <b>subcultivation</b> in vitro in agar and F 12 liquid medium. Results:  All three studied strains produce LPS expressing Lewis epitopes and express bioaccumulate amylose-like glycans. Bioaccumulation of amylose was found to be enhanced with the <b>subcultivation</b> of the bacterium on agar medium and accompanied by a decrease in the expression of LPS O-chains. In contrast, during exponential growth in F 12 liquid medium, an opposite behavior is observed, that is, there is an increase in the overall amount of LPS and decrease in amylose content.

40|$|SUMMARY: Penicillin {{blocks the}} {{assimilation}} of glutamic acid by Staphylococcus aureus; the effective concentration of penicillin is of the same order as that required to inhibit growth’of the organism whether the culture is sensitive or resistant to penicillin. Serial <b>subcultivation</b> in increasing concentrations of penicillin results {{in the selection of}} resistant mutants; as resistance increases, the ability of the cells to assimilate glutamic acid decreases. The efficiency of the assimilation process in highly resistant cells is poor, but they can synthesize all their amino-acid requirements from ammonia and glucose. The decrease in assimilatory efficiency as resistance to penicillin increases is correlated with an increase in the ability of the cells to synthesize amino-acids. Reverse mutations, having decreased ability to synthesize certain amino-acids, were obtained from highly resistant strains and had increased sensitivity to penicillin. Strains of Staph. aureus requiring several amino-acids as nutrients have been ‘trained’, by <b>subcultivation</b> in media progressively more deficient in amino-acids, to dispense with the addition to the medium of all amino-acids other than cystine an...|$|E
40|$|The growth {{properties}} of fibroblasts from the thoracic skin {{of patients with}} mammary cancers were compared to those of fibroblastic cultures from patients with benign lesions or having undergone surgery for non-neoplastic diseases.

Moreover, the latter group responded in an abnormal way to three biological parameters: anchorage dependence, colony formation on monolayers of normal human epithelial cells and saturation densities in overcrowded culture conditions. Skin fibroblasts from one patient with a benign lesion, whose mother had developed a breast cancer, displayed all the abnormal growth properties. Periodic controls of this patient resulted in the early detection of a carcinoma 3 years after the first operation for a benign microcystic lesion. Finally, we found that multiple <b>subcultivations</b> in overcrowded culture conditions cause the selection of a fibroblastic cell subset with greater growth potential which, in the cell strain tested, could invade foreign tissue in vitro...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thiocarboxanilide UC- 781 is {{a highly}} potent and {{selective}} non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV- 1, which also has virucidal properties. Recent {{studies have shown that}} UC- 781 would seem an ideal candidate for application as a vaginal virucide. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antiviral potency and stability of UC- 781 in a lipophilic gel formulation. METHODS: UC- 781 was formulated in replens gel at different concentrations and administered intravaginally to rabbits at 5 % in replens gel for 10 days. UC- 781 was also exposed to temperatures of 4, 37 and 50 degrees C, and to low pH (6. 0, 4. 3, 2. 0 and 1. 2). A number of microorganisms were exposed in culture to serial dilutions of UC- 781. RESULTS: The drug was stable under low pH conditions and did not lose its antiviral potency upon 4 h exposure to pH 3. 5 (the estimated vaginal pH). UC- 781 can be easily formulated into a lipophilic gel (replens; up to 5 %) and proved fully stable at 50 degrees C for 30 days. There was no effect on the growth of microorganisms (i. e., Candida and Lactobacillus strains) that are present in the vaginal flora. Neither systemic side-effects, nor local inflammation or damage of the vaginal mucosa or epithelium were observed in rabbits to which 5 % UC- 781 in replens gel had been administered. UC- 781, formulated as 0. 5, 0. 2 and 0. 05 % replens gel, and UC- 38, alpha-APA and zidovudine, formulated as 0. 5 or 0. 2 % replens gel, were effective in protecting CEM cells in the very beginning against productive HIV- 1 replication. This points to an efficient diffusion of the drugs from the lipophilic gel to the hydrophilic culture medium. However, subsequent <b>subcultivations</b> at a dilution rate of 1 : 10 every 3 - 4 days resulted in a rapid breakthrough of virus with all drugs except UC- 781 in its 0. 5 and 0. 2 % gel formulation. These cultures were fully protected against HIV- 1 and remained completely cleared from virus for at least 10 <b>subcultivations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The virus that emerged under 0. 05 % UC- 781 remained highly sensitive to the NNRTI, including UC- 781, in cell culture, suggesting a lack of resistance development under our experimental conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Populations of {{embryonic}} mouse fibroblasts undergo 10 ± 2 doublings in vitro prior to cessation of growth. We have studied various {{properties of the}} DNA of such cells as they undergo this process of in vitro ageing. Following a 1 -h pulse with [3 H]thymidine the labelling of growing cell populations decreases progressively with serial <b>subcultivation.</b> At early passage levels, the decrease in labelling between passages is rapid, but after about five passages the decline is much slower. Following a long pulse with [3 H]thymidine (up to 4 days), up to 50 % of the cells in the final passage become labelled. The binding of [3 H]actinomycin to nuclei decreases progressively during serial <b>subcultivation.</b> Under conditions of quiescence, induced by serum deprivation, the cells withdraw from the S-phase.

40|$|The {{chemically}} modified tripeptide glycyl-prolyl-glycine-amide (GPG-NH 2) inhibits replication of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) type 1 (HIV- 1) in vitro, probably by interfering with capsid formation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the metabolites glycyl-proline (GP-OH), glycine (G-OH), prolyl-glycine-amide (PG-NH 2), proline (P-OH), and glycine-amide (G-NH 2) from proteolytic cleavage may inhibit the replication of HIV- 1 in vitro. PG-NH 2 has previously been shown to have a modest effect on HIV- 1 replication. In the present study we show that G-NH 2 exhibits a pronounced inhibitory effect on HIV- 1. This effect was not due to a decrease in cell proliferation or viability and could not be shown for herpes simplex virus type 1. The G-NH 2 concentration that inhibited virus replication by 50 % (IC 50) was equimolar to that of GPG-NH 2 and ranged from 3 to 41 μM. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the effect of G-NH 2 on HIV- 1 morphology was equivalent to that of GPG-NH 2 and showed disarranged capsid structures, indicating interference with capsid formation. Serial passage of HIV-infected cells with G-NH 2 for more than 20 <b>subcultivations</b> did not decrease the susceptibility to the compound.

40|$|To perform coagulase gene typing, the {{repeated}} units encoding hypervariable {{regions of the}} Staphylococcus aureus coagulase gene were amplified by the PCR technique; {{this was followed by}} AluI restriction enzyme digestion and analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. In order to assess the discriminatory power of this typing method, 30 epidemiologically unrelated S. aureus strains which differed by their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were examined. Although 18 of the 30 strains had unique and unshared AluI RFLP patterns, there were only four observed patterns in the remaining 12 strains. This finding indicated that unrelated strains may share identical AluI RFLP patterns. To elucidate the degree of genetic variation in the C-terminus-encoding loci within the coagulase genes, the PCR products of these 12 strains were subjected to Taq polymerase-mediated sequencing. Sequence analysis confirmed the AIuI recognition sites {{in each of the four}} RFLP groups and demonstrated that AluI appears to yield the highest RFLP in restriction enzyme analysis. By their DNA sequences the majority of strains sharing common AluI groups could be clearly differentiated from each other and revealed between 93. 2 and 98. 5 % homology. When we determined the nucleotide sequences of two strains after six <b>subcultivations</b> no significant alterations were observed.

40|$|A {{permanent}} line of mouse embryo fibroblasts {{was treated}} with concentrations of the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) that left 20 – 50 % surviving colonies. The surviving population initially multiplied at a much slower rate than controls after subculture {{in the absence of}} the drug, and required 9 – 12 days of serial subculture, with selective growth of the faster growing cells, to approximate the control rate. To determine the distribution of growth rates of cells in the original posttreatment populations, many single cells were isolated in multiwell plates immediately after the treatment period, and the resulting clones were serially subcultured. Most of the control clones underwent about 2 population doublings per day (PD/D). Almost all the survivors of MTX treatment multiplied at heterogeneously reduced rates, ranging from 0. 6 PD/D to as high as control rates for a very few clones. They maintained the reduced rates through many <b>subcultivations.</b> The heritability of the reduced growth rates indicates that most cells that retain proliferative capacity after treatment with MTX carry random genetic damage that is perpetuated through many divisions of their progeny. Similar results have been described for cells that survive x-irradiation, and suggest random genetic damage is a common occurrence among cells in rapidly growing tissues that survive cytotoxic treatment. It also occurs in serial subcultures of cells that had been held under the constraint of confluence for extended periods, which suggests that the accumulation of random genetic damage to somatic cells during aging of mammals underlies the reduction of growth rate and function of the cells that characterizes the aging process...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{effect of}} in vitro {{expansion}} of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) on stem cell properties is controversial. We examined serial <b>subcultivation</b> with expansion {{on the ability}} of ASCs to grow and differentiate into osteoblastic lineages. Design Flow cytometric analysis, growth kinetics, cell population doubling time, light microscopy and confocal analysis, and osteogenesis induction were performed to assess growth and osteogenic potential of subcultivated ASCs at passages 2 (P 2), P 4 and P 6. Results Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ASCs at P 2 express classical mesenchymal stem cell markers including CD 44, CD 73, and CD 105, but not CD 14, CD 19, CD 34, CD 45, or HLA-DR. Calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity were the highest at P 2 but completely abrogated at P 4. Increased passage number impaired cell growth; P 2 cultures exhibited exponential growth, while cells at P 4 and P 6 showed near linear growth with cell population doubling times increased from 3. 2 at P 2 to 4. 8 d at P 6. Morphologically, cells in various <b>subcultivation</b> stages showed flattened shape at low density but spindle-like structures at confluency as judged by phalloidin staining. Conclusions Osteogenic potential of ASCs is impaired by successive passaging and may not serve as a useful clinical source of osteogenic ASCs past P 2. PublishedN/...|$|E

40|$|Pyruvate {{carboxylase}} (PYC), a biotin-dependent enzyme which catalyzes {{the conversion}} of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, was hypothesized {{to play an important}} anaplerotic role in the growth of Rhizobium etli during serial <b>subcultivation</b> in minimal media containing succinate (S. Encarnación, M. Dunn, K. Willms, and J. Mora, J. Bacteriol. 177 : 3058 - 3066, 1995). R. etli and R. tropici pyc::Tn 5 -mob mutants were selected for their inability to grow in minimal medium with pyruvate as a sole carbon source. During serial <b>subcultivation</b> in minimal medium containing 30 mM succinate, the R. etli parent and pyc mutant strains exhibited similar decreases in growth rate with each subculture. Supplementation of the medium with biotin prevented the growth decrease of the parent but not the mutant strain, indicating that PYC was necessary for the growth of R. etli under these conditions. The R. tropici pyc mutant grew normally in subcultures regardless of biotin supplementation. The symbiotic phenotypes of the pyc mutants from both species were {{similar to those of the}} parent strains. The R. etli pyc was cloned, sequenced, and found to encode a 126 -kDa protein of 1, 154 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to other PYC sequences, and the catalytic domains involved in carboxylation, pyruvate binding, and biotinylation are conserved. The sequence and biochemical data show that the R. etli PYC is a member of the alpha 4, homotetrameric, acetyl coenzyme A-activated class of PYCs...|$|E
40|$|Normal human diploid {{fibroblasts}} have {{a finite}} replicative lifespan in vitro, {{which has been}} postulated to be a cellular manifestation of aging in vivo. Several studies have shown an inverse relationship between donor age and fibroblast culture replicative lifespan; however, in all cases, the correlation was weak, and, with few exceptions, the health status of the donors was unknown. We have determined the replicative lifespans of 124 skin fibroblast cell lines established from donors of different ages {{as part of the}} Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. All of the donors were medically examined and were declared “healthy,” according to Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging protocols, at the time the biopsies were taken. Both long- and short-lived cell lines were observed in all age groups, but no significant correlation between the proliferative potential of the cell lines and donor age was found. A comparison of multiple cell lines established from the same donors at different ages also failed to reveal any significant trends between proliferative potential and donor age. The rate of [3 H]thymidine incorporation and the initial rates of growth during the first few <b>subcultivations</b> were examined in a subset of cell lines and were found to be significantly greater in fetal lines than in postnatal lines. Cell lines established from adults did not vary significantly either in initial growth rate or in [3 H]thymidine incorporation. These results clearly indicate that, if health status and biopsy conditions are controlled, the replicative lifespan of fibroblasts in culture does not correlate with donor age...|$|R
40|$|The mannose-specific plant lectins {{from the}} Amaryllidaceae family (e. g., Hippeastrum sp. hybrid and Galanthus nivalis) inhibit human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection of human lymphocytic cells in the higher nanogram per milliliter range and suppress syncytium formation between persistently HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected cells and uninfected CD 4 (+) T cells. These lectins inhibit virus entry. When exposed to escalating concentrations of G. nivalis and Hippeastrum sp. hybrid agglutinin, a variety of HIV- 1 (III(B)) strains were isolated after 20 to 40 <b>subcultivations</b> which showed a decreased sensitivity to the plant lectins. Several amino acid changes in the envelope glycoprotein gp 120, but not in gp 41, of the mutant virus isolates were observed. The {{vast majority of the}} amino acid changes occurred at the N glycosylation sites and at the S or T residues {{that are part of the}} N glycosylation motif. The degree of resistance to the plant lectins was invariably correlated with an increasing number of mutated glycosylation sites in gp 120. The nature of these mutations was entirely different from that of mutations that are known to appear in HIV- 1 gp 120 under the pressure of other viral entry inhibitors such as dextran sulfate, bicyclams (i. e., AMD 3100), and chicoric acid, which also explains the lack of cross-resistance of plant lectin-resistant viruses to any other HIV inhibitor including T- 20 and the blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) -derived mannose-specific cyanovirin. The plant lectins represent a well-defined class of anti-HIV (microbicidal) drugs with a novel HIV drug resistance profile different from those of other existing anti-HIV drugs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{thyroid gland}} is mainly {{composed}} of epithelial cells (thyrocytes) organized as follicles. The cells are connected by junction complexes that link them {{together into a}} cohesive simple epithelium. The junctions are also important {{for the establishment of}} a semipermeable barrier that restricts the paracellular flow of ions and other solutes. In the first part of this thesis, the effects of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines on the epithelial barrier of primary cultured human thyrocytes were investigated. Thyroid follicle segments were prepared from surgically excised paradenomatous tissue and from resected glands with Graves´ disease. The cells formed tight, but low resistant monolayers on permeable filters in bicameral chambers. Addition of TSH further increased the transepithelial resistance to approximately 1000 * x cm 2 after 3 - 5 days. TSH also induced an ordered organization of the tight junction protein ZO- 1, promoted a polarized (apical-basolateral) ultrastructure and stimulated the secretion of thyroglobulin (Tg), preferentially in the apical direction. Treatment with IL- 1 a for 1 - 2 days induced a decreased transepithelial resistance and an increased paracellular leakage of both small ([3 H]inulin) and large (125 I-Tg) radiotracers irrespective of TSH and without signs of cytotoxicity. Electron microscopy showed that the main target of IL- 1 a action was the adherens junction where large amounts of stress fibers were formed. In contrast, other pro-inflammatory cytokines, i. e. IL- 6, TNF-a, IFN-g and TGF-b, had no effect on the thyroid epithelial barrier. Changes in cell-cell adhesion have previously been correlated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In the second part of the thesis, cadherin-mediated adhesion and morphology in thyroid carcinoma cell lines and in cultured non-neoplastic pig and human thyrocytes were examined. E-cadherin negative cell lines established from anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) showed a variable down-regulation of catenins, known to anchor cadherins to the cytoskeleton. The reduced expression was most notable for g-catenin and p 120 ctn. Furthermore, the electrophoretic mobility of p 120 ctn was altered. A demethylating agent, 5 -aza- 2 ´-deoxycytidine, increased protein expression of E-cadherin and g-catenin although some cell lines were unresponsive. N-cadherin was detected in E-cadherin negative ATC cell lines but not in freshly isolated and primary cultured human and pig follicle segments. However, N-cadherin expression was also induced by 1 - 2 <b>subcultivations</b> of non-neoplastic thyrocytes. In this process, the upregulation of N-cadherin was paralleled by downregulation of E-cadherin and morphological alterations such as multilayering and loss of barrier function. Unexpectedly, one ATC cell line, KAT- 4, expressed normal levels of E-cadherin and catenins and had a maintained epithelial morphology despite loss of barrier function and lack of contact-inhibited growth. KAT- 4 cells also had a unique aberration of E-cadherin. In conclusion, human thyrocytes form a highly differentiated epithelium when grown on filter in the presence of TSH. The epithelial barrier is abrogated by IL- 1 a. Cultured anaplastic thyroid carcioma cells display N-cadherin-mediated adhesion and reduced catenin expression. A switch from E- to N-cadherin occurs in subcultured non-neoplastic thyrocytes. The results may have importance for the understanding of thyroid autoimmunity and tumor progressio...|$|R
