40|$|Debt {{financing}} with subsidizes {{interest rate}} has a multidimensional {{impact on the}} firm. Value of the levered equity, value of the debt and overall firm value will be different of those values with debt financing at market rate. <b>Subsidized</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on debt does not create any additional cash flow and all the changes in values {{and the cost of}} capital are the result of the redistribution of cash flows among debt, equity and government, and subsequent reduction in financial risk due to lower leverage. In this note we show that the levered firm value with the loan provided at a rate below market rate is lower (or equal, in a no tax world) compared to the same firm value with the loan at market rate. For the given nominal value of debt the cost of capital of the levered firm with the <b>subsidized</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than the cost of capital of the same firm with `the market cost of debt, and “intuitive” adjustment of the WACC by direct substitution of the contractual interest rate into the classic WACC formulation produces inconsistent cost of capital estimate and flawed valuation. Debt financing with <b>subsidized</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> converts into the gain for the levered equity. This value gain originates from the value transfer from debt to equity and to ensure correct and consistent cost of capital and value estimates we need properly incorporate the effect of the subsidy in the interest rate on the cost of the levered equity. Required return to the levered equity with subsidized debt financing does not depend on the contractual interest rate. “Extended APV valuation” performed by adding value of the loan subsidy to the sum of the unlevered firm value and the value of the tax shield is based on inconsistent value relationship and leads to false results.

A stochastic approach is also developed that incorporates risk into the model. Data from 1980 to 2012 are used to estimate the system of equations. Annual equilibrium prices are solved by minimizing the squared difference between supply and demand for four different markets: cheese, butter, milk powder, and fresh dairy products.

A survey was conducted to 89 farmers in the lowland area of Probolinggo District and 97 farmers in the upland areas of Malang Districts {{during the period of}} February-March 2013. Results of stochastic frontier production function with MLE method showed that the average technical efficiency in lowland area was higher (80 %) compared to that in upland area (64 %).

However, location of the business, whether in lowland and upland areas was a significant factor that could increase the efficiency. Some factors that could significantly reduce the technical inefficiency of beef cattle business were: labor force in family, education level, proportion of beef cattle income to total household income, age of cattle sold, cattle health examination, ownership status of the cattle, and gender.

40|$|Although most of {{the rice}} area in Indonesia is still {{prepared}} manually, since the early 1980 s the government has promoted tractors for land preparation through subsidized loans. This has increased capital investment in agriculture; and for the farmers, the cost of owning and operating tractor has become {{an important part of}} farm costs. By the late 1980 s, a rapid {{increase in the number of}} tractors intensified competition, reducing capacity utilization below an economically viable level. Thus, many tractor owners defaulted on their loans. This study investigates the financial profitability of tractor ownership in South Sulawesi, using a computer spreadsheet. The analysis uses input and output data (technical coefficient) collected by the Consequences of Mechanization Project in South Sulawesi in 1980 - 81, but introduces 1990 costs and prices to assess profitability under current conditions. The results showed that in 1980, tractors were unprofitable, as indicated by a B-C ratio of 0. 87. In 1990, with the 1990 prices applied to the 1975 - 79 tractor capacity utilization, owners obtained positive net return (as indicated by a B-C ratio of 1. 13, an IRR of 27 % and a NPV of Rp 1, 896, 000) when the official contract rates was maintained. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in critical variables, such as tractor price, contract rates, and interest level result in large changes in B-C ratio, NPV, and IRR. Increasing the initial tractor purchase price by 10 %, decreased the B-C ratio to 1. 07 (- 5 %), NPV to Rp 1, 246, 000 (34 %) and IRR to 23 % (- 15 %). Similarly, reducing the contract rate by 20 percent, reduce the B-C ratio to 0. 9 (- 20 %), NPV to Rp - 879, 000 (146 %) and IRR to 6. 8 % (- 75 %). In addition, increasing the interest rate from 15 % to 30 %, reduce the B-C ratio to 0. 9 (- 15 %) and NPV to Rp 461, 000 (- 76 %). These results indicate the sensitivity of tractor profitability to parameters controlled by government (<b>subsidized</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate).</b> Thus, while tractor ownership is certainly profitable, the profitability of future purchasers will depend on government policies at the time of purchase, government willingness to maintain a high contract rate, and farmers willingness to pay this rate.

40|$|The {{most common}} form of {{government}} intervention in the rural sector has been massive lending at <b>subsidized</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Credit programs generally aim to reach small farmers. However, despite the expansion of credit over the last three decades, few farmers in low income countries seem to have received or benefited from such credit. It has thus been common for small-scale farmers to resort to the formation of organized credit groups or cooperatives. This paper is a normative analysis of cooperatives viewed as institutions to improve the plight of small-scale farmers. The purpose is to analyze which structures are most successful, then to promote credit cooperatives and to design an optimal incentive scheme in place of subsidized credit policies of the past. The paper concludes by stating that a policy of providing assistance to existing and potential credit groups on how to set incentives, implement monitoring schemes and develop centralized resources is more desirable and more cost effective than the old fashioned and largely regressive subsidized credit policies.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of government-sponsored enterprise status for the Farm Credit System on allocative efficiency in agricultural credit markets. The Farm Credit Sys-tem was established originally to overcome market failures in these markets and to provide long-term funding at rates lower than private credit sources. Using a supply and demand model and an options model, the impact of <b>subsidized</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is discussed. My {{results show that the}} default risk premium in <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is transferred from agricultural borrowers to taxpayers. There is evidence of deadweight losses and market distortions due to government-sponsored enterprise status for the Farm Credit System. Government involvement in agricultural credit markets began with the estab-lishment of the Farm Credit System (FCS) as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) by the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. Under this act, the FCS was estab-lished as a system of farmer-owned cooperatives with the purpose of providing long-term mortgage loans to agriculture. The act was intended to overcome per-ceived market failures in agricultural credit markets by creating a stable source of long-term funding with lower <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and terms more compatible with the unique qualities of agricultural production. Even today, there is concern that market failures could still cause private lenders to reassess their commitment to agriculture during periodic downturns (Freshwater). The FCS was the first GSE established in the United States. Since its creation, other GSEs, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), have been established to facilitate credit availability throughout other sectors of the economy.
