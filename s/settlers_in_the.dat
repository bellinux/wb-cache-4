5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of {{non-indigenous}} <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 19thcentury, the area was inhabited by several Native American tribes. The county was officially established in 1827 and was the 55th county to be formed in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The road, {{like with}} nearby Hanlon Creek, {{is named after}} Felix Hanlon, {{one of the men}} who cut the first tree in Guelph along with John Galt. He was one of the {{original}} <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and his family eventually deeded their land to the city.|$|E
5|$|After {{the arrival}} of Euro-American <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19thcentury, Burns was {{established}} in the 1880s. It was formally incorporated after Harney County's creation in 1889 through the splitting of Grant County into two counties. Early settler, merchant, and county commissioner George McGowan named the city after the Scottish poet Robert Burns. By 1891, the community had stores, a post office, hotels, and other businesses. McGowan was the town's first postmaster.|$|E

5|$|Francis Nash (1742October 7, 1777) was a {{brigadier general}} in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Prior to the war, he was a lawyer, public official, and {{politician}} in Hillsborough, North Carolina, and was heavily involved in opposing the Regulator movement, an uprising of <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Carolina piedmont between 1765 and 1771. Nash was also involved in North Carolina politics, representing Hillsborough on several occasions in the colonial North Carolina General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.|$|E
5|$|Other {{official}} state dogs also are indigenous to their state, including the Boston Terrier (Massachusetts) and the Alaskan Malamute (Alaska). Pennsylvania selected the Great Dane {{not because of}} its origin, {{but because it was}} introduced by early <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state {{to be used as a}} hunting and working dog; it was chosen over the Beagle, which was also proposed around the same time.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota's early economy {{relied heavily}} on the soil, {{minerals}} and ecology of the area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area were farmers, miners, or trappers. Although other economic sectors have risen in prominence in recent years, early dependence on the land laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity of}} Apple River Fort, probably miners, likely arrived {{more than a}} decade before the fort's construction. The miners settled the site and built log cabins around and near the Kellogg's Trail, a route from Galena to Dixon's Ferry; they obtained fresh water from a nearby spring.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly {{before it became}} an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed {{to move out of}} their reserve areas. This was followed by the establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E
50|$|George Morphett (21 May 1811 - 1893) was a <b>settler</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{colony of}} South Australia, {{and a brother}} of John Morphett.|$|R

5|$|As the {{population}} of German <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region began to increase, the desire for Lutheran religious services and education also grew. Ministers, including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit, began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia. Muhlenberg was a German pastor, requested by colonists in Pennsylvania, {{who served as a}} missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787; he is considered the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in the United States. Johannes Schwarback and Muhlenberg's son, Peter, reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 (before Hebron Church's founding). Streit, charged with ministering to a Lutheran congregation in Winchester, settled there on July 19, 1785.|$|E
5|$|During the AprilAugust 1832 Black Hawk War, {{between white}} <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead mining regions and Sauk Chief Black Hawk's British Band, Hamilton again {{served in the}} {{volunteer}} militia. Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often {{in charge of the}} militia's indigenous allies. At the war's onset it was known that many of the Sioux and Menominee were eager to join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory, north of Prairie du Chien, to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war.|$|E
5|$|English has {{developed}} {{over the course of}} more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England, and was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible, and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.|$|E
50|$|Hartsgrove Township was {{organized}} in 1830. It {{was named for}} Richard W. Hart, an early <b>settler</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and native of Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|Hagensborg is {{also home}} to the Norwegian Heritage House, a {{preserved}} house built prior to 1900 by Andrew Svisdahl, an early Norwegian <b>settler</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The House has been outfitted as an interpretive centre.|$|R

5|$|Estimates of Mexican {{casualties}} {{range from}} one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, {{on the condition that}} they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Great Capon Church, Hebron Lutheran Church, and Hebron Evangelical Lutheran Church) is a mid-19th-century Lutheran church in Intermont, Hampshire County, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Hebron Church {{was founded in}} 1786 by German <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cacapon River Valley, making it the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley. The congregation worshiped in a log church, which initially served both Lutheran and Reformed denominations. Its congregation was originally German-speaking; the church's documents and religious services were in German until 1821, when records and sermons transitioned to English.|$|E
50|$|In 1861, David Millspaw became <b>the</b> first {{permanent}} <b>settler</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of {{what was}} to become Aurora. Hamilton County was formed in 1870.|$|R

5|$|Historically, Waterfall Gully {{was first}} {{explored}} by European <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early-to-mid-19th century, and {{quickly became a}} popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall Gully until 1884, when they agreed to place the land {{under the auspices of}} the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under State Government control, and in 1972 the Waterfall Gully Reserve, as it was then known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana {{near the end of}} the last ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} value to the early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working and camping location is known as the Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last decade of the 18thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against white <b>settlers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region over the destruction of camas root — {{a major source of}} food for the natives — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had won the war, the natives were allotted into various reservations. The Northern Paiute were sent to the Yakama Indian Reservation, and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States.|$|E
50|$|Dollymount Township was {{organized}} in 1881, and named after Dollymount, Ireland, although the name also alludes to Anthony Doll, an early <b>settler</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
