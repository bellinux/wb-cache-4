50|$|Willy Lange from Berlin {{discovered}} <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> in 1929. He fruitlessly {{tried to}} make monofluorophosphoric acid. However, he did discover the highly toxic organic esters. Following this discovery various nerve gases like sarin were developed.|$|E

50|$|Fluorapatite can be {{synthesized}} in a three step process. First, {{calcium phosphate}} {{is generated by}} combining calcium and phosphate salts at neutral pH.This material then reacts further with fluoride sources (often <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> or calcium fluoride (CaF2)) to give the mineral. This reaction is integral in the global phosphorus cycle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1929 by the German chemist Willy Lange, {{who was then}} with the University of Berlin. His fruitless attempts to prepare the free monofluorophosphoric acid led him to check the stability of its esters. Together with Gerda von Krüger, one of his students, Lange thus synthesized diethyl fluorophosphate and some analogs, which proved to be quite toxic, being related to nerve agents. In the 1930s, Gerhard Schrader, working for the German company IG Farben, tried to develop synthetic insecticide. His work focused on esters of phosphoric acid and resulted in an accidental discovery of some other nerve agents such as DFP (diisopropyl fluorophosphate), Tabun, Soman, and Sarin. In the meantime, Lange, who {{was married to a}} Jewish woman, emigrated from Germany to the United States and started work for Procter and Gamble Company. In 1947, he and Ralph Livingston of Monsanto Company published the preparation of the free fluorophosphoric acids and mentioned the use of some toxic esters of monofluorophosphoric acid (like DFP) in the treatment of glaucoma and myasthenia gravis. The well known toxicity of these esters led to fears that the simple salts might also be toxic, and such fears precluded any large scale commercial use of the salts. In 1950, under sponsorship of the manufacturer of the compounds, Ozark Chemical Company, the toxicity of <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> was studied by Harold Hodge at the University of Rochester who included anti-cavity testing. In 1967 Colgate-Palmolive filed several patents on the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> in toothpaste.|$|E
50|$|Monofluoro{{phosphate}} is an anion {{with the}} formula PO3F2−, {{which is a}} phosphate group with one oxygen atom substituted with a fluoride atom. The charge of the ion is −2. The ion resembles sulfate in size, shape and charge, and can thus form compounds with the same structure as sulfates. These include Tutton's salts and langbeinites. The most well-known compound of monofluorophosphate is <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate,</b> commonly used in toothpaste.|$|E
50|$|Most toothpastes {{contains}} between 0.22% (1,000 ppm) and 0.312% (1,450 ppm) fluoride, {{usually in}} the form of sodium fluoride or <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (MFP). Frequent use of toothpaste with 1,100 ppm fluoride content enhances the remineralization of enamel and inhibits the demineralization of enamel and root surfaces. Most toothpastes with fluoride contain mild abrasives in order to remove heavier debris and light surface staining. These abrasives include calcium carbonate, silica gels, magnesium carbonates and phosphate salts.|$|E
5000|$|Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more {{resistant}} to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite; in the mid-20th century, {{it was discovered that}} communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. [...] Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite.

40|$|Introduction: Dentifrices are {{commonly}} used for oral hygiene with some formulated with antimicrobial agents to control plaque. There is little information regarding the effects of dentifrices on controlling dental plaque and gingivitis amongst Indian subjects. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of three commercially-available fluoride dentifrices on established gingivitis and supragingival dental plaque after 6 -week of product use. Materials and Methods: Adult subjects completing informed consent and presenting a Loe-Silness gingival index (GI) score ≥ 1. 0 and a Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification, plaque index (PI) score ≥ 1. 5 completed a 2 -week washout period with commercial fluoride toothpaste. They were instructed to refrain from all other oral hygiene products (including mints, chewing gums, mouth rinses). Subjects returned to the clinical facility again having refrained from all oral hygiene procedures for 12 h and from eating, drinking or smoking for 4 h for baseline gingivitis and plaque examinations. They {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups according to baseline gingival and plaque indices scores: (1) A dentifrice containing 0. 3 % triclosan and 1000 ppm <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Colgate ® Supershakti Dental Cream), (2) a dentifrice containing 0. 54 % zinc citrate, 0. 64 % stannous chloride and 0. 33 % sodium fluoride (Crest ® Pro-Health All Good 7 Effects Toothpaste), and (3) a dentifrice containing 1000 ppm <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Colgate ® CIBACA Toothpaste [negative control]). After 6 -week use of their assigned dentifrice, all subjects were recalled for posttreatment plaque and GI examinations. Results: 105 subjects completed the study. Baseline plaque and GI scores demonstrated no statistical differences between treatment groups (P > 0. 05). Further, Chi-square analysis demonstrated no significant differences between treatment groups for subject age or gender (P > 0. 05). At the 6 -week examinations, subjects in all three dentifrice groups exhibited statistically significant reductions in GI scores (32. 5 %, 16. 6 % and 19. 9 %, respectively) and PI (38. 1 %, 16. 4 % and 20. 4 %, respectively) scores from baseline (P < 0. 05). The triclosan group exhibited statistically significant (P < 0. 05) reductions in GI scores (17. 5 % and 12. 5 %, respectively) and PI scores (21. 7 % and 19. 1 %, respectively) when compared to the zinc citrate/stannous chloride dentifrice and to the <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> dentifrice. Conclusion: The triclosan/sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice (Colgate Supershakti Dental Cream) demonstrated significantly less gingivitis and greater reductions of supragingival dental plaque (P < 0. 05) when compared to a dentifrice containing zinc citrate/stannous chloride/sodium fluoride (Crest Pro-Health All Good 7 Effects Toothpaste) and to a dentifrice containing <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Colgate CIBACA Toothpaste) ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This paper {{presents}} the results of one of two eight-week dentin hypersensitivity clinical studies in which the efficacy of a novel toothpaste containing 8. 0 % arginine, calcium carbonate, and 1450 ppm fluoride as <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (MFP) was compared to that of a benchmark commercial toothpaste containing 2 % potassium ion, dosed as 3. 75 % potassium chloride, and 1450 ppm fluoride as sodium fluoride (NaF). Methods: An eight-week clinical study, with eighty patients, was conducted in Rome, Italy using a double-blind, stratified, twotreatment design. Tactile sensitivity assessments, as well as air blast sensitivity assessments, were used to compare the efficacy of the two products. Results: This clinical study showed that the new toothpaste containing 8. 0 % arginine and 1450 ppm fluoride as MFP in a calcium carbonate base provided a significant reduction in dentin hypersensitivity when used over a period of eight weeks. The study also showed that this new arginine toothpaste provided significantly greater reductions (p< 0. 05) in dentin hypersensitivity in response to tactile (37. 0 %, 30. 0 %, and 12. 2 %) and air blast (23. 9 %, 32. 0 %, and 29. 3 %) stimuli than the commercial sensitive toothpaste containing 2 % potassium ion and 1450 ppm fluoride as NaF in a silica base, after two weeks, four weeks, and eight weeks of product use, respectively. Conclusion: A new toothpaste containing 8. 0 % arginine, calcium carbonate, and 1450 ppm fluoride as <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (MFP) provides significantly increased dentin hypersensitivity relief (p< 0. 05) compared to a commercial sensitive toothpaste containing 2 % potassium ion after two weeks, four weeks, and eight weeks of product use...|$|E
40|$|Tooth {{hypersensitivity}} due to exposed {{dentinal tubules}} {{is a common}} finding in the adult population, {{with as many as}} 1 in 7 (8 - 57 %) patients attending for dental treatment [1, 2]. The subjects’ evaluation of their own overall sensitivity, i. e. subject assessment, has been used frequently to measure hypersensitivity in clinical studies [3]. This assessment is done through various types of stimuli, which can be applied on the teeth to evoke a response from the patient. Patient’s own perception of overall hypersensitivity, as experienced by them, following application of various stimuli, can be reported using either a verbal rating scale (VRS) [4], or a visual analogue scale (VAS) [5]. A number of treatment options are currently available for the treatment of hypersensitivity. Agents may bring about their therapeutic effects, either by partial or complete obturation of dentinal tubules (tubule occluding agents), by anti-inflammatory activity, protein precipitation, or sealing the tubules. Research into the use of the mineral components of the inorganic portion of the tooth structure, i. e. calcium and phosphate has evoked considerable interest [6 - 11], and has inspired the preparation of hydroxyapatite (HAP), for occlusion of dentinal tubules [12]. Numerous studies have also reported the application of hydroxyapatite in various formulations, as dentifrices and gels in the treatment of tooth hypersensitivity [13 - 17].

This study evaluated the anti-caries and anti-plaque {{efficacy of}} a dentifrice containing <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (1000 ppm) and calcium glycerophosphate, and compared it with a non-fluoridated dentifrice. Materials and Methods: A total of 595 school children (12 - 15 years) were divided into test (302 children) and control (293 children) groups. The test group used the dentifrice containing <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (1000 ppm) and calcium glycerophosphate, whereas the control group was given a placebo dentifrice. Oral examination for dental caries and plaque assessment was carried out {{at the start of the}} study and the children were followed up semiannually up to 18 months. Data were analyzed using repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by one-way ANOVA. Results: The values for decayed missing filled teeth (DMFT) increased from baseline to 18 month examination from 4. 43 ± 2. 03 and 4. 67 ± 2. 25 (P= 0. 175) to 5. 84 ± 2. 29 and 5. 13 ± 2. 30 (P= 0. 001) for control and test groups, respectively. Similarly, the increase in decayed missing filled surface (DMFS) values were from 6. 42 ± 4. 10 and 7. 06 ± 4. 77 (P= 0. 082) to 8. 64 ± 4. 51 and 7. 92 ± 5. 07 (P= 0. 095) for test and control groups, respectively.
