Surface finish is also especially important in dynamic applications.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas <b>sealing</b> <b>faces</b> concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two <b>sealing</b> <b>faces.</b> The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

Prior to the face control grooves, the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> were not balanced and would begin to move under high pressure conditions.

40|$|A {{reduction}} of vibrations in mechanical seals increases {{the life of}} the seals in centrifugal pumps by minimizing fatigue damage. Mechanical seals consist of two smooth <b>seal</b> <b>faces.</b> one face is stationary with respect to the pump. The other rotates. Between the faces a fluid film evaporates as the fluid moves radially outward across the <b>seal</b> <b>face.</b> ideally, the film evaporates as it reaches the outer surface of the <b>seal</b> <b>faces,</b> thereby preventing leakage from the pump and effectively lubricating the two surfaces. Relative vibrations between the two surfaces affect the fluid film and lead to stresses on the <b>seal</b> <b>faces,</b> which lead to fatigue damage. As the fluid film breaks down impacts between the two <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> create tensile stresses on the faces, which cycle at the speed of the motor rotation. These cyclic stresses provide the mechanism leading to fatigue crack growth. The magnitude of the stress {{is directly related to the}} rate of crack growth and time to failure of a seal.

40|$|Lecturepg. 59 In this paper, an {{innovative}} approach of applying gas-lubricated, noncontacting sealing technology to process pumps is presented, {{in which a}} novel ?twin hybrid? design is incorporated to address the issues of gas seal applications to process pumps. In this design, orifice-injected inert barrier gas between concentric twin seal faces gives rise to hydrostatic action, so that the inner seal face with hydrodynamic lift features upon running can initiate and maintain stable face separation, even at extremely slow speed. The outer plain face seal, by way of higher barrier gas pressure, prevents any process fluid on the outer diameter cavity from leaking or emitting through <b>sealing</b> <b>faces.</b> The twin face design compacting two seals to one seal ring not only reduces greatly the cartridge size so as to fit all pumps without stuffing box modifications, but maintains its dual seal functionality with the single seal simplicity. The hybrid feature combining hydrostatic action for start/stop and slow speed operations, and hydrodynamic action for initiating and maintaining stable face separation not only enhances the sealing performance, but also expands its application ranges. Detailed design features and operating principles including reducing O-ring hysteresis and pressure reversal or loss-of-barrier gas are discussed. Extensive laboratory and field test were conducted to validate the designs. A field test is described to exemplify its applications in process pumps including its performance in abnormal operating conditions...|$|E

As {{a result of these}} changes, valve recession increases and component lifetime decreases, i. e. higher failure rates and more frequent service intervals. The tribological issues {{can be traced back to}} the cleaner combustion which demonstrably suppresses the formation of a protective layer on the <b>sealing</b> <b>faces.</b> In this work, StelliteÃ‚Â® and TribaloyÃ‚Â®-hardfaced valve spindles with different operating hours and from the same gas engine were analyzed in terms of quantitative wear, oxidation and microstructural alterations in the wear scar.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The presence of gas in engine liquid cooling systems can have severe consequences for engine efficiency and life. The presence of stagnant, trapped gases will result in cooling system hotspots, causing gallery wall degradation through thermal stresses, fatigue and eventual cracking. The presence of entrained, transient gases in the coolant flow will act to reduce its bulk thermal properties {{and the performance of}} the system s coolant pump; critically the liquid flow rate, which will severely affect heat transfer throughout the engine and its ancillaries. The hold-up of gas in the pump s impeller may cause the dynamic seal to run dry, without lubrication or cooling. This poses both an immediate failure threat should the seal overheat and rubber components melt and a long term failure threat from intermittent quench cooling, which causes deposit formation on <b>sealing</b> <b>faces</b> acting to abrade and reduce seal quality. Bubbles in the coolant flow will also act as nucleation sites for cavitation growth. This will reduce the Net Positive Suction Head available (NPSHA) in the coolant flow, exacerbating cavitation and its damaging effects in locations such as the cylinder cooling liners and the pump s impeller. This thesis has analysed the occurrence of trapped gas (air) during the coolant filling process, its behaviour and break-up at engine start, the two-phase character of the coolant flow these processes generate and the effects it has on coolant pump performance. Optical and parametric data has been acquired in each of these studies, providing an understanding of the physical processes occurring, key variables and a means of validating numerical (CFD) code of integral processes. From the fundamental understanding each study has provided design rules, guidelines and validated tools have been developed, helping cooling system designers minimise the occurrence of trapped air during coolant filling, promote its breakup at engine start and to minimise its negative effects in the centrifugal coolant pump. It was concluded that whilst ideally the prevention of cooling system gases should be achieved at source, they are often unavoidable. This is due to the cost implications of finding a cylinder head gasket capable of completely sealing in-cylinder combustion pressures, the regular use of nucleate boiling regimes for engine cooling and the need to design cooling channel geometries to cool engine components and not necessarily to avoid fill entrapped air. Using the provided rules and models, it may be ensured stagnant air is minimised at source and avoided whilst an engine is running. However, to abate the effects of entrained gases in the coolant pump through redesign is undesirable due to the negative effects such changes have on a pump s efficiency and cavitation characteristics. It was concluded that the best solution to entrained gases, unavoidable at source, is to remove them from the coolant flow entirely using phase separation device(s) ...|$|E
50|$|A Hydrostatic Seal is a {{non-contacting}} {{mechanical seal}} that operates under an equilibrium of forces. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic seals, Hydrostatic seals have two different pressure zones {{that are used}} to establish a balanced pressure zone between two <b>seal</b> <b>faces.</b> The two pressure system makes the seal unique because typical mechanical seals have one pressure zone that created causes a buildup of pressure that will eventually cause the seal to malfunction. After pressure has come to an equilibrium at the <b>seal</b> <b>face,</b> an incompressible fluid is then released between the two <b>seal</b> <b>faces.</b> The fluid creates a film around the <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> that acts as a lubricant and as a medium for the substance flowing through the seal.

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} power plant, {{one of the most}} {{important}} systems for both safety and performance is the reactor cooling system. The cooling system is generally driven by one or more very large centrifugal pumps. Most reactor coolant pumps utilize a multi-stage mechanical face seal system for fluid containment. As a result, these seal systems are critical to safe, continued operation of a nuclear reactor. Without adequate sealing, loss of coolant volume can occur, and a reactor may be forced to shut down, costing the operating utility significantly until it can be brought online again. The main advantage of mechanical face seals is their self-adjusting properties. These seals are tuned so that they automatically adjust to varying fluid conditions to provide adequate leakage control. Because of the enormous pressures, complicated water chemistry, and possible large temperature transients, the mechanical seals inside a reactor coolant pump must be some of the most robust seals available. In addition, their long service life and continuous operation demand durability and the capability to adjust to a wide range of conditions. However, over time, wear, chemical deposition, or changing operating conditions can alter the face gap, which is the critical geometry between the <b>sealing</b> <b>faces</b> of a seal. An altered face gap can lead to undesirable conditions of too much or not enough leakage, which must be maintained within a certain range to provide lubrication and cooling to the seal faces without resulting in uncontrolled coolant volume loss. Nuclear power plants operate within strict leakage ranges, and long-term effects causing undesirable leakage can eventually necessitate a reactor shutdown if the seal cannot self-adjust to control the leakage. This document will examine possible causes of undesirable leakage rates in a commonly-used reactor coolant pump assembly. These causes will be examined to determine the conditions which promote them, the physical explanation for their effect on the operation of a mechanical seal, and possible methods of mitigation of both the cause and its effect. These findings are based on previous publications by utilities and technical and incident reports from reactor stations which detail actual incidents of abnormal seal performance and their root causes as determined by the utilities. Next, a method of increasing the ability of a mechanical seal to adapt to a wider range of conditions will be proposed. This method involves modifying an existing seal face to include a method of active control. This active control focuses on deliberately deforming one face of the mechanical sealing face pair. This deformation alters the face gap in order to make the fluid conditions inside the face gap more preferable, generating more or less leakage as desired. Two methods of actuation, hydraulic pressure and piezoelectric deformation, will be proposed. Finally, a model of the actively controlled seal faces will be introduced. This model includes a method of numerically solving the Reynolds equation to determine the fluid mechanics that drive the lubrication problem in the seal face and coupling the solution with a deformation analysis in a finite element model of a seal face. The model solves iteratively until a converged solution of a sealed pressure distribution, a resulting face deformation, and a calculated leakage rate is reached. The model includes a study of the effects of induced deformation in the seal via both hydraulic and piezoelectric actuation and the ability of this deformation to control the leakage rate.
