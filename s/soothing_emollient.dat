60|$|The {{schoolmaster}} {{looked at}} him with wonder, and a kind of shuddering, at something so unlike himself; but probably he very imperfectly estimated the forces that were at work within this strange being, and how dangerous they made him. He imputed it, a great deal, to the brandy, which he had kept drinking in such inordinate quantities; whereas it is probable that this had a <b>soothing,</b> <b>emollient</b> effect, as far as it went, on the Doctor's emotions; a sort of like to like, that he instinctively felt to be a remedy, But in truth it was difficult to see these two human creatures together, without feeling their incompatibility; without having a sense that one must be hostile to the other. The schoolmaster, through his fine instincts, doubtless had a sense of this, and sat gazing at the lurid, wrathful figure of the Doctor, in a sort of trance and fascination: not able to stir; bewildered by the sight of the great spider and other surroundings; and this strange, uncouth fiend, who had always been abhorrent to him,--he had a kind of curiosity in it, waited to see what would come of it, but felt it to be an unnatural state to him. And again the grim Doctor came and stood before him, prepared to make another of those strange utterances with which he had already so perplexed him.|$|E

The shadings were 0 % shading (full sunlight) and 50 % shading. The characteristics evaluated were stem diameter, height, leaf area, green and dry biomass ofroots and shoots, height/diameter and Dickson quality index. There was no significant difference in diameterbetween the different substrates. The environment in full sun favored the diameter and the root biomasswhereas the height was favored by shade.

Soothe was the first lubricant eye drop to feature Restoryl, a lipid restorative that works to re-establish the lipid (oily) layer of tears, promoting sustained moisture retention. Soothe was a mineral oil in water emulsion developed by Chris Brancewicz (then at Clarkson University) for Ocular Research of Boston during 1996-2001. Soothe was sold to Bausch & Lomb in August 2007.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{proposed}} study is to demonstrate the benefits of using specialized cosmetic products as part of basic skin care for children with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The epidermal barrier dysfunction {{is known to be}} the leading factor in pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and it manifests as dry skin, imbalance in the composition of lipids of the stratum corneum and water-lipid mantle and alterations in the activity of proteases. Due to xerosis, the skin gets easily affected by allergens, irritants and pathogenic microorganisms, which triggers the "itch-scratch" cycle and can lead to AD exacerbation and significantly deteriorate {{the quality of life of}} the patient. The basic skin care using the moisturizing and <b>soothing</b> cosmetic products (<b>emollients)</b> is acknowledged by all major Guidelines for treatment of AD as an important part of therapy. Significant improvements in skin status as well as the child's well-being can be achieved with use of this simple to understand skin care algorithm that includes proper skin cleansing, moisturizing and itch prevention...|$|R
