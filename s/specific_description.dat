2500|$|The phrase soccer mom {{generally}} {{refers to}} a married middle-class woman {{who lives in the}} suburbs and has school age children. She is sometimes portrayed in the media as busy or overburdened and driving a minivan or SUV. [...] She is also portrayed as putting the interests of her family, and most importantly her children, ahead of her own. [...] The phrase derives from the literal, <b>specific</b> <b>description</b> of a mother who transports and watches her children play soccer. [...] It was also used in names of organizations of mothers who raised money to support their children's soccer teams. [...] The first reference to the phrase soccer mom in the US national media has been traced to 1982. In that year, the husband of the treasurer of the [...] "Soccer Moms booster club" [...] of Ludlow, Massachusetts, stole $3,150 raised for the benefit of a local soccer league.|$|E
2500|$|The match itself {{illustrated}} the advantage gained by the Queen's Park players [...] "through knowing each others' play [...] " [...] as all {{came from the}} same club. Contemporary match reports clearly show dribbling play by both the English and the Scottish sides, for example: [...] "The Scotch now came away with a great rush, Leckie and others dribbling the ball so smartly that the English lines were closely besieged and the ball was soon behind", [...] "Weir now had a splendid run for Scotland into the heart of his opponents' territory [...] " [...] and [...] "Kerr.. closed the match by the most brilliant run of the day, dribbling the ball past the whole field." [...] Although the Scottish team are acknowledged to have worked better together during the first half, the contemporary account in the Scotsman newspaper acknowledges that in the second half England played similarly: [...] "During {{the first half of the}} game the English team did not work so well together, but in the second half they left nothing to be desired in this respect. [...] " [...] There is no <b>specific</b> <b>description</b> of a passing manoeuvre in the lengthy contemporary match reports, although two weeks' later The Graphic reported [...] " [...] seem to be adepts at passing the ball". There is no evidence in the article that the author attended the match, as the reader is clearly pointed to match descriptions in [...] "sporting journals". It is also of note that the 5 March 1872 match between Wanderers and Queen's Park contains no evidence of ball passing.|$|E
60|$|Certain broad {{laws have}} a general {{application}} throughout both the animal and the vegetable worlds, but the ground common to these kingdoms of nature is not of very wide extent, and the multiplicity of details is so great, that the student of living beings finds himself obliged to devote his attention exclusively either to the one or the other. If he elects to study plants, under any aspect, we know at once what to call him. He is a botanist, and his science is botany. But if the investigation of animal life be his choice, the name generally applied to him will {{vary according to the}} kind of animals he studies, or the particular phenomena of animal life to which he confines his attention. If the study of man is his object, he is called an anatomist, or a physiologist, or an ethnologist; but if he dissects animals, or examines into the mode in which their functions are performed, he is a comparative anatomist or comparative physiologist. If he turns his attention to fossil animals, he is a palaeontologist.

6000|$|The rabbit {{is another}} animal {{which has been}} introduced, and has succeeded very well; so that they abound over {{large parts of the}} island. Yet, like the horses, they are {{confined}} within certain limits; for they have not crossed the central chain of hills, nor would they have extended even so far as its base, if, as the Gauchos informed me, small colonies had not been carried there. I should not have supposed that these animals, natives of Northern Africa, could have existed in a climate so humid as this, and which enjoys so little sunshine that even wheat ripens only occasionally. It is asserted that in Sweden, which any one would have thought a more favourable climate, the rabbit cannot live out of doors. The first few pairs, moreover, had here to contend against pre-existing enemies, in the fox and some large hawks. The French naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct species, and called it Lepus Magellanicus. (9/5. Lesson's [...] "Zoology of the Voyage of the Coquille" [...] tome 1 page 168. All the early voyagers, and especially Bougainville, distinctly state that the wolf-like fox was the only native animal on the island. The distinction of the rabbit as a species is taken from peculiarities in the fur, from the shape of the head, and from the shortness of the ears. I may here observe that the difference between the Irish and English hare rests upon nearly similar characters, only more strongly marked.) They imagined that Magellan, when talking of an animal under the name of [...] "conejos" [...] in the Strait of Magellan, referred to this species; but he was alluding to a small cavy, which to this day is thus called by the Spaniards. The Gauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being different from the grey, and they said that at all events it had not extended its range any farther than the grey kind; that the two were never found separate; and that they readily bred together, and produced piebald offspring. Of the latter I now possess a specimen, and it is marked about the head differently from the French <b>specific</b> <b>description.</b> This circumstance shows how cautious naturalists should be in making species; for even Cuvier, on looking at the skull of one of these rabbits, thought it was probably distinct! ...|$|E
