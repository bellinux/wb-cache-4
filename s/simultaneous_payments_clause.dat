The parties commit to maintaining and, where possible, improving immunisation coverage rates through immunisation initiatives to reduce the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases in Australia (COAG 2009, p. 4). The COAG Reform Council has the role of assessing States and Territories and publicly reporting their achievement of performance benchmarks before payments are made by the Commonwealth to reward maintaining and, where possible, improving immunisation coverage rates.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} South African Copyright Act No. 98 of 1978 as it {{pertains}} to the archived holdings at the International Library of African Music (ILAM) situated at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa. The purpose of analysing this law is to advise and assist ILAM in fulfilling royalty payment obligations as stipulated in a contract signed between ILAM and the Smithsonian Global Sound (formally Global Sound Network) in 2001. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of the royalty <b>payment</b> <b>clause</b> in the Smithsonian Institution’s contract with ILAM, this research includes an examination of: the history and nature of South African copyright as a sub-structure of intellectual property; specific internationally documented copyright infringement cases; the recording and documentation practices of Hugh Tracey (ILAM’s founder and director from 1954 to 1977); the contract between Global Sound Network and ILAM; and contentious issues surrounding collective ownership and indigenous knowledge. In conclusion, this research suggests equitable solutions to ILAM’s copyright concerns and proposes the Eastern Cape Music Archiving Project (ECMAP) as a practical vehicle to assist the South African Department of Trade and Industry in implementation of the South African Intellectual Property Amendment Bill (2008) if, and when, it is passed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1980 Congress has passed laws to facilitate the transfer of technology from federal laboratories to U. S. businesses. In particular, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 authorized federal laboratories operated by contractors, including the Department of Energy's (DOE) national laboratories, to enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA). Under a CRADA, the partner and DOE laboratory agree to jointly conduct research and typically share the research costs. By fiscal year 1992, DOE's national laboratories were among the leading federal laboratories participating in CRADAs. Recently however, the 12 laboratories that DOE surveyed have substantially reduced their CRADA partnerships and their technical assistance to small businesses. Instead, the laboratories have increasingly transferred technology through agreements that did not involve collaborative research and were funded by a business or other nonfederal entity. Managers at most of the laboratories say the lack of dedicated funding for technology for transfer to technology partnerships, including funding targeted to small businesses, {{is the most important}} barrier to their technology transfer activities. Managers at most laboratories said that DOE's lack of a high-level, effective advocate for technology transfer and DOE's lack of commitment to technology partnerships were important barriers. Several managers also said that requirements, such as DOE's advance <b>payment</b> <b>clause,</b> were often financially burdensome for small businesses. ...|$|R
500|$|Two {{years after}} signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans to W.E. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, {{if he did not}} meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to [...] "deal with the bankers" [...] to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty <b>payment</b> <b>clause</b> in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison, and Thompson-Houston).|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Ensuring and {{maintaining}} positive cash flow {{is becoming more}} and more difficult, especially in the construction industry. Payments need to be collected to be able to sustain a positive cash flow and this is not an easy process. Organizations fail due to insufficient available liquid assets and this study is done to determine why payments aren’t made, including information on what payment provisions contractors agree upon, and why the trend in the industry is to keep cash rather than pay suppliers. The collection of outstanding payments is also investigated, including actions taken if payments are not made, what clauses are included in contracts to ensure payment and if interest is charged on outstanding payments. A credit application processes need to be in place to ensure the credit worthiness of the clients/ employers is reviewed. It is also very important that some form of contract is agreed upon, understood and signed by both parties. There are instances where the contract documentation is not provided or the contract documents is provided and signed, but one of the parties has not read or understood some of the <b>payment</b> <b>clauses.</b> This could also lead to delayed payments. Collection of outstanding payments could be to propose a payment agreement, by charging interest or alternatively, enforcing early payments by providing a settlement discount. One of the most mentioned reasons for companies holding onto cash is to ensure liquid capital is available to ensure positive cash flow and the continuation of the business. The main reasons why liquid capital is not available is poor management of funds, poor payment procedures and mismanagement of funds. It was found that most of the construction companies have credit application processes, contracts and payment provisions in place, but most of these companies don’t adhere strictly to the procedures set out in these documents. More attention need to be given to enforcing credit and collection policies in practice, as well as following the payment provisions set out in the construction documentation. Questionnaires were only sent to companies operating in the construction industry. Further investigations can be done on other industries (including construction, mechanical, electrical, medical, farming, food sector, fashion sector etc.), which can assist in assisting with payments made by companies or individuals...|$|R
40|$|There are {{established}} procedures for {{arriving at a}} contract with a consulting firm regarding the terms and conditions under which the proposed services are to be performed. Whatever the method of selection and the form of contract, negotiations between the EA and the consultant are an essential step. A. Forms of Contract There are two commonly used types of contracts or fee structures for consulting services: time-based (or person-month) and lump-sum. These are discussed below. The time-based arrangement is, however, the more common and that preferred by ADB. It is the arrangement principally discussed in this Handbook. 1. Time-based Contracts Time-based contracts provide for agreed rates per person-hour, person-week or person-month, which are disbursed {{in accordance with the}} time the consultants actually spend on a job. The make-up of personmonth rates is discussed in more detail later in this Chapter. In addition there are normally per diem or living allowances and travel costs, plus other reimbursable “out of pocket ” or direct expenses, for equipment, report printing, and the like. The advantages of time-based contracts are that they most closely reflect the actual costs incurred by the consultants to address fully the task. All contracts of this type should have a “ceiling” (maximum <b>payment</b> <b>clause),</b> combined with the explicit obligation {{on the part of the}} consultants to complete the specified tasks within the total amount stated. The principal disadvantage is that more consulting services may be provided than is warranted. On the other hand, there have been cases in which person-months have been used up without the scope of services being completed. Thus, both the EA and the consultant must carefully monitor the expenditure of person-months in comparison with progress achieved toward completion of the job. Inasmuch as the time-based contract provides for payment on a consultant’s inputs rather than output, the time-based contract with a ceiling affords more opportunity than other types of contract for the EA to monitor day-to-day work. The EA is aware of who should be on the job, when, and what the consultant’s tasks will be. If negotiated correctly, it can also provide considerable opportunity for the transfer of skills from the consultants to the staff of the EA...|$|R

We study a broadly appli-cable principal agent setting, in which the agent exerts effort for an immediately observable task (acquisition) and a task for which information is only gradually available over time (diligence). Optimal compensation contracts trade off the cost and benefit of delay resulting from agent impatience and the informational gain. Mandatory deferral may increase or decrease equilibrium diligence depending {{on the importance of}} the acquisition task. In particular, higher acquisition incentives make it more likely that deferral regulation increases equilibrium diligence. Our results imply concrete conditions on economic primitives that make mandatory deferral socially (un) desirable...|$|R
50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of <b>payment.</b> A <b>clause</b> may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-certain {{activities}} of highway construction are particularly sensitive to such weather conditions as soil moisture, precipitation, and daily temperature. Regression analysis {{is used to}} obtain three alternative probability models designed to translate observed weather conditions into probabilities for carrying out construction activities. The models were developed using generalized least squares, normit analysis, and logit analysis. The generalized least squares method was the most convenient computationally, but it had severe interpretative disadvantages. The results obtained by logit analysis gave the desired probabilistic interpretation most readily and had the best predictive ability. Comparison of sample observation and predicted work probabilities for common excavation during wet and dry months indicated that the logit analysis model could accurately translate weather conditions into probabilities that work would take place. Models for paving and asphalt work and for bridge and drainage structure are also estimated using logit analysis. These estimates indicate a strong sensitivity of the latter category of work to precipitation conditions. Such models may aid contract letting agencies in planning <b>payment</b> schedules, penalty <b>clauses,</b> and completion dates for new roads; construction firms may find such models valuable in planning effective use of men and equipment. 0 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{production by}} {{a firm that}} relies on the patent rights that are held by other actors. Before production can take place, bargains have to be struck with each patent holder over the royalty per unit produced. In the negotiations, a patent holder must be mindful {{of the fact that}} a large royalty will increase the product price and lower demand for the final product. Hence each patent holder would prefer to gain a large royalty at the expense of rivals. When the producer makes the first offer in an alternating offer framework, we analyze whether it should conduct negotiations sequentially with some grouping of patent holders or simultaneously. We demonstrate that the producer will prefer simultaneous negotiation. An individual patent holder would prefer to negotiate early with the producer, and then to see remaining rights holders negotiate simultaneously. A firm that holds several patents would want to negotiate royalties on each one sequentially and then have <b>simultaneous</b> negotiation of <b>payments</b> to other rights holders.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} how two Norwegian banks have enacted and experienced individualized pay systems. The analysis was undertaken with in-depth qualitative interviews with a shop steward representative and a management representative at both banks, {{as well as}} with an employee representative at one of them. In addition, a preliminary interview with a delegate from the employer organization in the financial services industry was completed – mainly as a means to obtain introductory knowledge of recent trends and debates of remuneration among Norwegian banks. The development has been manifested in a proposition from 2001 rendered by a joint commission comprising representatives from Finansforbundet (sector level trade union) and Finansnæringens Arbeidsgiverforening (sector level employer organization). The document, here called the Individualization of Remuneration Proposal (IRP), drafted by the commission declared the need for adoption of more individually based forms of remuneration of employees in the Norwegian financial services industry. The crux was clause 14. 5 from the Basic Agreement – which inherently offers significant leeway for local fixation of payment, and the proposition was for two alternative routes towards such decentralizing reforms. Firstly, one ‘moderate’ alternative to include employees, in some way, in the examination of individual <b>payment</b> commanded by <b>clause</b> 14. 5 of the Basic Agreement. One example is to involve pay related issues in the already existing ‘appraisal interviews’. Secondly, a more ‘radical’ alternative consisting of complete determination of wages through individual sessions of wage discussions between employee and employer just as in the Swedish financial services sector (i. e. ‘pay interviews’). Two case banks have been investigated. Each followed a separate route from the IRP, and both chose to include pay-related discussions in the ‘appraisal interview’ sessions. The study assumes a feature to be a vital spur {{in the development of the}} first for both cases; namely, the existence of a kindred decentralized organizational structure in both banks. The study infers that the most important difference between the case banks unfolded as a matter of which position shop stewards were granted to the revenue-related aspects of the employment relationship under the implementation of the new pay regime. Even though it is uncertain whether or not either of the two bank cases will create and/or sustain such a procedural role for shop stewards in the longer run, the conclusion of this study is that such positions are the most promising for continuous trade union presence and influence of wage settlement in banks operating with individualized pay systems...|$|R
