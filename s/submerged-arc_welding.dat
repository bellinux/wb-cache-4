5000|$|Butt welds are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a butt weld are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of welding material possible. Butt welds are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welding,</b> due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation. Because of this necessity, butt welds can be utilized for their simplistic design to be fed through automated welding machines efficiently.|$|E
5000|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) {{is a common}} arc welding process. The first patent on the <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SAW) process was taken out in 1935 and covered an {{electric}} arc beneath a bed of granulated flux. Originally developed and patented by Jones, Kennedy and Rothermund, the process requires a continuously fed consumable solid or tubular (metal cored) electrode. The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being [...] "submerged" [...] under a blanket of granular fusible flux consisting of lime, silica, manganese oxide, calcium fluoride, and other compounds. When molten, the flux becomes conductive, and provides a current path between the electrode and the work. This thick layer of flux completely covers the molten metal thus preventing spatter and sparks as well as suppressing the intense ultraviolet radiation and fumes that {{are a part of}} the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process.|$|E

40|$|This article {{contains}} an overview on automated ultrasonic weld inspection for various pipe types. Some inspection steps might by {{carried out with}} portable test equipment (e. g. pipe end test), but the weld inspection in all internationally relevant specifications must be automated. The pipe geometry, the production process, and the further pipe usage determine if NDT is required and thus, the number of required ultrasonic probes. Recent updates for some test specifications enforce {{a large number of}} ultrasonic probes, e. g. the SHELL standard. To save production cost, seamless pipes are sometimes replaced by ERW (electric-resistance welded) pipes and LSAW (<b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welded</b> pipes with longitudinal seam) pipes by SSAW (<b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welded</b> pipes with spiral seam) pipes, the inspection methods change gradually between the various pipe types. Each testing system is optimized for the specific application and its properties have to be discussed by the system manufacturer, the system user and the final customer of the pipe.

40|$|This effort {{evaluated}} the fracture toughness of austenitic steel <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>weld</b> (SAW) fusion lines. The incentive was {{to explain why}} cracks grow into the fusion line in many pipe tests conducted with cracks initially centered in SAWS. The concern was that the fusion line may have a lower toughness than the SAW. It {{was found that the}} fusion line, Ji. was greater than the SAW toughness but much less than the base metal. Of greater importance may be that the crack growth resistance (JD-R) of the fusion line appeared to reach a steady-state value, while the SAW had a continually increasing JD-R curve. This explains why the cracks eventually turn to the fusion line in the pipe experiments. A method of incorporating these results would be to use the weld metal J-R curve up to the fusion-line steady-state J value. These results may be more important to LBB analyses than the ASME flaw evaluation procedures, since there is more crack growth with through-wall cracks in LBB analyses than for surface cracks in pipe flaw evaluations...|$|R

(1) Quasi-static, cyclic-load compact tension specimen experiments were conducted using parameters similar to those used in IPIRG- 1 experiments on 6 -inch nominal diameter through-wall-cracked pipes. These experiments were conducted on a TP 304 base metal, an A 106 Grade B base metal, and their respective <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welds.</b> The results showed that when using a constant cyclic displacement increment, the compact tension experiments could predict the through-wall-cracked pipe crack initiation toughness, but a different control procedure is needed to reproduce the pipe cyclic crack growth in the compact tension tests.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of reducing defects in the arc welding process has attracted research interest, particularly, in the aerospace and nuclear sectors where the resulting weld quality {{is a major}} concern and must be assured by costly, time-consuming, non-destructive testing (NDT) procedures. One possible approach is the analysis of a measurand correlated with the formation of defects, from which a control action is derived. Among others, the thermographic analysis of the weld pool and the heat-affected zone have proven to be a useful technique, since the temperature profile of the material being welded has a clear correlation with the process parameters.

In a companion article (Part I), the influence of post-weld annealing tem- perature on microstructure evolution and chemical com- position of austenite and ferrite was analyzed; this study can thus be considered directly connected with the previous one. The pitting corrosion resistance of the heat-treated welded joints was evaluated by using both electrochemical measurements and ASTM G 48 standard gravimetric tests; examinations of initiation sites of pitting attack were carried out in order to correlate the experimental data obtained in this study with the predicted pitting corrosion behavior obtained by using the results described in Part I. Generally, the post-weld annealing treatment enhances the pitting corrosion resistance of UNS S 32750 welded joints. By using PREN analysis of single phases, a correlation between the chemical composition evolution of ferrite and austenite and the experimental pitting behavior of the welded joints was found, in relation to welding and post-welding heat treatment temperature.

40|$|Measurements of {{toughness}} in the ductile-to-brittle fracture regime exhibit {{an effect}} of test-piece size. For a given level of toughness (KJC), this may {{be considered as a}} positive shift in the transition temperature (∆T) with increasing specimen thickness for a particular geometry. This Paper describes a numerical programme undertaken to investigate the influence of specimen size on the fracture toughness behaviour of <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>weld</b> material in the ductile-to-brittle transition regime. The influences of sampling volume and constraint on ∆T have been assessed for 10 mm thick CT (CT- 10) and 20 % side-grooved pre-cracked Charpy specimens (PC-CVN) relative to 25 mm thick standard plane-sided compact-tension (CT- 25) specimens. Three-dimensional, elastic-plastic finite element analyses have been used to assess the constraint behaviour of these specimens, and the BEREMIN model has been applied to predict ∆T. The analyses have indicated a loss of constraint over a significant proportion of the crack front for both CT- 10 and PC-CVN specimens at toughness levels greater than approximately 100 MPa√m. For CT- 10 specimens, constraint-loss is most significant towards the outer edges of the specimen whilst high constraint conditions are initially maintained over the central region of the crack-front. This high constraint region may be viewed as an effective crack-front width that reduces with increasing deformation. For side-grooved PC-CVN specimens, constraint loss occurs uniformly across the crack front. Statistical models, based on empirical data, give a value of ∆T = 18 ºC for this material at a mean reference toughness of 100 MPa√m. The BEREMIN model tends to over-predict this value by ~ 35 ºC for CT- 10 specimens and ~ 55 ºC for side-grooved PC-CVN specimens...|$|R

Mortars have been made containing the three types of SWF and in addition a reference mortar made with sand. Physical and mineralogical characteristics of each SWF were studied, and the physical properties (consistency and density) and mechanical properties (compressive and tensile strengths) of the mortars were analyzed.

The following properties after firing were determined: linear shrinkage, water absorption, apparent porosity, apparent density, and flexural strength. The results show that for multiple-use mortars, SWF reached excellent results, being an overall substitute for sand as fine aggregate. For ceramic bricks, SWF can also be used as partial substitute for red clay. Both applications of SWF significantly contributes for the reduction of the ambient impact: on one hand, reducing the extraction of natural sand and clay, on other hand, contributing for the reduction of the risk of ground water contamination due to the inadequate disposal of the SWF...|$|E

40|$|Welding of {{austenitic-ferritic}} {{stainless steels}} {{is a crucial}} operation and all the materials and parameters used in this process must be optimized {{in order to obtain}} the suitable corrosion and mechanical properties. Since a great part of super duplex stainless steels is used in very aggressive environment, their corrosion resistance, referred in particular to pitting and crevice corrosion, is an all- important facet in production and processing of this type of steels. Pitting corrosion resistance of super duplex stainless steels welded joints depends on several aspects: microstructure of the bead, elemental partitioning between ferrite and austenite, and the possible presence of secondary phases. For these reasons, a post-weld annealing is generally performed to homogenize the microstructure. The annealing temperature is the most important parameter to be optimized in this heat treatment. In the present work, a comparison between the as-welded and solution-treated joints is carried out. An effort has been made to correlate the main factors that affect pitting corrosion of the welded joints (microstructure, secondary phases, chemical composition of single phases) with the experimental data obtained from corrosion tests. In this first part of the work the results regarding microstructure and partitioning of elements are presented.

The number of replicate tests at any one temperature ranged from 2 to 46 specimens. Prior to testing with each striker, verification specimens at the low, high, and super high energy levels from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) were tested. In the two series of verification tests, the tests with the 2 mm striker met the requirements at the low and high energy levels {{but not at the}} super high energy. For one plate, the 2 mm striker showed somewhat higher average absorbed energies than those for the 8 -mm striker at all three test temperatures.

For the Russian forging steel and the HUS weld, tests were conducted over a range of temperatures with tests at one laboratory using the 8 mm striker and tests at a second laboratory using the 2 mm striker. Lateral expansion was measured for all specimens and the results are compared with the absorbed energy results.

40|$|Abstract This thesis studies {{controlling}} {{factors that}} govern transverse hydrogen cracking in high-strength multipass weld metal (WM). The experiments {{were concerned with}} heavy-restraint Y- and U-Groove multipass cracking tests of shielded-metal arc (SMAW) and <b>submerged-arc</b> (SAW) <b>weld</b> metals. Results of tensile tests, hardness surveys, weld residual stress measurements and microstructural investigations are discussed. The analytical phase comprised numerical calculations for analysing the interactions between crack-controlling factors. The objectives were: (i) the assessment of WM hydrogen cracking risk by defining the Crack-No Crack boundary conditions in terms of 'safe line' description giving the desired lower-bound estimates, and (ii) to derive predictive equations capable of giving reliable estimates of the required preheat/interpass temperature T 0 /Ti for the avoidance of cracking. Hydrogen cracking occurred predominantly in high strength weld metals of Rp 0. 2 ≈ 580 - 900 MPa. At intermediate strengths of Rp 0. 2 ≈ 500 - 550 MPa, cracking {{took place in the}} cases where the holding time from welding to NDT inspection was prolonged to 7 days. Low strength WMs of Rp 0. 2 ≤ 480 MPa did not exhibit cracking under any conditions examined. Cracking occurrence was, above all, governed by WM tensile strength, weld diffusible hydrogen and weld residual stresses amounting to the yield strength. The appearance of cracking vanished when transferring from 40 to 6 mm thick welds. The implications of the holding time were more significant than anticipated previously. A period of 16 hrs in accordance with SFS-EN 1011 appeared much too short for thick multipass welds. Interpass time and heat input showed no measurable effect on cracking sensitivity, hence being of secondary importance. Equations were derived to assess the weld critical hydrogen content Hcr corresponding to the Crack-No Crack conditions as a function of either weld metal Pcm, yield strength Rp 0. 2 or weld metal maximum hardness HV 5 (max). For the calculation of safe T 0 /Ti estimates, a formula incorporating: (i) WM strength as a linear function of either weld carbon equivalent CET or weld HV 5 (max), (ii) weld build-up thickness aw in the form of tanh expression and (iii) weld diffusible hydrogen HD in terms of a combined [ln / power law] expression was found descriptive...|$|R
40|$|This lecture first {{presents}} {{an outline of}} research work by which many troublesome problems {{in the design and}} construction of large tankers were solved, and secondly introduccs the largest tanker ever built in Japan, the A’issho Maru, of 130 000 deadweight tonnage. With regard to design of such tankers, two points, that is, (1) reduction in length of ship (L), and (2) increase in depth (D), should be taken into account from the standpoint of weight saving and of easy fabrication. Researches into structural problems of tank parts and into the dynamic pressure of cargo oil tank, due to ship motions, are described briefly, and show that the maximum impulsive pressure in model tests may be up to 5 times the static fluid pressure and may be observed at the tank top when the natural period of fluid in the tank is resonant with the oscillation period of the ship. Special care should be taken in thc detailed design of Iongitudinals, struts and so on, otherwise cracks will initiate easily at the point of stress conccntration. As regards hull construction practices in such large tankcrs, there secm to be no special problems except in the fabrication and welding of very thick plate of up to 50 mm thickness. Very thick plates thus offer several problems to be solved such as groove shapes, application of ‘Unionmelt’, doubling plate, weld cracking, and back-wave welding technique, ctc. Brief discussion and some test results on these problcms are included and mention is made of the superiority of KZ-typc groove for automatic single-pass <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welding</b> and of ‘Uranami ‘ welding electrode (which offers a perfect one-sidc welding without backing plate).

40|$|The study {{emphasizes}} {{the effects of}} multi-pass narrow gap (NG) <b>Submerged-Arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SAW) on the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). The differences between the HAZ of single-pass welds and multi-pass welds are radical and are caused by the subsequent thermal cycles which only exist in multi-pass welding. A series of experiments were carried out to establish {{the relationship between the}} welding thermal cycles and the mechanical and microstructural properties of a HAZ. Both real and Gleeble simulated HAZ's were investigated. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that the HAZ's in multi-pass welds can be improved significantly by the welding process itself. However, multi-pass welding does not always improve its HAZ. To realize the improvement, some special criteria must be met. The most important parameters are heat input, welding speed, deposit thickness and inter-pass temperature. This study establishes the relations between these parameters and the effects of HAZ refinement. There are some domains of the parameters in which HAZ refinement can be realized. The research reveals that in multi-pass NG welding, a set of welding parameters can always be found to fulfill the conditions for HAZ improvement. Real welding processes, with welding parameters optimized according to the analyses, were performed and a totally refined HAZ was achieved under laboratory conditions. It is suggested that the method can be applied to in situ welding situations. High heat input does not necessarily lead to inferior microstructural and mechanical properties in multi-pass NG welding. As long as the conditions for HAZ refinement are satisfied, an improved HAZ will be obtained no matter how high the heat input is. This also leads {{to the conclusion that the}} HAZ in multi-pass NG welding is less sensitive to heat input than that in single pass welding. The tempering parameter, which has been used to evaluate the tempering effects at constant temperature, is successfully introduced into welding (non-isothermal) conditions. The effects of precipitates in 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel are theoretically investigated...|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal and {{circumferential}} welds in transportable {{pressure vessels}} {{are produced by}} <b>submerged-arc</b> <b>welding</b> using a single vee preparation and multiple weld runs. Quenched and tempered (QT) steels, which are commonly used for transportable pressure vessels, require mandatory postweld heat treatment (PWHT) regardless of the plate thickness. During their life transportable pressure vessels may have up to four PWHT cycles, and concerns have emerged about possible effects on material properties such as hardness, tensile strength, impact toughness and fracture toughness. This thesis reports on the weld procedure, microstructural evaluation and various mechanical properties (bend, yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, fatigue, impact toughness, CTOD fracture toughness and hardness) for 11 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm QT steel weldments. The 11 mm and 20 mm base plates investigated were BIS 80 PV, which is a pressure vessel grade steel. The 12 mm plate was BIS 80, which is structural grade steel but deemed a possible candidate for pressure vessels due to superior impact and fracture toughness properties over currently used QT pressure vessel steels. The parent metal, heat affected zone and weld metal regions of each weldment were examined, and then exposed to temperatures and times in the PWHT range. Although there was no apparent change in microstructure at an optical level and little change in hardness for up to four postweld heat treatments, there was a marked decrease in hardness of the parent metal for more extensive heat treatments (increasing Holloman parameter). There was also evidence of minor secondary hardening in the 11 mm and 20 mm BIS 80 PV parent plate following short heat treatment times. The weld metal (WM) and HAZ hardness typically decreased with one PWHT cycle and subsequently stabilised with further PWHT cycles. For all test plates, results are also presented for Charpy V-notch impact tests in the parent metal, HAZ and weld metal region, and CTOD fracture toughness tests in the PM region. The effect of exposure to multiple PWHT cycles on these properties is discussed. A decrease in impact energy and fracture toughness {{with an increase in}} the number of heat treatments was evident in the parent metal. In contrast, the weld metal showed a decrease in impact energy after two PWHT cycles, and then an increase towards the original impact energy after a further two cycles. In PM samples, which have been extensively tempered in the manufacturing process, the mechanism by which toughness properties are affected by cumulative PWHT holding time is through the coarsening and coalescence of second phase carbide particles. These particles decrease impact energy by the formation of larger voids in the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip or by the initiation of cleavage fracture. These two phenomena decrease the energy required for fracture. In WM with an as-solidified structure, ductile failure in the form of void coalescence is initiated by non-metallic inclusions. This leads to an initially high impact toughness, which then decreases after PWHT because of the nucleation and coarsening of metastable Fe 3 C precipitates that promote quasi-cleavage type fracture. Upon exposure to further PWHT cycles the impact energy begins to increase again due to the dissolution of the metastable carbides and the formation of finer, more stable carbides based on elements such as Cr, Mo, Ni and Nb. This change in the form of the carbide promotes localised fracture by micro-plasticity, with void formation and coalescence. Additionally, cross-weld root bend (180 °) and tensile tests were carried out before and after PWHT. None of the bend samples showed any evidence of cracking or tearing, hence confirming the ductility of the weldment. The tensile properties of the BIS 80 PV cross-weld samples complied with the Australian Standards, but the tensile properties of the BIS 80 cross-weld samples only complied in the as-welded condition. Tensile properties of the PM showed no significant trends with the number of PWHT cycles and the fatigue crack growth rate increased slightly in relation to the number of PWHT cycles or PWHT holding time. One of the primary roles of PWHT is to reduce residual stresses caused by the welding process. Residual stress measurements using the hole drilling method were made to ascertain the need for PWHT. Residual stresses, measured in the weld centre-line by the hole drilling technique, were compressive along both the longitudinal and transverse directions and were no greater than 250 MPa (between 0. 2 - 0. 5 times the yield strength at room temperature). Although, the presence of residual stresses (tensile and compressive) of greater magnitude is not excluded, the residual stress measurements demonstrated that PWHT significantly reduced the magnitude of the residual stresses. The ability to predict the impact energy of a pressure vessel steel subjected to various cumulative PWHT holding times is beneficial to pressure vessel inspectors, who are misguidedly instructed to be wary of the mechanical properties of vessels after 6 hours of cumulative PWHT holding time. The original impact energy of the steel, which is determined by its chemical composition, microstructure and thermo-mechanical treatment determines the cumulative PWHT time before the impact properties of the QT steel decrease below the specified 40 J limit at – 20 °C. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed using an artificial neural network to predict the effect of PWHT time and other variables such as composition and test temperature on impact energy. This ANN model provides a valuable design tool for predicting impact toughness as a function of composition, heat treatment and testing conditions. Finally, the performance of BIS 80 was evaluated and its superior impact oughness and fracture toughness properties over BIS 80 PV were confirmed. However, the tensile properties of postweld heat-treated 12 mm BIS 80 cross-weld samples did not comply with AS 3597, the Australian Standard for QT steels; and the PM stress ratio exceeded the specified limit of 0. 93. These ‘deficiencies’ could be remedied by (i) discarding PWHT or (ii) using a high strength WM; and (iii) abandoning or relaxing the stress ratio requirement, which is of questionable significance, under conditions of high strain rate impact loading (road collision) ...|$|E
