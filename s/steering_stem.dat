40|$|The {{design of}} {{surfaces}} and interfaces {{gives rise to}} superior qualities and properties to materials and structures. The interface between biology and materials in nature is being closely examined at the smallest scales {{for a number of}} significant reasons. It is recognised that the properties of surfaces have definite biological effects that can be harnessed in clinical regeneration biology. Also the deeper understanding of surface interactions between cells and matrices in human biology is spurring the fabrication of biomimetic and bioinspired versions of these natural designs. The new emerging science of bioinspired surface engineering is helping to improve clinical performances for biomaterials and biostructures because it resolves the problems necessary to optimise integration of implant biomaterials and structures. One of the major developments is the use of surface topography, which is now being exploited for microbial control, <b>steering</b> <b>stem</b> cell behaviours in proliferation and differentiation and adhesive surfaces for better bonding with tissues. In this Chapter we will explore the status of these super surfaces and examine the possibilities {{for the next generation of}} dental biomaterials and implants. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|We derive {{laws for}} the {{distribution}} of quantum steering among different parties in multipartite Gaussian states under Gaussian measurements. We prove that a monogamy relation akin to the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality holds quantitatively for a recently introduced measure of Gaussian steering. We then define the residual Gaussian <b>steering,</b> <b>stemming</b> from the monogamy inequality, {{as an indicator of}} collective steering-type correlations. For pure three-mode Gaussian states, the residual acts a quantifier of genuine multipartite steering, and is interpreted operationally in terms of the guaranteed key rate in the task of secure quantum secret sharing. Optimal resource states for the latter protocol are identified, and their possible experimental implementation discussed. Our results pin down the role of multipartite steering for quantum communication. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures. Close to published versio...|$|R
40|$|Psychology is {{a science}} that {{contributes}} greatly {{to a number of}} other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Unfortunately, it is not often recognised as a STEM discipline. This discussion paper considers psychology’s membership as a STEM subject and the impact that it has had on our everyday lives. The author suggests that postgraduate students working on innovative, inter-disciplinary research can not only contribute to psychology’s standing, but can also help to communicate the value of what psychologists do. Reflections from the author’s experiences as a STEM Ambassador are also included, with reference to The University of Northampton’s unique <b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group and <b>STEM</b> Champions programme...|$|R
40|$|Psychology is a {{valuable}} Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) discipline, but one which could do far more at communicating its value to the wider public. This poster discusses Psychology’s inclusion in The University of Northampton’s STEM approach, considering challenges surrounding activity provision, recruitment, engagement and cross-discipline collaboration. It will be suggested that these activities enhance the Psychology STEM journey by providing students with valuable professional experience and by fostering the development of employability-related skills beyond those obtained during their degree. Despite challenges, Psychology STEM outreach activities not only improve participation and engagement, but may also improve Psychology’s STEM membership. Outline: This paper will focus on enhancing the Psychology student journey through STEM outreach. The University of Northampton has a unique, cross-university <b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group, which champions STEM activities and fosters cross-discipline collaboration across the University. Over the last two years, Psychology has been represented, for the first time, {{in a range of}} STEM outreach activities, including recruitment of Psychology students through the University of Northampton’s STEM Champions programme. A successful Psychology STEM Team Leader pilot initiative has also demonstrated the potential value for these activities on the Psychology STEM student journey. This work addresses how Psychology STEM outreach activities potentially increase HE participation in Psychology, as they enthuse young people with a new and exciting topic often only introduced at FE. In addition to this, Psychology educators involved in STEM outreach activities have the opportunity to use their subject-specific expertise to develop creative and inspiring learning environments, which could enhance their HE teaching and learning practice. Importantly, it will be suggested that involving HE students in STEM provision provides psychology graduates with essential knowledge, skills and experience of working within professional psychology-related environments, which is valuable for graduates success within competitive psychology careers. Those interested in this paper will be looking to enhance the STEM Psychology student journey, as well as increasing Psychology’s STEM membership and enhancing their learning and teaching practice. Educators and support staff both within and beyond Psychology may also be interested in this work. The poster will engage delegates by including photographs of Psychology STEM activities, feedback from students and staff involved in Psychology STEM provision and recommendations for future practice. It will also provide a critical insight into challenges related to Psychology STEM outreach activities. This poster will focus on a number of key areas: 1. 	Engaging the wider public in psychology •	Psychology’s position in STEM •	Importance of public engagement •	Engagement issues 2. 	Psychology’s inclusion in STEM at UN: •	<b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group, <b>STEM</b> Champions, Team Leader •	Challenges related to activities, recruitment, engagement and collaboration •	Staff and student Feedback 3. 	Conclusions and implications for practice •	Psychology STEM membership •	Student engagement •	Implications for practice Key Messages: 1. 	Psychology is an important and impactful STEM subject, but {{more needs to be done}} to promote its value to the wider public. 2. 	Psychology STEM initiatives provide important public engagement and participation opportunities, which potentially reinforce Psychology’s STEM membership. 3. 	This work may enhance educator’s professional practice and student employability prospects, but must involve student representation...|$|R
30|$|From hard {{scaffolds}} to gel-based and scaffold-free approaches, tendon {{tissue engineering}} has significantly progressed in recent years. The improved understanding of tissue resident adult stem cells, such as BMSCs, ADSCs and TSPCs, {{has been very}} helpful {{and a large number}} of studies have clarified {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these cell types. Growth factors <b>steering</b> <b>stem</b> cell fate toward the tenogenic lineage have been identified and overall, the protocols for in vitro tenogenesis have been improved. Still, the field needs to consider a multifactorial approach that is based on the combination and fine-tuning of chemical and biomechanical stimuli in order to obtain optimal tenogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The field also has to move out of a ‘one size fits all’ strategy for treating tendon injuries and consider that different tendon defects can be treated by ‘custom design’ combination of cells and carriers and personalised physiotherapy. In particular, carrier-free and gel-based applications, in combination with autologous cells, can be very attractive option to enhance conservative treated tendon injuries as they can be delivered with minimal invasive operation procedure and may lead to quicker and better outcome. All in all, tendon tissue engineering has now excellent foundations and enters the period of precision and translation to models with clinical relevance and we think undoubtedly it will remain the most promising step forward for better treatment of tendon injuries.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish a new style of AV performance that facilitated me in knowingly steering audience engagement. My interest in <b>steering</b> engagement <b>stems</b> from the intent I have with my performances; an intent to encourage audiences into considered thought about the topics I bring to my shows. As practice-based research, a series of performances formed its basis, with each adapted toward establishing a new style. I introduced audience conversations to my performances, doing so in real-time by harnessing the audience's second-screens. In this way, their smartphones facilitated spontaneous collaboration between the audience and I; in turn this gave me a way to steer them toward thinking about the themes behind my performances. By then bringing this style of performance to the context of live debate, a new paradigm emerged; one that challenges the audience to participate in shaping the emergent audio-visual event. I had to develop the capacity to monitor audience engagement, first online with the `video-cued commentary' and then in real-time via two different `audience-commentary systems'. This may be of interest to anyone engaging in forms of audience analysis or viewer studies. How I developed second-screen systems may be of interest to designers of phone-network-based social-media commentary platforms. My effort toward simplifying how I generated audio-visual content and how I controlled it on-stage may make {{this research}} of interest to other digital-media performers and installation-designers...|$|R
40|$|Student {{volunteering}} {{is growing}} in the UK and elsewhere, {{and there is an}} ongoing debate about whether it is really “self-evidently a ‘good thing’” or whether there is a greater need for reflection of whether this is true (Holdsworth and Quinn, 2010). This paper presents a personal reflection of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) volunteering as a potential route to increasing Computing student’s employability. This paper looks at an approach at the University of Northampton that involves: - Linking but not combining a local STEM volunteering scheme to the National STEM Volunteers (STEMNet 2015) - Creation of a <b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group that has representation across all parts of the university. Three brief case studies of computing student volunteers at different stages will be presented and end with a personal reflection based on observations over a ten year period...|$|R
40|$|The University of Northampton {{has long}} {{provided}} STEM inreach and outreach opportunities for community groups, schools, FE and HE institutions. In addition to National STEM Ambassador recognition, the University coordinates its own STEM Champions programme, ensuring STEM activities are championed across the University. This, {{combined with an}} inter-disciplinary <b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group, provides staff and students with a dedicated programme of STEM training and events. This year, an innovative student Team Leader scheme was introduced to provide further support and leadership to STEM programme delivery. This paper will showcase the positive outcomes of empowering students as partners within these STEM initiatives. This paper will reflect on an innovative STEM Team Leader pilot initiative which was introduced last year at The University of Northampton. Northampton has over a decade of experience in providing STEM inreach and outreach opportunities for community groups, schools, FE and HE institutions. As an Ashoka U Changemaker Campus, Northampton is dedicated to University-wide efforts which engage students as agents of innovation and social change. The University’s STEM approach includes a cross-university <b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group and a STEM Champions programme of dedicated training and events for staff and students. This ensures STEM representation across the university and that STEM activities are accessible to the local community. Student STEM Team Leaders are discipline-specific and, with the guidance of staff Senior Team Leaders, provide support and leadership to programme delivery. This creates a valuable STEM Champion support network, while empowering students as partners within STEM outreach. This work addresses not only the need for student representation and leadership in STEM outreach, but also the value that this initiative has on raising science aspirations, programme coordination and enhancing student employability. Student STEM Team Leaders are best placed to recruit Champions to the programme and identify, with support, current science themes and training needs. The leadership, project delivery, communication and motivational skills obtained by Team Leaders orient them for success beyond the acquisition of knowledge from their degree. Many Team Leaders have suggested that this experience will be directly relevant to their work once leaving university and identify more strongly with the University in doing so. Those interested in this paper presentation will be looking to enhance student employability and involve student representation in STEM outreach. This presentation will engage delegates by including insights from the student voice and feedback from students and staff involved. Educators and support staff within any discipline {{may be interested in}} this work. As well as reflecting on the value and positive enhancements of this scheme for students, staff and local communities, challenges faced {{during the first year of}} the Team Leader pilot scheme will also be outlined. Recommendations for future approaches will be provided, alongside practical implications for including empowering students in STEM outreach. The paper presentation will focus on the following areas: 1. 	The University of Northampton’s STEM Approach •	Northampton’s Changemaker Ethos •	<b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group and the value of STEM Activities •	STEM Champions and programme delivery 2. 	The STEM Team Leader pilot scheme •	The need for student representation •	Team Leader roles and responsibilities •	Challenges related to recruitment, engagement and communication 3. 	Conclusions and implications for practice •	Empowering students in STEM outreach •	Student employability •	Implications for practice Key messages: 1. 	In order to form a valuable staff-student network and champion STEM activities across disciplines, HEA STEM provision must involve discipline-specific student representation. 2. 	STEM Team Leader initiatives empower students as partners in STEM outreach, with positive outcomes for students, staff and participants. 3. 	This work enhances student employability, STEM Champion recruitment and STEM project delivery, while helping to further raise the science aspirations of young people within the local community...|$|R
40|$|For over a decade, University of Northampton {{staff and}} {{students}} have delivered successful STEM outreach activities, master classes and co-working opportunities to learners {{in schools and}} FE colleges. In addition, the University works with the local STEMNET contract holder to gain national recognition for staff and students STEM Ambassadors and recognises STEM Ambassadors through awards (staff and student) {{as part of its}} annual celebration of volunteer achievement. Both developments derive from a culture of empowering students as partners and enhancing the student journey. The University has developed a co-ordinated programme of training and events to empower students and staff to engage with school and community outreach. A cross-University <b>STEM</b> <b>Steering</b> Group (SSG) which features both management and grass roots-level representation from the across the University (Science and Technology, Health, Education, the Arts and its Centre for Employability and Engagement) manages the activities, including recruiting representation from the student body. As such, SSG is uniquely well-placed to champion STEM activities across the University and to make these available to the wider community. Local schools are able to access inspirational science activities, whilst University students gain employability-related skills in leadership, communication, project-delivery and self-motivation and staff gain valuable CPD. Students also identify more strongly with the University. The total package {{plays a major role in}} contributing to University aspirations in widening participation and is hugely popular with participants. This paper will outline the project and will showcase the positive enhancements which it offers to University of Northampton students and school participants...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{development}} of the kidney has been extensively studied both {{as a model for}} epithelial-mesenchymal interaction in organogenesis and to gain understanding of the origins of congenital kidney disease. More recently, the possibility of <b>steering</b> naïve embryonic <b>stem</b> cells toward nephrogenic fates has been explored in the emerging field of regenerative medicine. Genetic studies in the mouse have identified several pathways required for kidney development, and a global catalog of gene transcription in the organ has recently been generated [URL] providing numerous candidate regulators of essential developmental functions. Organogenesis of the rodent kidney can be studied in organ culture, and many reports have used this approach to analyze outcomes of either applying candidate proteins or knocking down the expression of candidate genes using siRNA or morpholinos. However, the applicability of organ culture to the study of signaling that regulates stem/progenitor cell differentiation versus renewal in the developing kidney is limited as cultured organs contain a compact extracellular matrix limiting diffusion of macromolecules and virus particles. To study the cell signaling events that influence the stem/progenitor cell niche in the kidney we have developed a primary cell system that establishes the nephrogenic zone or progenitor cell niche of the developing kidney ex vivo in isolation from the epithelial inducer of differentiation. Using limited enzymatic digestion, nephrogenic zone cells can be selectively liberated from developing kidneys at E 17. 5. Following filtration, these cells can be cultured as an irregular monolayer using optimized conditions. Marker gene analysis demonstrates that these cultures contain a distribution of cell types characteristic of the nephrogenic zone in vivo, and that they maintain appropriate marker gene expression during the culture period. These cells are highly accessible to small molecule and recombinant protein treatment, and importantly also to viral transduction, which greatly facilitates the study of candidate stem/progenitor cell regulator effects. Basic cell biological parameters such as proliferation and cell death as well as changes in expression of molecular markers characteristic of nephron stem/progenitor cells in vivo can be successfully used as experimental outcomes. Ongoing work in our laboratory using this novel primary cell technique aims to uncover basic mechanisms governing the regulation of self-renewal versus differentiation in nephron stem/progenitor cells...|$|R
5000|$|Hescheler {{has been}} working with {{embryonic}} stem cells ever since the late 1980s. Beginning with studies on cellular signal transduction, and starting with works on signalling pathways in different cells (g-protein phosphorylation, electrophysiology of channels) he focussed on embryonic stem cells and has since defined many important basic aspects of both fundamental research and clinical applications. He was the first scientist worldwide to perform electrophysiological and functional experiments on stem cells and differentiated phenotypes thereof. He achieved a first functional characterization of cardiomyocytes developed from embryonic stem cells which is an important prerequisite for their subsequent use in regenerative medicine. He thus pioneered the establishment of stem cell research for application in transplantation medicine. In 2002, he was among the first scientists in Germany to obtain permission to work with human embryonic stem cells. In his current position, as Chairman and Director to the Institute for Neurophysiology at the University of Cologne, his research areas include work on embryonic and adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and germline pluripotent stem cells. Among progressing the use of stem cells for translational purposes, aiming at tapping the potential of stem cell biology towards clinical application, Hescheler actively promotes the vision of EPAA through innovative alternative testing strategies, applying stem cells towards toxicity testing. Apart from the rationale of promoting 3R principles it is his goal that coordinating a multidisciplinary research effort undertaken by various projects and consortia led by Hescheler will generate pathway- and evidence-based understanding of long-term toxic effects, thus moving toxicology from a rather descriptive science towards a more mechanistic-driven predictive one. [...] Hescheler has been appointed coordinator of various European Consortia such as FunGenES, CRYSTAL, and more recently ESNATS and DETECTIVE. He is also coordinator of the BMBF consortium “iPS and adult bone marrow cells for cardiac repair”. In 2004 he founded and since chaired the German Society of Stem Cell Research (GSZ). He is {{an active member of the}} Scientific Panel of the AXLR8 Consortium and a member of <b>steering</b> committee of <b>Stem</b> Cell Network North Rhine Westphalia.|$|R
