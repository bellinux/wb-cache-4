5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} 35 million Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. In 2011, nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Less than one percent of Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an indigenous language. About half this number (129,865) reported using an indigenous language on a daily basis. Additionally, Canadians speak several sign languages; the number of speakers is unknown of the most spoken ones, American <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (ASL) and Quebec <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (LSQ), as it is of Maritime <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> and Plains Sign Talk. There are only 47 speakers of the Inuit <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> Inuiuuk.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Canada {{is home to}} many sign languages, some {{of which}} are Indigenous. American <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (ASL) is spoken across the country due to the {{prevalence}} of ASL in primary and secondary schools. Due to its historical relation to the francophone culture, Quebec <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (LSQ) is spoken primarily in Quebec, although there are sizeable Francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba.|$|E

40|$|Although sign language-using {{communities}} {{exist in}} all areas of the world, few <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> have been documented in detail. <b>Sign</b> <b>languages</b> occur in a variety of sociocultural contexts, ranging from <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> used in closed village communities to officially recognized national <b>sign</b> <b>languages.</b> They may be grouped into language families on historical grounds or may participate in various language contact situations.

40|$|<b>Sign</b> <b>{{languages}}</b> (alternatively, <b>signed</b> <b>languages)</b> {{are human}} languages whose forms consist of sequences of movements and configurations {{of the hands}} and arms, face, and upper torso. Typically, <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> are perceived through the visual mode. <b>Sign</b> <b>languages</b> thus contrast, of course, with spoken languages, whose forms consist of sounds produced by sequences of movements and configurations of the mouth and vocal tract. More informally, then, <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> are visual-gestural languages, whereas spoken languages are auditory-vocal languages. Most linguistic {{research has focused on}} spoken languages. Indeed, for many years all human languages were mistakenly believed to be spoken languages; <b>signed</b> <b>languages</b> (for example, those used by deaf people interacting with one another) were thought either to be pantomime or to be simple gestural codes representing the surrounding spoken language. However, recent linguistic work has shown these beliefs to be incorrect: natural <b>signed</b> <b>languages</b> show all the structural properties of other human languages yet have evolved independently of the spoken languages that surround them. <b>Signed</b> <b>languages</b> typically appear as the primary communication systems of people for whom the use of spoken languages is blocked, either by deafness or muteness.

5|$|American <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (ASL) is {{a natural}} {{language}} {{that serves as the}} predominant <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.|$|E

The divergence from ASL was influenced {{largely by the}} segregation of schools in the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the birth}} of ASL, <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> had been used by various {{communities}} in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation. As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Plains Indians had developed a <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> to communicate between tribes of different languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest group}} of {{students}} during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them. There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village <b>sign</b> <b>language.</b> Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French <b>Sign</b> <b>Language</b> (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From this situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.|$|E

The use and structure of two types of systems - tactile <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> and secondary <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> - will be explored in more detail. On the other hand, an effort will be made to situate natural <b>sign</b> <b>languages</b> within typological classifications originally proposed for spoken languages.

On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages.

5|$|As deaf {{education}} and <b>sign</b> <b>language</b> research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American <b>Sign</b> <b>Language,</b> ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
