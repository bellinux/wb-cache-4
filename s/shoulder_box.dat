This flexibility allows the agent to explore a variety of gaits, including the standard forward and reverse {{as well as a}} crab-like sidle to the left and right. Further gait variation could be achieved with experimentation. Platform The original ROUS platform was of a design not tried before in the three previous four-legged walkers built in the Machine Intelligence Lab. Instead of a two-layer X-shaped frame in which the <b>shoulder</b> <b>boxes</b> are sandwiched between the top and bottom layers, this original design was a single layer on which were mounted the circuit boards and z-axis servos.

In addition to trucks, the company used push carts, bicycles, <b>shoulder</b> <b>boxes,</b> {{and even a}} boat. At most branches, the season was six months, April through September.

50|$|Without Haile Gebreselassie, Paul Tergat {{would have}} won {{everything}} since the previous Olympics. He was the silver medalist in the previous Olympics and the ensuing two world championships. He was the World Cross Country Champion five {{times in a row}} in Gebreselassie's absence. The final broke down to a team race, with three Kenyans vs Ethiopians Gebreselassie and Assefa Mezgebu. With a lap to go, John Korir held the lead marked by Gebreselassie, with Tergat marking him. Mezgebu moved from behind Tergat to Gebreselassie's <b>shoulder,</b> <b>boxing</b> Tergat along the rail through the penultimate turn. Down the backstretch, Tergat slowed down a step {{to get out of the}} box, then sprinting around the outside, past everyone. The sprint was on. Unlike previous finals, Tergat had the drop on Gebreselassie, making him chase, with only Mezgebu able to hold on behind. Down the homestretch both were in full sprint, Tergat ahead, Gebreselassie making microscopic progress but not advancing enough to pass. Gebreselassie continued to press, drawing even with less than ten metres to go. Tergat strained, his last several steps losing his balance while Gebreselassie held form to take the gold again.|$|R

Benjy sometimes followed Alf--more frequently Leo, and always carried his father's double-barrelled shot-gun. He preferred that, because his powers with the rifle were not yet developed. Sometimes he went with Toolooha, or Tekkona, or Oblooria, in one of the native oomiaks to fish. At other times he practised paddling in the native kayak, so that he might accompany Chingatok on his excursions to the neighbouring islands after seals and wild-fowl.|$|R
60|$|The {{end of it}} {{was they}} took up their loads again and marched, while behind them walked the terrible and {{gigantic}} Jeekie, the barrels of the shotgun which he carried at full cock and occasionally used to prod them, pointing directly at their backs.

When Alan remonstrated with him as to the cork mattress, suggesting that it should be thrown away as too hot to wear, Jeekie replied that he had been cold for thirty years, and wished to get warm again. Guessing that his real reason for declining to part with the article, was that his master should have something to lie on, other than the damp ground, Alan said no more at the time, which, as will be seen, was fortunate enough for Jeekie.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the boat}} grounded, and the Kafirs crowded round her, {{up to their}} waists {{sometimes}} in the water, and sometimes up to the arm-pits, when a bigger wave than usual came roaring in. The boat itself was so large that, as they stood beside it, their heads barely rose to a level with the gunwale. The boatmen at once began to heave and roll the goods over the side. The Kafirs received them on their heads or shoulders, according to the shape or size of each package--and they refused nothing. If a bale or a box chanced to be too heavy for one man, a comrade lent assistance; if it proved still too heavy, a third added his head or <b>shoulder,</b> and the <b>box</b> or bale was borne off.|$|R
60|$|At {{a little}} before seven Adam stole softly {{out of the house}} and took the back-way to the rear of Diana's Grove.

He waited, perfectly still, and at last saw a gleam of white passing soundlessly through the undergrowth. He was not surprised when he recognised the colour of Lady Arabella's dress. She came close and waited, with her face to the iron door. From some place of concealment near at hand Oolanga appeared, and came close to her. Adam noticed, with surprised amusement, that over his <b>shoulder</b> was the <b>box</b> with the mongoose. Of course the African did not know that he was seen by anyone, least of all by the man whose property he had with him.|$|R
40|$|The typical {{suburban}} {{home is a}} "decorated box. " It is a prosaic rectangular mass "enhanced" by projected forms. The boxes within a typical suburban residential neighborhood line up along the streetfronts like soldiers standing shoulder to <b>shoulder.</b> These <b>boxes</b> remain in this configuration despite the many unique family types that make up these porchless communities. It is only when these families are economically capable, {{that they are able}} to take an interest in the way they are housed. This interest is typically manifested in the hiring of an architect to design a home that suits their individual family dynamics. It is often the architect that provides the homeowner with knowledge regarding sensibilities such as daylighting, capturing breezes and framing views. The architect empowers the homeowner by providing them with choice. As an experienced designer, the architect is able to provide the homeowner with a system or dialogue to direct the evolution of the design. It is the architect that asks the many questions that drive such things as square footages, materials, siting and adjacencies. This project explores the potential of a system that would bring a high level of design choices to the typical homeowner. This system was derived by reinterpreting the zones within the decorated boxes, both private and public. Reinterpreted as independent pavilions rather than an assortment of individual rooms arranged within a rigid box, an enhanced level of variability can be achieved. The "pavilion village" arrangement offers many opportunities to incorporate the design sensibilities that typical {{suburban home}}s are lacking. Most importantly, the homeowner is able to make choices regarding these sensibilites throughtout the process. This project tests this system with the design of two homes for two unique family types. The resulting designs of these two homes stemmed from the homeowner's decisions within this system. College of Architecture and PlanningTitle on CD-ROM: Variation through standardization. Thesis (B.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} surface height and load weight on upper limb movements and electromyographic (EMG) recordings during manual handling performed by both experienced and inexperienced lifter subjects. METHODS: Sixteen experienced and sixteen inexperienced lifters handled a box (both 7 and 15 kg) from an intermediate height (waist level) to either a high or low surface. Electromyography and video images were recorded during the tasks. The 10 th, 50 th and 90 th percentiles were calculated for the deltoid and biceps muscles, shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, and elbow flexion movements. Groups, right/left sides, weights and heights were compared. There were no differences between either groups or sides. RESULTS: Weight and height variations affected EMG and posture, although weight had more impact on EMG. Shoulder abduction and flexion movements higher than 60 º occurred, particularly for the higher surface. Shoulder flexion was also higher when the box {{was moved to the}} low height. This study provides new evidence as <b>shoulder</b> postures during <b>boxes</b> handling on low surfaces had not previously been evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The high demand of upper limb in manual material handling tasks is clear, particularly for the shoulder. This knowledge can be used by physical therapists to plan better rehabilitation programs for manual material handling-related disorders, particularly focusing on return to work...|$|R
5000|$|Officially {{known as}} the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit, this armor was created {{initially}} by Stark {{to deal with the}} Masters of Silence threat by using a [...] "respond in kind" [...] philosophy and strategy. It was designed for all-out warfare and was Stark's experiment with laser guided munitions and ballistic weaponry. Since the Masters of Silence were protected against Iron Man's usual weaponry of repulsors and unibeam, those weapons were removed from the Mark I model. The armor included several response devices such as a shoulder mounted electric minigun, <b>shoulder</b> mounted missile <b>box</b> launcher, and wrist mounted gaunlet cannons with additional weaponry such as a laser blade and flamethrower. It was not collapsible, and included far heavier carbon-composite-based armor as well as improved tactical computer systems and automatic targeting. A later version, Mark II Model JRXL-1000, was designed and built for James Rhodes, which became a full-fledged superhero identity for him as War Machine. In Mark I model, both the double-barreled cannon and the plasma blade were fixed with the flamethrower built over the plasma blade casing. In Rhodes' Mark II model, the wrist weapons became modular and the armor also included repulsor and unibeam technology. In both iterations, the shoulder mounted weapons are modular and can be removed and replaced. All further incarnations of the armor were used by Rhodes.|$|R
6000|$|The sisters dined {{together}} alone, {{without any}} question of Lionel, and on alighting at Covent Garden found Mr. Wendover awaiting {{them in the}} portico. His box proved commodious and comfortable, and Selina was gracious to him: she thanked him for his consideration in not stuffing it full of people. He assured her that he expected but one other inmate--a gentleman of a shrinking disposition, who would take up no room. The gentleman came in after the first act; he {{was introduced to the}} ladies as Mr. Booker, of Baltimore. He knew {{a great deal about the}} young lady they had come to listen to, and he was not so shrinking but that he attempted to impart a portion of his knowledge even while she was singing. Before the second act was over Laura perceived Lady Ringrose in a box on the other side of the house, accompanied by a lady unknown to her. There was apparently another person in the box, behind the two ladies, whom they turned round from time to time to talk with. Laura made no observation about Lady Ringrose to her sister, and she noticed that Selina never resorted to the glass to look at her. That Mrs. Berrington had not failed to see her, however, was proved by the fact that at the end of the second act (the opera was Meyerbeer's Huguenots) she suddenly said, turning to Mr. Wendover: 'I hope you won't mind very much if I go for a short time to sit with a friend on the other side of the house.' She smiled with all her sweetness as she announced this intention, and had the benefit of the fact that an apologetic expression is highly becoming to a pretty woman. But she abstained from looking at her sister, and the latter, after a wondering glance at her, looked at Mr. Wendover. She saw that he was disappointed--even slightly wounded: he had taken some trouble to get his box and it had been no small pleasure to him to see it graced by the presence of a celebrated beauty. Now his situation collapsed if the celebrated beauty were going to transfer her light to another quarter. Laura was unable to imagine what had come into her sister's head--to make her so inconsiderate, so rude. Selina tried to perform her act of defection in a soothing, conciliating way, so far as appealing eyebeams went; but she gave no particular reason for her escapade, withheld the name of the friends in question and betrayed no consciousness that it was not usual for ladies to roam about the lobbies. Laura asked her no question, but she said to her, after an hesitation: 'You won't be long, surely. You know you oughtn't to leave me here.' Selina took no notice of this--excused herself in no way to the girl. Mr. Wendover only exclaimed, smiling in reference to Laura's last remark: 'Oh, so far as leaving you here goes----!' In spite of his great defect (and it was his only one, that she could see) of having only an ascending scale of seriousness, she judged him interestedly enough to feel a real pleasure in noticing that though he was annoyed at Selina's going away and not saying that she would come back soon, he conducted himself as a gentleman should, submitted respectfully, gallantly, to her wish. He suggested that her friends might perhaps, instead, be induced to come to his box, but when she had objected, 'Oh, you see, there are too many,' he put her shawl on her <b>shoulders,</b> opened the <b>box,</b> offered her his arm. While this was going on Laura saw Lady Ringrose studying them with her glass. Selina refused Mr. Wendover's arm; she said, 'Oh no, you stay with her--I daresay he'll take me:' and she gazed inspiringly at Mr. Booker. Selina never mentioned a name when the pronoun would do. Mr. Booker of course sprang to the service required and led her away, with an injunction from his friend to bring her back promptly. As they went off Laura heard Selina say to her companion--and she knew Mr. Wendover could also hear it--'Nothing would have induced me to leave her alone with you!' She thought this a very extraordinary speech--she thought it even vulgar; especially considering that she had never seen the young man till half an hour before and since then had not exchanged twenty words with him. It came to their ears so distinctly that Laura was moved to notice it by exclaiming, with a laugh: 'Poor Mr. Booker, what does she suppose I would do to him?' ...|$|R
