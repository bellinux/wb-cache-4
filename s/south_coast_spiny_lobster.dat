40|$|A one-year {{experimental}} fishery for P. delagoae {{was established}} in April 2004 to determine the frequency and magnitude at which pulse fishing may be sustainable (Government Gazette 2004). Determining the extent of recovery after fishing is one aim of the experimental fishery. Assessments of the growth rate, size at sex maturity and natural mortality of P. delagoae were performed in 2000 (Groeneveld et al) and can be supplemented {{by the results of}} this study, which assess the reproductive biology of the East <b>Coast</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> in order to address this aim. A recent study (Groeneveld in press) assessed fecundity, egg loss during gestation, relative reproductive potential and lifetime egg production per recruit for P. gilchristii from three areas along the <b>South</b> African <b>south</b> <b>coast.</b> A general east-west trend of increasing fecundity, size at sexual maturity, and lifetime egg production per recruit was found for P. gilchristii. Examining egg-loss through the first four (of six) developmental stages of gestation showed significant loss of around 15 % by stage four, irrespective of lobster size (Groeneveld in press). The study of fecundity in P. gilchristii (Groeneveld in press) was used as a framework for assessing the fecundity of P. delagoae in this study...|$|R

40|$|In Corsica (NW Mediterranean), most of {{the fishing}} {{activity}} is composed of small-scale artisanal fisheries, and takes place on the western <b>coast.</b> The common <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> (Palinurus elephas) is the main target of Corsican netters. However, its populations have been declining since the 1950 's, questioning the sustainability of this activity. We therefore tried to assess whether the fishing effort, currently mostly focused on common <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> could be moved towards other commercially-interesting deep crustaceans, such as the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), through diversification of artisanal fishing practices. With the help of local fishermen, we set up Scottish traps for Norway lobsters at depths of 300 to 400 meters, on sandy and muddy bottoms of both eastern and western coasts. Despite several tests using different baits and soak times at various depths or seasons, catches on the western coast were low. On the other hand, on the eastern coast, experimentation showed interesting yields, and large mean size (i. e. high commercial value) for both sexes. While more {{studies are needed to}} confirm these results and improve knowledge of Norway lobster stocks, trap fishing of this species on eastern coast of Corsica could be a suitable alternative for diversification of artisanal fisheries...|$|R

25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat.

These lines {{may be more than}} 50 <b>lobsters</b> long. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae.

In response to an approaching predator, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> including the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument.

40|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> feed on a {{wide range}} of natural marine food. They prey nocturnally upon a diverse {{assemblage}} of epifaunal and infaunal organisms including molluscs (such as snails and clams), smaller crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes and algae (Lipicius and Cobb, 1994). Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994). Tropical <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have several amenable characteristics which make them suitable for aquaculture. Tropical lobsters are adaptable to captive conditions, less cannibalistic and relatively fast growing than their counterparts in the sub-tropical and temperate regions (Anon., 1994). The greatest hurdle in growing <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is the difficulty in larval rearing and hence the culture of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> is still not commercially taken up in spite of significant advances made in recent years.

40|$|Abstract. A complex {{nervous system}} enables <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{to have a}} rich {{behavioural}} repertoire. The present paper discusses {{the ways in which}} the sensory systems of the Caribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus argus, particularly its chemosensory systems, are involved in feeding behaviour. It addresses the neural mechanisms of three aspects of their food-finding ability: detection, identification, and discrimination of natural food odours; the effect of learning on responses to food odours; the mechanisms by which <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> orient to odours from a distance under natural flow conditions. It demonstrates that the olfactory organ of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> might use acrossneuron response patterns in discriminating odour quality; that the hedonic value of food can be modified by experience, including associative and nonassociative conditioning; that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can readily orient to distant odour sources; and that both chemo- and mechanosensory antennular input are important in this behaviour. Either aesthetasc or nonaesthetasc chemosensory pathways can be used in identifying odour quality, mediating learned behaviours, and permitting orientation to the source of distant odours.
