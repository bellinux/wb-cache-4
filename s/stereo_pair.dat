5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured <b>stereo</b> <b>pair</b> would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
25|$|DJ {{software}} requires specialized hardware {{in addition}} to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular sound card integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one <b>stereo</b> <b>pair).</b> However, DJs {{need to be able to}} output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.|$|E
25|$|Compact Cassettes contain two {{miniature}} spools, between {{which the}} magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell. Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks {{are available on}} the tape; one <b>stereo</b> <b>pair</b> or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette, or by the machine automatically changing the direction of tape movement ("auto-reverse") when it detects that the tape has come to an end.|$|E
40|$|Stereoscopic {{visualization}} {{is seldom}} used in Astrophysical publications and presentations {{compared to other}} scientific fields, e. g., Biochemistry, {{where it has been}} recognized as a valuable tool for decades. We put forth the view that <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> can be a useful tool for the Astrophysics community in communicating a truer representation of astrophysical data. Here, we review the main theoretical aspects of stereoscopy, and present a tutorial to easily create <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> using Python. We then describe how <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> provide a way to incorporate 3 D data in 2 D publications of standard journals. We illustrate the use of <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> with one conceptual and two Astrophysical science examples: an integral field spectroscopy study of a supernova remnant, and numerical simulations of a relativistic AGN jet. We also use these examples {{to make the case that}} <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> are not merely an ostentatious way to present data, but an enhancement in the communication of scientific results in publications because they provide the reader with a realistic view of multi-dimensional data, be it of observational or theoretical nature. In recognition of the ongoing 3 D expansion in the commercial sector, we advocate an increased use of <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> in Astrophysics publications and presentations as a first step towards new interactive and multi-dimensional publication methods.

The availability of the large number of <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> also reduces matching ambiguities, even for objects with low texture.

40|$|By the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) nearly {{worldwide}} digital height {{models have}} been generated. The SRTM height models {{can be used for}} several applications, but it has gaps in mountainous regions, caused by the radar layover, and is not so accurate in steep areas. In addition the grid width of 3 arcsec, corresponding to approximately 92 m at the equator, is limiting the morphologic details. From the very high resolution optical space sensors {{only a limited number of}} <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs,</b> taken from the same orbit, are available. The automatic matching of images taken with significant time interval is very difficult and not leading to satisfying results. In addition <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> from IKONOS, QuickBird and the former OrbView- 3 are expensive. The <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> from the SPOT HRS only have been available for test purposes, usually only the derived height models can be bought, but they may be critical in forest areas (Büyüksalih, Jacobsen 2008). As alternative solution the stereo sensors Cartosat- 1 and ALOS/PRISM are now available; both systems with 2. 5 m ground sampling distance (GSD). Cartosat- 1 <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> have been used for automatic image matching, leading even in forest areas to good results. Of course by matching as well as with the SRTM C-band and X-band digital surface models (DSMs) are generated, representing the visible surface. In most cases digital elevation models (DEMs) are requested, showing the height of the bare ground. DSMs can be filtered to DEMs if enough points of the bare ground are available.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{evaluate}} a novel automated segmentation algorithm for cup-to-disc segmentation from stereo color photographs {{of patients with}} glaucoma for the measurement of glaucoma progression. METHODS. Stereo color photographs of the optic disc were obtained by using a fixed stereo-base fundus camera in 58 eyes of 58 patients with suspected or open-angle glaucoma. Manual planimetry was performed by three glaucoma faculty members to delineate a reference standard rim and cup segmentation of all <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> and by three glaucoma fellows as well. Pixel feature classification was evaluated on the <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs</b> and corresponding reference standard, by using feature computation based on simulation of photoreceptor color opponency and visual cortex simple and complex cells. An optimal subset of 12 features was used to segment all pixels in all <b>stereo</b> <b>pairs,</b> {{and the percentage of}} pixels assigned the correct class and linear cup-to-disc ratio (LCDR) estimates of the glaucoma fellows and the algorithm were compared to the reference standard.
