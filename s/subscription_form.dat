For scenarios with reasonable traffic mixes and performance requirements, capacity gains of 20 %- 30 % appear very well possible...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent this type of bombing, most email {{subscription}} services send a confirmation email to a person's inbox when that email is used to register for a subscription. However, even the confirmation emails contribute to the attack. A better defense would prevent Web sites from being exploited without abandoning subscription forms. After a <b>subscription</b> <b>form</b> is filled out, the Web site would dynamically create a mailto link to itself. A legitimate user would then {{send a message to}} validate the request without receiving any email from the Web site. While the sender's email could be spoofed, the sender's SMTP IP address cannot. The list manager can therefore verify that the email in the form request matches the originating SMTP server in the validation message.|$|E
50|$|Sister Namibia Magazine {{has been}} {{published}} multiple times a year since 1989 in three languages: English, Afrikaans, and Oshiwambo. The magazine is used to “raise awareness among women, men and young people {{of the ways in}} which political, social, cultural, legal and economic systems of power control girls and women.” It includes profiles of influential women along with op-ed articles, reviews from books included in their resource center, and informational articles detailing topics such as violence against women, women in Namibian government, and women’s health issues. The magazine is distributed quarterly throughout Namibia. A <b>subscription</b> <b>form</b> is available on their website for international orders. An archive of editions dating back to the first one, published July 1989, is available on their website as well. Sister Namibia’s aim with the magazine is to bring focus to issues Namibian women face. They also want women to be able to express themselves through written and art pieces, be aware of issues like xenophobia and economic exploitation, and to challenge oppression through education.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is very prevalent in Kenya-mobile phone penetration is at 88 % and mobile data <b>subscriptions</b> <b>form</b> 99 % of all internet subscriptions. While {{there is great}} potential for such ubiquitous technology to revolutionise access and quality of healthcare in low-resource settings, {{there have been few}} successes at scale. Implementations of electronic health (e-Health) and mobile health (m-Health) technologies in countries like Kenya are yet to tackle human resource constraints or the political, ethical and financial considerations of such technologies. We outline recent innovations that could improve access and quality while considering the costs of healthcare. One is an attempt to create a scalable clinical decision support system by engaging a global network of specialist doctors and reversing some of the damaging effects of medical brain drain. The other efficiently extracts digital information from paper-based records using low-cost and locally produced tools such as rubber stamps to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines. By bringing down the costs of remote consultations and clinical audit, respectively, these projects offer the potential for clinics in resource-limited settings to deliver high-quality care. This paper makes a case for continued and increased investment in social enterprises that bridge academia, public and private sectors to deliver sustainable and scalable e-Health and m-Health solutions...|$|R

In this paper we quantify the attainable performance and/or capacity gains from introducing different forms of QoS differentiation in an HSDPA network, considering distinct scenarios of subscription- and/or service-based differentiation. For the case of weight-based QoS differentiation, we demonstrate how the significance of the achievable performance impact and capacity gains depends on the applied differentiation weights, the traffic characteristics, the service mix and the class-specific performance requirements. For scenarios with reasonable traffic mixes and performance requirements, capacity gains of about 20 % appear very well possible. For the investigated minimum bit rate-based QoS differentiation scheme, we demonstrate an inherent trade-off between giving high-priority data users preferred access to the shared transport channel, while as a consequence reducing the spectral efficiency of the channel by granting prioritised users access even at times when their channel conditions are unfavourable. Achievable performance gains were primarily observed at cell traffic loads exceeding the 'dimensioning load', although for some scenarios capacity gains of up to 8. 6 % were found, compared to a case without QoS differentiation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
