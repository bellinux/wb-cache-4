50|$|The 1st Proletarian Brigade and {{the other}} {{partisan}} units were holding the Klis-Sinj line against the enemy.

A great number of volunteers from Split joined the partisans and they were able to cover the loss in numbers. The 1st Proleter brigade managed to repeal the German reinforcements in Imotski but the enemy kept reinforcing even more. The partisans saw a chance of conquering the larger <b>Split</b> <b>area</b> and repealing the Germans from it. The partisan units launched an offensive on Dicmo and Sinj but they all failed.

The agreement did not include evacuation of the Yugoslav Navy from its bases on the islands of Vis and Lastovo.

Though the record is a short one in a single line, it throws valuable light on various aspects of South Indian history. The inscription clears the doubt about the identity of the Satyaputras, a dynasty of rulers, mentioned in Ashoka's inscriptions in the 3rd century. Opposite to this cavern, another cave with four Jain stone beds have been found which confirms that Jambai was a Jain centre. West of this hillock in a small stone boulder, a 10th-century C.E.

40|$|International audienceMany {{techniques}} are described to treat Chiari type I malformation. One {{of them is}} a splitting of the dura, removing its outer layer only to reduce the risks of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. We try to show the effectiveness of this technique from histological and biomechanical observations of dura mater. Study was performed on 25 posterior fossa dura mater specimens from fresh human cadavers. Dural composition and architecture was assessed on 47 transversal and sagittal sections. Uniaxial mechanical tests were performed on 22 dural samples (15 entire, 7 split) to focus on the dural macroscopic mechanical behavior comparing entire and split samples and also to understand deformation mechanisms. We finally created a model of volume expansion after splitting. Dura mater was composed of predominant collagen fibers with a few elastin fibers, cranio-caudally orientated. The classical description of two distinct layers remained inconstant. Biomechanical tests showed a significant difference between entire dura, which presents an elastic fragile behavior, with a small domain where deformation is reversible with stress, and split dura, which presents an elasto-plastic behavior with a large domain of permanent strain and a lower stress level. From these experimental results, the model showed a volume increase of approximately 50 % below the <b>split</b> <b>area.</b> We demonstrated the capability of the split dura mater to enlarge for suitable stress conditions and we quantified it by biomechanical tests and experimental model. Thus, dural splitting decompression seems to have a real biomechanical substrate to envision the efficacy of this Chiari type I malformation surgical technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} lithotypes of the Eocene flysch in the Croatian coast belt are breccias, conglomerates, (bio) calcirudites, (bio) calcarenites, sandstones, siltstones, shales and marls. Olistolithes {{also can be}} {{constitutive}} part of Eocene flysch. On the surface they can be mapped only in wider <b>Split</b> <b>area.</b> The mechanical weathering of the flysch rock mass is dominant {{in regard to the}} chemical weathering which is almost irrelevant for practical purposes. Mechanical weathering is caused by tectonic activities, and by repeated drying and wetting. It takes place in the engineering time, and not geological, which dictates the method of excavation, protection of slopes and construction pits in flysch rock masses. The quantity of the eroded material can extend 20000 m 3 /km 2 /yr. Most subject to erosion are lithotypes which are dominantly made of clast varying in size from silt to clay. The Slani Potok catchment in the Vinodol Valley mainly consists of Eocene flysch sediments. Its feature is that it represents the so far only known location in the External Dinarides in Croatia where the chemical weathering prevails in relation to mechanical, and that is caused by crystallization of the mineral tenardite. The precise determination of the weathering zone thickness of flysch, as well as other rock mass types is of great significance in geotechnical engineering. The weathering zone is mostly determined in four following ways: visually on the outcrop, by core mapping, analyzing the speed of primary seismic waves and analyzing the resistivity (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this review}} {{traditional}} Croatian cheeses {{were described as}} well as their importance considering globalization and industrialization in food production. The most important property of traditional cheeses is their originality and origin of milk that is incorporated in those products. As the high profitability (high price) of the products is very important it is necessary to conduct one of possible protections on European level. In that sense, hard cheeses from Adriatic and Dinara areas have significant potential {{due to the fact that}} high value raw material - sheep milk produced from breed with very extensively management using natural pasture with characteristic botanical composition consisting aromatic Mediteranean plants, is used in their production. This milk is characterized with high percentage of some chemical components, especially fat and protein. Considering that fact, this milk represents the best material especially for hard cheese production. In this paper the review of milk chemical composition of the most important Croatian sheep breeds which milk is used for production of hard cheeses, was performed. The review of basic technological parameters in production of hard traditional cheeses considering type, standardization and heat treatment of milk, renneting, curd cutting and drying, dimension, salting and ripening is represented. Characterization parameters of cheese, considering chemical and physical composition, biochemical changes, dominant microflora which dominates in technological production procedure and determines taste and odour of mature cheese, are shown.
