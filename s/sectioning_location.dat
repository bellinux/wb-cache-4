For these analyses potential slip surfaces passing through the gypsum material and underlying native foundation soils are considered. METHOD OF ANALYSIS Static Stability Analysis Slope stability analyses were perfonmed using the simplified Bishop method Bishop 1955 for the circular search method for potential slip surfaces and the Spencer method Spencer 19731 for block surfaces as implemented in the computer program SLIDE 20031.

The history associated with fault occurred in power system can be effectively used as a strong database. This database will act as the trainer to the fuzzy expert system. A rich history of faulty area will enhance {{the performance of the}} fuzzy fault identification system. Fault <b>section</b> <b>location</b> aims to identify the faulty area in the power system using the post fault status of protective relays and circuit breakers and diagnose the cause of a fault that has occurred. Restoration cost can be significantly reduced by accurately identifying a fault location and its cause, which also reduces the restoration time of the faulty section.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{protection}} method for single line-to-ground (SLG) faults in ungrounded low-inertia microgrids. The proposed method includes microgrid interface protection and unit protection. The microgrid interface protection {{is based on}} the difference between the zero-sequence voltage angle and the zero-sequence current angle at the microgrid interconnection transformer for fast selection of the faulty feeder. The microgrid unit protection is based on a comparison of the three zero-sequence current phase directions at each junction point of load or distributed energy resources. Methods are also included to locate the minimum fault section. The fault <b>section</b> <b>location</b> technology operates according to the coordination of microgrid unit protection. The proposed method responds to SLG faults that may occur in both the grid and the microgrid.

40|$|Abstract—Fault <b>section</b> <b>location</b> is a {{critical}} task when a severe disturbance {{is caused by a}} failure on a transmission line. In order to avoid further economic and social costs by load interruptions, intelligent systems have been successful in dealing with fault location problems. This paper presents a novel deterministic method to locate fault section on electrical power systems with the aim of assisting to command center operators to make decisions in cases of disturbances. The methodology proposed is based on the features of the electrical system, such as: state of relays and circuit breakers; impedance of transmission lines and transformers and adjustment of impedance relays. With the information provided by the expert system proposed, the operator has the advantage of making decisions more accurate in less time, based on information obtained from own electric system; unlike other methods already proposed, which were based on uncertainties and approximations.
