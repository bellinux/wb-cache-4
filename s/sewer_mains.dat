A total of 100 sewage treatment and disposal plants and 120 water pumping stations were completed; and more than 2,000 miles of main power lines and 535 miles of underground electrical cable placed, servicing a total connected electrical power load of over 80,700 horsepower.|$|E
2500|$|Infrastructure {{work now}} began in Marshall Heights. A city survey in 1949 found that just 30 {{percent of all}} homes in Marshall Heights had access to running water and the city sewer system. City {{engineers}} estimated in May 1950 {{that it would take}} $2 million to give the 500 homes in Marshall Heights water and sewer lines, and to grade and pave every street. But with an annual infrastructure budget of just $1 million a year for the entire city, they said improvements in Marshall Heights would take time. Nevertheless, the District agreed to spend $320,000 on water and <b>sewer</b> <b>mains,</b> and paving secondary streets, in 1950 alone. Paving of main streets, and adding sidewalks, curbs, and gutters was not planned, as this was not deemed urgent. By November, 30 homes on five blocks between E. 50th and E. 51st Streets had received water and <b>sewer</b> <b>mains.</b> Another $100,000 was spent on Marshall Heights infrastructure in 1952. By the end of 1952, 134 homes in Marshall Heights had water and sewer. But only 72 homeowners had actually hooked up to the system. City officials said the cost of a hookup, which ran from $1,000 to $1,500, and the $135 frontage fee were simply too high for most residents to afford. The city had the option of going to court to force residents to hookup and pay the frontage fee, but officials said this was useless because residents simply didn't have the income. Spending large amounts of money on Marshall Heights deeply angered some city officials. William H. Cary, Jr., director of the D.C. Bureau of Public Health Engineering, claimed, [...] "This will never be a place the District government will be proud of." [...] But work continued, and additional street grading and water and sewer lines were laid in 1957. [...] To counteract criticism that Marshall Heights residents didn't care about their neighborhood, the Marshall Heights Civic Association engaged in a two-month-long campaign to remove trash and weeds, sweep streets, improve empty lots, and generally eliminate blight from the neighborhood. The campaign won extensive media notice. The city spent a total of $700,000 on roads and water and sewer lines by the end of 1958.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, 120 {{prefabricated}} {{housing units}} had been hurriedly erected to provide accommodation {{for the work}} force. Rent was $15 for a furnished one-bedroom unit, $19 for a two-bedroom unit and $23 for a three-bedroom unit. Despite their temporary nature, these units were retained, and remained occupied until 1961. The influx of new employees called for more accommodation, and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which took over from the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947, spent $3.252 million on 380 sets of family quarters, streets, electricity, <b>sewers,</b> <b>mains</b> water, and a small school, which was named after Groves, that opened in 1948.|$|R

Improved techniques and facilities allowed the plant to triple its output in 1947. By 1949, the pilot plant employed over 700 people. The pilot plant helped design and equip and train workers for the new Burlington AEC Plant, which took over responsibility for manufacturing the explosive lenses. [...] The Salt Wells Pilot Plant was closed in 1954.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, Det Norske Veritas (DNV) {{was hired}} by the Norwegian {{authorities}} to develop technology to detect any remaining oil in the sunken German WW2 warship Blücher.

This discovery was the foundation of DNV's effort to develop a whole new inspection technology, based on ART (Acoustic Resonance Technology). John D. Breivoll had worked closely with DNV to inspect <b>sewer</b> <b>mains</b> since the 1980s. Since there were no good methods to inspect water mains in the same way as one can inspect <b>sewer</b> <b>mains,</b> John D. Breivoll saw the potential of the ART technology for the water sector, and while DNV primarily saw the use of the technology in oil related industries, John D. Breivoll started Breivoll Inspection Technologies AS with Arne Christian Vangdal in 1998 to license ART for the water sector.|$|E
