40|$|This public lecture {{introduces}} the key theoretical and aesthetic practices that have informed {{the creation of}} ‘we share some words’, a long, self-generating poem which folds together readings from the library at the Leeds College of Art. It is argued that reading can {{be a form of}} drifting (as a kind of library Dérive); or collecting and observing (likened to in-the-moment recording and drawing). The outcomes to this rule-based activity are defined as “poetic residua”, actualised as <b>stable</b> <b>books</b> and “eventualised” as a real-time digital projection. Within the randomness of the poem we strive to recognise meaning and pattern. This apophenia is a human desire which seeks the ghosts and fairies within the machine. BUT none are there. What remains are beautiful glitches - random events that reveal some of the inner nature of language...|$|R

40|$|Book Review - Transnational Psychiatries is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} to the serious <b>stable</b> of edited <b>book</b> collections about the diverse and connected worlds of psychiatry of the past. Waltraud Ernst and Thomas Mueller developed this book as a project, with the authors first holding an exciting symposium at Southampton in 2005, and then working with separate contributors to produce an interesting book which sets out to extend existing understandings of the histories of psychiatry in a comparative context. The {{use of the term}} ‘psychiatries’ is important here, because these contributions address a much broader set of concerns about the field of psychiatric treatment and the cross-fertilization of the psychiatric profession than many previous collections which mostly – but not exclusively – focus on institutionalization. Therefore, the book has much to offer colleagues and researchers in that it seeks to bring new perspectives to the established field, but it also contains impressive and richly researched single contributions...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{book that}} I like. So says its author in the {{foreword}} to this English edition, and the reviewer concurs. Indeed, the book is well-written, it is wellorganized, and it contains a beautiful development {{of the theory of}} <b>stable</b> groups. The <b>book</b> under review, an English translation of Poizat’s self-published Groupes Stables, retains a fresh perspective on a subject that has undergone substantial development since the publication of the French original {{a decade and a half}} ago. The mathematical ideology propounded in this book has been largely confirmed, even though some of the conjectures have been refuted. Poizat argues, sometimes explicitly, but generally through practice, that the theory of stable groups grows organically from the study of models and from the internal robustness of its own mathematical theory. This orientation is reflected in the organization of the book in that, with the exception of the first few sections of the first chapter which concerns easy consequences of the definition of a stable group, the theory is developed from the special to the general and the axiomatic approach is eschewed...|$|R
40|$|This {{is not so}} much {{one case}} study as a {{description}} of outcomes from a series of cases, based on our experience at Middlesex University in different but related projects concerning the modernisation of libraries in developing countries. For many years, libraries, particularly academic or special libraries, were <b>stable</b> institutions, purchasing <b>books</b> and printed journals to the extent that their budget would allow, cataloguing and classifying them and then making them available by placing them on open shelves or closed stacks. Libraries in developing countries were in the same situation, except that their budget was less and the books and journals more expensive because everything they received had to come by post half way round the world at great cost. So they could buy even less. Academic libraries in general discarded only books which were damaged unless they ran out of space in which case they might have to select carefully material for disposal. Libraries were staffed by librarians who had been taught the same kinds of topics as their grandfathers (or should I say also their grandmothers) before them. In many cases this still applies in a number of developing countries. The course curriculum for librarians has never been updated to take into account electronic sources of information, electronic journals and now e-books...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{textbooks}} {{that attempt}} to discuss and analyse subjects with particular reference to Nigerian circumstances and relevant judicial opinions are adjudged to be very useful for law teaching and learning in Nigeria (Jegede, 1981). In recent times, serious concern is being expressed about the acute shortage of essential law textbooks in University libraries and the adverse effects that the problem may be having on legal education {{and the practice of}} the profession. With the present gross under-funding of most universities, most law faculties do not seem capable of meeting the approved minimum standards with respect to physical and library facilities. In particular, the scourge of inadequate funding for university library acquisitions continues to pose serious challenges to collection development librarians and the various universities offering the law degree programme. Thus, law report, journals, basic textbooks and other reading materials are inadequate and outdated. Consequently, the legal profession and most especially legal education processes in Nigeria have been hard hit by inadequate funding. Most law facilities do not seem capable of meeting the approved minimum stands with respect to physical and library facilities. In particular, the present gross under-funding of universities has affected the ability of librarians to acquire relevant textbooks for students 2 ̆ 7 use. In a related development, the high cost of books has not helped matters. Panella (1990) pointed to the rising law library costs and stated that they increased at a higher rate than those of other general and special libraries {{due to the nature of}} legal research tools. It may thus be presumed that no other library would require the kind of investment on local and foreign publications as the law library. The high cost of books has affected the ability of libraries to acquire relevant textbooks for students 2 ̆ 7 use. It has also contributed to the reduction in students 2 ̆ 7 purchase of relevant textbooks, thereby affecting the growth of distribution points for locally published law textbooks and by implication the tertiary book market. Lawal (1989) identified other factors generally affecting acquisition from the Nigerian book market and these include; lack of bibliographic control, lack of promotional activities for published titles, insufficient distribution outlets and difficult payment terms on the part of publishers and booksellers. Previous studies on book situations in Nigeria have explored indigenous publishers 2 ̆ 7 contributions to general book provision (Apeji, 1997) and some have emphasized on issues and problems generally affecting the production and distribution of essential tertiary books (Bankole, 1985; Okekwe, 1995). Only very few studies have connected book production to library acquisition and use (Fasanya, 1978; Omadibi, 2000 and Nwagwu, 2001), although the more libraries they are, the wider and the more <b>stable</b> the <b>book</b> market. In Nigeria, the purported radical increase in law students 2 ̆ 7 enrolments in recent times, and the problem of acute shortage of essential basic law textbooks have brought the book needs of students into a sharper focus by the purported. The study raised the question; can variation law book production be accounted for by library provision use? The study assessed Indigenous law Textbook Publishing (ILTP) in Nigeria during the period 1960 - 1999 and related library acquisition of published titles, law student 2 ̆ 7 s textbook utilization and Indigenous Law Textbook Publishing (ILTP) in selected Federal Universities in Nigeria. It was anticipated that study results would provide an empirical basis for determining the extent of the Nigerian book market for locally published law textbook The specific research questions are the following: What is the book output of Indigenous Law Textbook Publishing Firms? What are the attributes of the indigenous law textbook collection of selected Federal University Libraries? To what extent do law students utilize locally published law textbooks in their course of study? To what extent is Indigenous Law Textbook Publishing (ILTP) related to library acquisitions and law students 2 ̆ 7 textbook utilization...|$|R
40|$|RECOMMENDATION REQUIRES EFFORT Collaborative {{filtering}} {{methods have}} been applied {{to a number of}} domains like books, videos, audio CDs and Usenet news. These systems require some {{effort on the part of}} users before they can generate recommendations (see for example [5] on the 9 ̆ 3 cold-start 9 ̆ 4 problem). How much effort they require depends on domain and application. Some recommender systems for books or videos require rating a specific number of items before they generate the first prediction. If users can save money by not buying the wrong books and videos this effort might pay off. The Usenet news filter GroupLens [2] gathers ratings while users read articles so the process of building the profile and getting recommendations is interleaved. This strategy might lower the threshold for getting started. How much effort a user is willing to make depends not only on the domain but also on the personal value of the recommendation. Users who depend on the information in a newsgroup might make every required effort, but occasional users with a less serious information interest might not. To summarize: The higher the required effort the more potential users will quit. Recommending TV programs has much in common with recommending Usenet news articles. Like news articles TV programs are a daily updating stream unlike the rather <b>stable</b> databases within <b>book</b> and video recommender systems. There is a relatively high number of programs/ newsgroup articles every day. Recommendation is supposed to help users to cope with the flood and to find the few interesting items for them. How much effort are users going to spend on TV recommendations? Interviews showed: Not much. 9 ̆ 3 I don 9 ̆ 2 t watch much TV anyway 9 ̆ 4, 9 ̆ 3 I just want to know what 9 ̆ 2 s on tonight 9 ̆ 4 and so on. It seems that TV doesn 9 ̆ 2 t have much value to people, although statistics show that people do spend a lot of time watching. All users we asked already had experience with printed guides, which gave them a rather clear expectation of what a TV guide should do. Traditionally, both TV and TV guides have been broadcast media. TV makers broadcast, viewers watch. Editors write, readers read. Interactive and collaborative concepts are new here. It is obviously a risky undertaking to try to introduce new techniques in such a 9 ̆ 3 where is the beef 9 ̆ 4 situation. DESIGN GOALS The low disposition of interviewed persons to spend much effort on TV guides was the motivation for our group to try out a new way of gathering ratings. We made two basic design decisions: (a) don 9 ̆ 2 t ask users to do something they don 9 ̆ 2 t have an immediate benefit from and (b) don 9 ̆ 2 t overtax users with concepts unknown to them like rating, relevance or recommendation. Figure 1 gives an overview of our recommendation engine. Before programs reach users they are first globally rated and ranked according to the size-of-the-audience ratings (see below). Then they are selected according to user-individual genre profiles. Personal rating offsets are added. Next, programs are presented to the users as ordered lists or tables. Individual programs in the lists and tables are color-coded to indicate the personalized ratings. From these lists and tables users choose the programs they actually want to watch and collect them in their personal laundry lists. The laundry list serves as a reminder which can be printed out and taken to the VCR or TV set. Preliminary user tests suggest that the laundry list is perceived as a useful tool. To avoid any additional questioning we use the content of users 9 ̆ 2 laundry lists as an input for recommendation generation. Programs in the laundry lists are interpreted as being rated high and recommended to other users. This approach has similarities with the implicit ratings deduced from reading time of newsgroup articles described in [6]. Laundry list content is processed by the two modules sizeof- the-audience rating and opinion leaders. 9 ̆ 3 SIZE OF THE AUDIENCE 9 ̆ 4 The size-of-the-audience rating generates a general ranking of all programs. The rating of an individual program is calculated as the number of times the program occurs in users 9 ̆ 2 laundry lists. The more often a program has been selected for viewing the higher the rating. The size-of-the audience rating can lead users 9 ̆ 2 attention to unexpected events that are not covered by personal profiles. In Germany, for example, the Tour de France came first into the focus of public interest when the German Telekom team was very successful in 1997. Although (or because) it is not personalized, the size-of-the-audience rating can be useful for detecting such events. OPINION LEADERS Since the ratings delivered by the size-of-the-audience ratings are general to all users, so-called opinion leaders are added as a source of more distinct, personal and higher quality recommendation. Opinion leaders are users that publish their otherwise private laundry list along with their names in a public folder. The system offers and recommends opinion leaders like it recommends genres. 9 ̆ 3 You could have found all these programs more easily if you had subscribed to the genre Basketball and the opinion leader Lars Brückner. Do you want to do that now? 9 ̆ 4 How to become an opinion leader? Based on user profiles and laundry lists a program can estimate which users 9 ̆ 2 selections could be of interest for the community. Candidates should a) correlate with many other users, b) cover interest areas not yet covered by enough opinion leaders and c) use the laundry list on a regular basis. If these requirements are fulfilled the system will suggest that a user becomes an opinion leader. Being an opinion leader requires no extra work. But to deserve their name we want them to select more accurately or even to rate or annotate programs. Why should users do the extra work? 9 ̆ 3 Ways to provide compensatory benefits to those group members need to be found 9 ̆ 4 [3, p. 810]. We have to reward them. One way is to organize the opinion leaders in a competitive way and to reward the winners. The success of an opinion leader can be measured in subscriptions, i. e. the number of users that selected them as their favorites. Concept Tour de France: a) display opinion leaders ordered by their success as a leader board. The currently first and most successful one wears the yellow jersey b) reward the best ones by giving awards and prices at the end of each stage c) drop the least successful one when new users apply. DISCUSSION The central element of the suggested no-extra-effort rating system is the laundry list. Certainly: The laundry list is a magnitude less powerful than explicit seven-items scale ratings: It provides only Boolean input, reasons for selecting and not selecting items are ambiguous and it can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. The applied technique shows similarities to last year 9 ̆ 2 s experiments at MyYahoo to correlate users according to uploaded bookmark lists. On the other hand the laundry list approach frees us from explaining users that they will help generating recommendations using it. The direct utility of the laundry list avoids lots of the trouble of explaining, convincing and persuading users to rate. This solves much of the general problem that many users experience the promised benefit associated with rating as being far away. After all, recommendation is a rather abstract concept and the question is how many first time users are willing to learn enough about it for it to become an incentive. But at the end, those users that want more than the mainstream recommendation of the size-of-the-audience rating do have to spend some effort. The system can suggest opinion leaders, but since these suggestions are based on the less informative laundry lists, users will have to check and fine tune to get equally good results as they would with systems using ratings on seven-items scales. How do opinion leaders relate to those systems where the virtual community is selected by the computer? In those systems one 9 ̆ 2 s virtual community can change by the hour. Opinion leaders are an attempt using active collaborative filtering [5] to provide 9 ̆ 3 names 9 ̆ 4 behind recommendations, like a large set of editors 9 ̆ 6 along with the option to become one. Hill et al. state: 9 ̆ 3 Recommendation and evaluations should come from people, not a black box machine or so-called agent 9 ̆ 4 [4, p. 196]. The opinion leader concept is built on the assumption of role specialization: 9 ̆ 3 Yet there is evidence that people naturally prefer to play distinct producer/consumer roles in the information ecology 9 ̆ 4 [1, p. 60]. It divides users into two distinct groups: A large majority of consumers that contribute only a little to a mass-average and a group of self-selected leaders that are willing to spend more effort on the system for getting social or monetary reward. How far can we get at zero user effort? We need more user tests to find out how much information we can draw out of implicit ratings and which other techniques can be applied to edit them and offer them to users. This will be subject to evaluations that will follow our online debut in May...|$|R
