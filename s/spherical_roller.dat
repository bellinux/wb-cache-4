50|$|A <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing is a {{rolling-element bearing}} that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore {{of the inner}} ring that may be misaligned in respect to the outer ring. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape {{of the outer ring}} and spherical rollers.Despite what their name may imply, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are not truly spherical in shape. The rolling elements of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are mainly cylindrical in shape, but have a profile that makes them appear like cylinders that have been slightly over-inflated.|$|E

50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing, their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing. This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E
50|$|The plant’s output changed qualitatively. In 1968-70, {{the plant}} {{switched}} to {{production of the}} 6001-6008 series ball and rod mills.

To reduce the noise the mills produced, steel linings were replaced with rubber linings. The lining procedure for the mill body became much less laborious.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The risk {{of fatigue}} failure of {{elements}} working in rolling contact conditions (such as railway wheels, rolling bearings, etc.) {{is a significant}} issue with respect to safety and economy. In this case the complex and non-proportional stress state with pulsating three dimensional compression occurs. Therefore, the analysis of fatigue life of structures working in rolling contact conditions can be performed using recently proposed multiaxial high-cycle fatigue criteria. However, there is no hypothesis that could be universally accepted for calculations of fatigue strength. Furthermore, not all criteria proposed in literature for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) analysis can predict it. In the paper, the most popular criteria based on different theories are investigated in the application to RCF problem. Moreover, modification of the popular Dang Van hypothesis is proposed. The problem of free and tractive rolling contact fatigue is analysed on {{the example of a}} cylindrical crane wheel and <b>spherical</b> thrust <b>roller</b> bearing...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{components}} of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is the linear translation stage used to vary the optical path length between the two arms of the interferometer. This translation mechanism must produce extremely constant velocity motion across its entire range of travel to allow the instrument to attain high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolving power. A new spectrometer is being developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) under NASA’s Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP). The goal of this project is to build upon existing spaceborne FTIR spectrometer technology to produce a new instrument prototype that has drastically superior spectral resolution and substantially lower mass, making it feasible for planetary exploration. In order to achieve these goals, Alliance Spacesystems, Inc. (ASI) has developed a linear translation mechanism using a novel ultrasonic piezo linear motor {{in conjunction with a}} fully kinematic, fault tolerant linear rail system. The piezo motor provides extremely smooth motion, is inherently redundant, and is capable of producing unlimited travel. The kinematic rail uses <b>spherical</b> Vespelâ <b>rollers</b> and bushings, which eliminates the need for wet lubrication, while providing a fault tolerant platform for smooth linear motion that will not bind under misalignment or structural deformation. This system can produce velocities from 10 – 100 mm/...|$|R

40|$|The {{work in this}} {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on ultrasonic inspection of bearing components. Roller bearings sustain the heavy loads railcars can often encounter in the rail industry and consist of an inner and outer ring with rollers transferring the load between the two. Rollers in smaller bearings are typically spherical with {{the contours of the}} rings conforming closely to this <b>spherical</b> geometry. Tapered <b>roller</b> bearings were designed to increase this load capacity by increasing the contact area between the rollers and raceways by using rollers of cylindrical shape. This design allows for the support of heavier railcars but introduces a higher likelihood of encountering a defect below the contact surfaces due to increased contact area between rollers and rings. ^ In this work, metrics for ultrasonic quantification of inclusion content are described and applied to railcar bearings. An analysis program is then developed to quantify inclusion content in a consistent manner regardless of the part geometry such that meaningful comparisons between different steels can be made. Ultrasonic scanning methods and reference parts for equipment setup and calibration are also described. ^ In a similar manner, an alternative mode of defect detection is employed to detect inclusions in this critical region utilizing surface waves which propagate only near the surface of the part. The analysis code developed also characterizes these defects in terms of similar metrics for comparison between steels. Inspection routines and novel reference parts for verification of experimental setup and parameters are developed. ^ Predictions of the ultrasonic attenuation of waves in the presence of several types of defects are presented {{as a result of the}} analysis and theoretical development. The work presents predictions of detection limits in terms of both defect size and type, as well as the incorporation of steel characteristics such as the average grain size. ^ Bulk inspection of defects is modeled considering backscattered signals as a function of defect size and type, as well as the grain size of the steel used. Predictions of backscattered amplitude are given for defects with sizes and types that are of concern for fatigue considerations. Previous studies utilize an approach that models grain noise and defect backscatter independently. This work presents a unified approach to this problem that has not been performed previously. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} have {{an outer}} ring with an internal spherical shape. The rollers are thicker {{in the middle}} and thinner at the ends. <b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment.

50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing, which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust bearing is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|E
50|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are used}} to support axial loads, such as vertical shafts.

50|$|Common roller {{bearings}} use cylinders of slightly greater length than diameter. Roller bearings typically have higher radial load capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads.

5000|$|The [...] "Combat" [...] {{engine was}} {{released}} in January 1972, with a twin roller bearing crank, 10:1 compression and developing [...] at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main bearing and one roller bearing main bearing but the Combat engine featured two roller bearings in a mistaken belief this would strengthen the bottom-end {{to cope with the}} higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to [...] "dig-in" [...] to the races, causing rapid failure.
