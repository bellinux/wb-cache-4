60|$|This will evidently {{follow from}} the {{considerations}} {{in the last}} paragraph; supposing only that, instead of the scale of shaft and capital varying together, {{the scale of the}} capital varies alone. For it will then still be true, that, if the projection of the capital be just safe on a given scale, as its excess over the <b>shaft</b> <b>diameter</b> increases, the projection will be unsafe, if the slope of the bell remain constant. But it may be rendered safe by making this slope steeper, and so increasing its supporting power.|$|E
60|$|Both {{of these}} are {{sufficiently}} ugly, the reader thinks; so do I; but we will mend them before we have done with them: that at a is assuredly the ugliest,--like a tile on a flower-pot. It is, nevertheless, the father of capitals; being the simplest condition of the gathered father of cornices. But {{it is to be}} observed that the diameter of the shaft here is arbitrarily assumed to be small, in order more clearly to show the general relations of the sloping stone to the shaft and upper stone; and this smallness of the <b>shaft</b> <b>diameter</b> is inconsistent with the serviceableness and beauty of the arrangement at a, if it were to be realised (as we shall see presently); but it is not inconsistent with its central character, as the representative of every species of possible capital; nor is its tile and flower-pot look to be regretted, as it may remind the reader of the reported origin of the Corinthian capital. The stones of the cornice, hitherto called X and Y, receive, now that they form the capital, each a separate name; the sloping stone is called the Bell of the capital, and that laid above it, the Abacus. Abacus means a board or tile: I wish there were an English word for it, but I fear there is no substitution possible, the term having been long fixed, and the reader will find it convenient to familiarise himself with the Latin one.|$|E

50|$|Parallel {{keys are}} the most widely used. They have a square or {{rectangular}} cross-section.

50|$|An {{example of}} the concept of {{allowance}} can be shown in relation to the hole that this shaft must enter. It is evident that the above shaft cannot be certain to freely enter a hole that is also 10 mm with the same tolerance. It might, if the actual <b>shaft</b> <b>diameter</b> is 9.99 mm and the actual hole diameter is 10.01 mm, but it would not if conversely the actual <b>shaft</b> <b>diameter</b> is 10.01 mm and the actual hole diameter is 9.99 mm.|$|E

If this 6" [...] <b>shaft</b> <b>diameter</b> is then increased to 12" [...] at the discharge, the fights will be only 2" [...] tall at this point.

40|$|The {{measured}} {{torsional buckling}} load of Graphite/Epoxy shafts {{is found in}} good agree-ment with theoretical predictions based on a general shell theory that includes elastic cou-pling effects and transverse shearing deformations. The direction of the applied torque and the lay-up stacking sequence drastically affects the buckling load (up to 80 %). Transverse shearing deformations are found significant {{when the number of}} circumferential waves in the buckling pattern is larger than 3. The residual strength of shafts with holes is also measured, and the dominant failure mode remains torsional buckling. The buckling mode patterns are seemingly unaffected by damage but buckling loads are lower compared to un-damaged specimens. Material failure concentrated around the hole does not occur until the hole size is approximately one-third of the <b>shaft’s</b> <b>diameter.</b> Teflon disks inserted between plies to simulate delaminations decrease the buckling load, but not significantly. In con-clusion, stiffness characteristics, rather than strength characteristics dominate the behavior of thin-walled, undamaged shafts under torsional load, and this appears to remain true for shafts with sizable damage (up to about one-third of the <b>shaft’s</b> <b>diameter)</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Eusauporoda {{are also}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have a}} semi-digitigrade foot posturem demonstrated by footprint evidence. Paleontologist Jeffrey Wilson explains that eusauropods differ from theropods and prosauropods that have digitigrade pes where their heel and metatarsals are lifted off of the ground. Eusauropods show asymmetry in their metatarsal <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters</b> where metatarsal I is broader than the others, suggesting that their weight was mostly assumed by their inner feet. According to Steven Salisbury and Jay Nair, basal eusauropods retain four pedal unguals but reduce their phalangeal number in their fourth digit to three units. The metatarsus in eusauropods {{is less than a}} quarter of their tibial length, unlike sauropod outgroups that have long hindlimbs and metatarsus that are almost half of their tibial length.|$|R

The primary objective of this work is to build up experimental set-up to calculate the changes in natural frequency and mode shapes for different <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters,</b> for various material changes and for varying damping. In addition, consequence of system parameters combination can be evaluated to recognize the performance of the system. FEA results are listed to realize the effects on two mass rotor systems.

40|$|We use isotopic {{analyses}} of authigenic siderite and calcite cements within Rosselia socialis burrows from shoreface deposits in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada, to re-veal the early cementation {{history of the}} burrow and geochemical conditions of the initial sedimentary environment. Within the Horse-shoe Canyon Formation, two forms of the Rosselia burrows are pres-ent: bulbous in situ burrows, and transported, spindlelike burrows, which display similar internal <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters</b> but smaller overall size compared to in situ forms. Transverse, incremental sampling of cal-cite and siderite cements in the Rosselia burrows reveals symmetrical isotopic deviation in 13 C and 18 O around the burrow core, rep-resenting accretionary records of evolving pore-water conditions. The number of isotopic deviations recorded in bulbous specimens is equal to those observed in spindle-shaped burrows, suggesting that in sit...|$|R

50|$|Human hair {{is unique}} in that its {{medullary}} index (the fraction of the hair <b>shaft's</b> <b>diameter</b> that the medulla occupies) is very small: generally less than 1/3. Other species will have much larger ratios, usually at least 1/2. The medulla's presence in human hair and its patterns differ both {{from person to person}} and from strand to strand on a single person's head. One hair may have an absent medulla while another from the same person may have a complete or fragmented medulla. For this reason, medulla patterns are not very useful as forensic evidence and are typically only used for determining the species of the subject. The medulla contains large amounts of mitochondrial (as opposed to nuclear) DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is passed from the mother to her offspring. As such, mtDNA may be of forensic value.|$|R

Jewel bearings are used in precision instruments where low friction, long life, and dimensional accuracy are important. Their largest use is in mechanical watches.|$|E
50|$|Selection of the internal/external drive {{arrangement}} is often idiosyncratic. The service {{life of the}} high-pressure shaft seal {{can be difficult to}} predict, and it may safely be assumed that the seal will cost a good deal more than the motor itself. For instance, a 2 in, 150 psi seal for a 50 hp motor will cost $2,000, whereas the motor itself is half that much. Generally, the combination of vessel pressure, <b>shaft</b> <b>diameter,</b> and fan speed encountered in autoclaves is such as to make the use of a shaft seal reasonably practicable.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating roller screw system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating roller screw system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters.</b>|$|R
