25|$|The Sabre was {{a hybrid}} vehicle, with the turret from a Fox Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle on a FV101 Scorpion hull and {{armed with the}} same 30mm RARDEN cannon as the Scimitar. One hundred and thirty-six of these hybrid {{vehicles}} were brought into service in 1995, after some modifications {{were made to the}} turret. These modifications included; redesigning the smoke grenade dischargers, replacing the <b>standard</b> <b>machine</b> gun with a L94A1 chain gun and domed hatches to improve headroom for the commander and gunner. They were assigned to the reconnaissance platoons of armoured and mechanised infantry battalions before being withdrawn from service in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Cannon Fodder 3 has a {{basic premise}} {{involving}} American soldiers battling disparate terrorists who have united {{with the aim}} of world domination. Like the earlier games in the series, it features a mix of [...] "old school" [...] action and strategy gameplay viewed from an isometric perspective. The player directs a small squad of soldiers, primarily with the mouse though the keyboard is used to deploy additional weaponry. The control system [...] "is very similar to ‘twin-stick’ shooters like Geometry Wars, except here you control just one of the four soldiers while the others fall in line, shooting when the lead does." [...] Each squad begins with four soldiers. They are fragile (though, possessing health bars, are somewhat tougher than the protagonists of the originals), but increase in status and power should they survive; the player is provided with a replacement squad should all his platoon die. The player can also split the squad into smaller units should strategy so require. The game has an online cooperative mode for up to four players, though Strategy Informer noted this mode is unpopular. As well as facing large numbers of equally frail enemy infantry, the player must combat vehicles, buildings and turrets which cannot be destroyed with the <b>standard</b> <b>machine</b> guns. For this reason, the player must rely on explosive secondary weapons such as grenades and rockets, which are essential to destroy enemy structures and more powerful units. He can also make use of vehicles – such as tanks and helicopters – as well as various power-ups. The game features an extensively destructible environment and several settings, including the moon.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>machine</b> gun of the Austro-Hungarian {{armed forces}} in 1914 was the Schwarzlose gun, which {{operated}} on a [...] "delayed blow back" [...] system and was not ideally suited to synchronization. Unlike the French and Italians, who were eventually able to acquire supplies of Vickers guns, the Austrians were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of [...] "Spandaus" [...] from their German allies and were forced to use the Schwarzlose in an application {{for which it was}} not really suited. Although the problem of synchronizing the Schwarzlose was eventually partially solved, it was not until late 1916 that gears were available. Even then, at high engine revolutions Austrian synchronizer gears tended to behave very erratically. Austrian fighters were fitted with large tachometers to ensure that a pilot could check that his [...] "revs" [...] were within the required range before firing his guns, and propeller blades were fitted with an electrical warning system that alerted a pilot if his propeller was being hit. There were never enough gears available, due to a chronic shortage of precision tools; so that production fighters, even the excellent Austrian versions of the Albatros D.III, often had to be sent to the front in an unarmed state, for squadron armourers to fit such guns and gears as could be scrounged, salvaged or improvised.|$|E

40|$|Tool path {{generation}} {{is one of}} the most complex problems in Computer Aided Manufacturing.

Presented in the paper there is a Virtual Digitizing architecture that takes the advantages of Reconfigurable Computing (using Field Programmable Gate Arrays) in order to improve the algorithm efficiency. FPGAs are used as low cost and low frequency coprocessor to accelerate the calculation of tool path, meeting the actual restrictions of the Computer Numeric Controls (CNCs) at the same time. A prototype has been implemented to measure the real impact on the total computing time. 1...|$|R
