40|$|Mushrooms {{are highly}} {{perishable}} and their shelf-life depends on processing, package properties and environmental conditions during storage and distribution. The aims {{of this work}} were to evaluate the effect of temperature and number of film perforations on quality and develop shelf-life kinetic model for a modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for sliced button mushrooms. <b>Sliced</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were packed in a tray, covered with cellophane film, and stored for 7 days at four levels of temperature (0, 5, 10, and 15 C) and three levels of perforations at each temperature ranging the number of perforations from 1 (58 perforations per m 2) to 6 (349 perforations per m 2). Headspace gas composition and quality parameters (weight loss, pH, firmness and colour) were measured throughout the storage period. Increasing the storage temperature required an increase {{of the number of}} perforations in order to obtain the optimum MAP conditions. Temperature had a significant effect (p < 0. 05) on quality of <b>sliced</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Firmness was identified as a critical quality parameter; therefore, a kinetic model was developed to describe the influence of temperature on firmness and predict shelf-life of <b>sliced</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Fresh <b>sliced</b> <b>mushrooms</b> had a shelf-life of 1, 2, 4, and 7. 5 days at 15, 10, 5, and 0 C, respectively, under optimum MAP conditions.
