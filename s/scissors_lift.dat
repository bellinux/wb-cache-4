50|$|In {{the fourth}} match, CM Punk faced Paul Heyman and Ryback in a Handicap Hell in a Cell match. Before the match, Heyman entered on a <b>scissors</b> <b>lift</b> and was dropped {{on top of}} the cell. The match ended when Punk {{performed}} a Diving Elbow Drop on Ryback through a table, hit Ryback with a kendo stick and executed a GTS on Ryback to win the match. After the match, Punk climbed the cell, hit Heyman with a kendo stick and executed a GTS on Heyman.|$|E
5000|$|Most pits are {{designed}} as a hydraulic lift, jackscrew lift, locking chain lift, rack and pinion lift, <b>scissors</b> <b>lift</b> or other system that can be raised and lowered as needed. The lift can usually be lowered {{all the way to}} a storage space under the stage, or halfway to floor level, or all the way up level with the stage. When lowered all the way, the lift can be filled with equipment or props from underneath the stage and then raised and unloaded on stage. The pit can be raised so it is level with the floor of the audience seats to accommodate more seating area. This is common when the stage is being used for a rock show and then the pit area is used for standing room. When the pit is raised all the way up, level with the stage, it can be used as part of the stage to give more room for larger shows. Having a lift set up this way gives the theatre much more flexibility and ability to adapt to different events that occur in the theatre. It allows many different setups, each one personal to certain types of productions.|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} Miss Naylor too came out, {{carrying}} a basket and pair of <b>scissors.</b> <b>Lifting</b> her skirts {{to avoid the}} lakes of water left by the garden hose, she {{stopped in front of}} a rose-bush, and began to snip off the shrivelled flowers. The little lady's silvered head and thin, brown face sustained the shower of sunlight unprotected, and had a gentle dignity in their freedom.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} reviews <b>scissors</b> <b>lifts</b> structure {{manufactured by}} AEREX, UMW Advantech Sdn. Bhd. {{that is used}} on a catering hi-lift using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The <b>scissors</b> <b>lifts</b> {{is one of the}} major and crucial components of a catering hi-lift which is mainly used to hoist the van body of the catering hi-lift for aircraft servicing. The catering hi-lift is one of the aircraft ground support equipment that is commonly used to service commercial airliners. For the design to be approved by the Department of Safety and Health (DOSH) Malaysia under Hoisting Machine Design according to DS- 149 Standard, it must comply with specific engineering design standard. The only standard applicable is the ANSI Standard MH 29. 1 - 2003 “Safety Requirements for Industrial Scissors Lifts” (Revision on ANSI MH 29. 1 - 1994). Focusing on the deflection accordance to the ANSI Standard; calculation regarding the allowable maximum deflection must not be exceeded. To analyze, manual calculations, solid modeling and computer simulations were involved using state-of-the-art CAE software. Several linear static FEA analyses were done to get accurate results. The results show that the deflection is still in the acceptable range. However, some manufacturers find that the allowable maximum deflection is too excessive. Therefore, advice on critical areas to the application must be given and other safety precautions must be taken to avoid failure during operation...|$|R
50|$|NZG {{specializes in}} a wide variety of heavy {{equipment}} types ranging from hand pallet movers, forklifts, <b>scissors</b> <b>lifts,</b> reach stackers, power generators and skidsteers to front loaders, shovels, excavators, graders, and mammoth ore carrying dump trucks. Caterpillar and other engines and machinery are sometimes also made and displayed free-standing. Some offerings, like pavement profilers, road finishers, asphalt strippers, road rollers, pipelayers, large cranes and drill rigs have also been offered, and NZG seems to have the market corner in promoting many models for a variety of manufacturers (Toy Fair 2011). Considering the variety of commercial model vehicles and equipment, one sees that details are intricate and sometimes delicate. To call NZG models 'toys' is too simple - they are precise replicas of the real thing - and quite sophisticated.|$|R

Lifting from low to high lifting, the scissors posts, and the hydraulic cylinder layout multiple, mobile way has traction, self-propelled, booster, etc. <b>Scissors</b> <b>lift</b> mechanism of scissors post number and cylinder layout by lifting height. This paper is about a design based 3 D software Pro/E with 8 m high <b>scissors</b> <b>lift</b> platform, which gives a entire platform dimension with 1800 × 900 mm 2. A rated load of features so that the whole platform {{can be set up}} by two pairs of scissors refers to like products. The platform is designed to be folded away doors, to save more space for convenient storage. Lift platform uses a hydraulic driver, which runs smoothly, stably, and accuracy factors relative to high...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStroke {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{disability}} in the world. The stroke patients need professional support for the rehabilitation activity. However, the number of therapist is considered inadequate to support an increasing numbers of stroke patients especially in the rural areas. Therefore, robot based device for rehabilitation is considered one of the solutions for the increasing numbers of stroke patients and to support the therapist. This research presents the development of upper limb rehabilitation device robot. The device is considered portable for home setting and allowed movement on vertical elbow flexion and shoulder/elbow horizontal flexion and extension. The device consists of <b>scissors</b> <b>lift</b> and armrest mechanism that allowed the patients to perform upper limb rehabilitation at X-X, X-Z, Y-Y and Y-Z axis direction. Two linear actuators, motor drivers and Arduino UNO board were used to drive the device...|$|E
40|$|Authorized SLAC {{personnel}} and subcontractors may use mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) to raise personnel, equipment, and working materials to elevated work areas. MEWPs (including <b>scissors</b> <b>lifts,</b> articulating boom aerial devices, and elevating platforms) offer flexible and versatile access to elevated locations. When work must be performed {{for extended periods}} of time at elevation and there is no guarded, fixed work surface available, it is generally appropriate to use a MEWP. When a MEWP is properly used, it can provide a useful working platform at heights, and is often safer than ladders or other access equipment. This chapter describes the minimum requirements for safely operating MEWPs at SLAC. 1. 1 Hazards/Impacts The misuse of MEWPs can result in property damage, severe injury, or death. Accidents associated with MEWPs include tip / roll-overs, collapses, or personnel being thrown from the basket. The risk of falling or being pinned by a nearby structure is increased by an impact, ground movement, improper maneuvering by the operator, or failure of an equipment component that is critical to the stability of the MEWP. Contact with electrical lines or equipment is a major hazard associated with MEWPs. ...|$|R
