5|$|Proceeding {{down the}} Mediterranean coast, the crusaders {{encountered}} little resistance, as local rulers preferred {{to make peace}} with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned siege of Arqa. On 7 June, the crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> reach.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death.

5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> {{pay for the}} stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known {{to many of the}} other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E
5|$|After {{copulation}} it {{is generally}} the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) guano. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6–7% of mother's body mass is laid, and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months. Both parents take turns feeding {{for the first three}} months, after which the male's attendance tails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents' throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E
5|$|The Lavochkin La-150 (also {{known as}} the Izdeliye 150 – Aircraft or Article 150, USAF/DOD {{designation}} Type 3), was designed by the Lavochkin design bureau (OKB) {{in response to a}} 1945 order to build a single-seat jet fighter using a single German turbojet. By this time both the Americans and British, as well as the Germans, had already flown jet fighters and the single Soviet jet engine under development (the Lyulka TR-1) was not yet ready for production. The design was completed quickly, but the construction of the five flying prototypes was protracted by the factory's inexperience in building metal aircraft. The aircraft made its first flight in September 1946, but proved to require extensive modifications to meet the Soviet Air Forces' requirements. These took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> make and test that the aircraft was essentially obsolete by the time that they were completed. Even one variant with a much more powerful engine was inferior to other aircraft that the OKB had under development and all work was terminated in 1947.|$|E

25|$|The first {{cases of}} 1p36 {{deletion}} syndrome were {{described in the}} 1980s. However, since many of these individuals also had other chromosomal imbalances, symptoms varied widely. The reason it took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> recognize the condition as a distinct chromosome deletion syndrome is that the deletions causing the disorder {{are too small to}} be detected in a routine chromosomal analysis. FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) and DNA-based technology known as MLPA (multiple ligation probe amplification) used in testing have aided in diagnosing an increasing number of cases since the 1990s.|$|E

He thrust this stick into the ground wherever he was evangelising and at the place now known as Aspatria (ash of Patrick), {{the message of the}} dogma took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> get through to the people there that the stick had taken root {{by the time he was}} ready to move on.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution {{opened the}} way for cataclysmic change in Persia, heralding the modern era. It saw a period of {{unprecedented}} debate in a burgeoning press. The revolution created new opportunities and opened up seemingly boundless possibilities for Persia’s future. Many different groups fought to shape the course of the Revolution, and all sections of society were ultimately to be in some way changed by it. The old order, which king Naser al-Din Shah Qajar had struggled for <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> sustain, finally died, to be replaced by new institutions, new forms of expression, and a new social and political order.|$|E

25|$|During this chaos, Kongo {{was being}} {{increasingly}} manipulated by Soyo. In {{an act of}} desperation, the central authority in Kongo called on Luanda to attack Soyo in return for various concessions. The Portuguese invaded the county of Soyo in 1670. They met with no more success than Garcia II, being roundly defeated by Soyo's forces at the Battle of Kitombo on 18 October 1670. The kingdom of Kongo was to remain completely independent, though still embroiled in civil war, thanks to the very force (Portuguese colonials) it had fought <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> destroy. This Portuguese defeat was resounding enough to end all Portuguese ambitions in Kongo's sphere of influence, {{until the end of}} the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet {{struggles to}} turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends {{a large portion of}} the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have {{proposed}} numerous theories as to why he waits <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Glazunov {{became a}} {{professor}} at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. In the wake of the 1905 Russian Revolution and firing, then re-hiring of Rimsky-Korsakov that year, Glazunov became its director. He remained so until the revolutionary events of 1917, which culminated on 7 November. His Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, Op.100, which he conducted, was premiered at the first concert held in Petrograd after that date. After the end of World War I, he was instrumental in the reorganization of the Conservatory—this may, in fact, have been the main reason he waited <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> go into exile. During his tenure he worked tirelessly to improve the curriculum, raise the standards for students and staff, as well as defend the institute's dignity and autonomy. Among his achievements were an opera studio and a students' philharmonic orchestra.|$|E

25|$|In Galveston, Austin was {{at anchor}} while Commodore Moore met with President Houston and Secretary of War and Marine George Washington Hockley {{to make plans}} for the Texan fleet. Moore {{discovered}} that Houston would not release $20,000 in discretionary money recently appropriated by the Texas Congress for the navy, and thus the sailors and officers would not be paid {{for the second consecutive}} year; many sailors deserted. Despite Houston's lack of support for the navy, he did not hesitate to use it when it suited his needs. He ordered a blockade of Mexico in July 1842 and released just over $18,000 for the repair and provisioning of the ships. However, the repairs took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> complete that the blockade never materialized. Then, in September 1842, General Adrian Woll led a large force of Mexican regulars in an invasion of Texas, capturing San Antonio in what has become known as the Woll Invasion.|$|E
25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
25|$|The delayed brigade {{counter-attack}} {{was ordered}} for dawn on 21 January, spearheaded by the 2LR but the 6RNR and 3/16PR were incapable of attacking so soon and the 2LR {{had only just}} arrived; the attack was postponed again but with orders to begin as soon as possible. At 20:00, Arthur Percival (General Officer Commanding Malaya Command) decided that the Japanese capture of the Pelandok defile seriously endangered the Westforce line of communications and ordered Bennett to continue to withdraw south of Labis to a line from Paloh to the Sungei Gerchang bridge {{on the road to}} Labis and to detach a brigade as soon as possible to dig in at the Yong Peng road junction. As the 27th Australian Brigade covered Yong Peng, Percival put all troops on the Muar–Yong Peng road back under the command of Westforce at 12:30. The counter-attack by the 53rd Brigade never occurred; at 10:30 on 21 January, Key visited the brigade and found that half of his orders had not been transmitted, that the brigade had not planned an attack and the 2LR had been sent to dig in at the east end of the causeway. An attack could be arranged for 14:00 but more confusion occurred and the start time was moved to 15:30. The Japanese positions gave a view of the ground east of the ridge, making surprise impossible to achieve and more time was needed to arrange artillery support and concentrate the 2LR. The attack was postponed again to 18:00 and then to the morning of 22 January. The artillery took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> register that ther was another postponement to 09:00 but the 2LR who had assembled under cover of night were spotted by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft and bombed and strafed. With no prospect of surprise and doubtful that the attack could succeed, Duke cancelled the operation and redeployed the three battalions to guard the causeway and the ground from there to the defile.|$|E
