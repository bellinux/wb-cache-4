40|$|Data on {{the acute}} and/or {{long-term}} toxicity of colored smokes {{appear to be}} scarce and inconsistent. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is to obtain more insight on this matter. For this purpose, existing platforms for in vitro toxicity screening are evaluated with respect to their applicability to determining the toxicity of colored smokes. The platforms chosen are CULTEX® using human lung cells (A 549) or human keratinocytes (HaCat) in culture to study acute toxicity, and CULTEX® with an Ames module, using bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium), to study long-term adverse effects. The tested colored smokes are green, yellow and red. Acute toxicity was determined as follows: the colored smoke grenade was ignited inside a ventilated bunker. Wells containing the lung cells and keratinocytes were placed in the vicinity of the grenade and were thus exposed to the colored smoke. Meanwhile the smoke was sampled in a gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag,</b> the number of particles in the smoke was counted and the particle sizes were determined with an aerosol particle sizer. Next, the exposed cells were cultured and various parameters that are indicative of cell toxicity were measured. Also, other wells with lung cells and keratinocytes were exposed to the contents of the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> using the CULTEX® system. The composition of the smoke collected in the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> was determined using continuous two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (GC*GC-Tof-MS). Long-term toxicity was studied by exposing the bacteria in the CULTEX® Ames module to the contents of the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag.</b> Next, the bacteria were cultured on a medium which lacks an essential nutrient for these bacteria. Consequently, the bacteria cannot grow on this medium. However, mutagenic compounds will enable the bacteria to produce the essential nutrient, and therefore they will grow on this medium. The results obtained so far will be presented. This study is supported by The Netherlands’ Defence Materiel Organizatio...|$|E

40|$|To {{control the}} {{emission}} of pollutants from building materials, labelling systems have been introduced. Some of the systems combine measurements of volatile organic compounds according to 16000 - 9 and sensory evaluations. In Denmark, the sensory tests are performed by a minimum of 20 subjects.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} cyanide (HCN) concentration in exhaled human breath and skin gas samples collected with different sampling techniques {{was measured using}} near-infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The median baseline HCN concentrations in samples provided by 19 healthy volunteers 2 - 4 h after the last meal depended on the employed sampling technique: 6. 5 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) in mixed (dead space and end-tidal) mouth-exhaled breath collected to a gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag,</b> 3. 9 ppbv in end-tidal mouth-exhaled breath, 1. 3 ppbv in end-tidal nose-exhaled breath, 1. 0 ppbv in unwashed skin and 0. 6 ppbv in washed skin samples.

The HCN concentrations in end-tidal nose-exhaled breath and skin gas samples were correlated, and it is concluded that these concentrations best reflect systemic HCN levels. 863 QS Times Cited: 2 Cited References Count: 39 </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{environmental}} analysis, researchers rely on the accurate qualitative and quantitative assessment of odorous compounds in the gas phase. In recent years, attention has been mainly given to advanced hyphenated analytical techniques {{and the development of}} new detectors (e. g. e-noses, SIFT-MS, etc.). However, the sample collection step is equally important and strongly influences reproducibility and accuracy. Whole air sampling using polymeric bags {{is still one of the}} most frequently used sample collection methods in the field. The degree of scalping, which is defined as sorption of the volatiles on the inner surface of polymeric <b>sampling</b> <b>bag,</b> is often underestimated, in particular in {{the field of}} environmental sampling. In this work a Phase Ratio Variation (PRV) method is suggested as a fast and efficient manner for predicting the degree of scalping for individual compounds, and thus enabling to compensate for sorption phenomena.

40|$|IntroductionA {{significant}} portion of the increased risk of cancer and respiratory disease from exposure to cigarette smoke is attributed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, 21 VOCs were quantified in mainstream cigarette smoke from 50 U. S. domestic brand varieties that included high market share brands and two Kentucky research cigarettes (3 R 4 F and 1 R 5 F). MethodsMainstream smoke was generated under ISO 3308 and Canadian Intense (CI) smoking protocols with linear smoking machines with a gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> collection followed by SPME/GC/MS analysis. ResultsFor both protocols, mainstream smoke VOC amounts among the different brand varieties were strongly correlated between the majority of the analytes. Overall, Pearson correlation (r) ranged from 0. 68 to 0. 99 for ISO and 0. 36 to 0. 95 for CI. However, monoaromatic compounds were found to increase disproportionately compared to unsaturated, nitro, and carbonyl compounds under the CI smoking protocol where filter ventilation is blocked. ConclusionsOverall, machine generated 2 ̆ 01 cvapor phase 2 ̆ 01 d amounts (3 ̆bcg/cigarette) are primarily attributed to smoking protocol (e. g., blocking of vent holes, puff volume, and puff duration) and filter ventilation. A possible cause for the disproportionate increase in monoaromatic compounds could be increased pyrolysis under low oxygen conditions associated with the CI protocol.

Objectives: To compare the results obtained from the presence of H. pylori by a carbon- 13 urea test using a portable quadrupole mass spectrometer system with those from a fixed mass spectrometer in a hospital-based clinical trial. Methods: Following ethical approval, 45 patients attending a gastroenterology clinic at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital exhaled a breath sample into a Tedlar gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag.</b> They then drank an orange juice containing urea radiolabelled with carbon and 30 [*]min later gave a second breath sample. The carbon- 13 content of both samples was measured using both quadrupole mass spectrometer systems.

Results: The findings were compared to the results using conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry using a laboratory-based magnetic sector instrument off-site. The results showed agreement in 39 of the 45 patients. Conclusions: This study suggests that a portable quadrupole mass spectrometer is a potential alternative to the conventional centralised testing equipment.
