In 2013, 54.4 million t of synthetic fibres were produced worldwide with PES (44.6 million t) being the dominant fibre type [80]. Browne et al. [81] quantified the number of fibres released when washing PES blankets, fleeces and shirts in domestic washing machines. The washing machine effluent contained approx.  120 (blanket) to 300 fibres (fleece) per L. Overall, > 1900 fibres were given off from the evaluated PES fleece during a single wash. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> are also released to air and dust, either during normal use [57] or during tumble drying [77]. In addition, synthetic fibres are released from hygiene products, e.g. if improperly disposed into wastewater [31].|$|R

40|$|Mulberry tree, a plant of {{the family}} of Moraceae and genus Morus, has been widely {{cultivated}} to feed silkworm for the production of silk. Until the past century, in Italy the mulberry cultivation was ruled by regulations which forbade to cut down this plant. But, after the coming in the market of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres,</b> the silk production diminished and so the cultivation of mulberry was almost forgotten. At present, it can be found as ornamental or wild plant in marginal areas. Nevertheless, other utilizations, beyond silkworm feeding, are possible for mulberry. For example, leaves could be used for the preparation of protein concentrates for animal or human nutrition and for extracting compounds with either pharmaceutical activity or <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> colouring ability. This paper describes experiments carried out for the extraction of flavonoids from mulberry, the major responsible compounds for the claimed therapeutic benefits ascribed to mulberry in the folk medicine, in order to study if the recovery of such substances, together with other products, can make suitable the growing, management and processing of mulberry and so allow the conservation of this historical plant...|$|R

To investigate the outcome of patch-testing with a textile dye mix (TDM) at 7 dermatology clinics in Sweden, a TDM tested at 2 concentrations was included into the baseline series during one year. The mix consisted of Disperse (D) Blue 35, D Yellow 3, D Orange 1 and 3, D Red 1 and 17, all 1. 0 %, and D Blue 106 and D Blue 124, each 0. 3 % in the mix 6. 6 % and 1. 0 % each in the mix 8. 0 %. In 2, 122 tested patients, contact allergy to the TDM at the concentration 8. 0 % was found in 2. 8 % and to the TDM at 6. 6 % in 2. 5 % of the patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{document}} {{the prevalence of}} work related ocular (eyeWRI) and nasal (noseWRI) irritation in workers in spinning mills of cotton and <b>synthetic</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> and to relate the prevalence of symptoms to atopy, byssinotic symptoms, work history, and measured dust concentrations in the personal breathing zone and work area. METHODS [...] A cross sectional study of 1048 cotton workers and 404 synthetic fibre workers was performed. A respiratory questionnaire was given to 1452 workers (95 % of the total available population). Atopy was judged by skin prick tests to three common allergens. Work area cotton dust sampling (WAdust) was carried out according to EH 25 guidelines in nine of the 11 spinning mills included in the study. Personal breathing zone dust concentrations were assessed with the IOM sampler to derive total dust exposure (PTdust) and a concentration calculated after the removal of fly (Pless). RESULTS [...] 3. 7 % of all operatives complained of symptoms of byssinosis, 253 (17. 5 %) complained of eyeWRI and 165 (11 %) of noseWRI. These symptoms did not relate to atopy or byssinosis, or correlate univariately with any measure of cotton dust exposure (noseWRI v WAdust r = 0. 153, PTdust r = 0. 118, eyeWRI v WAdust r = 0. 029, PTdust r = 0. 052). Both of these symptoms on logistic regression analysis were related to being of white origin (P < 0. 001), female sex (P < 0. 001), and younger age (P < 0. 001). With regression analysis, there was a negative relation between dust concentration and prevalence of symptoms. CONCLUSION [...] Work related ocular and nasal irritation {{are the most common}} symptoms complained of by cotton textile workers. There was no relation between these symptoms and atopy, byssinosis, or dust concentration. It is likely that they relate to as yet unidentified agents unrelated to concentration of cotton dust...|$|R
40|$|The Thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of new concepts for improving the properties of natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> A natural fibre, cotton, has been chosen as fibrous material. The focus of the modification has been directed towards its handle properties, which usually are improved at the expense of moisture up-take. The silicon based compounds were used for this work. Polylactic acid and polypropylene have been chosen as <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> whose <b>textile</b> potential is hindered by their poor dyeability and low moisture sorption capacity and which can be modified at spinning stage with suitable additives. The focus here has been directed on using recyclable natural materials as additives for achieving an improved comfort property of the synthetic polymer. Two chemical processes, namely coating and infiltration, were considered for applying functional polymers on the fibre surface and, respectively, for modifying the bulk of a polymer via infiltration of particles into the matrix. The coating of cotton with two hydrophilic silicon softeners, a silanol compound and a PDMS compound, was carried out from water, as a classical method, and from supercritical CO 2, respectively, as a new approach. The coating process and the change of the fabric properties were investigated by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), elemental identification Energy Dispersive X–Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), moisture analyser and Kawabata Evaluation System (KES-FB). The results allowed optimising the route of silicon product application and put into evidence the benefits of the treatment, independently of the fabric structure. The polylactic acid and polypropylene based composites were produced via melt infiltration of powders of chitosan, cotton or keratins into polymer matrix. The prepared powders were characterised using FTIR, NMR, Raman microscopy and amino acid analysis. The distribution of the powders into the matrix was investigated by SEM analysis. The composites show good thermal and mechanical properties demonstrated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and miniature material tester (MiniMat 2000). The ability of absorbing and keeping the moisture was highly improved for all materials, as shown with IGA sorb moisture analyser. Polylactic acid based composites proved also an improved ability for dyeing with reactive and acid dyes at 100 °C. Summing up the fibres properties can be controllable improved by selecting the appropriate synthetic polymer structure for coating natural fibres, or the appropriate natural additive for infiltrating the matrix of the synthetic fibre...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} design for {{closed-loop}} (cradle to cradle) systems where waste materials can become inputs for new production, the textile industry needs new tools and processes {{with which to}} create fully or truly recyclable products. However, rather than being cyclical and self-perpetuating, the current means of textile production are linear and one-way. Finishing processes often mix materials from different ‘metabolisms’ creating complex hybrids that are irreversible. With this ever-increasing demand for performance and functionality, it is the design of these products that prevents them from being effectively recycled and leaves us with a legacy of waste (Allwood et al, 2006). This practice based research project set out to explore innovative technologies that afford new opportunities for textile finishing, with a particular focus on the recyclability of synthetic thermoplastics.

40|$|Throughout antiquity, textile {{manufacture}} was practiced on {{all levels}} of society {{and was one of}} the most labour-intensive of all occupations. As such, it was an industry of great cultural and social importance, which should be factored into any balanced assessment of the ancient economy. Over the last two decades, textile research has demonstrated how much we can learn about the culture, society, technology and economy of the ancient world through archaeological textiles. Textile quality and appearance are dependent on the material of which the textile has been made, that is fibre. Fibre investigation, hence, is more than just identification of material source. By studying fibre on a microscopic level we can come closer to understanding issues of selective breeding/ cultivation, processing of fibres, and their wear. <b>Textile</b> <b>fibre</b> exploitation has had a great impact on subsistence strategies of past societies, which were transformed when plant fibre was largely replaced by animal fibre during Bronze Age. Investigation of <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> development is thus essential to the interpretation of much wider aspects of ancient societies, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, domestication and technology. This paper presents some preliminary results of the project <b>FIBRE</b> (<b>textile</b> <b>Fibre</b> in Italy Before Roman Empire, 2009 - 2011), which aims to deepen our understanding of the development of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> in the Apennine peninsula (Italy) through a macroscopic, microscopic and molecular investigation of selected archaeological textiles from various Italian sites dated from prehistory to the Hellenistic period.
