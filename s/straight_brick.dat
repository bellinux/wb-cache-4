50|$|A new {{master plan}} for the Independence National Historical Park was {{developed}} by the Landscape Architecture firm Olin Partnership (now known simply as OLIN). The extensive redesign proposed the removal of all previous structures, except the Free Quaker Meetinghouse. It proposed to focus all of the proposed buildings along 6th Street at {{the western edge of the}} park with smaller pocket parks along 5th Street to the east. The smaller parks along the eastern edge, some of which were raised above the central lawn, would provide more intimate gathering and sitting areas with extensive trees and other landscaping. Several <b>straight</b> <b>brick</b> pathways carved each of the lawn areas within each block including two lateral cuts through the first block corresponding to Ranstead Street and Ludlow Street to the east of the park. There was also a meandering curved path that connected the southeast corner at 5th and Chestnut Streets to the National Constitution Center at the north end of the park.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was a 10 track <b>straight</b> through <b>brick</b> shed, {{with a large}} coaling plant and turntable. After the electrification of the local railways, an electric locomotive shed was also built and, in 1958, a 300 ft by 60 ft, 3-road, brick and glass diesel depot was added to service 60 new diesel multiple units.|$|R
50|$|The Roman Wall is a {{rectangular}} structure of <b>straight</b> rows of <b>bricks</b> and stones. It exhibits a characteristic Ottoman construction method of surrounding the large cut stones with sets of bricks. The wall is situated with an east-west orientation and features two windows, with a mihrab niche in between. A notched brick cornice decorates {{the top of}} the wall.|$|R
50|$|On October 20, 1687, an {{earthquake}} destroyed {{the city of}} Lima, killing 600 people there and 700 in Callao. Before the earthquake, Lima had been a city of <b>straight</b> streets, <b>brick</b> and adobe houses with wooden balconies, and seventy churches and bell towers. The earthquake destroyed much of this, including nearly all the churches and the city walls that were under construction. Wheat production {{in the area around}} Lima was interrupted. The viceroy and his wife took extraordinary measures to aid the victims, expending much money from their own pockets. The city was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by the earthquake of 1746.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the theme}} is sung, Toms Thunderbolt Grease-Slapper {{suddenly}} [...] "hops" [...] out of control off a road and into a barnyard occupied by farm animals. Tom is knocked momentarily unconscious with a chicken {{sitting on top of}} his head as he drives <b>straight</b> into a <b>brick</b> wall. But he miraculously gets out of the sudden pandemonium as his car falls apart in mid-air, and suddenly falls back together again. The car then jumps onto (and off) a stone fixture bearing Tom Slicks name and gets back on the road as Tom waves his hand and smiles.|$|R
