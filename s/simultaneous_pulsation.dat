40|$|Friesian-type {{dairy cows}} were milked with {{different}} machine settings {{to determine the}} effect of these settings on teat tissue reaction and on milking characteristics. Three teat-cup liner designs were used with varying upper barrel dimensions (wide-bore WB = 31. 6 mm; narrow-bore NB = 21. 0 mm; narrow-bore NB 1 = 25. 0 mm). These liners were tested with alternate and <b>simultaneous</b> <b>pulsation</b> patterns, pulsator ratios (60 : 40 and 67 : 33) and three system vacuum levels (40, 44 and 50 kPa). Teat tissue was measured using ultrasonography, before milking and directly after milking. The measurements recorded were teat canal length (TCL), teat diameter (TD), cistern diameter (CD) and teat wall thickness (TWT). Teat tissue changes were similar with a system vacuum level of either 50 kPa (mid-level) or 40 kPa (low-level). Widening the liner upper barrel bore dimension from 21. 0 mm (P < 0. 01) or 25. 0 mm (P < 0. 001) to 31. 6 mm increased the magnitude of changes in TD and TWT after machine milking. Milk yield per cow was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher and cluster-on time was reduced (P < 0. 01) with the WB cluster as compared to the NB 1 cluster. Minimum changes in teat tissue parameters were achieved with system vacuum level of 40 kPa and 50 kPa using NB and WB clusters, respectively. Similar changes in teat tissue and milk yield per cow were observed with alternate and <b>simultaneous</b> <b>pulsation</b> patterns. Widening pulsator ratio from 60 : 40 to 67 : 33 did not have negative effects on changes in teat tissue and had a positive effect on milk yield and milking time.

40|$|Quasi-periodic Pc 5 {{pulsations}} {{have been}} reported inside and just outside the Earth's magnetotail during intervals of low geomagnetic activity. In order to further define their characteristics and spatial extent, we present three case studies of simultaneous magnetic field and plasma observations by IMP- 8, ISEE- 1 (and ISEE- 2 in one case) in the Earth's magnetotail and ISEE- 3 far upstream of the bow shock, during intervals in which the spacecraft were widely separated. In the first case study, similar pulsations are observed by IMP- 8 at the dawn flank of the plasma sheet and by ISEE- 1 near the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) near midnight local time. In the second case study, <b>simultaneous</b> <b>pulsations</b> are observed by IMP- 8 in the dusk magnetosheath and by ISEE- 1 and 2 in the dawn plasma sheet. In the third case study, <b>simultaneous</b> <b>pulsations</b> are observed in the north plasma sheet boundary layer and the south plasma sheet. We conclude that the pulsations occur simultaneously {{throughout much of the}} nightside magnetosphere and the surrounding magnetosheath, i. e. that they have a global character. Some additional findings are the following: (a) the observed pulsations are mixed mode compressional and transverse, where the compressional character is more apparent in the close vicinity of the plane ZGSM= 0; (b) the compressional pulsations of the magnetic field in the dusk magnetosheath show peaks that coincide (almost one-to-one) with similar peaks observed inside the dawn plasma sheet; (c) in the second case study the polarization sense of the magnetic field and the recurrent left-hand plasma vortices observed in the dawn plasma sheet are consistent with anti-sunward moving waves on the magneto-pause; (d) pulsation amplitudes are weaker in the PSBL(or lobe) as compared with those in the magneto-tail's flanks, suggesting a decay with distance from the magnetopause; (e) the thickness of the plasma sheet (under extremely quiet conditions) is estimated to be ~ 22 RE at an average location of (X, Y) GSM=(16, 17) RE, whereas at midnight local time the thickness is ~ 14 RE. The detected pulsations are probably due to the pressure variations (recorded by ISEE- 3) in the solar wind, and/or the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the low-latitude boundary layer or the magnetopause due to a strongly northward IMF...|$|R

40|$|A fair {{fraction}} of Pc 1 pulsation events observed {{on the ground}} includes more than one <b>simultaneous</b> <b>pulsation</b> band. In most such multiband events the bands display different characteristics and, therefore, come from different source regions via horizontal ducting in the ionosphere. However, in this report we identify a new &quot;coherent&quot; subclass of multiband Pc 1 events where the pearls of the simultaneous bands have the same group velocities (repetition rates) as well as dispersion and other properties, thus implying that the bands are produced by the same source. Studying one {{example of such a}} coherent multiband event in more detail, we argue that these events defy an explanation in terms of band splitting by magnetospheric heavy ions because the observed frequency gap between the bands is smaller than would result in such a case. We interpret these events to be due to the frequency dependence of the ionospheric reflection coefficient of Alfvén waves. An oscillatory frequency dependence of the coefficient is a natural consequence of the idea that the ionosphere acts as a resonator for Alfvén waves. We also discuss other predictions of this interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Learned et. al. {{proposed}} that a sufficiently advanced extra-terrestrial civilization may tickle Cepheid and RR Lyrae variable stars with a neutrino beam {{at the right}} time, thus causing them to trigger early and jogging the otherwise very regular phase of their expansion and contraction. This would turn these stars into beacons to transmit information throughout the galaxy and beyond. The idea is to search for signs of phase modulation (in the regime of short pulse duration) and patterns, which could be indicative of intentional, omnidirectional signaling. We have performed such a search among variable stars using photometric data from the Kepler space telescope. In the RRc Lyrae star KIC 5520878, we have found two such regimes of long and short pulse durations. The sequence of period lengths, expressed as time series data, is strongly auto correlated, with correlation coefficients of prime numbers being significantly higher (p= 99. 8 %). Our analysis of this candidate star shows that the prime number oddity originates from two <b>simultaneous</b> <b>pulsation</b> periods and is likely of natural origin. Simple physical models elucidate the frequency content and asymmetries of the KIC 5520878 light curve. Despite this SETI null result, we encourage testing other archival and future time-series photometry for signs of modulated stars. This can be done as a by-product to the standard analysis, and even partly automated. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ. 49 pages, 16 figure...|$|E

40|$|Following an {{invitation}} {{to participate in an}} exhibition that commemorated the 50 th anniversary of the great smog I became particularly interested in the space opened up by the anxiety induced by reduced visibility and disorientation. I completed and exhibited a series of six new paintings (36 X 28 inches) under the collective title 'A Bout de Souffle: <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>Pulsations</b> and Reminiscences of Killer Fog'. These works took eyewitness accounts of real events as a starting point to develop a series of paintings that spin a web of connections between the lived, recollected and imagined. The paintings are each exhibited beside a printed version of the anecdote from which they originated. In developing the new works I was aware of an historical fascination with fog by artists like Whistler and Monet and writers like Connan Doyle and Dickens. The exhibition was the fourth in a series of exhibitions at LSHTM that brought artist’s interpretation into the field of medical science made possible by, financial support from the Wellcome Trust and the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. My aesthetic research for this project relates directly to my continuing interest in handling social subjects beyond the tradition of documentary representation. This attitude is expressed in the preface to the exhibition saying of the artworks “…scientific fact may appear to be diffused, concealed or transformed in order to reveal other kinds of insights and meanings. The meanings and feelings that these works evoke are surely complex, suggesting positions and visions perhaps peripheral to scientific enquiry yet provoking fresh readings and intersections between science, art and life. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} ELF-VLF {{receiver and}} search coil magnetometer data from five Antarctic stations from 1998 and 1999 to study quasiperiodic emissions (QPs) and periodic emissions (PEs), which occur as ULF-range modulations of ELF-VLF signals between 0. 5 kHz and similar to 4 kHz. QPs are modulated at frequencies of similar to 20 - 50 mHz, and PEs are modulated at frequencies of similar to 200 - 500 mHz. The stations used covered {{a range of}} magnetic latitudes from - 62 degrees (Halley) to - 74 degrees (South Pole Station); three automated geophysical observatories (AGOs) were located at intermediate latitudes. Consistent with earlier studies, most QPs were observed with magnetic pulsations of identical period in the Pc 3 range (type I QPs). Of those QPs not observed with <b>simultaneous</b> magnetic <b>pulsations</b> (type II QPs), nearly all were accompanied by PEs. Type I QPs, PEs, and events during which both appeared together (QPPEs) {{were found to have}} different latitudinal, seasonal, and diurnal occurrence patterns: QPs of both types were more likely to occur between - 65 degrees and - 70 degrees magnetic latitude, while PEs occurred more often around - 60 degrees magnetic latitude. QPs were more common during the months of October though March, while PEs were more common during the months of May through September. QPs, whether with or without simultaneous PEs or magnetic pulsations, were predominantly a dayside phenomenon, with a broad maximum near local noon. The occurrence of QPs unaccompanied by PEs was restricted to the dayside, however, while a small number of QPPEs appeared even during nighttime hours. PEs, on the other hand, could be seen at all local times, but with latitudinally dependent diurnal patterns. Most higher-latitude QPs were type I events (observed with magnetic pulsations), while type II QP events (without <b>simultaneous</b> magnetic <b>pulsations)</b> occurred relatively more often at lower latitudes.

40|$|The vacuum {{variations}} at {{the apex}} of an artificial teat during simulated milking were measured in a factorial-design laboratory test involving six cluster types, two internal diameters (13. 5 mm and 16 mm) of long milk tube (LMT), three water flow rates (4, 6 and 8 l/min), simultaneous (4 × 0) and alternate (2 × 2) pulsation patterns and three pulsator ratios (60, 64, and 68 %). Four of the six clusters were fitted with wide-bore tapered liners and represented all combinations of two claw volumes (150 or 420 ml) and two short-milk-tube bores (8. 5 mm and 13. 5 mm). Two clusters were fitted with narrow-bore liners (22 and 25 mm) that had large-bore short milk tubes and large claw volumes. The vacuum variations were expressed as mean vacuum at the teat-end during the b-phase of pulsation (TVB), mean vacuum at the teat end measured over complete pulsation cycles (TV), minimum vacuum measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVM) and amplitude of vacuum fluctuation measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVF). The highest level of TVB was recorded with wide-bore tapered liners. For a milking unit fitted with a wide-bore tapered liner TVF was reduced and TVM increased by increasing either the bore of the short milk tube or the volume of the claw. When the bore of the LMT was increased TVB, TV and TVF increased. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>pulsation</b> gave higher TVB (P < 0. 001) and higher TVF (P < 0. 001) than alternate pulsation for all cluster types.

(3) The dominant spectrum peaks of the radio fluctuations and geomagnetic field on the ground generally coincide. Cases are found also in which temporal characteristics of the spectra are similar.

40|$|We {{carried out}} a multi-colour time-series {{photometric}} study of six stars claimed as "hybrid" p and g mode pulsators in the literature. Gamma Peg was confirmed to show short-period oscillations of the Beta Cep type and <b>simultaneous</b> long-period <b>pulsations</b> typical of Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars. From the measured amplitude ratios in the Stromgren uvy passbands, the stronger of the two short period pulsation modes was identified as radial; the second is l= 1. Three of the four SPB-type modes are most likely l= 1 or 2. Comparison with theoretical model calculations suggests that Gamma Peg is either an 8. 5 solar mass radial fundamental mode pulsator or a 9. 6 solar mass first radial overtone pulsator. HD 8801 was corroborated as a "hybrid" Delta Sct Gamma Dor star; four pulsation modes of the Gamma Dor type were detected, and two modes of the Delta Sct type were confirmed. Two pulsational signals between the frequency domains of these two known classes of variables were confirmed and another was newly detected. These are either previously unknown types of pulsation, or do not originate from HD 8801. The O-type star HD 13745 showed small-amplitude slow variability on a time scale of 3. 2 days. This object {{may be related to}} the suspected new type of supergiant SPB stars, but a rotational origin of its light variations cannot be ruled out at this point. 53 Psc is an SPB star for which two pulsation frequencies were determined and identified with low spherical degree. The behaviour of 53 Ari and Iota Her is consistent with non-variability during our observations, and we could not confirm light variations of the comparison star 34 Psc previously suspected.

The pulsations exhibited an amplitude peak and a ∼ 180 ° phase change at ∼ 67 ° geomagnetic latitude. A vortex structure of the equivalent ionospheric current system was also observed centered at the geomagnetic latitude between 67 ° and 71 °. During the Pc 5 event, the Polar spacecraft was located near the morningside magnetic equator and crossed magnetic field lines conjugate to the ground stations at which the pulsations were strong. Polar observed ∼ 2.8 mHz pulsations in the radial electric field and compressional magnetic field components. Since toroidal mode Alfvén waves in the magnetosphere are characterized by an electric field perturbation in the radial direction, the <b>simultaneous</b> presence of <b>pulsations</b> in both components indicates that a field line resonance (FLR) was driven by compressional pulsations. The ground H component at the station conjugate to Polar and the radial electric field perturbation at Polar oscillated with a great similarity without a phase delay. From {{an analysis of the}} ground-satellite data, we suggest that the ground perturbations are associated with toroidal mode Alfvén waves rather than compressional mode propagating across magnetic field lines. In addition, we discuss the source of the compressional perturbations observed at Polar using solar wind and geosynchronous data.|$|R
