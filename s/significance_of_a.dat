The statistical <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trend in the data—which measures {{the extent to which a}} trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{proposed}} {{scales for}} quantifying {{the significance of}} transmissions between Earth and potential extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The Rio Scale, ranging from 0 to 10, was proposed in 2000 {{as a means of}} quantifying the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> SETI detection. The scale was designed by Iván Almár and Jill Tarter to help policy-makers formulate an initial judgment on a detection’s potential consequences. The scale borrows heavily from the Torino Scale, which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of near-earth objects (NEOs). The IAA SETI Permanent Study Group officially adopted this scale both as a means of bringing perspective to claims of ETI detection and as an acknowledgement that even false ETI detections could have disastrous consequences, which should be mitigated.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting {{how much of a}} given resource is transported to a given building, under six separate headings; foodstuff, grain, iron, coal, boards and water. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a bakery, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, a rolling pin will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith.|$|E

25|$|The French {{victory at}} the Battle of Wagram on 6 July forced the {{commander}} of the Kaiserlich-königliche Hauptarmee Hauptarmee, the main Austrian army, Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, to retreat. In spite of the defeat, the retreat was orderly and very well handled. The French, commanded by Napoleon I, were initially unsure about the exact direction, with reports saying that the Austrians were retreating towards Bohemia, but it was still unclear whether they would retreat using the road to Brünn or the road to Znaim. Other reports from, sent by General Louis-Pierre Montbrun were indicating that the Austrians were actually retreating towards Moravia. Masséna sent scouts towards Krems and the district of Horn and was able to ascertain that the enemy was not retreating in that direction, but he was unable to conclude where they would retreat. It thus took the French {{a few days after the}} battle of Wagram, before they could gather enough intelligence to really understand where the Austrians were going. However, by 8 July, things began to clarify for Napoleon, mainly due to intelligence sent by Auguste de Marmont, commander of XI Corps and the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of combats fought by elements of Masséna's Corps against the VI Korps under Klenau. These combats, fought at Korneuburg and Stocerau allowed Masséna to inform Napoleon that a large Austrian force was indeed retreating towards Bohemia.|$|E

500|$|Boyd {{said he was}} {{partially}} inspired by the generation of English writers who matured between the wars: [...] "I am fascinated by the life and work of that generation of English writers who were born {{at the beginning of}} the century and reached maturity by the time of World War II. People like Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Anthony Powell, obviously, but also less well known writers—Henry Green, Lawrence Durrell, Cyril Connolly and William Gerhardie.

[...] Both real and imagined characters are blended [...] into this context, where historical personages are typically used to concentrate the historical <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel's plot, Mountstuart's encounters with them are superficial, leaving only an impression of both parties' small-mindedness.

[...] Astrologer Bruce Scofield noted, [...] "The Milky Way crossing of the winter solstice is something that has been neglected by Western astrologers, with a few exceptions. Charles Jayne made a very early reference to it, and in the 1970s Rob Hand mentioned it in his talks on precession but didn't elaborate on it.

Vikings coach Dennis Green believed that the 1998 Vikings would have been considered the best NFL team of their generation had they won the Super Bowl, and due to these lofty perceptions, Damon Amendolara of CBS Radio and Don Banks of Sports Illustrated both consider the Vikings' loss in the championship game {{as one of the most}} devastating in NFL history.

[...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home."
