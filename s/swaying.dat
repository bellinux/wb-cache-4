Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of <b>swaying</b> back and forth, trunk <b>swaying,</b> or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including <b>swaying</b> to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{examining}} body <b>sway</b> factors for 1, 107 healthy people aged 16 to 69 years and to propose a practical body <b>sway</b> evaluation method. The center of foot pressure measurement was carried out twice for 1 min. with a 1 -min. rest. 30 parameters with high reliability selected from 6 domains (distance, distribution of amplitude, area, velocity, power spectrum, and body <b>sway</b> vector) were summarized objectively into 4 body <b>sway</b> factors (unit time <b>sway,</b> front-back <b>sway,</b> left-right <b>sway,</b> and high frequency band power). Factor scores were calculated by the estimate equation and the total standard scores of parameters with high factor loadings. Considering this result, a total standard score for each factor was classified into 4 percentile categories based on percentile rank. Using this classification criteria, body <b>sway</b> scores for each individual were classified {{into any of the}} above 4 domains for each factor. It was confirmed that young adultsmainly belong to percentile Categories A and B and the elderly mainly belong to percentile Categories C and D. It was found that a great effect on body <b>sway</b> occurred when an individual's conscious condition changed (contracting a cold or after exercise). In conclusion, the body <b>sway</b> of healthy people can be explained by these 4 <b>sway</b> factors.

40|$|Background: Single Leg Stance (SLS) {{testing is}} used in {{clinical}} assessments of balance, but {{little is known about}} the temporal structure of <b>sway</b> parameters during this test. SLS research is equivocal on the effects of <b>sway</b> over time and the direction of balance initiation. <b>Sway</b> data in a healthy young population may provide insight on how balance is initiated and maintained in relation to the initial step direction. This may lead to novel approaches to help healthy elderly populations decrease fall risk and fall-related mortality. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the temporal and directional dependencies of <b>sway</b> parameters during 10 seconds of SLS in young, healthy adults. Methods: Six healthy, young college students (five male, one female) performed 10 seconds of SLS on their dominant leg, stepping from a frontward and sideward direction.

40|$|The {{development}} of independent upright stance {{is an important}} motor milestone. Infants {{have been shown to}} adapt <b>sway</b> {{in the context of their}} environment (Lee 2 Ì† 6 Aronson, 1974; Butterworth 2 Ì† 6 Hicks, 1977) and adapt postural <b>sway</b> during a manual concurrent task (Claxton, Melzer, Ryu, 2 Ì† 6 Haddad, 2012; Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, 2 Ì† 6 Zuckerman, 2012). However, it remains unknown as to whether infants will also adapt their standing postural <b>sway</b> under other types of concurrent tasks conditions, such as a visual task. We investigated the relationship of visual task-demands on postural <b>sway</b> in 21 newly independently standing infants. Infants stood on a force plate independently while viewing large and small images of animals displayed on a monitor. Three types of postural <b>sway</b> measures were calculated: amount of <b>sway</b> (AP-sway, ML-sway, area of <b>sway),</b> velocity of <b>sway,</b> and <b>sway</b> complexity. Infants displayed a marginally significant decrease in area of <b>sway,</b> along with a significant reduction in the velocity of <b>sway</b> when viewing the small image. Infants also exhibited a significant increase in <b>sway</b> complexity. These results suggest that infants not only engage in adaptive postural control strategies in order to facilitate manual concurrent task-demands, but to facilitate visual task-demands as well. The {{development of}} this skill further emphasizes the capability of advanced postural complex behaviors in infancy. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Swaying</b> {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum.

If so, do subjects decrease <b>sway</b> size by increasing ankle impedance or by some alternative mechanism?The position of the pendulum, the torque generated at each ankle and the soleus and tibialis anterior EMG were recorded. Results showed that subjects could significantly reduce the mean <b>sway</b> size of the pendulum by giving full attention to that goal.

Results also revealed that ankle impedance and muscle co-contraction were not significantly changed when the <b>sway</b> size was decreased. As the ankle impedance and <b>sway</b> frequency do not change when the <b>sway</b> size is decreased, this implies no change in ankle stiffness or viscosity. Increasing ankle impedance, stiffness or viscosity are not the only methods by which <b>sway</b> size could be reduced. A reduction in torque noise or torque inaccuracy via a predictive process which provides active damping could reduce <b>sway</b> size without changing ankle impedance and is plausible given the data. Such a strategy involving motion recognition and generation of an accurate motor response may require higher levels of control than changing ankle impedance by altering reflex or feedforward gain...|$|R

5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. <b>Swaying</b> is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum.

5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or <b>swaying</b> tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of quantisation of force plate data used to measure body <b>sway</b> and the relationship between this body <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance in shooting. Quantisation error in and resolution of selected body <b>sway</b> parameters were calculated from force plate data sampled using 12 -bit and 16 -bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). It was concluded that 12 -bit ADC does not offer adequate precision when assessing the body <b>sway</b> of shooters and that 16 -bit ADC is required. The relationship between body <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance was examined on both group and individual bases. Body <b>sway</b> was measured in six elite rifle and five elite pistol shooters while performing 20 shots in simulated competition conditions over 5 s, 3 s and 1 s before shot using an AMTI LG 6 - 4 force plate and 16 -bit ADC. This was synchronised with a SCATT shooting training analysis system, which measured aim point fluctuation and performance. From 16 time-based body <b>sway</b> parameters quantified, principal components analysis identified four body <b>sway</b> factors, which related to the amplitude and speed of this <b>sway</b> in both the X and Y axis. Using four body <b>sway</b> parameters that represented these factors, correlation and multiple regression analysis indicated that body <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance were related for some but not all shooters. Further, this association was specific to the individual shooter in terms of degree and direction of association, the axis of influence of body <b>sway</b> and aim point fluctuation and the time period.
