40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition primarily characterised by {{alterations in}} social interaction and communication {{combined with the}} presence of restricted interests and <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Mutations in several genes have been associated with ASD resulting in the generation of corresponding mouse models. Here, we focus on the behavioural (social and <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours),</b> functional and structural traits of mice with mutations in genes encoding defined synaptic proteins including adhesion proteins, scaffolding proteins and subunits of channels and receptors. A meta-analysis on ASD mouse models shows that they can be divided into two subgroups. Cluster I gathered models highly impaired in social interest, <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours,</b> synaptic physiology and protein composition, while Cluster II regrouped much less impaired models, with typical social interactions. This distribution was not related to gene families. Even within the large panel of mouse models carrying mutations in Shank 3, the number of mutated isoforms was not related to the severity of the phenotype. Our study points that the majority of structural or functional analyses were performed in the hippocampus. However, to robustly link the structural and functional impairments with the behavioural deficits observed, brain structures forming relevant nodes in networks involved in social and <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours</b> should be targeted in the future. In addition, the characterisation of core ASD-like behaviours needs to be more detailed using new approaches quantifying the variations in social motivation, recognition and <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R

50|$|Promptov {{was born}} in the family of a {{high-ranking}} Russian revenue official. He went to school in Kostroma and graduated from the Nechaev gymnasium in Moscow. Even as a young boy, he took an interest in birds but he chose to study experimental zoology rather than ornithology. It is thought that his choice may have been aided by family ties to Nikolai Koltsov. Promptov's and Koltsov's mothers were related and Koltsov influenced the authorities to let Promptov study the genetics of fowl under Aleksandr Serebrovskii, a former student of Koltsov, in a project funded by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture. Promptov graduated in 1923 and joined the University in the department of genetics. He contributed to a translation of T.H. Morgan's Physical Basis of Heredity into Russian and joined Sergei Chetverikov's research team working on Drosophila. In 1926 he started research at Moscow University's Institute of Zoology on pleiotropism and polymorphism in Drosophila genetics. Throughout this period, he continued to take an interest in field ornithology and began to explore many aspects of avian biology including song learning and hybridization of finches. After defending his dissertation in 1929 he made a trip to the Urals to study song variation in several bird species. Returning after two months, he took up a job of a lecturer in general biology. He gradually intensified his studies in ornithology and in 1937 he produced a 400 page manual of field ornithology, Птицы в природе ("birds in nature") which is still considered a classic. It included calls described in his own notations. Promptov also pioneered bird sound recording in the USSR with an instrument that made use of photographic film. In 1940 he moved to an Ornithological Laboratory at the Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Pathology of Higher Nervous Activity which had been established in Koltushi by Ivan Pavlov and then directed by his student Leon Orbeli. He began to study species specific <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> in birds but the war broke out. Promptov stayed at the Institute through the war and after the war, he was visited by Julian Huxley who reported that it was the only work on the genetics of behaviour in wild birds that he knew of. On November 11, 1948 Promptov committed suicide. Some of his work was posthumously published by his wife Elizaveta Lukina (who was also a research collaborator).|$|E
40|$|Abnormal {{behaviour}} {{of horses}} is a problematic behaviour that occurs mainly in horses domesticated or held in captivity {{due to the}} effect of incorrect breeding methods or improper handling with these animals. A part of abnormal behaviour is also <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> which is main target of this thesis. There are many causes of <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour.</b> It could be a trauma during early weaning, lack of physical activity, an impact of nutrition, genetics and other factors. It is difficult to find out the true cause of <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> and it is even harder to remove these stereotypes. However the reduction of symptoms is almost always possible. The aim of the thesis was explanation, based on literature review, of the concept of <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> of horses, describe its symptoms, causes and suggest possible ways of removing.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effect of pharmacological inhibition of endocannabinoid degradation on behavioural actions of the dopamine D- 2 /D- 3 receptor agonist quinpirole in male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice. In addition, we studied the effects of endocannabinoid degradation inhibition on both cocaine-induced psychomotor activation and behavioural sensitization. We analysed the effects of inhibition of the two main endocannabinoid degradation enzymes : fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), using inhibitor URB 597 (1 mg/kg); monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), using inhibitor URB 602 (10 mg/kg). Administration of quinpirole (1 mg/kg) caused a temporal biphasic response characterized by a first phase of immobility (0 - 50 min), followed by enhanced locomotion (next 70 min) that was associated with the introduction of <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours</b> (<b>stereotyped</b> jumping and rearing). Pretreatment with both endocannabinoid degradation inhibitors did not affect the hypoactivity actions of quinpirole. However, this pretreatment resulted in a marked decrease in quinpirole-induced locomotion and <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Administration of FAAH or MAGL inhibitors did not attenuate the acute effects of cocaine. Furthermore, these inhibitors did not impair the acquisition of cocaine-induced behavioural sensitization or the expression of cocaine-induced conditioned locomotion. Only MAGL inhibition attenuated the expression of an already acquired cocaine-induced behavioural sensitization. These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of endocannabinoid degradation might exert a negative feedback on D- 2 /D- 3 receptor-mediated hyperactivity. This finding might be relevant for therapeutic approaches for either psychomotor disorders (dyskinesia, corea) or disorganized behaviours associated with dopamine-mediated hyperactivity...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work on the}} unconditioned {{effects of}} {{amphetamine}} in rats has examined qualitative changes in <b>behaviours</b> which become <b>stereotyped</b> and quantitative changes in locomotion. <b>Stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours</b> have been adopted {{as a model of}} raised caudate-putameri function whilst locomotion has been adopted as a model of raised mesolimbic dopamine function. These models have been used to study drugs which are effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. Only locomotion is reliably antagonised by all classes of antipsychotic drugs, although it has been hypothesised that, under some doses of amphetamine, locomotion may also become stereotyped. The Lyon-Robbins hypothesis of the behavioural effects of amphetamine predicts competition between the output of the mesolimbic and caudate-putamen, and would predict that stereotyped locomotion represents a 'blending' of mesolimbic and caudate-putamen behavioural output. An experiment was conducted to test the Lyon-Robbins hypothesis using contrast-based image analysis to determine the spatio-temporal characteristics of open-field locomotion. A further four experiments examined the effects of a classic antipsychotic (haloperidol), the atypical antipsychotics (clozapine and sulpiride) and a putative antipsychotic (a 5 -HT 3 antagonist, ondansetron) on open-field locomotor routes taken by rats following treatment with 3. 5 mg/kg amphetamine. Measures of stereotyped locomotion derived from image analysis were supported by a novel form of behavioural analysis based on multi-dimensional scaling which provided an integrated analysis of behavioural change following drug treatment. Haloperidol blocked locomotion and <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours</b> including <b>stereotyped</b> locomotion, whereas clozapine, sulpiride and ondansetron blocked locomotion but not stereotyped locomotion and in some cases increased <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours.</b> This suggests that stereotyped locomotion represents synergistic functioning of both mesolimbic and caudate-putamen systems, when the output from the caudate-putamen is insufficient to over-ride that of the mesolimbic system. Antagonism of a 5 -HT 3 enhancement of mesolimbic locomotor activity by ondansetron allowed latent 5 -HT and dopamine mediated behaviours to be expressed. This effectively mimicked a leftwards shift of the amphetamine dose response curve, hypothesised as amplification of the caudate-putamen output. These findings lend support to the Lyon-Robbins hypothesis of the behavioural effects of amphetamine...|$|R

40|$|Swimming {{behaviour}} {{and effects}} of water baths on <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> in farmed mink (Mustela vison) were studied in three experiments. The singly-housed mink had access from their home cages to extra cages with 20. 5 litre water baths. Two short-term experiments aimed to investigate how quickly adult and juvenile mink start using and how consistently they use water baths over 10 days, and whether {{the extent of the}} use correlates between dams and their females kits. A four-month experiment was designed to compare the development of <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> in juvenile mink housed with and without swimming opportunity. The behavioural analyses were based on several 24 -hour video recordings carried out in all three experiments. There were obvious inter-individual differences and intra-individual consistency in swimming frequency and time. Farmed minks motivation to swim can be assessed in short-term experiments, and measurement of water losses from the swimming baths and use of instantaneous sampling with 10 min sampling intervals provide quite reliable measures of the amount of swimming. The bath use of the juveniles correlated with that of their dams, indicating that an individual minks eagerness to swim may have a genetic component. The lower amount of <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> in mink housed with water baths indicates that long-term access to baths may alleviate frustration in singly-housed juvenile farmed mink. ...|$|E

It is not felt that such sensory processes must have the same dimensions as behavior. In temporal discriminations, however, the temporal gap is there to be bridged, and the analysis of mediating or timing behavior may be regarded as a kind of search for the temporal receptor". (Catania, 1970, p. 36). The research reported in this thesis arose from {{a review of the literature}} on timing behaviours in organisms. This revealed that while many experimenters have described behaviour, produced by both animals and humans, where responses have been spaced accurately in time, the empirical results are open to equivocal explanations. One aspect of timing behaviour which has received little experimental attention is the function, if any, of the <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviours</b> which often occur collaterally with accurately spaced responding in time. These <b>stereotyped</b> collateral <b>behaviours</b> have sometimes been termed mediating behaviours because several researchers claim that they mediate accurately spaced responding in time (Kramer and Rilling, 1970, p. 234 ff.). A detailed functional analysis of these "mediating" behaviours has not appeared in the literature. This is possibly because the initial appearance of such behaviours is outwith the experimenter's control and, furthermore, these behaviours are normally peculiar to the individual and therefore difficult to measure quantitatively. The present investigation used a technique which made it likely that a certain behaviour would occur as the <b>stereotyped</b> collateral <b>behaviour,</b> and allowed a degree of quantitative measurement of this behaviour. It was hoped that investigation of <b>stereotyped</b> collateral <b>behaviours</b> would throw some light on the wider question of how organsisms space responses accurately in time...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: sows; nutrition; welfare; stereotyped behaviour; {{foraging}} behaviour; feeding motivation; satiety; dietary fibre; non-starch polysaccharides; blood glucose; fermentation; volatile {{fatty acids}} Non-lactating sows often show abnormal <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour,</b> which indicates impaired welfare. Theoretically, sow welfare can be improved by allowing expression of natural behaviour (stimulation of behavioural satiety) or by providing sows with a diet that increases or prolongs the feeling of satiety without providing an excess of digestible energy (stimulation of nutritional satiety). Both possibilities are addressed within this thesis. In order to stimulate behavioural satiety {{the effect of the}} presence of rooting-material (or bedding material) was studied in sows with restricted or free access to feed. In addition, provision of feed in the rooting-material in order to stimulate foraging behaviour was studied. In order to stimulate nutritional satiety, focus was placed on dietary fibre and especially on the effects of fermentation of dietary fibre in the hindgut. Because fermentation products ({{volatile fatty acids}}) can provide energy to the animal, even several hours after a meal, they may prolong the feeling of satiety. The provision of a low-satiating feed in rooting-material does not have any added value in the improvement of welfare above that of the presence of rooting-material itself. In order to reduce <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour,</b> it is more effective to aim for nutritional satiety than to provide rooting-material on the floor. Stress hormone levels, however, indicate that even sows with free access to feed appreciate the presence of rooting-material. Fibre-rich feed reduces <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> and physical activity and causes more stable blood glucose levels than fibre-poor feed. Fermentation of fibre has an effect on physical activity and stability of blood glucose levels. The specific effect of fermentation on <b>stereotyped</b> <b>behaviour</b> remains to be investigated. Increased gut fill by fibrous feed may play the most important role in the reduction in the development of this behaviour. Due to the combined effects of increased gut fill, prolongation of eating and chewing time, and fermentation it is advisable to provide non-lactating sows with fermentable dietary fibre...|$|E
