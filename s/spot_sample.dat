Archived residual dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> from national newborn screening programs may provide DNA from entire populations and medical registries the corresponding clinical information. The amount of DNA available in these samples is however rarely sufficient for reliable genome-wide scans, and whole-genome amplification may thus be necessary. This study assess {{the quality of}} DNA obtained from different amplification protocols by evaluating fidelity and robustness of the genotyping of 610, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, using the Illumina Infinium HD Human 610 -Quad BeadChip. Whole-genome amplified DNA from 24 neonatal dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> stored between 15 to 25 years was tested, and high-quality genomic DNA from 8 of the same individuals was used as reference.

Thirty-six Merino wethers were allocated to 1 of 4 diets with differing levels of sodium addition (0, 0. 87, 2. 18, 3. 48 mol Na/kg DM, equivalent to 0, 20, 50 and 80 g Na/kg DM). Urinary collections began 5 weeks after the sheep had been introduced to the diet. Total urine output was collected daily for 3 days to determine the pattern of sodium and creatinine excretion relative to sodium intake. Also over the 3 days, 4 spot samples of urine were taken at different times of the day. The Na : Creat ratio in urine predicted daily sodium intake with an r 2 of 0. 82. There was significant variation in the estimation of sodium intake depending on the time of <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> collection. This variation was attributed to diurnal variation in the Na : Creat ratio due to differences in renal clearances of sodium and creatinine, possibly caused by the feeding patterns in the experiment.

If the UIC were {{to be used to}} assess individuals, it is unclear how many repeat urine collections would be needed and if the collections should be <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> or 24 -h samples. In a prospective, longitudinal, 15 -mo study, healthy Swiss women (n = 22) aged 52 - 77 y collected repeated 24 -h urine samples (total n = 341) and corresponding fasting, second-void, morning <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> (n = 177). From the UIC in <b>spot</b> <b>samples,</b> 24 -h urinary iodine excretion (UIE) was extrapolated based on the age- and sex-adjusted iodine:creatinine ratio. Measured UIE in 24 -h samples, estimated 24 -h UIE, and UIC in <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> were (geometric mean +/- SD) 103 +/- 28 mu g/ 24 h, 86 +/- 33 mu g/ 24 h, and 68 +/- 28 mu g/L, respectively, with no seasonal differences.

Two version of the sampler were used. One for mercury that consists on 47 [*]mm Empore™ disks of iminodiacetic chelating groups as the receiving phase overlaid by a diffusion membrane of polyethersulphone; and other for organotin compounds comprising a C 18 disk and a cellulose acetate membrane.

Background:  The use of early morning sputum samples (EMS) to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) can result in treatment delay given the need for the patient to return to the clinic with the EMS, increasing the chance of patients being lost during their diagnostic workup. However, there is little evidence to support the superiority of EMS over <b>spot</b> sputum <b>samples.</b> In this new analysis of the REMoxTB study, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of EMS with <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> for identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis pre- and post-treatment. Methods:  Patients who were smear positive at screening were enrolled into the study. Paired sputum samples (one EMS and one spot) were collected at each trial visit pre- and post-treatment. Microscopy and culture on solid LJ and liquid MGIT media were performed on all samples; those missing corresponding paired results were excluded from the analyses. Results:  Data from 1115 pre- and 2995 post-treatment paired samples from 1931 patients enrolled in the REMoxTB study were analysed. Patients were recruited from South Africa (47 %), East Africa (21 %), India (20 %), Asia (11 %), and North America (1 %); 70 % were male, median age 31  years (IQR 24 – 41), 139 (7 %) co-infected with HIV with a median CD 4 cell count of 399 cells/μL (IQR 318 – 535). Pre-treatment <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> had a higher yield of positive Ziehl–Neelsen smears (98 % vs. 97 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 02) and LJ cultures (87 % vs. 82 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 006) than EMS, but there was no difference for positivity by MGIT (93 % vs. 95 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 18). Contaminated and false-positive MGIT were found more often with EMS rather than <b>spot</b> <b>samples.</b> Surprisingly, pre-treatment EMS had a higher smear grading and shorter time-to-positivity, by 1  day, than <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> in MGIT culture (4. 5 vs. 5. 5  days, P[*]<[*] 0. 001). There were no differences in time to positivity in pre-treatment LJ culture, or in post-treatment MGIT or LJ cultures. Comparing EMS and <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> in those with unfavourable outcomes, there were no differences in smear or culture results, and positive results were not detected earlier in Kaplan–Meier analyses in either EMS or <b>spot</b> <b>samples.</b> Conclusions:  Our data do not support the hypothesis that EMS samples are superior to <b>spot</b> sputum <b>samples</b> in a clinical trial of patients with smear positive pulmonary TB.

However, variable exposure and short biological half-lives of OP pesticides {{could result in}} highly variable measurements, leading to exposure misclassification. Objective: We examined within- and between-child variability in DAP metabolites in urine samples collected during 1 week. Methods: We collected <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> over 7 consecutive days from 25 children (3 – 6 years of age). On two of the days, we collected 24 -hr voids. We assessed the reproducibility of urinary DAP metabolite concentrations and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> as predictors of high (top 20 %) or elevated (top 40 %) weekly average DAP metabolite concentrations. Results: Within-child variance exceeded between-child variance {{by a factor of}} two to eight, depending on metabolite grouping. Although total DAP concentrations in single <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> were moderately to strongly associated with concentrations in same-day 24 -hr samples (r ≈ 0. 6 – 0. 8, p 1 day apart and in 24 -hr samples collected 3 days apart were weakly correlated (r ≈ – 0. 21 to 0. 38). Single <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> predicted high (top 20 %) and elevated (top 40 %) full-week average total DAP excretion with only moderate sensitivity (≈ 0. 52 and ≈ 0. 67, respectively) but relatively high specificity (≈ 0. 88 and ≈ 0. 78, respectively).

Samplers spiked with performance reference compounds (PRCs) were deployed for either 14 or 28 days. Ten <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> of water were collected over the course of the trial and filtered through a 0. 7 mu m glass fibre filter. Concentrations of pollutants measured using the Chemcatcher were compared with the average concentrations found in <b>spot</b> <b>samples.</b> This study describes the operational performance of Chemcatcher for measuring hydrophobic (log K-OW 3. 7 - 6. 8) chemicals in surface water. Site specific Chemcatcher sampling rates up to 0. 5 L d(- 1) were found using the PRC approach that reduced the uncertainty in estimates of sampling kinetics where temperature, local flow conditions and biofouling potential varied between sites and seasons, and with time during sampler exposure. The limits of quantification of sampled analytes ranged from one to tens ng L- 1. Highest sensitivity was achieved for compounds with a favourable combination of low instrument quantification limits and high sampling rates including dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, lindane, pentachlorobenzene, and PAHs with less than five aromatic rings. The direct comparison of time weighted average (TWA) concentrations (mostly close to method limits of detection) obtained using passive and <b>spot</b> <b>sampling</b> was possible for lindane, hexachlorobenzene, and PAHs < 4 rings. Implications of using the Chemcatcher in regulatory monitoring programmes such as the European Union Water Framework Directive are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Published onlineJournal ArticleThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Wiley Open Access via the DOI in this record. OBJECTIVE: Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and minor strokes are {{important}} risk factors for recurrent strokes. Current stroke risk prediction scores such as ABCD 2, although widely used, lack optimal sensitivity and specificity. Elevated urinary albumin excretion predicts cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality. We explored the role of microalbuminuria (using albumin creatinine ratio (ACR)) in predicting recurrence risk in patients with TIA and minor stroke. METHODS: Urinary ACR was measured on a <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> in 150 patients attending a daily stroke clinic with TIA or minor stroke. Patients were followed up at day 7, 30, and 90 to determine recurrent stroke, cardiovascular events, or death. Eligible patients had a carotid ultrasound Doppler investigation. High-risk patients were defined as those who had an event within 90  days or had > 50 % internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. RESULTS: Fourteen (9. 8 %) recurrent events were reported by day 90 including two deaths. Fifteen patients had severe ICA stenosis. In total, 26 patients were identified as high risk. These patients had a higher frequency of previous stroke or hypercholesterolemia compared to low-risk patients (P =  0. 04). ACR was higher in high-risk patients (3. 4 [95 % CI 2. 2 - 5. 2] vs. 1. 7 [1. 5 - 2. 1] mg/mmol, P =  0. 004), independent of age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes, and previous stroke. An ACR greater than 1. 5  mg/mmol predicted high-risk patients (Cox proportional hazard ratio 3. 5 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 9. 5, P =  0. 01). INTERPRETATION: After TIA or minor stroke, a higher ACR predicted recurrent events and significant ICA stenosis. Incorporation of urinary ACR from a <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> in the acute setting could improve risk stratification in patients with TIA and minor stroke.

40|$|BackgroundWe {{assessed}} {{the integration of}} PMTCT services during the postpartum period including early infant diagnosis of HIV (EID) and adult and pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) in {{maternal and child health}} (MCH) facilities in ZimbabweMethods and FindingsFrom August to December 2012 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of 151 MCH facilities. A questionnaire was used to survey each site about staff training, dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> (DBS) collection, turnaround time (TAT) for test results, PMTCT services, and HIV care and treatment linkages for HIV-infected mothers and children and HIV-exposed infants. Descriptive analyses were used. ConclusionsZimbabwe has successfully scaled up and integrated the national EID and PMTCT programs into the existing MCH setting. The long TAT of infant DBS test results and the lack of integrated ART programs in the MCH setting could reduce effectiveness of the national PMTCT and ART programs. Addressing these important gaps will support successful implementation of the 2014 Zimbabwe's PMTCT guidelines under which all HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women will be offered life-long ART and decentralized ART care.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{formation}} of antibodies to Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{may be the}} earliest indicator of pulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. To enable easy sampling in babies and young children an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a blood <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> taken on to blotting paper was developed. A sample of approximately 20 RI of blood was required. A high correlation and level of absolute agreement was shown between paired finger prick and venepuncture blood spots, and between blood spot, serum spot, and serum samples. Healthy controls and non-infected patients with cystic fibrosis had low titres of antibody compared with patients with intermittent and chronic infection. The latter groups had signifi-cantly greater antibody titres than normal controls. This assay permits serial measurement of antibodies to P aeruginosa in patients of all ages with cystic fibrosis and may provide a means of assessing the value of such measurements in the detection and management of early infection. Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aerugi-nosa is {{the main cause of}} morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. ' There may be a period of harmless colonisation of the respiratory trac...|$|E

40|$|HIV {{associated}} TB is {{not easy}} to make diagnosis and is linked with extreme disease and death. The spread of MDR-TB, together with increasing harmful of HIV infection and inadequate availability of quick examination instrument have lead to cause disappointment of global TB control. The intention {{of the study was to}} evaluate Gene Xpert MTB/RIF technique and smear auramine LED FM technique for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in people living with HIV at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital Zanzibar. The study was experimental type of design that involved laboratory analysis of sputum specimens for determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as rifampicin resistance for HIV patients. The specimens were processed in Gene Xpert MTB/RIF and smear auramine LED FM. The sum of 246 patients sputum specimens were analyzed for the existence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by means of Gene Xpert MTB/RIF and LED FM techniques. The results showed that 169 (68. 7 %) <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> (sample I) and 169 (68. 7 %) morning samples (sample II) were positive for Gene Xpert MTB/RIF technique. Then 112 (45. 5 %) <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> (sample I) and 118 (48. 0 %) morning samples (sample II) were smear positive (LED FM). The sensitivity of LED FM in <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> and morning samples were 66. 3 % and 69. 8 % respectively. Among 169 positive TB cases 2 patients were found with rifampicin resistance. The outcome of this study indicated that the performance of Gene Xpert MTB/RIF machine is more accuracy than LED FM in diagnosis of PTB in HIV patients suspected with TB. Gene Xpert MTB/RIF may be significant as a single quick method for PTB case finding in HIV patients suspected with active TB...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of the}} Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union (EU) {{to achieve}} good quality status for all European waters is ambitious and will succeed only if {{decisions}} concerning remedial action are based on sound information. Current regulatory practice based on <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> of water and comparisons of measured levels of priority pollutants with environmental quality standards will not provide data of the required reliability. Application of alternative methods (emerging methods) that can provide more representative data than infrequent <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> can overcome some of the drawbacks of <b>spot</b> <b>sampling</b> linked with classical chemical analysis. Some emerging methods replace the analytical step but still depend on bottle sampling; others can be used on-site or in situ. Another class, including passive samplers, provides more representative sampling. A further set of emerging tools is based on biological systems and provides information concerning water quality {{that is different from}} that provided by chemical analysis. In order for these methods to be useful {{within the context of the}} WFD, they must provide cost-effective, reliable, representative information. The potential of a range of candidate methods has been investigated in field trials within the SWIFT-WFD EU Project (No. SSPI-CT- 2003 - 502492). This article uses case studies to illustrate potential applications of some types of emerging monitoring tools, and indicates where research and development are needed to enable their adoption within the context of the WFD...|$|R
