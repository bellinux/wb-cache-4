5000|$|Bacterial {{transformation}} {{involves the}} transfer of DNA from a donor to a recipient bacterium through the intervening liquid medium. Recipient bacteria must first enter a special physiological state termed competence to receive donor DNA. A. calcoaceticus is induced to become competent for natural transformation by dilution of a <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> into fresh nutrient medium. [...] Competence is gradually lost during prolonged exponential growth and for a period after entrance into the stationary state. The DNA taken up {{may be used to}} repair DNA damage or as a means to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. [...] Natural transformation in A. calcoaceticus may protect against exposure to DNA-damaging conditions in the natural environment of these bacteria, as appears to be the case for other bacterial species capable of transformation.|$|E

The center of the town, especially the main street, Milinka Kušića, retains its original appearance dating back to the middle of the 19th century. Most of the structures were built after the Great Fire in 1846, which burned the town to the ground which was stopped after some houses where blown up to prevent spread. The Old Bazaar was used for a decades as backdrop for movies and TV shows in the golden-age of Yugoslavian cinematography. Promotion of the Old Bazaar as a place for making films started with Soja Jovanović making the first version of Branislav Nušić's Sumnjivo lice, in the 1950s. Later Zdravko Šotra made the TV show Više od igre, and after that, the movies Sok od šljiva and Užička republika. The 19th century ambiance of the area was desirable for these films, and Ivanjica was named [...] "Little Hollywood".|$|E

Although the rate of virus infection was a little low at 24 to 28 °C, the final cell infectivity {{was similar to that}} at a constant temperature of 28 °C. The production of OB was increased from 13. 4 to 17. 4 /cell in <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> and from 13. 9 /cell to 18. 1 /cell in suspension culture.

Inoculated cultures were rolled at 2, 96, or 383 rpm, while <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> served as controls. At 24 h, inoculated cultures rolled at 96 rpm had a 6. 8 -fold increase in foci when compared with <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> (P less than 0. 01) and a 2. 8 -fold increase over cultures rolled at 2 rpm (P less than 0. 05). Cultures rolled at 2 rpm had a 2. 4 -fold increase in foci over <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> (P less than 0. 05). Viral yield results correlated with focus results. Significantly more virus was present in cultures rolled at 96 rpm (7. 3 -fold) than in <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures.</b> Cultures rolled at 2 rpm produced 2. 9 -fold more virus than <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> (P less than 0. 05). Of 37 cultures rolled at 96 rpm, 33 (89 %) were cytopathic effect positive at 96 h, while 18 of 40 (45 %) were positive at 2 rpm and only 2 of 37 (5 %) were positive for <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> (P less than 0. 01).

40|$|The {{relative}} {{synthesis of}} the brain-specific s 100 protein increased as clonal rat glial cells, C 6, progressed from logarithmic to stationary growth in monolayer culture. Drugs that disrupt microtubules, such as colchicine, vinblastine, Colcemid, and podophyllotoxin, inhibited the relative synthesis of S 100 protein in <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures.</b> Colchicine (0. 1 muM) caused a 50 % inhibition of the relative synthesis of S 100 protein whereas lumicolchicine,an isomer of colchicine that does not disrupt the microtubular system, had no effect. Succinylated concanavalin A (500 mug/ml) increased relative synthesis in logarithmic but not <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures.</b> These results suggest that signals inducing {{an increase in the}} relative synthesis of S 100 protein in <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> are transmitted intracellularly from the cell membrane by the microtubular network...|$|R
40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{effect of}} inulin added to MRS medium on growth and bacteriocin production by L. plantarum ST 16 Pa {{was investigated in}} <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> in anaerobic jars with medium containing 0. 025 % sodium thioglycolate or in flasks shaken at 100 rpm. In the presence of 1 % inulin in anaerobic <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures,</b> this strain produced lactic acid {{at a level that}} was 36. 5 % higher than {{in the absence of the}} polysaccharide. In shaken cultures without inulin, cell count was 54 % higher than in the stationary ones. Under stationary conditions in anaerobic jars, the addition of inulin increased the maximum specific growth rate from 0. 37 to 0. 49 h− 1 and reduced the generation time from 1. 85 h to 1. 40 h. Consequently, the exponential phase was shortened from 12 to 9 h when the cells were grown in <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> with the oxygen scavenger. Despite this effect of inulin on growth rate, <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> without inulin displayed higher antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes L 104 (3200 AU/mL) than cultures with inulin (1600 AU/mL); therefore, inulin behaved as a compound able to accelerate growth rather than to stimulate bacteriocin production. The results presented in this study are very promising, as L. monocytogenes is a well-known foodborne pathogenic microorganism. Moreover, L. plantarum ST 16 Pa has proven to be a potential producer of a natural food preservative at an industrial level...|$|R
40|$|HeLa S 3 cells, a clonal strain {{adapted for}} growth in {{suspension}} culture, contain adenylate cyclase {{activity that is}} stimulated by glucagon, prostaglandin E 1, and epinephrine. Total enzymatic activity and response to hormones is increased {{as a result of}} these cells being in <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> for several days. The parental strain of HeLa cells normally grown in <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> shows even greater adenylate cyclase activity. Hepatoma (HTC) cells grown in suspension culture have no detectable adenylate cyclase activity, but when grown in <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> they contain low, but detectable, amounts of adenylate cyclase, which is stimulated by glucagon, epinephrine, or prostaglandins. Chang's liver cells, both suspension and <b>stationary</b> <b>culture,</b> contain relatively high levels of adenylate cyclase that is stimulated by epinephrine or prostaglandin E 1, with differences in activity depending upon culture conditions. Adenylate cyclase of 3 T 3 and L 929 mouse fibroblasts respond to catecholamines, as well as to prostaglandin E 1, but not to glucagon. Characteristic increases in basal activity of adenylate cyclase and in activity in the presence of hormone occurred as cell density increased during <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> of certain cell lines, but do not occur with fluoride ion present. In addition to the influence of growth conditions and rate or phase of cell growth on cyclase activity and hormonal response, the cultured cell lines frequently showed marked differences in activity from one another; malignant cells generally exhibited less activity. It is postulated that adenylate cyclase activity may be enhanced by cell to surface contact or cell to cell interaction and that this phenomenon may represent a form of self regulation or modulation of hormonal response by a tissue...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to isolate the {{antagonist}} from rhizosphere soil and evaluate its potential for biocontrol of anthracnose disease in orchid. The potential microbial antagonist, designated SRA 14, was isolate and identified as Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Cell-free culture filtrates of Streptomyces hygroscopicus SRA 14 inhibited the growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The percentage of growth inhibition by the <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> filtrate was significantly higher than that of exponential-culture filtrate. Additionally, morphological changes such as hyphal swelling and abnormal shapes were observed in fungi grown on potato dextrose agar that contained the culture filtrates. Application of culture filtrates was able to prevent the expression of anthracnose disease on orchid, indicating that disease inhibition was due to antifungal metabolites in the culture filtrates. No significantly the prevention of anthracnose development was observed in the <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> filtrate and mancozeb-treated leaves.

In general, when proline, asparagine, casein, and ammonium sulfate were used as sole nitrogen sources, they supported more growth and toxin production than tryptophan or methionine. However, proline stimulated more toxin production per gram of mycelium in <b>stationary</b> <b>cultures</b> than the other nitrogen sources, including the amino acid asparagine, which is generally recognized as supporting good aflatoxin production.

A potent antagonist against both plant pathogenic fungi, designated SRA 14, was selected and identified as Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The strain SRA 14 highly produced extracellular chitinase and &# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase during the exponential and late exponential phases, respectively. Culture filtrates {{collected from the}} exponential and stationary phases inhibited the growth of both the fungi tested, indicating that growth suppression was due to extracellular antifungal metabolites present in culture filtrates. The percentage of growth inhibition by the <b>stationary</b> <b>culture</b> filtrate {{was significantly higher than}} that of exponential culture filtrate. Morphological changes such as hyphal swelling and abnormal shapes were observed in fungi grown on potato dextrose agar that contained the culture filtrates.
