5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E

5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer.

5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} {{too young to}} compete as a senior in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} for {{a place on the}} U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.

Furthermore, the company was also considering making a sequel to the original game. The Kickstarter failed, only gaining $39,843 of its $330,000 goal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E

5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E

5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
