It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please <b>Save</b> <b>My</b> Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of the climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E
