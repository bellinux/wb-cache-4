40|$|ABSTRACT: This study assesses whether eleven factors {{associate}} with higher impact research: individual, institutional and international collaboration; journal and reference impacts; abstract readability; reference and keyword totals; paper, abstract and title lengths. Authors {{may have some}} control over these factors and hence this information may help them to conduct and publish higher impact research. These factors have been previously researched but with partially conflicting findings. A simultaneous assessment of these eleven factors for Biology & Biochemistry, Chemistry and Social Sciences used a single negative binomial-logit hurdle model estimating the percentage change in the mean citation counts per unit of increase or decrease in the predictor variables. The journal Impact Factor was found to <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> with increased citations in all three areas. The impact {{and the number of}} cited references and their average citation impact also <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> with higher article citation impact. Individual and international teamwork give a citation advantage in Biology & Biochemistry and Chemistry but inter-institutional teamwork is not important in any of the three subject areas. length <b>significantly</b> <b>associates</b> with increased citations but the number of keywords, title length and paper length are insignificant or of no practical significance. In summary, at least some aspects of collaboration, journal and document properties <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> with higher citations. The results provide new and particularly strong statistical evidence that the authors should consider publishing in high impact journals, ensure that they do not omit relevant references, engage in the widest possible team working, when appropriate, and write extensive abstracts. A new finding is that whilst is seems to be useful to collaborate and to collaborate internationally, {{there seems to be no}} particular need to collaborate with other institutions within the same country...|$|R
40|$|Pre-operative kidney {{volume is}} an {{independent}} predictor of glomerular filtration rate in renal cell carcinoma patients. Compensatory renal growth (CRG) can ensue prior to nephrectomy in parallel to tumor growth and benign parenchyma loss. We aimed to test whether renal metabolite abundances <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> with CRG, suggesting a causative relationship. Tissue metabolomics data from 49 patients, with a median age of 60 years, were previously collected and the pre-operative fold-change of their contra to ipsi-lateral benign kidney volume served as a surrogate for their CRG. Contra-lateral kidney volume fold-change within a 3. 3 +/- 2. 1 years follow-up interval {{was used as a}} surrogate for long-term CRG. Using a multivariable statistical model, we identified metabolites whose abundances <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> with CRG. Our analysis found 13 metabolites in the benign (e. g. L-urobilin, Variable Influence in Projection, VIP, score = 3. 02, adjusted p = 0. 017) and 163 metabolites in the malignant (e. g. 3 -indoxyl-sulfate, VIP score = 1. 3, adjusted p = 0. 044) tissues that <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> with CRG. Benign/tumor fold change in metabolite abundances revealed three additional metabolites with that <b>significantly</b> positively <b>associate</b> with CRG (e. g. p-cresol sulfate, VIP score = 2. 945, adjusted p = 0. 033). At the pathway level, we show that fatty-acid oxidation is highly enriched with metabolites whose benign tissue abundances strongly positively associate with CRG, both pre-operatively and long term, whereas in the tumor tissue significant enrichment of dipeptides and benzoate (positive association), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, lysolipid and nucleotide sugar pentose (negative associations) sub-pathways, were observed. These data suggest that specific biological processes in the benign {{as well as in the}} tumor parenchyma strongly influence compensatory renal growth...|$|R

40|$|CRP is a {{recognized}} marker of systemic inflammation. The {{degree to which}} CRP is associated with carotid and/or femoral intima media thickness (IMT), markers of atherosclerosis, may quantify {{the degree to which}} inflammation explains cardiovascular disease in patients with end stage renal disease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the association between CRP and both carotid and femoral IMT in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The present cross-sectional study is nested in the Sevelamer hydrochloride and ultrasound-measured femoral and carotid intima media thickness progression in end stage renal disease (SUMMER) clinical trial. Carotid (common, internal and bifurcation) and femoral arteries were visualized in B-mode ultrasonography. CRP was measured in serum. The study cohort included 177 HD patients (39. 5 % female, mean age 67. 8 Â± 11. 5 years). All measures of both carotid and femoral IMT were <b>significantly,</b> positively <b>associated</b> with CRP. Compared to subjects without, subjects with PVD, coronary revascularization and hypertension had significantly higher CRP levels. Conversely, subjects treated with sevelamer hydrochloride had significantly lower CRP levels than those not exposed to this medication. CRP was <b>significantly,</b> positively <b>associated</b> with serum phosphorus, calcium and PTH, and <b>significantly</b> inversely <b>associated</b> with HDL. In conclusion, CRP is <b>significantly,</b> positively <b>associated</b> with both femoral and carotid IMT and suggests an association between inflammation and atherosclerosis in HD patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Determining {{the most}} {{important}} demographic correlates of sedentary behavior and physical activity will help identify the groups of children that are {{most in need of}} intervention. Little is known in regards to the demographic correlates of sedentary behavior and physical activity in toddlers (aged 12 â€“ 35 months), where long-term behavioral patterns may initially be formed. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the associations between demographic correlates and specific types of sedentary behavior and physical activity in this age group. Methods Findings are based on 149 toddlers (19. 0 [*]Â±[*] 1. 9 Â months) and their parents (33. 7 [*]Â±[*] 4. 7 Â years) recruited from immunization clinics in Edmonton, Canada as part of the Parentsâ€™ Role in Establishing healthy Physical activity and Sedentary behavior habits (PREPS) project. Toddlersâ€™ and parental demographic characteristics and toddlersâ€™ television viewing, video/computer games, and overall screen time were measured via the PREPS parental questionnaire. Toddlersâ€™ objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity (light, moderate to vigorous, and total) were accelerometer-derived using Actigraph wGT 3 X-BT monitors. Simple and multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine associations. Results In the multiple linear regression models, toddlersâ€™ age, toddlersâ€™ sex (female versus male), toddlersâ€™ race/ethnicity (other versus European-Canadian/Caucasian), and household income ($ 50, 001 to $ 100, 000 versus[*]>[*]$ 100, 000) were <b>significantly</b> positively <b>associated,</b> and main type of child care (child care center versus parental care) was <b>significantly</b> negatively <b>associated</b> with screen time. Similar findings were observed with television viewing, except null associations were observed for toddlersâ€™ sex. Toddlersâ€™ race/ethnicity (other versus European-Canadian/Caucasian) was <b>significantly</b> positively <b>associated</b> and main type of child care (child care center, day home, other versus parental care) was <b>significantly</b> negatively <b>associated</b> with video/computer games. Toddlersâ€™ sex (female versus male) was <b>significantly</b> positively <b>associated</b> with sedentary time and <b>significantly</b> negatively <b>associated</b> with moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity. Conclusions Female toddlers, toddlers from ethnic minority groups, toddlers from families of lower income, and toddlers whose main type of child care is not center-based may be important targets for screen time interventions in toddlers. Apart from sex, demographic correlates may not be important targets for objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity in toddlers...|$|R

Associations with polymorphisms located at six independent loci were also detected; IRF5, STAT4, BLK, IL12A, TNIP1, and CXCR5. This also suggested the activation of the innate immune system, notably through the IFN system, B-cell activation through CXCR5-directed recruitment to lymphoid follicles and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation involving BLK, and T-cell activation owing to HLA susceptibility and the IL-12-IFN-Î³-axis.|$|E
