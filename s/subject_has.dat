However, within Italy, the <b>subject</b> <b>has</b> {{been a matter of}} extensive debate and dispute since the late 1940s to the present and a variety of theories of how Mussolini died has proliferated. At least 12 different individuals have been identified at various times as being responsible for carrying out the shooting. Comparisons have been made with the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, and it has been described as the Italian equivalent of that speculation.|$|E

In seven of these 28 subjects plasma creatinine, calculated glomerular filtration rate and plasma cystatin C were within the reference values.

Seven <b>subjects</b> <b>had</b> Brånemark implants, four <b>subjects</b> <b>had</b> been treated with Astra Tech implants and one <b>subject</b> <b>had</b> a Straumann implant. Eleven <b>subjects</b> <b>had</b> periodontal supportive care performed by their hygienist or general dentist at a frequency of 6  months to once yearly. One subject reported sporadic visits. About 50 % of the subjects performed dental home care twice a day including tooth brushing and interdental cleaning. Access for oral hygiene procedures was deemed acceptable for all the supraconstructions in both groups. None of the re-assessed patients reported prosthodontic retreatment after completing the previous study. Technical complications were observed in two supraconstructions, one with fractured occlusal screw (bridge screw) and one presented a lost filling of the access hole.|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand specimen allocation factors that may impact the validity and reliability of results in longitudinal studies examining within-person changes in biomarker levels. Using data from a randomized clinical trial of an exercise intervention in 136 postmenopausal women, we determined the ef-fect of assaying the baseline and follow-up samples of some subjects in different batches on the interven-tion effect estimates for serum concentrations of estrone, estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone.

40|$|Obesity is an {{increase}} body weight above normal caused by multifactorial such as genetic factor, individual factors and especially the sedentary lifestyle. Worker community are {{recognized as one of}} community at high risk of obesity and the risk can be minimalized by having good knowledge and attitude of obesity and its prevention. The aim of this research was to know the relationship of knowledge and attitude with obesity at the Local Secretary Officer Riau Province. A cross sectional research was performed involving 44 subjects. Obesity was determined by using body mass index. Knowledge and attitude were measured by some questionnaire. The result of obesity showed 50 % samples were obese. The result of knowledge showed 36. 4 % <b>subject</b> <b>had</b> good knowledge, 56, 8 % had enough knowledge and 6. 8 % <b>subject</b> <b>had</b> bad knowledge. Futhermore, the result of attitude showed 11. 4 % <b>subjects</b> <b>had</b> good attitude, 75 % <b>subjects</b> <b>had</b> enough attitude and 13. 6 % <b>subjects</b> <b>have</b> a bad attitude. Statistic analyzing using Kolmogorov Smirnov test showed there was no relationship either between knowledge and obesity or attitude and obesity (p> 0, 05) in this research...|$|R
