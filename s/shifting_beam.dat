In {{our earlier}} works we {{reported}} on experimental results showing how finite length variations {{in a high}} power backward wave oscillator (BWO) will result in sinusoidal variations in both frequency and power outputs. By manually shifting the slow wave structure {{with respect to the}} cutoff neck by one-quarter of a wavelength we were able to achieve maximum frequency agility (large bandwidth). Automated control of the <b>shifting,</b> <b>beam</b> current, and cathode voltage will allow the device to perform specific tasks and will ultimately lead to a “Smart Tube. ” Such tasks may include the ability to maximize power of efficiency for a given frequency, or to achieve maximum frequency agility at a given constant power. Accomplishing these goals requires the development of a learning control system in conjunction with directed hardware. In this paper, we report on various completed subsystems of such a smart tube. In particular, we report on the implementation and testing of a vacuum-compatible step motor assembly and the corresponding motor control, for shifting the slow wave structure. We also report on the design and implementation of a pressure control device for the nitrogen in the spark gap, in order to adjust the cathode voltage. We finally report on the design and simulation of an iterative learning controller which automatically adjusts the pressure and shifting in order to achieve frequency agility. IEE...|$|E

40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} {{the potential benefits of}} applying two embodiments of adaptive lighting to the U. S. and European low-beam patterns: curve lighting that involves <b>shifting</b> the <b>beam</b> horizontally into the curve, and motorway lighting that involves <b>shifting</b> the <b>beam</b> vertically upward. The curve lighting simulations paired 80 -m radius left and right curves with a horizontal <b>beam</b> <b>shift</b> of 15 °, and 240 -m radius curves with a shift of 10 °. The motorway lighting simulations involved upward aim shifts of 0. 25 ° and 0. 5 °. For both curve and motorway lighting, changes in both visibility and glare illuminance were considered. Marketweighted model year 2000 U. S. and European beam patterns were used. We conclude that curve lighting, as simulated here, would substantially improve seeing performance on curves for both types of beams. On left curves (but not on right curves) there would be an increase in disability glare for oncoming traffic. No major discomfort glare problems would be expected. Although the <b>shifted</b> U. S. <b>beams</b> were found to perform slightly better overall than the <b>shifted</b> European <b>beams,</b> the main difference in performance is between the shifted and nominally aimed beams. Motorway lighting, as simulated here, would also substantially improve seeing performance, with the benefits already present at an upward shift of 0. 25 °. Because the increases in glare illuminance would be minor, and because motorways often incorporate median barriers or wide separations between lanes of opposing traffic, we do not expect substantial problems with increased glare. The European beams benefit more from this embodiment of motorway lighting than do the U. S. beams. (This is the case because under nominal aim the European beams provide less visibility illuminance and their vertical gradient is steeper.) Nevertheless, the nominally aimed U. S. beams tend to outperform the European <b>beams</b> <b>shifted</b> upward 0. 25 °...|$|R

Unlike negative-refractive-index focusing implementations, this "meta-screen" does not suffer from image degradation when losses are introduced and is easily scalable from microwave to Terahertz frequencies and beyond. The slotted geometry is designed using {{a theory of}} <b>shifted</b> <b>beams</b> to determine the necessary weighting factors for each slot element, which are then converted to appropriate slot dimensions.

40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{proposed}} a new setup for measuring EMCD experiments, which does — in theory — not rely on a crystalline sample for providing the required phase <b>shifted</b> <b>beams.</b> FEM calculations of the electrostatic potentials caused by phase plates justify the commonly assumed constant phase shift approximation inside a ring electrode for small radii, which are {{an order of magnitude}} larger than their thickness; if the radius is increased by another order of magnitude the phase shift has to be described by a hyperbolic cosine. On the other hand we have shown that the phase shift outside of the ring electrode in general cannot be neglected. Based on these insights we have investigated the intensity distribution and phase difference in the sample plane caused by a twin aperture. Thereby we have demonstrated the effects of different phase shifting models and aberrations. From these we have concluded that aberrations can be neglected for the particular microscope and that the effects of most investigated non-constant phase shift models are still in reasonable agreement with the analytical model as the strongest effects due do non-constant phase shifts appear to be a shift of the non-phase-shifted beam in the sample plane and a “blurring” of the phase <b>shifted</b> <b>beam.</b> Calculations of the expected magnetic signal by Jan Rusz suggest a strong dichroic signal due to interference of the two incident waves assuming plane waves instead of convergent ones. In experiments we have seen that for the construction of phase plates in the condenser system thick layers of Pt are needed and that a common cross over of two incident waves originating from the twin aperture is possible. An interference pattern in this cross over was not observable — mainly due to technical issues. The proposed setup uses convergent waves with a phase difference that is not determined by the crystal structure as in the intrinsic EMCD method, but by the microscope and twin aperture geometry. Thus the phase plate geometry (aperture radius and displacement) would need to be optimized for a specific microscope and the lattice constant of the primary investigated material...|$|R

40|$|Ordinary {{intelligent}} states (OIS) hold {{equality in}} the Heisenberg uncertainty relation involving two noncommuting observables {A, B}, whereas generalized intelligent states (GIS) {{do so in the}} more generalized uncertainty relation, the Schrodinger-Robertson inequality. In general, OISs form a subset of GISs. However, if there exists a unitary evolution U that transforms the operators {A, B} to a new pair of operators in a rotation form, it is shown that an arbitrary GIS can be generated by applying the rotation operator U to a certain OIS. In this sense, the set of OISs is unitarily equivalent to the set of GISs. It is the case, for example, with the su(2) and the su(1, 1) algebra that have been extensively studied particularly in quantum optics. When these algebras are represented by two bosonic operators (nondegenerate case), or by a single bosonic operator (degenerate case), the rotation, or pseudo-rotation, operator U corresponds to phase <b>shift,</b> <b>beam</b> splitting, or parametric amplification, depending on two observables {A, B}.
