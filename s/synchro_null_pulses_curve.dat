40|$|Transabdominal fetal {{pulse oximetry}} is an {{approach}} to measure oxygen saturation of the unborn child non-invasively. The principle of pulse oximetry {{is applied to the}} abdomen of a pregnant woman, such that the measured signal includes both, the maternal and the fetal <b>pulse</b> <b>curve.</b> One of the major challenges is to extract the shape of the fetal <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> from the mixed signal for computation of the oxygen saturation. In this paper we analyze the principle kind of connection of the fetal and maternal <b>pulse</b> <b>curves</b> in the measured signal. A time varying finite element model is used to rebuild the basic measurement environment, including a bulk tissue and two independently pulsing arteries to model the fetal and maternal blood circuit. The distribution of the light fluence rate in the model is computed by applying diffusion equation. From the detectors we extracted the time dependent fluence rate and analyzed the signal regarding its components. The frequency spectra of the signals show peaks at the fetal and maternal basic frequencies. Additional signal components are visible in the spectra, indicating multiplicative coupling of the fetal and maternal <b>pulse</b> <b>curves.</b> We conclude that the underlying signal model of algorithms for robust extraction of the shape of the fetal <b>pulse</b> <b>curve,</b> have to consider additive and multiplicative signal coupling...|$|R

40|$|The {{blood flow}} in the uvea in cats and monkeys during acute {{increases}} of arterial blood pressure is well controlled by a sympathetic mechanism protecting the eye from overperfusion. Ocular macrocirculation (ophthalmic artery) and ocular microcirculation (iris) were examined in 22 healthy subjects during acute increases of arterial blood pressure induced by physical exercise (125 W). With a data acquisition and storage software in real time mode several parameters of ocular perfusion and systemic functions were measured simultaneously. Blood flow parameters were measured in the ophthalmic artery by pulsed Doppler sonography and in the iris by laser Doppler flowmetry. Systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities of the ophthalmic artery peak velocity <b>pulse</b> <b>curve,</b> the ophthalmic artery mean velocity <b>pulse</b> <b>curve,</b> and the iris velocity <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> were estimated off line. The ophthalmic artery mean velocity <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> resembles the integrated velocity of all erythrocytes in the vessel including the slowly running cells near the vessel wall. The iris velocity <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> was calculated by a special statistic procedure (ALDF). After exercise {{there was a significant}} increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> of the ophthalmic artery showed significantly increased systolic and decreased diastolic velocities. The vascular resistance of the branches of the ophthalmic artery increased significantly. The iridal vasculature showed no significant change in blood cell velocity but an increased vascular resistance. It was observed that the elevated perfusion pressure was associated with an increased vascular resistance and a constant mean blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery and iridal vessels. The parallel elevation of vascular resistance and blood pressure during exercise may be the reason for a constant blood {{flow in the}} ophthalmic artery and the iris. This may be accounted for by a sympathetic mechanism for protecting the eye from overperfusion...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Exercise oxygen pulse (O 2 pulse), a {{surrogate}} for stroke volume and arteriovenous oxygen difference, has emerged as an important variable obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the O 2 <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> pattern response to a maximal cycling ramp protocol exhibits a stable linear pattern in subjects reevaluated under the same clinical conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 100 adults (80 males), mean age at baseline of 59 + 12 years, who performed two cardiopulmonary exercise testings (median interval was 15 months), for clinical and/or exercise prescription reasons. The relative O 2 pulse was calculated by dividing its absolute value by body weight. Subjects were classified into quintiles of relative O 2 pulse. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing results and the O 2 <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> pattern, expressed by its slope and intercept, were compared among quintiles of relative O 2 pulse at both cardiopulmonary exercise testings. RESULTS: After excluding the first minute of CPX (rest-exercise transition), the relative O 2 <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> exhibited a linear increase, as demonstrated by high coefficients of determination (R² from 0. 75 to 0. 90; p 0. 05 for all comparisons; except for intercept in the 5 th quintile). CONCLUSION: Excluding the rest-exercise transition, the relative O 2 pulse exhibited a stable linear increase throughout maximal exercise in adults that were retested under same clinical conditions...|$|R

The radio emission from this pulsar exhibits sequences of several tens to several hundreds consecutive burst <b>pulses,</b> separated by <b>null</b> <b>pulses,</b> {{and the appearance of}} the emission seems quasi-periodic. The null fraction from the data is estimated to be 93. 6 %. No emission is detected in the integrated profile of all <b>null</b> <b>pulses.</b> Systematic modulations of pulse intensity and phase are found at the beginning of burst-pulse sequences just after null. The intensity usually rises to a maximum for the first few pulses, then declines exponentially afterwards, and becomes stable after few tens of pulse periods. The peak phase appears at later longitudes for the first pulse, then drifts to earlier longitudes rapidly, and then systematic drifting gradually vanishes while the intensity becomes stable. In this pulsar, the intensity variation and phase modulation of pulses are correlated in a short duration after the emission starts following a null. Observed properties of the pulsar are compared with other nulling pulsars published previously, and the possible explanation for phase modulation is discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It {{is unknown}} whether an {{extremely}} high heart rate can affect oxygen pulse profile during progressive maximal exercise in healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: Our {{aim was to}} compare relative oxygen pulse (adjusted for body weight) curves in athletes at their maximal heart rate during treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing. METHODS: A total of 180 elite soccer players were categorized in quartiles according to their maximum heart rate values (n = 45). Oxygen consumption, maximum heart rate and relative oxygen <b>pulse</b> <b>curves</b> in the extreme quartiles, Q 1 and Q 4, were compared at intervals corresponding to 10 % of the total duration of a cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RESULTS: Oxygen consumption was similar among all subjects during cardiopulmonary exercise testing; however subjects in Q 1 started to exhibit lower maximum heart rate values when 20 % of the test was complete. Conversely, the relative oxygen pulse was higher in this group when cardiopulmonary exercise testing was 40 % complete (p<. 01). Although {{the slopes of the}} lines were similar (p =. 25), the regression intercepts differed (p<. 01) between Q 1 and Q 4. During the last two minutes of testing, a flat or decreasing oxygen pulse was identified in 20 % of the soccer players, and this trend was similar between subjects in Q 1 and Q 4. CONCLUSION: Relative oxygen <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> slopes, which serve as an indirect and non-invasive surrogate for stroke volume, suggest that the stroke volume is similar in young and aerobically fit subjects regardless of the maximum heart rate reached...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the oxygen}} {{saturation}} of an unborn child is an invasive procedure, so far. Transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry is a promising method under research, {{used to estimate}} the oxygen saturation of a fetus noninvasively. Due {{to the nature of}} the method, the fetal information needs to be extracted from a mixed signal. To properly evaluate signal processing algorithms, a phantom modeling fetal and maternal blood circuits and tissue layers is necessary. This paper presents an improved hardware concept for an artificial vascular system, utilizing an FPGA based CompactRIO System from National Instruments. The experimental model to simulate the maternal and fetal blood pressure curve consists of two identical hydraulic circuits. Each of these circuits consists of a pre-pressure system and an artificial vascular system. <b>Pulse</b> <b>curves</b> are generated by proportional valves, separating these two systems. The dilation of the fetal and maternal artificial vessels in tissue substitutes is measured by transmissive and reflective photoplethysmography. The measurement results from the pressure sensors and the transmissive optical sensors are visualized to show the functionality of the pulse generating systems. The trigger frequency for the maternal valve was set to 1 per second, the fetal valve was actuated at 0. 7 per second for validation. The reflective curve, capturing pulsations of the fetal and maternal circuit, was obtained with a high power LED (905 nm) as light source. The results show that the system generates <b>pulse</b> <b>curves,</b> similar to its physiological equivalent. Further, the acquired reflective optical signal is modulated by the alternating diameter of the tubes of both circuits, allowing for tests of signal processing algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Several pulsars show sudden {{cessation}} of pulsed emission, {{which is known}} as pulsar nulling. In this paper, the nulling behaviour of 15 pulsars is presented. The nulling fractions of these pulsars, along with the degree of reduction in the pulse energy during the null phase, are reported for these pulsars. A quasi-periodic null-burst pattern is reported for PSR J 1738 - 2330. The distributions of lengths of the null and the burst phases {{as well as the}} typical nulling time scales are estimated for eight strong pulsars. The nulling pattern of four pulsars with similar nulling fraction are found to be different from each other, suggesting that the fraction of <b>null</b> <b>pulses</b> does not quantify the nulling behaviour of a pulsar in full detail. Analysis of these distributions also indicate that while the null and the burst pulses occur in groups, the underlying distribution of the interval between a transition from the null to the burst phase and vice verse appears to be similar to that of a stochastic Poisson point process.

However, for a valid interpretation, {{the stability of}} this variable over time should be known. The objective was to analyze {{the stability of the}} O 2 <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> relative to body mass in elite athletes. VO 2, heart rate (HR), and relative O 2 pulse were compared at every 10 % of the running time in two maximal CPETs, from 2005 to 2010, of 49 soccer players. Maximal values of VO 2 (63. 4 ± 0. 9 vs 63. 5 ± 0. 9 mL O 2 &# 8226;kg- 1 &# 8226;min- 1), HR (190 ± 1 vs 188 ± 1 bpm) and relative O 2 pulse (32. 9 ± 0. 6 vs 32. 6 ± 0. 6 mL O 2 &# 8226;beat- 1 &# 8226;kg- 1) were similar for the two CPETs (P > 0. 05), while the final treadmill velocity increased from 18. 5 ± 0. 9 to 18. 9 ± 1. 0 km/h (P < 0. 01). Relative O 2 pulse increased linearly and similarly in both evaluations (r² = 0. 64 and 0. 63) up to 90 % of the running time. Between 90 and 100 % of the running time, the values were less stable, with up to 50 % of the players showing a tendency to a plateau in the relative O 2 pulse. In young healthy men in good to excellent aerobic condition, the morphology of the relative O 2 <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> is consistent up to close to the peak effort for a CPET repeated within a 1 -year period.

40|$|A wave is {{described}} {{occurring in the}} venous pulse of man late in the diastolic period. This wave is a diastolic wave, since {{in an increase in}} length of the cardiac cycle it follows the h wave at its regular interval and becomes separated from the a wave of the next cardiac cycle. There is no wave on the venous pulse in man which can be referred to a contraction of the region of the great veins or sinus region of the heart. The h wave is a normal occurrence in the venous <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> from man and the dog. It occurs, according to the experience in this work, in all normal individuals in which the heart rate is sufficiently slow to prevent its obliteration by the a wave. The x wave, while not infrequent, is not always present in man even when the cardiac cycle is of sufficient length to prevent its obliteration by the a wave. This wave has not been observed in the dog. There is no wave on the venous <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> of the dog that can be referred to a contraction of the sinus region of the heart. Extra-systoles from stimulation of the venous region of the dog's heart produce no contraction of this region sufficiently pronounced to be recorded on a venous pulse tracing. After an interval of from 0. 07 to 0. I second, representing the interval of veno-auricular conduction plus the latent period of the auricle, the auricle contracts. Extrasystoles from stimulation of the right auricle show, after an interval following the stimulus much shorter than that noted above and representing the latent period of the auricle, an a wave followed by ventricular systole after the usual a-c interval.

In ten subjects, STIs were recorded at supine rest, sitting, standing, during prompt and sustained squatting and during isometric and dynamic exercise.

In time-of-flight measurements of homemade boron-doped Ni-rich Ni 3 Al, a so-called ladder diagram was constructed from the evaporation data of a pole. This ladder diagram revealed a very high degree of ordering in the alternating pure Ni and mixed Ni/Al planes: only 0. 4 % of the detected Al atoms were located on pure Ni planes. The number of <b>null</b> <b>pulses</b> {{to start a new}} plane was found to be much higher for Ni/Al planes (5 x 10 (2)) than for Ni planes (I x 10 (2)). Moreover, the ladder diagram showed that boron was uniformly distributed through the matrix with nearly all boron found on pure Ni-planes. The suggestion that boron preferentially settles on these planes would be supported by reports of a strong Ni-B bond, since on Ni planes, B atoms can be accommodated on octahedral interstitial sites surrounded by only Ni atoms.

Main outcome measures were PV measured by pulse oximetry, heart rate, and noninvasive mean arterial blood pressure recorded before anesthesia, 15 minutes after induction, and at start of surgery, end of surgery, and eye opening at the end of anesthesia. Carbon dioxide (PETCO 2) and oxygen inspiratory (FI-PO 2) and expiratory (FE-PO 2) concentrations were measured at all times except before anesthesia. Results demonstrated that PVs before anesthesia and at eye opening were lower than 15 minutes after induction and at end of surgery (P <. 05). The PETCO 2 and difference of FI-PETO 2 increased at eye opening compared with the end of surgery (P <. 05). We conclude that the pulse oximetry PV and the increased PETCO 2 could be useful variables to predict timing of recovery in terms of eye opening after intravenous anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-eight {{patients}} with heart failure caused by congestive cardiomyopathy, {{which had been}} diagnosed according to the criteria of Goodwin and Oakley, were treated with beta-blocking agents for six to 62 months, except for four patients who died within two months. Repeated non-invasive investigations were performed before and during treatment as well as exercise tests and chest x-rays. The echocardiographic and <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> findings indicated an improvement in systolic and diastolic myocardial function. The ejection fraction increased from 0. 32 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 42 +/- 0. 04, and the third heart sound amplitude and rapid filling wave were significantly reduced. The functional classification improved in 15 patients while in 12 patients it remained unchanged and in one it deteriorated. During follow-up, 10 patients died, most of them suddenly. The mortality was lower than expected in this severely ill group of patients. The beneficial effect of chronic beta-blockade in {{patients with}} congestive cardiomyopathy suggests that catecholamines {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of congestive cardiomyopathy, and that patients with congestive cardiomyopathy may have inappropriate sympathetic cardiac stimulation which can be reduced by chronic beta-blockade. It is suggested that beta-receptor blockade should be added to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics in all patients with severe myocardial failure caused by congestive cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to compute cardiac out-put (CO) noninvasively and other hemodynamic parameters by a new computer-aided decision system: a Noninvasive Hemodynamic Analyzer (NHA), and use the obtained data to demonstrate hemodynamic instability of two hypertensive patients. The NHA is composed of several instruments, in-cluding an electronic blood pressure instrument (with <b>pulse</b> <b>curve</b> detection), oxymeter (SpO 2), hemoglobinometer and a core-body thermometer. Their data inputs are the dynamic characteristics of the patient’s condition. The static charac-teristics including, date of birth, sex, height, weight and test date are entered manually or via computer. These in-puts are analyzed by a high performance multi-function data acquisition computer. In a recently published retro-spective study of 203 ICU patients thermodilution cardiac output data were compared with NHA computed CO val-ues. Statistical evaluation, concerning bias, precision and accuracy showed clinically acceptable ranges according to a literature survey. The hemodynamic pattern of two essen-tial hypertensive patients were computed by the NHA and diagnostic and therapeutic directions were demonstrated. The NHA computer-aided clinical decision system provides reliable guidance for hemodynamic evaluation and leads to a scientifically based differential diagnosis of hypertensive patients as a promising screening method. Since the NHA system can function separately from direct patient measure-ment, it can be ideally applied to telemedicine applications...|$|R
