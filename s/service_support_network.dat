40|$|Product-service system (PSS) is {{a system}} of products, <b>service,</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>networks</b> and {{infrastructure}} {{that is designed to}} be competitive. The concept of PSS is rather new and currently many companies and governmental institute are eager to implement the PSSs as a new business model. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional model to classify PSS based on three axes. The three axes consist of selling product type, product usage type, and sustainability. The selling product type is classified as physical product, physical product and added services, and product-service system. The product usages type is classified as product-oriented, use-oriented, and result-oriented usage. The sustainability is classified as economy, society and environment. The 3 D model is applied to the surveyed Korean industrial practices to identify some typical migration paths from physical product to PSS. Three typical migration paths are identified and the paths are used to suggest Sustainable PSS(SPSS) development strategies. Three identified paths are value-extended SPSS, positioning-extended SPSS, and field-extended SPSS...|$|R
5000|$|The initial move to PSS {{was largely}} {{motivated}} by the need {{on the part of}} traditionally oriented manufacturing firms to cope with changing market forces and the recognition that services in combination with products could provide higher profits than products alone. Faced with shrinking markets and increased commoditization of their products, these firms saw service provision as a new path towards profits and growth. [...] While not all product service systems result in the reduction of material consumption, they are more widely being recognized as an important part of a firm's environmental strategy. In fact, some researchers have redefined PSS as necessarily including improved environmental improvement. For example,(Mont)defines PSS as [...] "a system of products, <b>services,</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>networks,</b> and infrastructure that is designed to be competitive, satisfy customers' needs, and have a lower environmental impact than traditional business models" [...] Mont elaborates her definition as follows: A PSS is pre-designed system of products, <b>service,</b> <b>supporting</b> infrastructures, and necessary networks that is a so-called dematerialized solution to consumer preferences and needs. It has also been defined as a [...] "self-learning" [...] system, one of whose goals is continual improvement.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The {{current study}} {{examined}} the barriers and perceptions of Welfare Reform of welfare recipients answering questions through a survey in Alaska's Northern Regional area (Appendix A). The areas covered in the survey concerned family health and well-being, barriers to getting a job, {{and how they are}} managing on and off welfare. An area of central concern was to understand how families reported that they were managing after closure. The major problem identified was the ability to pay monthly bills and purchase food. Families were also concerned with finding an appropriate childcare provider and their inability to obtain health care coverage. Most individuals worked part-time jobs with little or no benefits and had problems obtaining health care for their families. Areas for further research were identified. Doubts are raised about how states are administering their welfare programs and how much information clients now about their entitlements. The current study is consistent with other studies that show families lack many of the important resources that are essential for self-sufficiency; i. e., well-paying jobs for low skilled workers, transportation, childcare, health <b>services,</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks,</b> and the financial means to meet basic needs...|$|R

40|$|Society is now, {{more than}} ever, highly {{dependent}} on the large-scale networks that underpin its functions. In relatively recent times, significant failures have occurred on large-scale networks that have a considerable impact upon sizable proportions of the world’s inhabitants. The failure of infrastructure has, in turn, begot a subsequent loss of <b>services</b> <b>supported</b> by that <b>network.</b> Consequently, it is now vitally important to evaluate the robustness of such networks {{in terms of the}} <b>services</b> <b>supported</b> by the <b>network</b> in question. Evaluating network robustness is integral to service provisioning and thus any network should include explicit indication of the impact upon service performance. Traditionally, network robustness metrics focused solely on topological characteristics, although some new approaches have considered, to a degree, the <b>services</b> <b>supported</b> by such <b>networks.</b> Several shortcomings of these new metrics have been identified. With the purpose of solving the drawbacks of these metrics, this paper presents a new measure called endurance, which quantifies the level of robustness supported by a specific topology under different types of multiple failure scenarios, giving higher importance to perturbations affecting low percentages of elements of a network. In this paper, endurance of six synthetic complex networks is computed for a range of defined multiple failure scenarios, taking into account the connection requests that cannot be satisfied. It is demonstrated that our proposal is able to quantify the robustness of a network under given multiple failure scenarios. Finally, results show that different types of networks react differently {{depending on the type of}} multiple failure...|$|R

40|$|Quality of <b>Service</b> (QoS) <b>supporting</b> <b>network</b> architectures, {{like the}} Differentiated Services architecture, require a certain {{agreement}} regarding service levels. Traffic characteristics like data rates {{will be part}} of such agreements and, thus, senders must take care to stay within the agreed limits. Traffic shaping is one important mechanism to avoid penalties in networks (dropped or delayed packets) due to violations of the agreement. This paper presents a new traffic shaper based on Class-Based QoS for Linux that aims at shaping aggregate traffic as well as individual flows within an aggregate. In comparison to other approaches (e. g., Class-Based Queuing), our Flow Based Queuing mechanism causes significantly less jitter. Implemented in end-systems, this approach even benefits from direct interaction with applications to create traffic in accordance to application requirements. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Media Independent Handover (MIH) is an {{emerging}} standard which supports the communication of network critical events to upper layer mobility protocols. One {{of the critical}} features of MIH is the event <b>service.</b> This <b>service</b> <b>supports</b> predictive <b>network</b> degradation events, which are triggered based on link layer metrics. For set route vehicles, the cyclical nature of movement enables a degree of network performance prediction. We propose to capture this performance predictability through a Traffic Route Adapted Weighted Learning algorithm (TRAWL). TRAWL is a feed forward neural network whose output layer is configurable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. TRAWL uses an unsupervised back propagation learning mechanism which captures predictable network behaviour while also considering dynamic performance characteristics. We evaluate the performance of TRAWL using a commercial metropolitan heterogeneous network. We illustrate that TRAWL has significant performance improvements over existing MIH link triggering mechanisms...|$|R
