Near Grand Isle, Louisiana, the team discovered that PAH remained at levels 40 times higher than before the spill. The PAH's were most concentrated in the area near the Louisiana Coast, but levels also jumped 2-3 fold in other spill-affected areas off Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. As of August 2010, PAH levels remained near those discovered while the spill was still flowing heavily. [...] Kim Anderson, a professor of environmental and molecular toxicology, said that based on the findings of other researchers, she suspected that the abundant use of dispersants by BP increased the bio-availability of the PAHs. [...] "There was a huge increase of PAHs that are bio-available to the organisms - and that means they can essentially be uptaken by organisms throughout the food chain." ...|$|E

40|$|Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), seeded in the fall, cold acclimates {{when exposed}} to low fall temperatures. Growth resumes in spring, {{culminating}} in early summer harvest. Winter wheat yield is generally 20 - 25 % higher than spring wheat. However, winter damage/kill can reduce its yield. A {{better understanding of the}} cold acclimation/tolerance process could help in the development of improved breeding strategies for winter wheat hardiness. Transcriptional activators and specific cold regulated (COR) genes are induced as a result of exposure to low temperatures. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the quantitative expression of three COR genes (Wcs 120, Wcor 410 and Wcor 14 b) and one transcriptional activator (WCBF 1) in field-grown wheat using real-time PCR and to establish any association with LT 50 (temperature at which 50 % of plants are killed). Winter Norstar (vrn-A 1 /vrn-A 1), spring Manitou (Vrn-A 1 /Vrn-A 1) and two near-isogenic lines (Spring Norstar (Vrn-A 1 /vrn-A 1) and Winter Manitou (vrn-A 1 /vrn-A 1), respectively) were used in these studies. Plants were sampled on three dates (Sept. 29, Oct. 12 and Oct. 26) in the fall of 2004. Accumulation of WCBF 1 transcripts was highest in Norstar, but in all four genotypes there was an increase in transcripts by the second <b>sampling</b> <b>date,</b> followed by a decline on the third <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> Wcs 120 transcripts increased from the first to the third <b>sampling</b> <b>date</b> in Norstar, Spring Norstar and Winter Manitou, but increased to the second <b>sampling</b> <b>date</b> and decreased by the third in Manitou.

We examined each punch core under a high-magnification microscope (at 10 × to 40 × magnification) {{to determine whether the}} most recently produced tracheid cells were earlywood (i.e., larger, thinner walled cells) or latewood (smaller, thicker walled cells). Overly suppressed growth or poor sample quality occurred in < 5 % of collected punch cores; these samples were not used. For each year at each study area, we determined which trees transitioned between each collection period. Trees were considered to have transitioned during a given time window (between date x and date y) if the punch cores showed earlywood at date x and then latewood at date y. Occasionally, replicate cores from the same tree and same <b>sample</b> <b>date</b> did not match in terms of most recent production of earlywood versus latewood, which is consistent with expected variability in growth patterns around a tree bole (Fritts 1976, Speer 2010). In these cases, we used the earliest date of latewood production as the end date of the transition period. After determining when individual trees transitioned between earlywood and latewood, we calculated the percentage of all trees that transitioned between <b>sample</b> <b>dates</b> for each year at each study area. If > 75 % of trees transitioned between two subsequent <b>sample</b> <b>dates,</b> then we defined the transition period as the month in which the midpoint between the two <b>sampling</b> <b>dates</b> fell. If < 75 % of trees transitioned between two subsequent <b>sample</b> <b>dates</b> (which was the case in two of the seven combinations of study area and year), then three subsequent <b>sampling</b> <b>dates</b> were used and the transition period was defined as the month containing the midpoint between the earliest and latest dates.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Phaseolus coccineus L. plants require insects or {{hummingbirds}} {{to pollinate}} their flowers and set pods. The number of pods {{that can be}} produced by a plant is set {{by the number of}} flowers while the number of seeds is set by the number of ovules within the flowers (Stephenson, 1981). The arrest of the development of the seed after its partial differentiation, - seed abortion-, also determines the number of seeds per plant. The objective of this work is to determine the percentage of seed abortion per plant of two Mexican native varieties of Phaseolus coccineus L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two varieties (accessions no. 8446 and 8448) were selected from the Mexican bean collection of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (INIFAP). Seeds harvested in November 2014, were sown in pots on April 5, 2015 and seedlings were transplanted outdoors on April 20, distant 2 meter apart. The plants were of indeterminate growth, climbing type. There were a natural occurrence of bees, bumblebees, and hummingbirds pollinators during the flowering period. The experiment was a complete randomized design, with two treatments (varieties), five replications (one plant per replication) and five sampling dates (Oct. 14, Nov. 4, Nov. 25, Dec. 9, and Dec. 16). At each <b>sampling</b> <b>date,</b> the mature pods per plant were harvested and opened. The following data were registered: a) the number of normal seeds per pod; b) the number of aborted seeds per pod including early abortions detected with the stereoscopic microscope. The sum of (a) and (b) = c, which represented the potential number of seeds per POD in each <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> It was evident at this point that practically all the pods in a variety had the same potential number of seeds. Therefore, the potential number of seeds per PLANT in each <b>sampling</b> <b>date</b> represented by Y = c*n, where n represents the number of pods per plant in each <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> Following when applicable, the similar procedure for seed abortion: Z = total number of aborted seeds per plant in each <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> The percentage of seed abortion (Z/Y) * 100 (total number of aborted seeds per plant in each sampling date/potential number of seeds per plant in each <b>sampling</b> <b>date)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact that the autumn leaf drop associated with the changing seasons has on water quality. Students in the senior elective, Botany, participated in this study of the main outlet of Turner’s Pond in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The students designated two test sites downstream from the dam that holds back Turner’s Pond. Testing was done October 6 and 7, 2005 and October 27 and 28, 2005. The first dates were prior to the leaf drop and the second dates occurred after leaf drop had started but not yet been completed. The macroinvertebrate sampling site was 100 feet downstream of the dam. The chemical and water quality sampling site was 200 feet downstream of the dam. Students used the sweep method to collect macroinvertebrate samples. The hydrolab was used to sample water quality and a grab sample was taken to measure the nutrient concentrations in the water. The flow and depth meter were used on October 7 th to determine the stream bed depths and water flow to calculate loading. However, severe flooding made this procedure dangerous for the students and teachers on October 27 and 28 th. Students counted and identified the macroinvertebrates sampled at each date. The first sampling yielded a low count that students were able to complete without re-sampling the grid. The second sampling yielded a much higher count of macroinvertebrates that was divided by taking samples from four squares in the first box. The diversity of organisms in the second sampling was also much higher. However, when the major group biotic index was used at the family level the rating for October 7 th was 3. 9 – very good and for October 28 th was 4. 1 – very good. The hydrolab data showed that oxygen levels in the water increased with the cooler temperatures. The pH data showed that the pH on the first <b>sampling</b> <b>date</b> ranged from 4. 3 – 4. 4 and that on the second <b>sampling</b> <b>date</b> the pH ranged from 4 – 4. 1. The specific conductivity held consistently just below 0. 17 mS/cm on the first <b>sampling</b> <b>date</b> and just above 0. 1 mS/cm on the second <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> The grab sample data revealed that both the phosphate and nitrate concentrations were higher on the first <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> Loading was not calculated due to flooding on the second <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> The students determined that the most dramatic difference between the two sampling dates was the drop in pH and the increase in the diversity and number of macroinvertebrates sampled on the second <b>sampling</b> <b>date.</b> These changes would appear to be directly related to leaf drop since the decomposing leaves would have added hydrogen ions to the water and provided more diverse and plentiful food sources for macroinvertebrates. Students realized that the macroinvertebrates could have been grouped by feeding strategy and hope to do this with the data in the future. They also realized that by not calculating loading they did not present a complete picture of the water chemistry. In the future they plan to have more numerous sampling dates throughout the leaf drop time period that will provide a more detailed picture of the changes caused by leaf drop...|$|E
