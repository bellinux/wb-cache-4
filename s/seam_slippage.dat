40|$|The elastic yarns and fabrics {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} in {{last few years}} {{all over the world}} because of their wearing comfort and functionality. The elastane ratio and the subsequent finishing processes influence the fabric mechanical properties and hence performance during sewing. In this paper an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of Lycra percentage, type of sewing thread and silicone finish on sewability of denim fabrics. The seam efficiency was found to be increased with Lycra percentage, while the seam pucker and needle damage were affected by the weights of the fabric rather than the Lycra percentage. The <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> does not show any trend with either of the Lycra percentage or fabric weight. The use of silicone finish reduces the seam efficiency, seam pucker and needle damage while the <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> is increased. The use of cores pun thread though helps to achieve higher seam efficiency; the seam pucker, <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> and needle damage is increased...|$|E
40|$|Slippage {{resistance}} of yarns at a seam in woven fabrics {{is a very}} important factor and very strict claims are raised for this property. It is necessary to know how fabric structure influences on <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> quality before manufacturing the fabric. The purpose of this work was to establish which of the weave factor is most suitable to describe balanced weave fabrics <b>seam</b> <b>slippage.</b> It was investigated <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> characteristics in the fabric and the factor was offered, which characterizes best fabric structure from the thread slippage point of view. Fifteen wool fabrics, which differ only on weave were weaved for investigations. The test was carried out according to LST EN ISO 13936 - 1 standard. First of all, the well known factors such as fabric structure factor P and average float F were investigated and then a new fabric structure factor was offered, which the best characterizes the weave from thread slippage point of view. The proposed model shows good correlation between experimental and theoretical values of the new weave factor. [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presented}} {{study the}} effect of laundering {{on the quality of}} sewn cotton and bamboo plain woven fabrics was investigated considering both the textile parameters and the type of chemical treatment. Quality parameters of sewn cotton and bamboo woven fabrics such as: fabric strength, seam strength and <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> at the moment of 4  mm seam opening were evaluated before and after washing with “Tide” washing powder without softeners or with softeners: “Surcare” and “Pflege Weicspuler”. There was also determined surface density, warp and weft densities as well as thicknesses under the pressures 0. 625  kPa and 3. 125  kPa, and calculated the comparative thickness that was considered as softness or porosity of fabrics. Notwithstanding that both the investigated fabrics were cellulosic their behavior after laundering was different. Under the tested conditions, unwashed and laundered with or without chemical softeners cotton fabric didn’t demonstrate <b>seam</b> <b>slippage.</b> The <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> resistance of laundered without or with softener specimens of bamboo fabric was increased in respect to control fabric. The larger changes in seam efficiency and seam strength because of laundering were determined for bamboo woven fabric then for cotton fabric. They could be influenced by the higher changes in bamboo fabric’s structure. The highest difference between the structure parameters of both fabrics was determined for comparative thickness. It was significantly increased for cotton fabric and decreased for bamboo fabric after chemical softening comparing to untreated fabrics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
50|$|An {{issue with}} lamé {{is that it}} is subject to <b>seam</b> or yarn <b>slippage,</b> making it less than ideal for {{garments}} with frequent usage. Lamé is often used in evening and dress wear and in theatrical and dance costumes. It is a favourite material in futuristic costumes and spacesuits for science fiction television and films.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) The {{purposes of}} this study were (1) to determine if increasing stitches per inch in seam construction would reduce the amount of slippage along seams of 100 % olefin furniture fabrics; and (2) to determine if use of self-adhesive seam tape would reduce the amount of slippage along seams of 100 % olefin furniture fabrics. A test method was proposed that would measure resistance to <b>seam</b> <b>slippage,</b> Five 100 % olefin furniture fabrics were used in the study, specimens were prepared at six, seven and eight stitches per inch and at six stitches per inch with self-adhesive seam tape. All specimens were tested using the method given. The findings of this investigation were a (1) Increasing stitches per inch in seam construction significantly reduced the amount of <b>seam</b> <b>slippage.</b> (2) The use of self-adhesive seam tape significantly reduced the amount of seam slippage; and (3) The test method proposed treated the test specimens uniformly and may be used in future testing with confidence...|$|E

40|$|The stab {{resistance}} of textiles and membranes {{is a very}} important property for several areas. For many applications, which are used in the protection area, aramid woven structures are normally used. A main problem of these panels is the missing yarn friction, whichleads to a high yarn slippage. It allows a knife or another sharp blade to penetrate the fabric, because the yarns slide apart. One solution is to reduce the slippage of the yarns during the penetration through the knife and resultant of this effect a higher absorbing of the impact energy. To determine the influence of this effect, fourdifferent woven aramidstructures with different properties and pattern, were tested against shift by determining the <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> by using the fixed seam opening method. Due to this, the behaviourof stab {{resistance of}} the different aramid fabrics were tested according to theVPAM test instruction “Stab-and impact protection”. The interdependence betweenthe yarn slippage and the stab penetration was tested. A better understanding of this process allows improving fabrics for membranes against stab attacks in future...|$|E
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{chemical}} treatment of textile are widely applied in advanced textile. Finishing of textile can provide additional functional properties for products or/and {{to improve the}} appearance of final product {{as well as to}} improve their mechanical properties. In this research the influence of the industrial treatment of viscose linings on the parameters of fabric surface friction, on fabric surface appearance {{as well as on the}} slippage resistance of yarns at a seam was investigated. Raw, dyed, dyed and softened, dyed and non-slip finished plain weaved linings were investigated. The slippage resistance of yarns at a seam in woven fabrics was evaluated according to standard EN ISO 13936 - 1 : 2004. The friction was investigated according to the standard DIN 53375 in a fabric-fabric friction pair. Surface of raw, dyed, dyed and softened viscose lining was investigated using SEM. The obtained results have shown that the friction parameters as well as the parameters of <b>seam</b> <b>slippage</b> resistance of dyed or dyed and softened fabrics were higher than the ones of raw fabric. The highest differences in those parameters were obtained for lining that was dyed and treated with non-slip finishing. That type of finishing influenced the break of lining yarns without typical to the other investigated linings slipping near a stitching line. [URL] </p...|$|E
