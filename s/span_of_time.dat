Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to perpetual erosion, uplift, and deposition of silt, and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a cliffside at Taihang {{as evidence that the}} area was once the location of an ancient seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles east over an enormous <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|An anime {{television}} {{adaptation of}} To Heart 2 {{was produced by}} OLM's Team Iguchi, directed by Norihiko Sudō, and was scripted by head writer Hiroshi Yamaguchi. Both members had previously served the same positions for the studio's Comic Party anime adaptation, and Yamaguchi was also the main writer for the To Heart anime. The anime series, containing fourteen episodes, was first broadcast in Japan between October 3, 2005 and January 2, 2006 on Television Kanagawa as a UHF anime. Out of the fourteen episodes, thirteen were regular episodes, while a summary episode also aired after the eleventh episode. Inspired by the film Mystery Train, Sudō and the production staff created the series' story as a nonlinear narrative; each episode of the anime follows a different heroine's interactions with the protagonist over the same <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The anime series was released in Japan as seven separate DVD volumes between December 22, 2005 and June 23, 2006 by Imagica. A DVD box set containing the series was released on September 10, 2008. Maiden Japan have licensed the series for a North American release.|$|E

Seoul withdrew after considering the short <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> between 2002 and 2010, as South Korea hosted the 2002 Games in Busan. Evaluation committee of the OCA, headed by the then vice-president of the association Celso Dayrit inspected both the final bidders.
