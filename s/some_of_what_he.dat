25|$|In a 2008 {{discussion}} {{hosted by}} the website Salon, Paul Ehrlich has become more critical of the United States specifically, claiming that it should control its population and consumption as an example {{to the rest of}} the world. He has disavowed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said in The Population Bomb. He still thinks that governments should discourage people from having more than two children, suggesting, for example a greater tax rate for larger families.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlich became {{well known}} for his {{controversial}} 1968 book The Population Bomb, which asserted that the world's human population would soon increase {{to the point where}} mass starvation ensued. Among the solutions he suggested in that book was population control, to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail. Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions; for example, Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an irrepressible doomster. However, Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster. Ehrlich has acknowledged that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> predicted has not occurred, but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct, and that overpopulation is a major problem.|$|E
25|$|Broad was {{headmaster}} of Nelson College for 11 years. In 1927 {{he visited}} the United Kingdom with his wife, and saw how secondary schools were organised there. When he returned to Nelson, he put into practice <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had observed, particularly the house system, which still continues. The latter years of Broad's tenure were dominated by {{the effects of the}} damaging 1929 Murchison earthquake. Three new boarding houses were planned: the new Rutherford and Barnicoat Houses were completed in 1931, and Fell House was temporarily located in nearby Fairfield House. Broad gained extra responsibilities in 1932 as the daytime operations of the Nelson Technical School were merged into Nelson College. He retired as headmaster at the end of 1933, having been at the school for all but five years since 1884.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Eberhardt's {{possessions}} included several of her unpublished manuscripts. Lyautey instructed his soldiers to search for all of her papers {{in the aftermath of the}} flood, and posted those that could be found to Barrucand. After reconstructing them, substituting his own words where the originals were missing or too damaged to decipher, he began to publish her work. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> published is considered to be more his work than Eberhardt's. Barrucand also received criticism for listing himself as the co-author of many of the publications, and for not clarifying which portions of text were his own. The first posthumous story, [...] "Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam" [...] (In the Warm Shadow of Islam) received critical acclaim when it was published in 1906. The book's success drew great attention to Eberhardt's writing and established her as among the best writers of literature inspired by Africa. A street was named after Eberhardt in Béchar and another in Algiers. The street in Algiers is in the outskirts; one writer at the time commented there was a sad symbolism in the fact the street [...] "begins in an inhabited quarter and peters out into a wasteland". She was posthumously seen as an advocate of feminism and decolonisation; according to Hedi Abdel-Jaouad in Yale French Studies, her work may have begun the decolonisation of North Africa. However, Eberhardt's relationship with Lyautey has triggered discussion by modern historians about her complicity in colonialism.|$|E
500|$|In 2001 Chrisye {{released}} the studio album Konser Tur 2001 (Concert Tour 2001), which included two new songs and several old ones. The music video {{for one of}} the new songs, [...] "Setia" [...] ("Loyal"), was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing. Soon afterwards, Chrisye decided to cover <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered the most important Indonesian songs since the country's independence in 1945, ranging from songs from the 1940s like Ismail Marzuki's [...] "Kr. Pasar Gambir & Stambul Anak Jampang" [...] ("Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the Cowlicked Child"), to the late 1990s such as Ahmad Dhani's [...] "Kangen" [...] ("Longing"). It also featured a song written exclusively for the album by Pongky of Jikustik and two duets with Sophia Latjuba. The album, Dekade (Decade), was released in 2002; by October 2003 it had sold 350,000 copies. On 15 December 2002 Chrisye participated in the Bali for the World– Voices of Stars concert at Kartika Beach Plaza to raise funds for the victims of the bombings on 12 October; other acts involved included Melly Goeslaw, Gigi, Slank, and Superman is Dead. On 12 July 2004 Chrisye held a third concert, Dekade, at Plenary Hall. The concert, with a set that contained numerous classics included in Dekade, featured duets with Sophia Latjuba and several of the original performers, such as Fariz RM with [...] "Sakura" [...] and A. Rafiq with [...] "Pengalaman Pertama" [...] ("First Experience"); Gutawa's orchestra again provided the music.|$|E

5000|$|Schmidt {{received}} his PhD in 1844 from the University of Gießen under Justus von Liebig. In 1845, he first announced the {{presence in the}} test <b>of</b> <b>some</b> Ascidians <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called [...] "tunicine", a substance very similar to cellulose. Tunicine now is regarded as cellulose and correspondingly a remarkable substance to find in an animal.|$|R

[...] The Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, publishers of the book, noted that Griffin is a distinguished theologian and praised the book’s religious content, but said, [...] "The board believes the conspiracy theory is spurious and based on questionable research." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 2004 interview, Ehrlich {{answered}} {{questions about the}} predictions he made in The Population Bomb. He acknowledged that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had published had not occurred, but reaffirmed his basic opinion that overpopulation is a major problem. He noted that, [...] "Fifty-eight academies of science said that same thing in 1994, as did the world scientists' warning to humanity in the same year. My view has become depressingly mainline!" [...] Ehrlich also stated that 600 million people were very hungry, billions were under-nourished, and that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct. Retrospectively, Ehrlich believes that The Population Bomb was [...] "way too optimistic".|$|E

2500|$|After several misadventures, and {{escaping}} from Pontius Pilate, Brian {{winds up in}} a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced {{to come up with}} something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a miracle. Their responses grow in fervour and intensity, making it harder and harder for him to get away from them, yet because of the mob's excitement over the 'miracles' they discover, they ultimately end up completely ignoring Brian himself. [...] Judith is the only one that doesn't leave; Brian and Judith then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd outside his mother's house which proclaims him to be the Messiah. Brian's mother protests, telling the crowd that [...] "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy" [...] and, [...] "There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess, all right, but no Messiah." [...] All of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their belief in Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine.|$|E

6000|$|The more {{important}} part of Mr. Forster's fresh material is to come in future volumes, if now, alas! we are ever to have them. For <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> gives us in this we can hardly thank him. One of the manuscripts he has unearthed is the original version of [...] "Baucis and Philemon" [...] {{as it was before}} it had passed under the criticism of Addison. He seems to think it in some respects better than the revised copy though in our judgment it entirely justifies the wisdom of the critic who counselled its curtailment and correction. The piece as we have hitherto had it comes as near poetry as anything Swift ever wrote except [...] "Cadenus and Vanessa," [...] though neither of them aspires above the region of cleverness and fancy. Indeed, it is misleading to talk of the poetry of one whose fatal gift was an eye that disidealized. But we are not concerned here with the discussion of Swift's claim to the title of poet. What we are concerned about is to protest in the interests of good literature against the practice, now too common, of hunting out and printing what the author would doubtless have burned. It is unfair to the dead writer and the living reader by disturbing that unitary impression which every good piece of work aims at making, and is sure to make, only in proportion to the author's self-denial and his skill in ...|$|E
60|$|Indeed, he {{was growing}} less afraid, for the sorrow seemed to swallow that up; the grief at having {{offended}} One so loving was putting out the terror of being punished; or rather, when he thought that this illness was punishment, he was almost glad to have <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> deserved; just as {{when he was a}} little boy, he really used to be happier afterwards for having been whipped and put in the corner, because that was like making it up. Though he knew very well that if he had ten thousand times worse than this to bear, it would not be making up for his faults, and he felt now that one of them had been his 'despising the chastening of the Lord.' And then the thought of what had made up for it would come: and though he had known of it all his life, and heeded it all too little, now that his heart was tender, and he had felt some of the horror and pain of sin, he took it all home now, and clung to it. He recollected the verses about that One kneeling--nay, falling on the ground, in the cold dewy night, with the chosen friends who could not watch with Him, and the agony and misery that every one in all the world deserved to feel, gathering on Him, Who had done no wrong, and making His brow stream with great drops of Blood.|$|E

60|$|It {{was thus}} {{clear to the}} two {{veterans}} of the Encyclopædia that the change for which they had worked was at hand. The press literally teemed with pamphlets, treatises, poems, histories, all shouting from the house-tops open destruction to beliefs which fifty years before were actively protected against {{so much as a}} whisper in the closet. Every form of literary art was seized and turned into an instrument in the remorseless attack on L'Infâme. The conservative or religious opposition showed a weakness that is hardly paralleled in the long history of the mighty controversy. Ability, adroitness, vigour, and character were for once all on one side. Palissot was perhaps, after all, the best of the writers on the conservative side.[192] With all his faults, he had the literary sense. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was true, and some of the third-rate people whom he assailed deserved the assault. His criticism on Diderot's drama, The Natural Son, was not a whit more severe than that bad play demanded.[193] Not seldom {{in the course of this}} work we have wished with Palissot that the excellent Diderot were less addicted to prophetic and apocalyptical turns of speech, that there were less of chaos round his points of burning and shining light, and that he had less title to the hostile name of the Lycophron of philosophy.[194] But the comedy of The Philosophers was a scandalous misrepresentation, introducing Diderot personally on the stage, and putting into his mouth a mixture of folly and knavery that was as foreign to Diderot as to any one else in the world. In 1782 the satirist again attacked his enemy, now grown old and weary. In Le Satyrique, Valère, a spiteful and hypocritical poetaster, is intended partially at least for Diderot. A colporteur, not ill-named as M. Pamphlet, comes to urge payment of his bill.|$|E
