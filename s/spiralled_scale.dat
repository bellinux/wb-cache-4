The cones are usually small, 0.3 - 6 cm long, and often spherical or nearly so, like those of Nootka cypress, while others, such as western redcedar and California incense-cedar, are narrow.

40|$|Original paper can {{be found}} at: [URL] Astronomical Society of the PacificOur study of the grand-design spiral galaxy NGC 5248 reveals that the feature {{previously}} thought to be an inclined disk is in fact an extended bar or semi-major axis 7. 1 kpc, embedded within a fainter outer disk which is visible out to a radius of 17. 2 kpc. NGC 5248 provides a classic demonstration of how an extended large-scale stellar bar embedded within a faint outer disk can be missed if imaging studies lack the sensitivity detect the outer disk. This effect may well lead high redshift studies to underestimate the fraction of barred galaxies. Through multi-wavelength observations and hydrodynamical modeling, we also demonstrate that the grand-design nuclear <b>spiral</b> on <b>scales</b> of 75 - 225 pc in NGC 5248 forms part of an exyended grand-design spiral which can be traced from 8 kpc down to 80 pc {{and appears to be}} driven by the large-scale stellar bar. This study suggests that grand-design <b>spirals</b> on <b>scales</b> of several 10 - 100 pc, which are increasingly common in HST images of galaxies, can be generated by bar-driven gaseous spiral density waves which propagate inside the OILR. This propagation is particularly effective when the central mass concentration is low.

There is a considerable amount of diffuse X-ray emission protruding from the disk in the NW direction out to approximately 6 kpc. We analyse the point source population using a Chandra observation, using a maximum likelihood method to find that the slope of the cumulative luminosity function of point sources in the galaxy is - 0. 77 ^+ 0. 13 _- 0. 1. Using a sample of other local galaxies, we compare the X-ray and infrared properties of NGC 891 with those of 'normal' and starburst spiral galaxies, and conclude that NGC 891 is most likely a starburst galaxy in a quiescent state. We establish that the diffuse X-ray luminosity of <b>spirals</b> <b>scales</b> with the far infra-red luminosity as L_X ∝ L_FIR ^ 0. 87 +- 0. 07, except for extreme starbursts, and NGC 891 does not fall in the latter category.

50|$|Note added 29 November 2006: This {{paper was}} {{submitted}} on 2 September 2006 and {{accepted for publication}} on 26 October 2006. Since then the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project Group has published interesting findings citation:. Their independent survey has included study of the newly discovered fragment F, {{a part of the}} lower back dial which was not available to me. Their reading of the inscriptions on this dial reveals that the function displayed on it was the eclipse cycle of 223 synodic months, distributed around the four-turn <b>spiral</b> <b>scale.</b> (As eclipses of the Sun are rare events, the engraved sequence may, in principle, afford means for dating the Mechanism.) One revolution of the pointer thus represented (223÷4) synodic months, not one draconitic month as I have suggested. The Group offers a modification of my gear train which achieves this function and also incorporates exactly those mechanical features that I characterised as having probably been made redundant by alteration of the instrument. The satisfactory way in which the Group’s suggestions for these parts fall in with my own observations of the artefact itself, and remove residual difficulties with my reconstruction, lead me to believe that they are correct. I have no hesitation either in adopting the Group’s revisions of the function of the lower back dial and of the internal mechanism or in withdrawing statements concerning these features that conflict with them. The changes, though important, are physically quite slight, and do not affect my arguments for other significant features of my reconstruction. I stand by the conclusions of my paper.|$|R
40|$|Nature doesn’t seem {{reducible}} to rigid {{systems and}} classifications. Although resorting to metaphors may {{give rise to}} contradictions, it allows the elaboration of explanatory models which help us to organize thought and to find orientation in the natural world. Giving form through metaphors stands for seeking the way by which mankind looks for both solutions and new configurations to face nature’s enigmas. The creation of morphological and/or evolutionary metaphors framed in a schematic way what Hugo called “man’s groping in the universe of nature”. Circles, arrows, <b>spirals,</b> <b>scales,</b> etc. stood for research directions: for example, scale became metaphor of an “animal universe” that – as it {{was thought to be}} in the Eighteenth Century – organized itself in a bottom-up scale. The circle referred to “metamorphosis” (Alle Glieder bilden sich aus nach ew'gen Gesetzen, /Und die seltenste Form bewahrt im Geheimen das Urbild), which reminds us of Goethe’s thinking. Metaphors are never an aim in themselves: they always determine a way of thinking as well as choices and research directions. Such a use of the linguistic image deeply influences the very notion of metaphor as figures of speech. If, on the one hand, metaphor shows unknown structures of nature, on the other it rediscovers its own ‘naturalness’. Starting from the deep interconnection between functional and formal tasks in morphological discussion, metaphor turned from “figure” to “figuration”, Gestaltung, and in doing so it revealed a dynamic structure able to make us understand new links and directions {{in the sense of a}} metamorphic nature. Far from limiting itself to a historical retrospection, the methodological significance of having recourse to metaphor profoundly informs the most recent questions in the scientific field  and notably in life sciences, in the very moment in which it leads and encourages a renewed dialogue between sciences and philosophy. </p...|$|R

They are particularly useful for spotting seasonal patterns in time series data. This, however, requires expressive vi-sual encoding and efficient interaction. In this paper, we improve existing spiral displays by applying the expressive two-tone pseudo coloring. This allows users to read off data values more precisely. More importantly, we enhance our two-tone spiral display with efficient interaction facilities. These allow for easy exploration of the data space and easy adjustment of a vari-ety of visualization parameters. Our tool is fully implemented and freely available for experimentation...|$|R
