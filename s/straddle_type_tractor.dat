40|$|Titanium dioxide {{materials}} {{have been studied}} intensively and extensively due to photocatalytic applications. A long-standing open question is the energy band alignment of rutile and anatase TiO 2 phases, which can affect the photocatalytic process in the composite system. There are basically two contradictory viewpoints about the alignment of these two TiO 2 phases supported by respective experiments: 1) <b>straddling</b> <b>type</b> and 2) staggered type. In this work, our DFT plus U calculations find that the perfect rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces have the <b>straddling</b> <b>type</b> band alignment, whereas the surfaces with defects can turn the band alignment into the staggered type. The electric dipoles induced by defects {{are responsible for the}} reversal of band alignment. Thus the defects introduced during preparations and post-treatment processes of materials are probably the answer to above open question regarding the band alignment, which can be considered in real practice to tune the photocatalytic activity of materials.

40|$|AbstractAs a kind {{of solid}} waste, the <b>straddle</b> <b>type</b> {{monorail}} vehicle waste tire was not only increased the operating costs, but also brought environmental pollution problems; {{while at the same}} time the rigidity value of bridge-subgrade transition section in existing monorail system was relative big and the settlement difference still exists between transition section and subgrade, these problems would resulted in tensile failure of the transition section under monorail train loads. In order to solve those problems, an idea that using the modified concrete contains rubber powder of <b>straddle</b> <b>type</b> monorail train waste tire as the material of bridge-subgrade transition section is proposed. The finite element software Midas/GTS was being used to analyse the stress and settlement of bridge-subgrade transition section under static and dynamic load. These results shown that, when the rubber concrete was filled above the reference concrete, the maximum stress of bridge-subgrade transition section reduces significantly, the average reduction value is 34. 82 %. at the same time according to the fact, this new methods will save more than one million operating costs per year of Chongqing monorail transit system...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{machinery}} is {{an important}} source of emission of air pollutant in rural locations. Emissions of a specific tractor engine mainly depend on engine speed. Various driving methods and use of implements with different work capacities can affect the engine load. This study deals with the effects of <b>types</b> of <b>tractors</b> and operation conditions on engine emission. In this study two <b>types</b> of agricultural <b>tractors</b> (MF 285 and U 650) and some tillage implements such as centrifugal type spreader, boom type sprayer and rotary tiller were employed. Some of the exhausted gases from both tractors in each condition were measured such as, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2) and nitrogen oxide (NO). Engine oil temperature was measured at every step for both <b>types</b> of <b>tractors.</b> Difference between steady-state condition and operation conditions was evaluated. The results showed all exhaust gases that measured and engine oil temperature at every operation conditions are higher than steady-state condition. A general conclusion of the work was that, using various implements and employing different <b>types</b> of <b>tractors</b> effect on engine emissions. The results of variance analysis showed all exhausted gases had a significant relationship with types of implements used at 1 %. Also, all exhausted gases except CO had a significant relationship with <b>types</b> of <b>tractors.</b> A further conclusion was that NO emission increased as engine oil temperature increased. The final conclusion was about the difference between MF 285 and U 650; using U 650 at operation conditions is better than MF 285 in terms of pollution...|$|R

5000|$|In {{quantum dots}} the band {{energies}} {{are dependent on}} crystal size due to the quantum size effects. This enables band offset engineering in nanoscale heterostructures. It is possible {{to use the same}} materials but change the type of junction, say from <b>straddling</b> (<b>type</b> I) to staggered (type II), by changing the size or thickness of the crystals involved. The most common nanoscale heterostructure system is ZnS on CdSe (CdSe@ZnS) which has a <b>straddling</b> gap (<b>type</b> I) offset. In this system the much larger band gap ZnS passivates the surface of the fluorescent CdSe core thereby increasing the quantum efficiency of the luminescence. There is an added bonus of increased thermal stability due to the stronger bonds in the ZnS shell as suggested by its larger band gap. Since CdSe and ZnS both grow in the zincblende crystal phase and are closely lattice matched, core shell growth is preferred. In other systems or under different growth conditions {{it may be possible to}} grow anisotropic structures such as the one seen in the image on the right.|$|R

40|$|Monorail, was {{put into}} {{operation}} in 1964. Since then, three more monorail systems have been constructed with the active participation of Hitachi in Kitakyushu, Osaka, and Tama. A monorail system is now being constructed in Okinawa; it is scheduled to start operation in 2003. The <b>straddle</b> <b>type</b> monorail can be constructed using the space above public roads without disturbing everyday traffic. Monorail trains with rubber tires are environmentally friendly and produce little noise and vibration. The <b>straddle</b> <b>type</b> monorail has become {{an important part of}} the urban public transportation system, chiefly because of its many advantages over other transportation means including the subway. These advantages include (1) improved environment, (2) a shorter construction period, and (3) lower costs. Thus, the monorail system in Japan is an effective solution to environmental problems and traffic congestion in urban cities, which also stimulates local economy. The demand for urban monorail systems has recently begun to come from smaller local cities where the daily ridership is much lower than that in Tokyo, Osaka, Kitakyushu, and other major cities in Japan. To enhance the financial viability of monorail construction in smaller cities and to construct smaller monorails, the Japan Monorail Association (JMA) set up a research committee to investigate the development of a small monorail. This committee, mainly headed by Hitachi, carried out comprehensive research of the market demand for monorail systems and initiated the development of a compact monorail. Hitachi developed a number of new design elements including an articulated bogie to enable trains to negotiate sharp curves. We also worked to design a compact and light monorail that makes use of next-generation signal systems. These basic elements can also be used for other people-mover systems in amusement parks, airports, and business complexes...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{official}} survey and various reports, the productivity of rice {{production per unit area}} is quite different in every farm. This is because various factors of farm management are effecting to the production processes of rice. From viewpoint of our studies, these factors can be classified into two large groups: {{one of them is the}} economic conditions surrounding outside of farm management, the other is the inside conditions of farm management. Therefore, this report will be limited only to the analysis of the latter conditions, especially of the field situation (fragmentation or size of parcels). In this studies we have three big problems in regard to the tillable land fragmention (size of parcels) now that are effecting to the labor productivity. (1) Determination of the adequate size of parcels to use the draft cattle, utilization of small <b>tractors</b> and Fordson <b>type</b> <b>tractors</b> more efficiently under the present conditions. (2) Clearing up of the relationship between the labor productivity of rice production and the size of parcels of farms. (3) Consideration of the relationship between the diffusion of the small tractors and the tillable land fragmentation (size of parcels) of the villages in southern Okayama Prefecture. The data of using the draft cattle and the small tractors of problem (1) were mainly derived from our survey in Niiike Village of Okayama Prefecture, a large part of which was reported already in "Analysis of Mechanization of Japanese Agriculture" 1960, Sobun-sha, Tokyo. In addition to these data, we obtained some useful data of the utilization of the Fordson <b>type</b> <b>tractors</b> from Agricultural Improvement Section of Okayama Prefectural Office. The data of problem (2) were derived from the basic data of The Survey of Rice Production Cost surveyed by Okayama Statistical Office of Agriculture and Forestry Department in 1959. The data of problem (3) were derived from the World Census of Agriculture and Forestry in 1960. Rearranging and analyzing these basic data for our purpose, we shall conclude the result as follows: (1) The adequate size of parcels to use the draft cattle, small <b>tractors</b> and Fordson <b>type</b> <b>tractors</b> efficiently the area should be larger than 0. 15 ha. 0. 2 ha. and 0. 3 ha. respectively. Therefore, the consolidation of farms are absolutly necessary in Okayama Prefecture because of the average size of parcel is about 0. 1 ha [...] (2) As the size of parcel increases, the working hour for rice production per unit area decreases. The yields of rice per unit area are slightly up with the increase of the size of parcels of farms. Therefore, the labor productivity of rice production is remarkably increased with the expansion of size per parcel. (3) The more the size per parcel increase, the more the rice production per 0. 1 ha. and production cost of rice per koku (150 kg) decrease. (4) We can fine out the good relationship between the diffusion of the small tractors and fragmentation of tillable land (average size of parcels) in the villages in southern Okayama Prefecture...|$|R

The growth mode {{and the structure of}} the overlayer were studied by means of low‐energy electron diffraction (LEED) and core as well as valence level photoemission using synchrotron radiation. The attenuation of substrate core‐level intensities with ZnS deposition indicate layerwise growth. LEED demonstrates the growth of the cubic (zinc‐blende) phase as expected for substrate‐stabilized growth. A minor interface reaction is evident from changes in the appearance of the substrate (Ga 3 d) and overlayer (S 2 p) core levels with increasing thickness. S–Ga bonding was observed in a thin interfacial layer. The valence band offset for this lattice‐matched heterojunction interface system was determined, and found to be of the <b>straddling</b> <b>type</b> (type I); its magnitude is in agreement with predictions based on the dielectric midgap energy model. © 1996 American Vacuum Societ...|$|R
