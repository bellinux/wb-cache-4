40|$|The {{utilisation}} of near-neutral salts as activators {{to produce}} alkali-activated <b>slag</b> <b>cements</b> offers several technical advantages, including reduced alkalinity of the binders, minimising the {{risk associated with}} handling of highly alkaline materials, and better workability of the fresh paste {{compared to that of}} sodium silicate-activated <b>slag</b> <b>cements.</b> Despite these evident advantages, the delayed setting and slow early-age mechanical strength development of these cements have limited their adoption and commercialisation. Recent studies have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome by selecting slags with chemistry, which is more prone to react with near-neutral salts, or by adding mineral additives. A brief overview of the most recent advances in alkali-activation of slags using either sodium carbonate or sodium sulfate as activators is reported, highlighting the role of material design parameters in the kinetics of reaction and phase evolution of these cements, as well as the perspectives for research and development of these materials...|$|R

Simulated phase diagrams for NaOH- and Na 2 SiO 3 -activated slag-based cements demonstrate the high stability of zeolites and other solid phases in these materials.

50|$|Engineers usually {{specify the}} {{required}} compressive strength of concrete, which is normally given as the 28-day compressive strength in megapascals (MPa) or {{pounds per square}} inch (psi).
