40|$|In recent years, Internet {{surveys have}} been widely used by {{researchers}} and companies as a means of data collection. However, few IS studies have discussed the validation of Internet survey research. From the perspective of the positivist and quantitative research, studies that fail to organize a scientific and rigorous research design will harm their finding’s validity, reliability and generalizability. In turn; their contributions to the literature and implications for business are limited. Building on a review of past marketing research studies which were well-developed in Internet survey methodological validation, this study illustrated nine issues for IS researchers to re-consider in their empirical Internet surveys. Alternative ways to enhance the necessary rigor of the survey quality in term of the Internet <b>survey</b> <b>types,</b> population, and pros. /cons. of each <b>survey</b> <b>type</b> were also proposed.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type C isolates cause enteritis necroticans {{in humans}} or necrotizing enteritis and enterotoxemia in domestic animals. Type C isolates always produce alpha toxin and beta toxin but often produce additional toxins, e. g., beta 2 toxin or enterotoxin. Since plasmid carriage of toxin-encoding genes {{has not been}} systematically investigated for type C isolates, the current study used Southern blot hybridization of pulsed-field gels to test whether several toxin genes are plasmid borne among a collection of type C isolates. Those analyses revealed that the <b>surveyed</b> <b>type</b> C isolates carry their beta toxin-encoding gene (cpb) on plasmids {{ranging in size from}} ∼ 65 to ∼ 110 kb. When present in these type C isolates, the beta 2 toxin gene localized to plasmids distinct from the cpb plasmid. However, some enterotoxin-positive type C isolates appeared to carry their enterotoxin-encoding cpe gene on a cpb plasmid. The tpeL gene encoding the large clostridial cytotoxin was localized to the cpb plasmids of some cpe-negative type C isolates. The cpb plasmids in most surveyed isolates were found to carry both IS 1151 sequences and the tcp genes, which can mediate conjugative C. perfringens plasmid transfer. A dcm gene, which is often present near C. perfringens plasmid-borne toxin genes, was identified upstream of the cpb gene in many type C isolates. Overlapping PCR analyses suggested that the toxin-encoding plasmids of the <b>surveyed</b> <b>type</b> C isolates differ from the cpe plasmids of type A isolates. These findings provide new insight into plasmids of proven or potential importance for type C virulence...|$|R
