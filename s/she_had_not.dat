5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall {{may have been a}} precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E

Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas.

He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
