40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) contribute {{to more than}} half of the pollutants present in the atmosphere. Adsorption has been found to be a feasible and an effective method to separate and recover VOCs for further analysis. Activated Spherical Carbon (ASC) adhered onto woven fabric was used as the adsorbent for the present study. In this paper, we review the novel single vapor phase adsorption of homologous aliphatic ketone series from propanone to hexanone onto ASC. The breakthrough time of propanone was fastest among all vapors ; this behavior is attributed to its physicochemical properties. The results show that physisorption plays a primary role in ketone removal. Another experiment was carried out to compare the adsorption trend of two pentanone isomers, wherein the breakthrough time of 2 pentanone was more than that of 3 pentanone. The breakthrough characteristic shows that activated spherical carbon with an appropriate surface area could be utilized in controlling the volatile {{organic compounds}} to maintain and improve the ambient air quality. ASC woven fabric is effective in use as an adsorbent material which is light in weight and also <b>suitable</b> for <b>protective</b> <b>clothing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Heating {{fabric is}} an {{advanced}} textile {{material that is}} extensively researched by the industrialists and the scientists alike. Ability to create highly flexible and drapeable heating fabrics has many applications in everyday life. This paper presents a study conducted on the comparison of heatability of knitted fabric made of stainless steel yarn. The {{purpose of the study}} is to find a <b>suitable</b> material for <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> against cold environments. In the current research the ampacity of stainless steel yarn is observed in order to prevent the overheating of the heating fabrics. The behavior of the knitted structure is studied for different levels of supply voltage. Infrared temperature sensing is used to measure the heat generated from the fabrics in order to measure the temperature of the fabrics without physical contact. It is concluded that interlock structure {{is one of the most}} suited structures for knitted heating fabrics. As learnt through this research, fabrics made of stainless steel yarn are capable of producing a higher level of heating compared to that of knitted fabric made using silver coated polymeric yarn at the same supply voltage...|$|R

30|$|Wearing <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> is {{essential}} to protect the fire-fighters from thermal exposures and other life threatening risks. In general, the standard <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> is a multilayer construction, which is heavy and bulky to provide the desired thermal protection. This in turn reduces {{the ability of the}} <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> to transfer internal heat to the surrounding atmosphere and creates heat stress to the fire-fighters. Hence, the moisture produced by sweating remains inside the clothing system resulting in a sensation of wet clinginess and thermal discomfort to the wearer. Therefore, optimizing the thermal protection and comfort properties of the PPC have been the major area of research in recent years. The comfort properties of the fire-fighters personal <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> (FFPPC) is a complex phenomenon governed by the transport properties and thermal resistance of the fabric combinations. An ideal clothing will provide the necessary protection as well as minimize the metabolic heat stress. However, these are the two conflicting factors to be considered while designing <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> for fire-fighters (Scott [2005]).|$|R
