40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the impact of}} master scheduling models on student performance {{as reported by the}} AEIS database in the high schools of the SAISD. General student performance and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills were the primary measures for comparison. The SAISD made a transition from an A-B block schedule in 2002 to a traditional-seven period model in 2003. Conclusions have been made as to the degree of influence that traditional and block schedules have on student performance. The population of this study was the eight high schools of the SAISD. All students enrolled on these campuses were included in the data analysis. The population was 14, 418 students during the 2002 - 2003 school year and 13, 689 in 2003 - 2004. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were the measures utilized for the purposes of population comparisons and data review. Based on the findings of this study, the recommendations for practice indicate the following: 1. Attendance ratings did not <b>return</b> <b>statistical</b> significance on a traditional schedule. 2. Advanced Course participation and AP/IB testing results <b>returned</b> <b>statistical</b> significance on a traditional schedule. 3. SAT and ACT did not <b>return</b> <b>statistical</b> significance on a traditional schedule. 4. TAKS Campus Performance did not <b>return</b> <b>statistical</b> significance on a traditional schedule. 5. TAKS Reading/ELA, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies scores <b>returned</b> <b>statistical</b> significance on a traditional schedule. 6. African American, Hispanic and Special Education Performance <b>returned</b> <b>statistical</b> significance in TAKS Science and TAKS Social Studies on a traditional schedule. 7. White Performance <b>returned</b> <b>statistical</b> significance in TAKS Science on a traditional schedule. 8. Economically Disadvantaged Performance <b>returned</b> <b>statistical</b> significance in each area of the TAKS assessment on a traditional schedule. 9.

The recommendations are that libraries should make available for comparison by others not only their library service provision, i. e. opening hours, but also staff provision, i. e. staffing numbers and demographics and staff deployment, {{with a view to}} benchmarking levels of flexibility. This work highlights the lack of existing benchmarking facilities in UK universities and colleges of higher education, relating to HR deployment in libraries, and recommends that Sconul extends the existing data collection in its Annual <b>Statistical</b> <b>return</b> to include this HR area...|$|R

60|$|In {{deciding}} on the districts to be investigated, {{it was important}} to choose well-marked specimens of urban and rural populations. In the former, a town was wanted where there were various industries, and where the population was not increasing. A town where only one industry was pursued would not be a fair sample, because the particular industry might be suspected of having a special influence, and a town that was increasing would have attracted numerous immigrants from the country, who are undistinguishable as such in the census returns. Guided by these considerations, I selected Coventry, where silk weaving, watch-making, and other industries are carried on, and whose population had scarcely varied during the decade preceding the census of 1871.[25] It is an open town, in which the crowded alleys of larger places are not frequent. Its urban peculiarities are therefore minimised, and its <b>statistical</b> <b>returns</b> would give a picture somewhat too favourable of the average condition of life in towns. For specimens of rural districts, I chose small agricultural parishes in Warwickshire.|$|E

25|$|Radar {{estimates}} of rainfall and general weather forecasting techniques {{are also important}} components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and it also may allow for the computation of the likely <b>statistical</b> <b>return</b> period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.|$|R

While a certain amount of information was available there was insufficient for informed decision making as the annual <b>statistical</b> <b>return</b> collected by the State Library does not specifically ask for data relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This made it difficult to adequately describe what research needed to be undertaken to support and promote the development and provision of services and programs.

The legal status of the abandoned canal was formalised in 1925, when two holding companies were created, Nutbrook No 1 Company, to hold the shares of the original company, and Nutbrook No 2 Company to hold the shares of Nutbrook No 1 Company, and to attempt to purchase the freehold of the canal bed, to remove the burden of rental payments.|$|R

5000|$|A {{small school}} (called Alum Creek School) {{operated}} from July 1887 to August 1897. [...] The Shannons Flat/Yaouk area was initially {{isolated from the}} general spread of early settlement which came through Bredbo and Bunyan and moved further south. The original squatters to Yaouk {{were more likely to}} arrive by crossing the Murrumbidgee near Bredbo and travelling north west through rough country before getting to open plains. The <b>Statistical</b> <b>Returns</b> of 1831 listed J Slake (probably Blake) as holding the Yayak (Yaouk) station and the Brayshaws settled in the Bobeyan Valley during the 1840s. Archibald Crawford bought the Yaouk run in partnership with Lachlan Cochrane, but Crawford had to retire from the partnership in 1864. The property is still owned by the Cochrane family. For many years, the district relied primarily on the town of Adaminaby for supplies and services. The poet Barcroft Boake who lived in the region in the 1880s based some of his poems on places and events in the area.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{analysis}} of the Fortore River coastal plain and the Lesina Lake coastal barrier integrated with radiocarbon age data indicates that {{the evolution of the}} coastal landscape has been strongly affected by a number of strong earthquakes and related tsunamis which occurred during the last 3000 years. The first seismic event struck this coastal area in the V century BC. It produced strong erosion of the Fortore River coastal plain and significant emersion of Punta delle Pietre Nere, as well as the large tsunami responsible {{for the development of the}} Sant'Andrea washover fan. The second event occurred in 493 AD; it induced severe erosion of the Fortore River coastal plain and triggered the large tsunami that hit the Lesina Lake coastal barrier, producing the Foce Cauto washover fan. Then later in 1627, an earthquake was responsible for the further coseismic uplift of Punta delle Pietre Nere, the subsidence of Lesina village area and the development of a tsunami which produced two washover fans. Morphological analysis points out that seismic events strong enough to control the morphological evolution of local coastal landscapes show a <b>statistical</b> <b>return</b> period of about 1000 years. These major events produced important coseismic vertical movements and large tsunamis. However, the correct identification of the tectonic structure responsible for the generation of these strong earthquakes is still an unsolved problem...|$|R
