The geometric parameters of spring are determined. The maximum deformation and the stress distribution of spring are obtained. Moreover, the modal analysis of spring is carried out and the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of first 20 orders are obtained. The relationship between the natural frequency and deformation is also analyzed. All the results in this paper provide a strong basis for the optimization design of spring and the calculation of energy density...|$|R
