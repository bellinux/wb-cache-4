30|$|The beer game {{model is}} the earliest, the most simple and {{complete}} model used to study complex nonlinear dynamics behaviours in supply chains. The beer game {{was derived from the}} product distribution game developed by Forrester [1] in the process of studying factory dynamics, which simulates the decision-making process of ordering or stocking in a chain-type production–distribution system consisting of such 4 sectors (nodes) as a retailer, a wholesaler, a distributor and a factory in total. The beer game model was early taken only as a universal case in investigating the bullwhip effect in supply chains, however, it has been considered as a classical model with nonlinear dynamics in supply chain systems since Mosekilde et al. [2] and Sterman [3] found chaos phenomenon in the game. The previous researches [2 – 11] have shown that complex nonlinear dynamics behaviours, e.g., chaos/hyperchaos, can occur in the production–distribution system represented by the beer game model. The nonlinear factors come mainly from the nonlinear coupling of several oscillating feedback produced by the feedback structures among different decision-making entities, multiple inventory levels, time lag, etc., as well as the non-negativity [10, 12, 13] and piecewise-linearity [14] in ordering/dispatching decision-making. The chaos complex dynamics behaviours have been observed in multi-level <b>series</b> <b>supply</b> chain inventory systems [15 – 17], production-recycling system [18] and customer–supplier systems [19 – 22] more simple than the beer game model.|$|E

40|$|The current {{conceptual}} model of reinvasion and settlement for estuarine brachyuran crabs in mesotidal systems is that megalopae undergo selective tidal stream transport, in an upstream direction, and settle {{by the end}} of the flood tide. Recent studies on recruitment processes of Carcinus maenas (L.) have reported a clear decoupling between supply, as larval influx, and settlement events in the lower Mira Estuary (SW Portugal). We investigated, at high temporal resolution, whether overestimation of planktonic abundances and/or deviations of megalopal responses from the {{conceptual model}} were responsible for such decoupling. Daily settlement of megalopae was analyzed using regression and spectral analyses to identify periodicities and correlated with tidal amplitude. Hydrological parameters and supply, net flux and hourly concentration of megalopae in the plankton were addressed as factors influencing short, intermediate and long-term settlement, through 50 h sampling <b>series.</b> <b>Supply</b> and surface net flux levels of megalopae were similar and clearly decoupled from settlement on bottom-deployed collectors. Both hourly planktonic concentration and settlement patterns of megalopae fitted the conceptual model at high temporal resolution, with some deviations in terms of light intensity influences. Furthermore, our results suggest that processes preventing settlement and capable of overriding the influence of light intensities—such as turbulence—may explain the decoupling between supply and settlement of shore crab megalopae in the lower Mira Estuary...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two approaches}} to modeling {{the use of}} IMF resources in order to gauge whether the recent decline in credit outstanding is a temporary or a permanent phenomenon. The two approaches-the time series behavior of credit outstanding and a two-stage program selection and access model-yield the same conclusion: the use of IMF resources is likely to decline sharply. Specifically, credit outstanding is projected to decline {{from an average of}} SDR 50 billion over 2000 ? 05 to SDR 8 billion over 2006 ? 10. Stochastic simulations suggest that it is unlikely to be much higher. These results are based on WEO projections with a correction for historically-observed over-optimistic biases. Alternative scenarios assuming a weaker economic performance or a less benign global environment do not alter these results.

40|$|Lean supply chains with cost {{optimized}} {{production and}} logistics {{processes in the}} automotive industry have become a benchmark for other industries. Short delivery times, low inventories and high availability are parameters which assume a robust supply chain. In industrial practice we see, however, that in the After Sales business particularly related to the supply of automotive spare parts, that there are always unforeseen delays in delivery. In order to avoid service level losses on the focal firm level due to missing parts {{it is necessary to}} understand the risk structure on the supplier side. For this reason, a risk model for the After Sales inbound SC is developed through this work. Based on an extensive analysis of delivery data a central risk size was derived. Comprehensively researched SC risks are supplemented by After Sales specific risks derived through an empirical supplier survey. A reference network, which is methodologically based on the Bayesian theorem, to control the dynamic relationships was developed. The developed risk model allows for the identification of proactive and reactive measures by top-down and bottom-up analyzes to make lean supply chains for after sales requirements in the best cases robust and resilient. A big advantage of the developed model is not only the ability to quantify the cause and effect of supply chain risks but also to describe the constantly changing risk environment of the supply chain through continuous belief updates within the model. The risk analysis in the developed model potentially reduces the delivery delay of spare parts by 65 percent and diminishes the buffer stock value by 50 percent. To achieve such improvements in the real world organizations must be able to implement measures in explicit SC risk clusters for sustainable supply chain performance and inventory management. Improvements in the internal supplier processes, due to risks like prioritized <b>series</b> <b>supply,</b> or inappropriate after sales supply strategies are necessary. Utilizing the developed After Sales Risk Management Model (ASRIM) organizations will be able to implement proactive risk mitigation strategies, facilitating agile SC performance, while simultaneously reducing buffer stocks...|$|E

Force feedback {{acts as a}} means for electronic modulation of the spring constant of the suspension and thus for enhancing the sensitivity. Therefore, a suitable electrostatic time-varying ac-tuation {{can be used to make}} the accelerometer selectively sensitive to a coherent frequency component of a mechanical vibration. By sweeping the frequency of the drive voltage over a selected range, the mechanical (vibration) spectrum is analyzed in the mechan-ical domain. An inverted pendulum type of accelerometer structure has been fabricated in silicon using micromachining techniques and operated using electrostatic momentum feedback. The spec-tral performance is comparable to fast Fourier transform based systems for spectral analysis on a time <b>series</b> <b>supplied</b> by a conven-tional accelerometer, while the overall system features a reduced complexity and reduced power consumption.
