40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies have}} shown that alpha-oligonucleotides (alpha-ONs) are more {{resistant}} to degradation by nucleases than are beta-oligonucleotides (beta-ONs), but a few exceptions have been reported. The present work indicates that the resistance of alpha-ONs to 3 '-exonucleases contained in calf or human sera strongly depends on their 3 '-terminal sequence. When the 2 last residues were [...] . A-G, [...] . C-A, or [...] . C-T, the degradation rates in tissue culture media with fetal calf serum were similar to those observed for beta-ONs, but <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors</b> up to 200 were observed when the 2 last residues were [...] . T-C, [...] . A-C, or [...] . C-C, and intermediate <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors</b> were found with [...] . G-A, [...] . T-A, or [...] . T-T terminal sequences. Other data confirm that alpha-ONs are significantly more resistant than beta-ONs to purified 5 '-exo- and endonucleases as well as to 3 '-exonucleases contained in snake venom or CEM cell lysates, but suggest that sequence specificity may also exist in these media. These findings, which are consistent with literature data and explain the behavior of the aforementioned exceptions, also emphasize that the stability observed in the presence of purified nucleases cannot be extrapolated to sera. Other results show that handling, heat inactivation, and storage conditions have little effect on the 3 '-exonuclease activity of serum-containing media, but can completely modify the nuclease activities of cell extracts.

40|$|Heme {{deficiency}} in rabbit reticulocytes and their lysates {{leads to the}} activation of a heme-regulated translational inhibitor (HRI) which causes the cessation of polypeptide initiation. HRI is a protein kinase that specifically phosphorylates the 38, 000 -dalton subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF- 2). eIF- 2 binds Met-tRNAf and GTP in ternary complex. As {{a continuation of the}} studies on the molecular basis of the inhibition of the formation of 40 S ribosomal subunit-Met-tRNAf complexes by HRI [Ranu, R. S., London, I. M., Das, A., Dasgupta, A., Majumdar, A., Ralston, R., Roy, R. & Gupta, N. K. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 745 - 749], we describe here the isolation and some characteristics of a factor that is required for the HRI-catalyzed inhibition of eIF- 2 -promoted ternary complex formation. In the presence of 1 mM Mg 2 +, ternary complex formation by eIF- 2 is dependent on the presence of this <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor</b> (SF). Under these conditions, SF increases the rate and the extent of ternary complex formation. This finding suggests that the interaction of SF with eIF- 2 causes a conformational change that stabilizes eIF- 2 and promotes efficient ternary complex formation by increasing the affinity of eIF- 2 for GTP and Met-tRNAf. In the absence of Mg 2 +, however, eIF- 2 efficiently forms the ternary complex and SF has little effect on its ternary complex formation capacity—hence, the name eIF- 2 <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor</b> (SF). In the presence of SF, HRI markedly inhibits (70 - 80 %) the ternary complex formation capacity of eIF- 2. The inhibitory effect requires both HRI and ATP. Under these conditions, HRI phosphorylates only the 38, 000 -dalton subunit of eIF- 2. Both the rate and the extent of the SF-dependent ternary complex formation are inhibited. These findings are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation causes a conformational change in eIF- 2 such that its interactions with other initiation factors in the formation and the binding of ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits are inhibited...|$|E

Here, we report crystal structures of the DNA-bound and free form of the aRNAP from Sulfolobus shibatae. Together with biochemical and biophysical analyses, these data show that Rpo 13 C-terminus binds non-specifically to double-stranded DNA.

The Tb linker significantly increased the thermal stability of the PEGylated DhaA by slowing its structural unfolding, and the pH stability of the PEGylated DhaA by slowing the protonation process. In addition, the PEGylated DhaA with the Tb linker showed the maximum resistance to high ionic strength (1 M NaC 1) and organic solvent (40 % DMSO).

Angiopoietin- 1, the natural agonist ligand for the endothelial-specific Tie 2 receptor, is a non-redundant endothelial survival and vascular <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor.</b> Here we evaluate the efficacy of a polyethylene glycol-clustered Tie 2 agonist peptide, vasculotide (VT), to protect against endothelial-cell activation with subsequent microvascular dysfunction in a murine model of ischemic AKI. Renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) was induced by clamping of the renal arteries for 35 [*]minutes. Mice were treated with VT or PEGylated cysteine before IRI. Sham-operated animals served as time-matched controls. Treatment with VT significantly reduced transcapillary albumin flux and renal tissue edema after IRI. The protective effects of VT were associated with activation of Tie 2 and stabilization of its downstream effector, VE-cadherin in renal vasculature. VT abolished the decline in renal tissue blood flow, attenuated the increase of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen after IRI, improved recovery of renal function and markedly reduced mortality compared to PEG [HR 0. 14 (95 % CI 0. 05 – 0. 78) P[*]<[*] 0. 05].

AHA exhibited hydrolytic activity over {{a broad range of}} NaCl concentrations (0. 01 - 4. 5 M). AHA showed 28 % increased activity in 0. 5 - 2. 0 M NaCl compared to that in 0. 01 M NaCl. In contrast, the corresponding mesophilic (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) and thermostable (B. licheniformis) a -amylases showed a 39 and 46 % decrease in activity respectively. Even at 4. 5 M NaCl, 80 % of the initial activity was detected for AHA, whereas the mesophilic and thermostable enzymes were inactive.

The higher activation energy, half-life time and T m indicated reduced conformational dynamics and increased rigidity in the presence of higher NaCl concentrations. A comparison with the sequences of other halophilic a -amylases revealed that AHA also contains higher proportion of small hydrophobic residues and acidic residues resulting in a higher negative surface potential.

In exponential phase, mRNA half-lives were correlated positively to open reading frame length.

These original findings suggested that multiple pathways of mRNA degradation should coexist: internal cleavage, endonuclease cleavage initiated at the 5 ′-end, and exonuclease attack at the 3 ′-end. During carbon starvation adaptation, mRNA stability globally increased, but specific mechanisms allowing a wide range of <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors</b> between genes and differential kinetic evolution were involved. A formal method allowing the quantification of the relative influences of transcription and degradation on the mRNA pool control was developed and applied in L. lactis.

The resulting size of Fe-particles synthesized in water (with and without surfactants) correlates with the determined values of open circuit potential (OCP) : the more negative OCP, the obtained Fe-particles are bigger, because values of OCP correspond to different range of polarization determined for the reduction of Fe 2 +.

A correlation of aE with toroidal rotation velocity and E x B shearing rate {{is found in the}} low density plasmas, suggesting that the turbulence quench rule may be more complicated than assumed in the GLF 23 model with constant alpha(E). For the selected discharges the best predictive accuracy is obtained by using weak/no E x B shear stabilization (i. e. alpha(E) approximate to 0) at low toroidal angular frequency (Omega 100 krad s(- 1)).

Variations of the SUV within each lesion were examined at different acquisition times. Methods: Our protocol {{was approved by}} either the Human Investigation Committee or the Institutional Review Board. All 120 PET datasets were acquired continuously for 180 s per bed position in list mode and were re-constructed to obtain 30 -, 60 -, 90 -, 120 -, 150 -, and 180 -s-per-bed-position PET images with registration to a single set of nondiagnos-tic CT images. Qualitative assessment of the images was performed separately for correlation. The SUV measurements of each lesion were computed and normalized to the 180 -s acquisition values to create a <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor.</b> These stabilization factors were used to demonstrate a predictable trend of stabilization over time. The var-iances of the stabilization factors over the entire dataset, composed of several tumor types over a range of sizes, were compared for each time point with the corresponding 150 -s time point using a 2 -sided F test, which has similar values to the 180 -s time point. Results: The variance of the data decreased with increasing acqui-sition time and with increasing dose but leveled off for sufficiently long acquisitions.

Humic acid (HA), {{an important component}} of NOM, was extracted from a peat soil. Two different molecular weight PAAs were also used for coating. The colloidal stability of the coated magnetic NPs was evaluated as a resultant of the attractive magnetic dipolar and van der Waals forces and the repulsive electrostatic and steric- electrosteric interactions. The conformational alterations of the polyelectrolytes adsorbed on magnetic gamma Fe(2) O(3) NPs and their role in colloidal stability were determined. Pure gamma Fe(2) O(3) NPs were extremely unstable because of aggregation in aqueous solution, but a significant stability enhancement was observed after coating with polyelectrolytes. The steric <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor</b> induced by the polyelectrolyte coating strongly dictated the colloidal stability. The pH-induced conformational change of the adsorbed, weakly charged polyelectrolytes had a significant effect on the colloidal stability. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the stretched conformation of the HA molecular chains adsorbed on the gamma Fe(2) O(3) NP surface at pH 9, which enhanced the colloidal stability through long-range electrosteric stabilization. The depletion of the polyelectrolyte during the dilution of the NP suspension decreased the colloidal stability under acidic solution conditions. The conformation of the polyelectrolytes adsorbed on the NP surface was altered {{as a function of the}} substrate surface charge as viewed from AFM imaging. The polyelectrolyte coating also led to a reduction in magnetic moments and decreased the coercivity of the coated gamma Fe(2) O(3) NPs.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of human papillomavirus type 16 virus-like particles has been examined {{by means of}} different techniques including dynamic and static light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and electrophoretic mobility. All these techniques provide different and often complementary perspectives about the aggregation process and generation of stabilized virus-like particles {{after a period of}} time of 48 hours at a temperature of 298 K. Interestingly, static light scattering results point towards a clear colloidal instability in the initial systems, as suggested by a negative value of the second virial coefficient. This is likely related to small repulsive electrostatic interactions among the particles, and in agreement with relatively small absolute values of the electrophoretic mobility and, hence, of the net surface charges. At this initial stage the small repulsive interactions are not able to compensate binding interactions, which tend to aggregate the particles. As time proceeds, an increase {{of the size of the}} particles is accompanied by strong increases, in absolute values, of the electrophoretic mobility and net surface charge, suggesting enhanced repulsive electrostatic interactions and, consequently, a stabilized colloidal system. These results show that electrophoretic mobility is a useful methodology that can be applied to screen the <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors</b> for virus-like particles during vaccine development...|$|R

The multipoint covalent immobilization of SuSyAc on glyoxyl agarose at pH 10. 0 under optimized conditions provided a significant <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor</b> at reaction conditions (pH 5. 0 and 45 °C). However, this strategy did not stabilize the enzyme quaternary structure. Thus, a post-immobilization technique using functionalized polymers, such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) and dextran-aldehyde (dexCHO), was applied to cross-link all enzyme subunits. The coating of the optimal SuSyAc immobilized glyoxyl agarose with a bilayer of 25 kDa PEI and 25 kDa dexCHO completely stabilized the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Accordingly, the combination of immobilization and post-immobilization techniques led to a biocatalyst 340 -fold more stable than the non-cross-linked biocatalyst, preserving 60 % of its initial activity. This biocatalyst produced 256 mM of UDP-glucose in a single batch, accumulating 1 M after five reaction cycles. Therefore, this immobilized enzyme can be of great interest as a biocatalyst to synthesize UDP-glucose.

40|$|Introduction: Angiopoietin- 1 (Angpt 1), {{the natural}} agonist ligand for the endothelial Tie 2 receptor, is a nonredundant endothelial {{survival}} and vascular <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor</b> that reduces endothelial permeability and inhibits leukocyte-endothelium interactions. Here we evaluate {{the efficacy of}} a novel polyethylene glycol (PEG) -clustered Tie 2 agonist peptide, vasculotide (VT), to protect against vascular leakage and mortality in a murine model of polymicrobial abdominal sepsis. Methods: Polymicrobial abdominal sepsis in C 57 BL 6 mice was induced by cecal-ligation-and-puncture (CLP). Mice were treated with different dosages of VT or equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sham-operated animals served as time-matched controls. Results: Systemic administration of VT induced long-lasting Tie 2 activation in vivo. VT protected against sepsisinduced endothelial barrier dysfunction, as evidenced by attenuation of vascular leakage and leukocyte transmigration into the peritoneal cavity. Histological analysis revealed that VT treatment ameliorated leukocyte infiltration in kidneys of septic mice, probably due to reduced endothelial adhesion molecule expression. VT-driven effects were associated with significantly improved organ function and reduced circulating cytokine levels. The endothelial-specific action of VT was supported by additional in vitro studies showing no effect of VT on either cytokine release from isolated peritoneal macrophages, or migratory capacity of isolated neutrophils. Finally, administration of VT pre-CLP (hazard ratio 0. 39 [95 % confidence interval 0. 19 - 0. 81] P < 0. 001) and post-CLP reduced mortality in septic mice (HR 0. 22 [95 % CI 0. 06 - 0. 83] P < 0. 05). Conclusions: We provide proof of principle {{in support of the}} efficacious use of PEGylated VT, a drug-like Tie 2 receptor agonist, to counteract microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction and reduce mortality in a clinically relevant murine sepsis model. Further studies are needed to pave the road for clinical application of this therapeutic concept...|$|E
40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} metabolites {{are produced by}} microorganisms to survive in their environment, where primary metabolites are essential and mainly used for growth, the secondary metabolites are non-essential and used for {{a broader range of}} purposes. The final products can reach from antibiotics, cytostatics, fatty acids to several other compounds [1]. A small group of secondary metabolites are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), which produce non-ribosomal proteins (NRPs). They contain several domains of which the adenylation domain, defines the specificity of the module. Adenylation domains need sometimes the assistance of a MbtH-like domain/ protein to function properly, which gives the MbtH-like protein its function as a helper protein. MbtH-like proteins are mainly produced by Actinobacteria, but they are also found in several other bacteria, generally prokaryotes [4]. The predicted structure of the MbtH-like proteins reveals the importance of two conserved tryptophan residues, which form a small pocket in the MbtH-like domain [9]. The precise function of the MbtH-like proteins is still unknown, though several depletion and reconstitution assays show, that the MbtH-like proteins help with the activation, solubilisation and overexpression of NRPSs. Also MbtH-like proteins from several species can replace each other, which means that the protein is likely a chaperone, facilitator or <b>stabilization</b> <b>factor.</b> But some NRPSs have also activity without MbtH-like proteins or can be replaced by the RubC 1 a domain, which is a fusion of the A-domain and a MbtH-like protein and is seen as the ancestral version of the MbtH-like protein. Because of these possibilities it is likely that MbtH-like proteins have a specific function, which could by exploited for biological applications, like strain-improvement and during the optimization of antibiotic production by secondary metabolite biosynthesis. ...|$|E
40|$|Changing gel {{structure}} and immobilization conditions {{led to a}} significant improvement in the covalent multipoint attachment of chymotrypsin on chitosan. The use of sodium alginate, gelatin, or κ-carrageenan, activation with glutaraldehyde, glycidol, or epichlorohydrin, and addition of microorganisms followed by cellular lysis allowed the modification of the gel structure. Immobilization yields, recovered activities, and <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors</b> at 55 and 65 °C were evaluated. Enzyme immobilization for 72 h at pH 10. 05, 25 °C and reduction with NaBH 4 in chitosan 2. 5 %−carrageenan 2. 5 %, with addition of S. cerevisiae 5 % and activation with epichlorohydrin led to the best derivative, which was 9900 -fold more stable than the soluble enzyme. This support allowed an enzyme load up to 40 mg chymotrypsin × ggel− 1. The number of covalent bonds, formed by active groups in the support and lysine residues of the enzyme, can explain the obtained results. SEM images of the gel structures corroborate these conclusions. Fil: Adriano, Wellington. Universidade Federal do Sao Carlos; BrasilFil: Mendonça, Dany.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 09 - 06 - 2006 A {{new strategy}} {{to achieve a}} vety high stabilization of industrial enzymes is here proposed. A vety intense ngidification of a given region of the enzyme surface via its improved multipoint covalent immobilization on activated preexisting supports has been developed. The main objective of this Ph. D. Thesis involves the development of five different relevant subobjedwes: a. - Preparation of tailor made disulfideepoxy supports containing i) - a small concentration of highly reactive disulfide groups able to selectively immobilize enzyme through inserted cysteine groups, ii). - a very high concentration of epoxy groups able to perfom an intense multipoint immobilization with nucleophilic groups of the enzyme surface placed {{in the vicinity of}} the inserted cysteine group. Furthermore. the optimization of multipoint covalent immobilization of enzymes on these new supports was also studied. b. - Preparation of different mutated enzyme containing, each mutant, a reactive cysteine group placed in regions that are naturally rich in lysine residues. The tridimensional structure of PGA was studied and diierent mutations (insertion of cysteines) were proposed. The theoretical structure of the proposed mutants was evaluated and those mutants (with very similar structure with regards to the native one) were cloned. expressed and purified. c. - Site-direct multipoint covalent attachment of each mutated enzyme in order to detect the region of the enzyme surface that is more sensitive for stabilization (in this case a region close to the active site and surrounding the amino acid 8380 of the enzyme) d. - Enrichment of the selected region of the enzyme surface with new lysine residues (up to 8 new lysine groups were inserted close the amino acid 8380). In this way. a highly impmved ngidification of this region of the enzyme by multipoint covalent irnmobilization couM be achieved. e. - Evaluation of dfferent activated supports in order to get the most intense directed multipoint covalent irnmobilization of the mutated enzyme and subsequently the best <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors.</b> Glyoxyi agarose selectwely immobilues the enzyme via this mutated region of its surface (enriched with adiiional lysine residues) and this support promotes the more intense stabilization ((around 20 lysine residues of the enzyme surface seem to be imrolved in this very interesting multipoint covalent immobilization). The best immobilized derivatives were more than 300. 000 fold more stable than the corresponding soluble (and one-point immobilized) enzyme in experiments of irreversible thermal inactivarion. This dramatic stabilization was not found in scientific literature for any anzyme and any stabilzation strategy. Similar <b>stabilization</b> <b>factors</b> were found for inactivation of the enzyme in the pregence of organic cowlvents. In addition to that, these highly r i g i i i enzymes exhibit W r ca talytic properae 9 for interesüng biotransfomiaoons (enant¡o&dh hydmlysm of chiral esters, kimatically wntrolled synthesis c 4 amide bonds).
