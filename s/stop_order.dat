5|$|The {{incident}} {{happened on}} 28 March 1997 in the Strait of Otranto when the Italian Navy vessel Sibilia {{collided with the}} Albanian ship Kateri i Radës which had left from the Albanian port city of Vlorë with 142 people on board. The Sibilla sought to stop and inspect the ship suspected of containing irregular migrants. The vessel instead ended up colliding with the ship and sinking it. According to Italian authorities, there was no intention to cause the collision. The Zefiro first approached and identified the Kateri i Radës as a motorboat with approximately 30 civilians on board. The motorboat continued toward Italy even though a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> issued by the Zefiro. This happened around 4:30 PM, near the Albanian island Sazan. Sibilia then took over the operation and during its maneuvers, the Italian ship caused the Kateri i Radës to turn which resulted in subsequent deaths. After the Albanian ship was capsized, the Sibilia allegedly left and came back approximately 20 minutes later. The bodies of at least 52 {{who lost their lives}} were recovered. The total number of dead may be as high as 83. The survivors were taken to the Apulian port of Brindisi, where they arrived at 2:45 AM. They were then put on a bus, and taken to an immigration center to be identified. On 29 and 30 March 1997, news of the disaster made it to the first page of major Italian newspapers, relating the sense of gravity of the incident, which reported it as either a collision or a ramming. March 31 was a day of mourning in Albania.|$|E

2500|$|Many short sellers place a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> {{with their}} {{stockbroker}} after selling a stock short—an {{order to the}} brokerage to cover the position {{if the price of}} the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above. [...] In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.|$|E
5000|$|Since many traders place {{protective}} <b>stop</b> <b>orders</b> to {{exit from}} positions that go wrong, all the <b>stop</b> <b>orders</b> placed by trapped traders {{will provide the}} orders that boost {{the market in the}} direction that the more patient traders bet on. The phrase [...] "the stops were run" [...] refers to the execution of these <b>stop</b> <b>orders.</b> Since 2009, {{the use of the term}} “trapped traders” has grown in popularity and is now a generic term used by price actions traders and applied in different markets - stocks, futures, forex, commodities, etc. All trapped trader strategies are essentially variations of Brooks pioneering work.|$|R

50|$|After {{the style}} of Brooks, the price action trader will place the initial <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> 1 tick below the bar that gave the entry signal (if going long - or 1 tick above if going short) and if the market moves as expected, moves the <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> up to one tick below the entry bar, once the entry bar has closed and with further {{favourable}} movement, will seek to move the <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> up further to {{the same level as}} the entry, i.e. break-even.|$|E
50|$|The rule {{may also}} {{adversely}} affect position traders by {{preventing them from}} setting stops {{on the first day}} they enter positions. For example, a position trader may take four positions in four different stocks. To protect his capital, he may set <b>stop</b> <b>orders</b> on each position. Then if there is unexpected news that adversely affects the entire market, and all the stocks he has taken positions in rapidly decline in price, triggering the <b>stop</b> <b>orders,</b> the rule is triggered, as four day trades have occurred. Therefore, the trader must choose between not diversifying and entering no more than three new positions on any given day (limiting the diversification, which inherently increases their risk of losses) or choose to pass on setting <b>stop</b> <b>orders</b> to avoid the above scenario. Such a decision may also increase the risk to higher levels than it would be present if the four trade rule were not being imposed.|$|R

50|$|A {{price action}} trader will trade this pattern, e.g. a double bottom, {{by placing a}} buy <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> 1 tick above the bar that created the second 'bottom'. If the order is filled, then the trader sets a {{protective}} <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> 1 tick below the same bar.|$|E
50|$|After {{entering}} the trade, the trader needs {{to place a}} protective <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> to close the position with minimal loss if the trade goes wrong. The protective <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> will also serve to prevent losses {{in the event of}} a disastrously timed internet connection loss for online traders.|$|E

50|$|A <b>stop</b> <b>order,</b> also {{referred}} to as a stop-loss order, is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches a specified price, known as the stop price. When the stop price is reached, a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> becomes a market order. A buy-stop order is entered at a stop price above the current market price. Investors generally use a buy <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they have sold short. A sell-stop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price. Investors generally use a sell-stop order to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they own.|$|E
50|$|A {{stop-limit order}} {{combines}} {{the features of}} a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> and a limit order. A stop-limit order is an order {{to buy or sell}} a stock that combines the features of a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> and a limit order. Once the stop price is reached, a stop-limit order becomes a limit order that will be executed at a specified price (or better). As with all limit orders, a stop-limit order doesn't get filled if the security's price never reaches the specified limit price.|$|E
50|$|A {{trailing}} {{stop-limit order}} {{is similar to}} a trailing <b>stop</b> <b>order.</b> Instead of selling at market price when triggered, the order becomes a limit order.|$|E
5000|$|... "Five tick failed breakouts" [...] are a {{phenomenon}} {{that is a great}} example of price action trading. Five tick failed breakouts are characteristic of the stock index futures markets. Many speculators trade for a profit of just four ticks, a trade which requires the market to move 6 ticks in the trader's direction for the entry and exit orders to be filled. These traders will place protective <b>stop</b> <b>orders</b> to exit on failure {{at the opposite end of}} the breakout bar. So if the market breaks out by five ticks and does not hit their profit targets, then the price action trader will see this as a five tick failed breakout and will enter in the opposite direction at the opposite end of the breakout bar to take advantage of the <b>stop</b> <b>orders</b> from the losing traders' exit orders.|$|R
25|$|The {{limitation}} on railroad rates depreciated {{the value of}} railroad securities, and meant that railroads <b>stopped</b> <b>ordering</b> new equipment, including locomotives. This {{may have been a}} factor in precipitating the Panic of 1907, which in turn disrupted finance and investment in new plants. Both of these events had a direct negative effect on the railroad industry, especially the locomotive builders.|$|R

50|$|The use of stop orders is {{much more}} {{frequent}} for stocks and futures that trade on an exchange than those that trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The exact mechanism of a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> may vary between brokers and software platforms. For instance, Charles Schwab defines a <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> as follows:Stop orders and stop-limit orders are very similar, the primary difference being what happens once the stop price is triggered. A standard sell-stop order is triggered when the bid price is equal to or less than the stop price specified or when an execution occurs at the stop price.|$|E
