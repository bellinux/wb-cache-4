5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1858, during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence, Kansas {{established}} Montana City as a mining town {{on the banks of}} the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River in what was then western Kansas Territory. This was the first historical settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and by {{the summer of}} 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria (named after the gold-mining town of Auraria, Georgia), and St. Charles City.|$|E
5|$|Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, {{leaving a}} {{patchwork}} of disjointed routes throughout the city. There are over 850 miles of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the <b>South</b> <b>Platte.</b> This allows for {{a significant portion of}} Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some local residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle– a citywide bicycle sharing program– in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States {{at the time of its}} launch, boasting 400 bicycles.|$|E
50|$|The first legislature, {{along with}} several {{subsequent}} gatherings, drew criticism for a perceived lack of representation of the population <b>south</b> of the <b>Platte</b> River. Legislators from <b>south</b> of the <b>Platte</b> wore red blankets over their shoulders in the first session to indicate their hostility towards the northern legislators.|$|R

5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E
25|$|A {{branch of}} the Oregon trail crossed the very {{northeast}} corner of Colorado if they followed the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River to one of its last crossings. This {{branch of the}} trail passed through present day Julesburg before entering Wyoming. Later settlers followed the Platte and <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> Rivers into their settlements there (much of which became the state of Colorado).|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} 1832 to 1856, traders, trappers, and {{settlers}} established trading posts and small settlements along the Arkansas River, {{and on the}} <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> near the Front Range. Prominent among these were Bent's Fort and Fort Pueblo on the Arkansas and Fort Saint Vrain on the <b>South</b> <b>Platte.</b> The main item of trade offered by the Indians was buffalo robes, see Early history of the Arkansas Valley in Colorado.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital of}} the Nebraska Territory had been Omaha since the {{creation}} of the territory in 1854; however, most of the territory's population lived <b>south</b> of the <b>Platte</b> River. After much of the territory <b>south</b> of the <b>Platte</b> River considered annexation to Kansas, the territorial legislature voted to locate the capital city south of the river and as far west as possible.|$|R

50|$|The Rainwater Basin is a 4,200 mi.2 (10,900 km2) {{region of}} shallow lakes, marshes and other {{wetlands}} located <b>south</b> of the <b>Platte</b> River in south-central Nebraska. In {{the spring and}} fall months, millions of migratory birds pass through the region to feed and rest. The Rainwater Basin, along with the Platte River, is a major component of the Central Flyway of North America. These oval basins occur <b>south</b> of the <b>Platte</b> River on the loess-covered landscape of Nebraska.|$|R
25|$|In April, Renfroe {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{senators}} to vote against the nomination of Celeste C de Baca to the state parole board, citing concerns about her conduct as a judge. Renfroe is also exploring legislation regarding water rights along the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River.|$|E
25|$|However, some of {{the mountainous}} regions of Colorado receive {{a huge amount of}} {{moisture}} from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the Yampa River, the Colorado River, the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River.|$|E
25|$|After {{crossing}} the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River the Oregon Trail follows the North Platte River out of Nebraska into Wyoming. Fort Laramie, at {{the confluence of}} the Laramie and North Platte rivers, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails. It was the last army outpost till travelers reached the coast.|$|E

Kalamath Street, the end of state maintenance, is one-way southbound, providing access to US 85 south and I-25 south. One block later, Santa Fe Drive (one-way northbound) carries traffic from US 85 north and I-25 north, and leads to the onramp to I-25 north.|$|E
25|$|Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops, {{and most}} of the villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator. Irrigation water is {{available}} from the <b>South</b> <b>Platte,</b> the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including artesian wells. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline. As well as crop agriculture, eastern Colorado hosts considerable livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.|$|E

25|$|Indian attacks {{increased}} significantly after 1860, {{when most of}} the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country, often encroaching on Indian territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the Central Nevada Route. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the Indian trouble nearer the Snake River. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> to avoid local Indian hot spots.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{interior}} of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, {{on the east side of}} the Continental Divide is the North Park of Colorado. The North Park is drained by the North Platte River, which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the Middle Park of Colorado, which is drained by the Colorado River. The South Park of Colorado is the region of the headwaters of the <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} in the mid-18th century among the Native American tribes {{of what is now}} {{northern}} Colorado. A young Arapaho boy named Lame Beaver grows up during this period.
