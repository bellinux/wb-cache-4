5|$|Blue <b>Shift</b> {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue <b>Shift</b> came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue <b>Shift</b> content. Blue <b>Shift</b> had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line <b>shift</b> of a binary star system. This <b>shift</b> is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler <b>shift</b> in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this <b>shift</b> allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|The Great Vowel <b>Shift</b> {{affected}} the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain <b>shift,</b> meaning that each <b>shift</b> triggered a subsequent <b>shift</b> in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced {{as the word}} beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel <b>Shift</b> explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.|$|E

50|$|Late during 1935, the {{management}} of the Goodyear plant, which was by far the largest employer of rubber workers in the industry, introduced a plan for the reduction of hourly wages for workers as well as a move from six hour <b>shifts</b> to eight hour <b>shifts.</b> The reason for management's plan was to save money on labor. The move to eight hour <b>shifts</b> from six hour <b>shifts</b> would cause significant layoffs of around 1,200 workers, because with six hour <b>shifts,</b> four <b>shifts</b> of workers would be employed compared to three <b>shifts</b> of workers being employed under eight hour <b>shifts.</b> Eventually, Goodyear's management {{decided to go back to}} six hour <b>shifts</b> because of the displeasure voiced by workers.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{the class of}} <b>shifted</b> simplicial complexes. A simplicial complex on n nodes is <b>shifted</b> if there exists a {{labelling}} of the nodes by 1 through n such that for any face, replacing any node of {{the face with a}} node of smaller label results in a collection which is also a face. A primary motivation for considering <b>shifted</b> complexes is a procedure called <b>shifting.</b> <b>Shifting</b> associates a <b>shifted</b> complex to any simplicial complex in a way which preserves meaningful information, while simplifying the structure of the complex. For example, <b>shifting</b> preserves the f-vector of a complex but always reduces the topology to a wedge of spheres. <b>Shifting</b> {{has proved to be a}} successful tool for answering questions regarding f-vectors. While most of the previous results on <b>shifted</b> complexes are algebraic or topological in nature, we explore the combinatorics of <b>shifted</b> complexes. We give intrinsic characterization theorems for <b>shifted</b> complexes and <b>shifted</b> matroid complexes. In addition, we show results on the enumeration of <b>shifted</b> complexes and connections to various combinatorial structures. by Caroline J. Klivans. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{version of}} Half-Life was cancelled, Blue <b>Shift</b> persevered. Prior to the {{cancellation}} of the Dreamcast version, Sierra announced on March 29, 2001, that Blue <b>Shift</b> would be released for PC as well. The game would be released as a standalone expansion pack, a product that {{does not require the}} original Half-Life to run. The new models developed for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life would also be included in the PC version as the Half-Life High Definition pack. In addition, Gearbox announced that the High Definition pack would not be exclusive for Blue <b>Shift,</b> but could be applied to both Half-Life and Opposing Force as well. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2001, Gearbox announced that development of Blue <b>Shift</b> had been completed, and exhibited a playable version of the end product. The game was released on June 12, 2001.|$|E

30|$|Polarity <b>shifting</b> is a {{phenomenon}} in sentiment analysis that denotes the inversion, attenuation, or cancelation of the sentiment of a polarity clue (i.e., word or phrase) in a sentence. A polarity <b>shifting</b> pattern is a pattern that performs polarity <b>shifting.</b> Previous {{research has shown that}} the detection of polarity <b>shifting</b> can improve the performance of sentiment analysis. Currently, researchers often manually check a corpus line by line to find sentences containing polarity <b>shifting</b> and then extract the polarity <b>shifting</b> pattern. However, this process is time-consuming and may miss many polarity <b>shifting</b> patterns.|$|R
5|$|An outward <b>shift</b> of the PPF {{results from}} {{growth of the}} {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a <b>shift</b> reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will <b>shift</b> inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue <b>Shift</b> {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person. The protagonist in Blue <b>Shift</b> is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue <b>Shift</b> and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last <b>Shift</b> (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive <b>shift</b> in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last <b>Shift</b> illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E
30|$|Finding {{polarity}} <b>shifting</b> patterns automatically in a corpus is not easy. The {{density of}} polarity <b>shifting</b> is normally low, and <b>shifting</b> patterns are subtle and flexible, making {{the task of}} extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> patterns difficult. Currently, human annotating is the main way to obtain polarity <b>shifting</b> patterns, which is time-consuming. This paper will present a semi-automatic approach to extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> patterns from specially designed corpora. This approach used sequence mining to generate frequent word sequences, which greatly reduced human labor in annotating polarity <b>shifting</b> patterns compared with annotating the original corpus directly.|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we argue that}} <b>shifting</b> between {{different}} modes of thought, termed ‘mode shifting’ for short, is a fundamental cognitive skill underlying human creative thinking across different domains. We introduce empirical evidence revealing a relationship between mode <b>shifting</b> and creativity. Findings also show a relationship between mode <b>shifting,</b> as assessed by the mode <b>shifting</b> index (MSI), and creativity across five different domains, as assessed by the Kaufman domains of creativity scale (K-DOCs), suggesting that mode <b>shifting</b> is important for creativity across different domains. However, findings demonstrate {{that the relationship between}} mode <b>shifting</b> and creativity hinges on the component of mode <b>shifting</b> (metacognitive awareness of <b>shifting</b> or <b>shifting</b> competence), with certain components more important in some domains than others. In sum, mode <b>shifting</b> has domain-specific in addition to domain-general elements. We conclude the chapter by discussing the implications of our findings for creativity training and educational practice...|$|R
40|$|Switching between mental sets {{has been}} {{extensively}} investigated in both experimental and individual differences research using {{a wide range of}} task-switch paradigms. However, it is yet unclear whether these different tasks measure a unitary <b>shifting</b> ability or reflect different facets thereof. In this study, 20 task pairs were administered to 119 young adults to assess 5 proposed components of mental set shifting: switching between judgments, stimulus dimensions, stimulus-response mappings, response sets, and stimulus sets. Modeling latent factors for each of the components revealed that a model with 5 separate yet mostly correlated factors fit the data best. In this model, the components most strongly related to the other latent factors were stimulus-response mapping <b>shifting</b> and, to a lesser degree, response set <b>shifting.</b> In addition, both factors were statistically indistinguishable from a second-order general <b>shifting</b> factor. In contrast, <b>shifting</b> between judgments as well as stimulus dimensions consistently required separate factors and could, hence, not fully be accounted for by the general <b>shifting</b> factor. Finally, <b>shifting</b> between stimulus sets was unrelated to any other <b>shifting</b> component but mapping <b>shifting.</b> We conclude that tasks assessing <b>shifting</b> between mappings are most adequate to assess general <b>shifting</b> ability. In contrast, <b>shifting</b> between stimulus sets (e. g., as in the Trail Making Test) probably reflects <b>shifts</b> in visual attention rather than executive <b>shifting</b> ability...|$|R

Nevertheless, the teacher seldom explains pronunciation in details which makes it as obstacles for the students to produce good pronunciation in English.

In this study, the writer attempted to find out the kinds of vowel sound <b>shifts</b> and the causes of the vowel sound <b>shifts</b> produced by the eighth grade students at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari. In conducting the study, the writer used descriptive research with 32 students of eighth grade at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari chosen randomly as the research subjects. The instruments used by the writer to collect the data were performance assessment and interview. The findings of this study revealed that the students <b>shifted</b> 19 sounds from 20 vowel sounds.
