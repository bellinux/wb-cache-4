40|$|Aims and Objectives The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore the naming, or classification, of physical assaults by a partner as ‘intimate partner violence’ during emergency department consultations. Background Research continues to evidence instances when intimate partner physical violence is ‘missed’ or unacknowledged during emergency department consultations. Methods Theoretically {{this research}} was approached through complexity theory and the sociology of diagnosis. Research design was an applied, descriptive and explanatory, multiple-method approach that combined: qualitative semi-structured interviews with service users (n= 8) and emergency department practitioners (n= 9), and qualitative and quantitative document analysis of emergency department health records (n= 28). Results This study found that multiple classifications of intimate partner violence were mobilised during emergency department consultations and that these different versions of intimate partner violence held different diagnostic categories, processes, and consequences. Conclusion The construction of different versions of intimate partner violence in emergency department consultations could explain variance in people’s experiences and outcomes of consultations. The research found that the classificatory threshold for ‘intimate partner violence’ was too high. Strengthening systems of diagnosis (identification and intervention) so that all incidents of partner violence are named as ‘intimate partner violence’ will reduce the incidence of missed cases and afford earlier specialist intervention to reduce violence and limit its harms. Relevance to Clinical Practice This research found that identification of and response to intimate partner violence, even in contexts of severe physical violence, was contingent. By lowering the classificatory threshold so that all incidents of partner violence are named as ‘intimate partner violence’, practitioners could make a significant contribution to reducing missed intimate partner violence during consultations and improving health outcomes for this population. This research has relevance for practitioners in any setting where service-user report of intimate partner violence is possible. <b>SUMMARY</b> <b>BOX</b> What does this paper contribute to wider global community? •	Identification of and response to intimate partner violence, even in contexts of severe physical violence was found to be contingent. •	Classification of intimate partner violence was connected to: legal duty to respond statutory frameworks of risk of harms; socio-cultural discourses about what counts as intimate partner violence; and health care practitioners’ perceptions of usual modes of disclosure. •	Connecting all reports of partner perpetrated violence to intimate partner violence identification and intervention will reduce missed cases in health consultations and mobilise earlier intervention to reduce violence and limit its harms. •	The sociology of diagnosis is a valuable conceptual tool for examining variance in identification and response {{for a wide range of}} determinants of health of concern for nurses and allied professions...|$|E

40|$|This brief {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a Pew-commissioned experiment that tested the effect of uniform versus dissimilar disclosure formats on participants' ability to compare accounts. Half of the nationally representative sample of adults viewed <b>summary</b> <b>boxes</b> that were uniformly formatted and worded, and the other half received disclosure forms with differing layouts and language. The experiment found that uniform disclosures: Made it easier for participants to compare account terms and conditions. Increased participants' confidence in their understanding of practices and fees. Decreased the time users needed to identify account information. Increased participants' understanding of account fees and practices. These findings demonstrate the benefit of uniform disclosure for consumers and align with previous Pew research showing that 78 percent of checking account holders say that requiring banks to provide a one-page summary of key information about their accounts' terms, conditions, and fees would be an improvement. Accordingly, Pew urges the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to mandate clear, concise, and uniform disclosures for checking accounts [...] as it has proposed for general purpose reloadable prepaid cards...|$|R
40|$|Objective:   To provide {{practical}} and clinically meaningful treatment recommendations that amalgamate clinical experience and research findings for each phase of bipolar disorder. Methods:   A comprehensive {{search of the}} literature was undertaken using electronic database search engines (Medline, PubMed, Cochrane reviews) using key words (e. g., bipolar depression, mania, treatment). All relevant randomised controlled trials were examined, along with review papers, meta-analyses, and book chapters known to the authors. In addition, the recommendations from accompanying papers in this supplement have been distilled and captured {{in the form of}} <b>summary</b> <b>boxes.</b> The findings, in conjunction with the clinical experience of international researchers and clinicians who are practiced in treating mood disorders, formed the basis of the treatment recommendations within this paper. Results:   Balancing clinical experience with evidence informed and lead to the development of practical clinical recommendations that emphasise the importance of safety and tolerability alongside efficacy in the clinical management of bipolar disorder. Conclusions:   The current paper summarises the treatment recommendations relating to each phase of bipolar disorder while providing additional, evidence-based, practical insights. Medication-related side effects and monitoring strategies highlight the importance of safety and tolerability considerations, which, along with efficacy information, should be given equal merit...|$|R

40|$|By 2030 {{more than}} {{sixty percent of the}} world's {{population}} will live in urban areas, with most of the world’s population growth over the next twenty-five years being absorbed by cities and towns in low and middle income countries. What are the consequences of this shift? Demographic pressure already strains the capacity of local and national governments to manage urban change. Today, nearly one billion people live in slums, {{and in the absence of}} significant intervention that number is set to double in the next two decades. Will our future be dominated by mega-cities of poverty and despair, or can urbanization be harnessed to advance human and economic development? Cities and Development provides a critical exploration of the dynamic relationship between urbanism and development. Highlighting both the challenges and opportunities associated with rapid urban change, the book surveys: the historical relationship between urbanization and development the role cities play in fostering economic growth in a globalizing world the unique characteristics of urban poverty and the poor record of interventions designed to tackle it the complexities of managing urban environments; issues of urban crime, violence, war and terrorism in contemporary cities the importance of urban planning, governance and politics in shaping city futures.
