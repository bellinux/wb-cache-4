25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{within the field}} of {{agriculture}} that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels {{from the beginning of the}} process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the <b>soil</b> <b>preparation</b> stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} the disruption of the Russian Revolution, which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and World War I increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation. [...] For example, in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas, the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930. The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale erosion under certain environmental conditions. [...] The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other <b>soil</b> <b>preparation</b> methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods. [...] Furthermore, cotton farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and burned the stubble {{as a means to}} control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.|$|E

Only soft-rot microfungi from the Ascomycota and Zygomycota were detected in the soil. Fungi, including those antagonistic to Armillaria and Heterobasidion, were more abundant after shallow ploughing than after deep ploughing or ridging, and where chipped rather than coarse wood debris was left on the soil surface or incorporated.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of indurate pyroclastic formations of the Ecuadorian Sierra (cangahua) {{paves the way}} for the development of new agricultural areas. The material derived from the fragmentation of the hardened volcanic ashes is strongly prone to pluvial erosion, essentially because it has a fine silty-sandy texture, and because contains no organic matter and no clay minerals. Rainfall simulation was implemented before and after three cycles of cultivation to asses the evolution of soil structure and its susceptibility to erosion. The cultivated plots were < 1 % slope and the rainfall simulation tests were conducted after the harvest on bare surfaces. Two <b>soil</b> <b>preparations,</b> (coarse and fine) and four different agricultural practices, (organic matter, green manure, mineral fertilization, and zero fertilization) were evaluated; as well reference/control plots (uncultivated bare plots). Surface soil crusting occurred rapidly within the cultivated plots when compared to the recent tilled cangahua. Runoff and soil loss were generally higher on plots with lower structural stability and generally exhibited higher clay content. In agreement with the structural stability measured in a laboratory, organic matter inputs increase the soil porosity. This condition had no effect on the structural stability of the soil, resistance to crusting, and therefore little impact on surface runoff and erosion. The preferred option for land with these soils would be no tillage and a permanent soil cover (pasture) if they were to be utilised for agriculture...|$|R

Regeneration and early growth in three stand stem densities (SSDʼs) with different light regimes, i. e. uncut forest (~ 500 stems/ha), shelterwood (~ 150 stems/ha),and clear-cut, were compared. Sowing, after using two <b>soil</b> <b>preparations</b> (mineral <b>soil</b> and a mixture of mineral soil and humus layer ground to a ﬁne texture), and planting were done in 2001 at six distances in north-south direction from trees (0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 4 and 6 meters). Naturally regenerated P. abies seedling and saplings were also selected in pairs in the uncut forest. Half of all seedlings and saplings in the experiments were irrigated with fertiliser (10 mM N). The light environment didnʼt differ signiﬁcantly between different orientations or distances with respect to trees, but it was clearly different between SSDʼs. On the North slope, the emergence of direct seeded seedlings was highest (50 in percent of germinable seeds for P. sylvestris and 44 % for P. abies) in SSD 150. On the other hand, on the South slope the conditions in SSD 0 favoured the high emergence of P. sylvestris (41 %). Only for P. abies on the North slope, fertilised seeded seedlings were taller (ca. 20 %) than nonfertilised seeded seedlings after 4 years. For planted P. abies, the fertilised seedlings in SSD 0 {{were the ones that}} grew the most (22. 2 cm). Fertilisation had no effect on height growth of planted P. sylvestris, but the growth was clearly increasing (from 50 cm) with decreasing SSD. The naturally regenerated seedlings/saplings in the different height classes showed no response in height growth to fertilisation. With planted P. sylvestris being the more extreme, dry mass of leading shoot in SSD 500 was only 3 % of that in SSD 0, while for height growth the corresponding value was almost 30 %. The main conclusion was that for plant establishment the general conditions of the stand mattered more than the orientation and distance with respect to the nearest tree and the light environment was more important than the nutritional status, i. e. light requirements could not be moderated by nutrient supply. A resulting new hypothesis was that a system of forest gaps and shelterwood in a geometric pattern could be used in conventional forestry to regenerate forests.

The application of this Eh measurement method allows characterisation of soil conditions with sufficient repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy to demonstrate that conservation agriculture systems positively alter the protonic and electronic balance of soil as compared to conventional systems.

The experimental design was a randomized block with four treatments and eight replications. At six years old, the height, diameter at breast height, survival (number of plants {{in relation to the}} initial stand), and timber production per plant were measured.
