5|$|With {{the weather}} {{improving}} over the United Kingdom and Normandy, Hausser's preparations for his counter stroke came under continual harassment from Allied aircraft and artillery fire, delaying {{the start of}} the attack to the afternoon. From the number of German reinforcements arriving in the VIII Corps sector and aerial reconnaissance, O'Connor suspected that the Germans were organising a counter-stroke. XXX Corps was still some way to the north, leaving the VIII Corps right flank vulnerable, O'Connor postponed attacks by I Corps and ordered VIII Corps onto the defensive. Dempsey, privy to ULTRA decrypts of intercepted German <b>signal</b> <b>traffic,</b> knew the counter-attack was coming and approved O'Connor's precautions. VIII Corps began to reorganise to meet the attack. Supply echelons for Hausser's divisions were located in the Évrecy–Noyers-Bocage–Villers-Bocage area and were the focus of RAF fighter-bomber attention throughout the morning and early afternoon; the RAF claimed the destruction of over 200 vehicles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{forwarding}} pointer-based cache scheme (PB-Cache scheme) that {{can reduce the}} signaling cost for location management in PCS networks. In the existing cache scheme, the use of cache information can effectively reduce the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> for locating frequently called mobile users. However, when the cache information is obsolete, it results in much more <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> {{than that of the}} IS- 41. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new location cache scheme called the PB-Cache scheme, which exploits a user’s movement locality as well as call locality. Even if the cached information is not up-to-date, the called user can be found by tracing forwarding pointers starting from that VLR pointed in the cache instead of querying the HLR. Thus, the PB-Cache scheme can effectively reduce the frequent access to the HLR and the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> for location management. Moreover, it distributes the signaling and database access load on the HLR to the VLR’s. Analytical results indicate that the PB-Cache scheme significantly outperforms the other schemes when a user’s call-to-mobility ratio is high or the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> to the HLR is heavy...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} four network {{interconnection}} scenarios {{and the related}} signaling aspects for the international roaming traffic in mobile and personal communications. With or without international gateway relay nodes summarized from the proposed scenarios, we also derive three international roaming network sets {IR 1, IR 2, IR 3 } for the observed <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> model with two-level databases. Based on the proposed performance metrics, analysis results show that under some reasonable assumptions the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> of international roaming is significantly impacted by the related gateway relay nodes and databases. In addition, the studied cache data management strategy at VLR can reduce the impacts of the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> of query operation, but the caching approach cannot improve the performance of update operation. Furthermore, the performance of proposed standalone STP scenario is better than that of integrated STP scenario for the international network connection. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractÐFor a PCS {{network to}} {{effectively}} deliver services to its mobile users, {{it must have}} {{an efficient way to}} keep track of the mobile users. The location management fulfills this task through location registration and paging. To reduce the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic,</b> many schemes such as Local Anchor (LA) scheme, per-user caching scheme and pointer forwarding scheme have been proposed in the past. In this paper, we present a new location management scheme which intends to mitigate the <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> as well as reduce the tracking delay in the PCS systems. In this strategy, we choose a set of VLRs traversed by users as the Mobility Agents (MA), which form another level of management in order to make some registration <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> localized. The idea is as follows: Instead of always updating to the HLR, which would become the bottleneck otherwise, many location updates are carried out in the mobility agents. Thus, the two-level pointer forwarding scheme is designed to reduce the signaling traffic: Pointers can be set up between VLRs as the traditional pointer forwarding scheme and can also be set up between MAs. The numerical results show that this strategy can significantly reduce the network <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> for users with low CMR without increasing much of the call setup delay.

50|$|To {{understand}} basic {{traffic signal}} timing fundamentals, one must also understand the different {{modes of operation}} of the traffic signal controller which controls the <b>signal.</b> <b>Traffic</b> signals may be placed into two broad groups by their method of operation. They can be either pre-timed or actuated. Pre-timed traffic signals provide each intersection approach a fixed amount of time on a round robin basis, serving each approach consecutively, and repeating the pattern. No movements are skipped. An actuated traffic signal relies on some mechanism for detecting vehicles as they approach the intersection. Where detection has occurred, green time is provided to that approach. Approaches with no detection are skipped. These two schemes are {{also referred to as}} interval based and phase based signal timing.|$|E
50|$|The large troop {{movements}} required for this took {{two months to}} execute. They had {{to be carried out}} in small units to maintain secrecy and surprise. U.S. 36th Division was sent on amphibious assault training and road signposts and dummy radio <b>signal</b> <b>traffic</b> were created {{to give the impression that}} a seaborne landing was being planned for north of Rome. This was planned to keep German reserves held back from the Gustav Line. Movements of troops in forward areas were confined to the hours of darkness and armoured units moving from the Adriatic front left behind dummy tanks and vehicles so the vacated areas appeared unchanged to enemy aerial reconnaissance. The deception was successful. As late as the second day of the final Cassino battle, Generalfeldmarschall Kesselring estimated the Allies had six divisions facing his four on the Cassino front.
