5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not damage cells {{and can be}} safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) {{but the use of}} the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, {{the squash}} and stretch were exaggerated by Disney animators, making it ever more extreme, {{but they had}} to {{maintain}} the overall volume of an object <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not appear to change volume as well as shape.|$|R
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not impact their cognition.|$|E
25|$|The second {{molecule}} of H2 {{does not}} appear in the rate equation because it reacts in the third step, which is a rapid step after the rate-determining step, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not affect the overall reaction rate.|$|E
50|$|Letters patent are {{so named}} from the Latin verb , to lie open, exposed, accessible. The originator's seal was {{attached}} pendent from the document, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not have to}} be broken in order for the document to be read.|$|R
25|$|Further, {{the court}} held that while the statute forbade the {{teaching}} of evolution (as the court had defined <b>it),</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not require the teaching of any other doctrine, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not benefit any one religious doctrine or sect over the others.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the event, the ACO {{modified}} the course near the actual town of Le Mans <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not enter as {{far into the}} suburbs. The shortcut was built at the ACO's expense, and shortened the track length by approximately a kilometer.|$|R
25|$|To use deeper ponds, growers agitate the water, {{circulating}} {{the algae}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not {{remain on the}} surface. Paddle wheels can stir the water and compressed air coming from the bottom lifts algae from the lower regions. Agitation also helps prevent over-exposure to the sun.|$|E
25|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} (exhaust tee, exhaust cover, whiskers) is the ducting {{that protects the}} exhaust valve(s) and diverts the exhaled air to the sides <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not bubble up in the diver's face and obscure the view. This is not necessary for twin hose regulators as they exhaust air behind the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|This {{average torque}} is {{perpendicular}} to {{the direction in which}} the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun (or the Moon) varies with the gravitational object's alignment with the Earth's spin axis and approaches zero when it is orthogonal.|$|E
60|$|King Louis XII {{dispatched}} the Sieur de Sarenon by sea, with a {{fleet of}} three ships and five galleys, to the end that he should conduct the new duke to France, which fleet was delayed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not drop its anchors at Ostia {{until the end of}} September.|$|R

The 14-50 has a rating of 50A, and a straight neutral blade sized <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not mate with 14-30 connectors.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, {{also known}} as the Orange Africa Cup of Nations South Africa 2013 for {{sponsorship}} reasons, held from 19 January to 10 February 2013, was the 29th Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Starting from this edition, the tournament was switched to being held in odd-numbered years instead of even-numbered years <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not clash with the FIFA World Cup.|$|E
25|$|There are {{alternatives}} to a block heater that offer {{some of the}} same benefits. These include heaters attached to the engine's oil pan, usually with magnets. Dipstick heaters can be installed in place of the engine's oil dipstick. Heated blankets are available for the entire engine area, as well. A timer can be used with any of these heaters, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have to be left on all the time. This can help lower the electrical costs of using a block heater.|$|E
50|$|Elections of {{the whole}} council were held every three years. Elections were {{cancelled}} during {{the two world wars}} (1914-1918 and 1939-1945). The 1952 election was postponed for a year <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not clash with elections to the London County Council. The number of councillors returned at each election was as follows:.|$|R
50|$|EverQuest Online Adventureswas {{developed}} {{and published by}} Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) and first released on February 11, 2003 in North America.

50|$|The Exclusion Bill Parliament was a Parliament of England {{during the}} reign of Charles II of England, named after the long saga of the Exclusion Bill. Summoned on 24 July 1679, but prorogued by the king <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not {{assemble}} until 21 October 1680, it was dissolved three months later on 18 January 1680/81.|$|R
25|$|One {{problem the}} extreme {{southern}} part of the state has had in the past decade is the contamination of water from the drainage of the Valley of Mexico. Mexico City pumps out excess water from the area, as the valley has no natural drainage, to the north into Mexico and Hidalgo states. This water is increasingly polluted and is causing damage to these northern zones. The state is negotiating federal and other help to treat and recycle this water <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not do further damage to state agriculture and environment.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power has}} proved {{controversial}} since the 1970s. Highly radioactive materials may overheat and {{escape from the}} reactor building. Nuclear waste (spent nuclear fuel) needs to be regularly removed from the reactors and disposed of safely {{for up to a}} million years, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not pollute the environment. Recycling of nuclear waste has been discussed, but it creates plutonium which can be used in weapons, and in any case still leaves much unwanted waste to be stored and disposed of. Large, purpose-built facilities for long-term disposal of nuclear waste have been difficult to site, and have not yet reached fruition.|$|E
25|$|The longe whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not interfere with the horse.|$|E

30|$|The {{amount of}} {{distortion}} {{added to the}} pure data {{is proportional to the}} evaluated privacy risk. If the privacy risk is low, distortion added is small enough <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> not affect the quality of answer, but large enough that they protect the individual privacy of database. But if the privacy risk is high then more distortion is added.|$|R
50|$|Nine years later, on November 12, 2013 {{there was}} a minor fire in the West Tower, the fire was on the 16th floor, which 420 people were {{evacuated}} and 15 were rescued, no fatalities. The fire was immediately controlled <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not affect the upper floors of the tower. Fire Department officials presumed that the fire occurred in a trash chute.|$|R
25|$|The {{other basic}} {{defensive}} play {{is called the}} bump or ride-off. It's similar to a body check in hockey. In a ride-off, a player rides his pony alongside an opponent's mount {{in order to move}} an opponent away from the ball or to take him out of a play. It must be executed properly <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not endanger the horses or the players. The angle of contact must be safe and can not knock the horses off balance, or harm the horses in any way. Two players following the line of the ball and riding one another off have the right of way over a single man coming from any direction.|$|E
25|$|GC is {{a method}} {{involving}} the separation of different analytes within a sample of mixed gases. The separated gases can be detected multiple ways, {{but one of the}} most powerful detection methods for gas chromatography is mass spectrometry. After the gases separate, they enter the mass spectrometer and are analyzed. This combination not only separates the analytes, but gives structural information about each one. The GC sample must be volatile, or able to enter the gas phase, while also being thermally stable <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not break down as it is heated to enter the gas phase. Mass spectrometry ionization techniques requiring the sample to be in the gas phase have similar concerns.|$|E
25|$|Highly skilled leg spin bowlers {{are also}} able to bowl {{deliveries}} that behave unexpectedly, including the googly, which turns the opposite way to a normal leg break and the topspinner, which does not turn but dips sharply and bounces higher than other deliveries. A few leg spinners such as Abdul Qadir, Anil Kumble, Shane Warne and Mushtaq Ahmed have also mastered the flipper, a delivery that like a topspinner goes straight on landing, but floats through the air before skidding and keeping low, often dismissing batsmen leg before wicket or bowled. Another variation in the arsenal of some leg spinners is the slider, a leg break pushed out of the hand somewhat faster, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not spin as much, but travels more straight on.|$|E
50|$|Ayotte Homestead- Built {{prior to}} 1841, the Ayotte Homestead was moved from its {{original}} site on Clear Lake in Smith Township.
