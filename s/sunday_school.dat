5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> movement, {{founding}} the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them". Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked Trimmer's advice on founding a <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> at Windsor.|$|E

5000|$|The work of <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools</b> in the {{industrial}} cities was increasingly supplemented by [...] "ragged schools" [...] (charitable provision for {{the industrial}} poor), and eventually by publicly funded education under the late 19th-century <b>school</b> boards. <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools</b> continued alongside such increasing educational provision, and new forms also developed such as the Socialist <b>Sunday</b> <b>Schools</b> movement, {{which began in the}} United Kingdom in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Necessary {{equipments}} to <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools</b> {{were distributed}} during his period. Especially, necessary educational and religious materials {{were distributed to}} Buddhist, Christian and Muslim Hadiya <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools</b> through the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. He {{was the first person}} who donated materials to Muslim Hadiya <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools.</b> Also to uphold the welfare of women, nutrition packages were distributed among pregnant mothers as well as conducted dental clinics through Ministry of women Affairs.|$|R

50|$|Ordained as a {{minister}} in the Congregational Church in 1888, Platt left KSAC in 1889 and traveled throughout Kansas establishing <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools.</b> He and his wife subsequently continued this work in Oklahoma, where he is credited with establishing 150 <b>Sunday</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R
50|$|Socialist <b>Sunday</b> <b>Schools</b> (SSS) {{were set}} up as an {{alternative}} to Christian <b>Sunday</b> <b>Schools</b> in the United Kingdom. They arose in response to a feeling as to the inadequacy of the orthodox <b>Sunday</b> <b>Schools</b> as a training ground for the children of socialists and of the need for some organised and systematic method of presenting the socialist point of view and of teaching the ideals and principles of socialism to the children, youths and maidens in the country.|$|R
5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a <b>Sunday</b> <b>school.</b> This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
5|$|St John's Church {{was built}} in 1769 by Edward Byrom, a co-founder of the first bank in Manchester. Its parish {{encompassed}} a large and important {{section of the city}} of Manchester. The first rector, John Clowes, held the office for 62 years until his death in 1831. Clowes preached the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks. Clowes was succeeded by William Huntington, who had held the post of curate since 1826 and continued as rector until his death in 1874. Huntington established the <b>Sunday</b> <b>school,</b> for which he laid the foundation stone in 1827. In 1906, around 250 children attended the <b>Sunday</b> <b>school</b> and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. By the early 1900s, the graveyard was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse built on the Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence, and with a declining congregation and some redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, the Manchester diocese decided to merge the parish of St John's with St Matthew's in 1927. As a result, the church was demolished in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{was sold}} in 1928 due {{to changes in the}} district, and was {{subsequently}} used as a Welsh Baptist Chapel. The chapel was then used as a Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall in the early 1970s. The most recent use of both the chapel and former <b>Sunday</b> <b>School</b> was for the Islamic Academy of Manchester between 1974 and 2006, when it was used as a mosque, teaching centre and for outreach work in the Asian community. The chapel is currently vacant, with the Islamic Academy occupying the <b>Sunday</b> <b>School.</b> The building has been owned by Manchester City Council since the 1970s, who purchased land alongside Upper Brook Street with the aim of constructing a large motorway into Manchester, which was never realised.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} wooden {{church building}} was moved again in 1909 and extended in 1928 {{for use as}} a community hall. It had a kitchen extension added in 1955 and a kindergarten room in 1958. The split paling cladding was replaced with weatherboards in the 1900s. The roof was replaced with iron, probably in 1914 when the brick church was also re-roofed in iron. The interior paling lining of the old wooden church was covered with pine sheeting in the late 1930s. This building {{has been used as a}} church for seven years, more than sixty years as a meeting room and community centre and more than seventy years as a day and <b>Sunday</b> <b>school.</b> After the school moved to a new building in 1929 the old building remained in use as a <b>Sunday</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Wesleyan chapel {{was built}} in 1865; a small {{weatherboard}} building with an attached <b>Sunday</b> <b>School.</b> The Church eventually fell out of use and became a private home.
