50|$|The word <b>Salep</b> {{comes from}} سَحْلَب (saḥlab). In the mid 18th century: from French, from Turkish <b>sālep,</b> from ثَعْلَب (aṯ-ṯaʿlabi), {{the name of}} an orchid (literally ‘fox's testicles’).|$|E
5000|$|The {{ice cream}} is usually and {{traditionally}} made with an ingredient called Sahlab (...) or <b>Salep</b> (Turkish: <b>salep),</b> which provides {{it with the}} ability to resist melting at the speed that other regular ice creams are affected by. Sahlab or <b>Salep</b> is also a primary ingredient in the Turkish version of this style of ice cream called Dondurma, and the Persian version called Bastani.|$|E
50|$|The {{beverage}} sahlab is now {{often made}} with hot milk instead of water. Other desserts are also made from <b>salep</b> flour, including <b>salep</b> pudding and <b>salep</b> ice cream. The Kahramanmaraş region of Turkey {{is a major}} producer of sahlab known as Salepi Maraş. The popularity of sahlab in Turkey {{has led to a}} decline in the populations of wild orchids. As a result, it is illegal to export true <b>salep.</b> Thus, many instant sahlab mixes are made with artificial flavoring. <b>Salep</b> is also consumed in Greece, and it is usually sold on the streets as a hot beverage during the cold months of the year. It is extremely popular {{in many parts of the}} Middle East, especially the Levant. Families in Turkey drink the hot version during the winter time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{underground}} tubers {{of terrestrial}} orchids Orchis mascula are {{ground to a}} powder and used for cooking, {{such as in the}} hot beverage <b>salep</b> or in the Turkish frozen treat dondurma. The name <b>salep</b> has been claimed to come from the Arabic expression ḥasyu al-tha`lab, [...] "fox testicles", but it appears more likely the name comes directly from the Arabic name saḥlab. The similarity in appearance to testes naturally accounts for <b>salep</b> being considered an aphrodisiac.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Salep</b> was {{a popular}} {{beverage}} in the lands of the Ottoman Empire. Its consumption spread beyond there to England and Germany before the rise of coffee and tea and it was later offered as an alternative beverage in coffee houses. In England, the drink was known as saloop. Popular in the 17th and 18th centuries in England, its preparation required that the <b>salep</b> powder be added to water until thickened whereupon it would be sweetened, then flavored with orange flower or rose water.

If prepared incorrectly, it can be highly toxic, so should be prepared with due diligence and caution.|$|E
5000|$|The Ancient Romans used ground orchid bulbs to make drinks, {{which they}} called {{by a number}} of names, {{especially}} satyrion and priapiscus. As the names indicate, they likewise considered it to be a powerful aphrodisiac. Of <b>salep,</b> Paracelsus wrote: [...] "behold the Satyrion root, is it not formed like the male privy parts? No one can deny this. Accordingly, magic discovered it and revealed that it can restore a man's virility and passion".|$|E

50|$|In the Autumn of 638, Abu Ubaidah {{launched}} several columns, {{including two}} commanded by Khalid ibn Walid and Ayadh, to raid Byzantine territory in Anatolia as far west as Tarsus. Khalid's objective was Germanicia (Arabic: Marash), the city which lies on a plain {{at the foot}} of the Taurus Mountains. The region is best known for its production of <b>salep,</b> a flour made from dried orchid tubers. In late 638 the Muslim army laid the siege to the city which contained a Byzantine garrison. Expecting no help from their Emperor, the Byzantine garrison surrendered the city on the usual terms of Jizya offered by the Rashidun army, which included terms stating that the garrison and the populace be spared. As for material wealth, the Muslim could take all they wished.|$|E
5000|$|The art {{developed}} in Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey, {{as well as}} Mughal and the Deccan Sultanates in India. Within these regions, various methods emerged in which colors were made to float {{on the surface of}} a bath of viscous liquid mucilage or size, made from various plants. These include katheera or kitre- gum tragacanth (Astragalus often used as a binder by apothecaries in making tablets), shambalîleh or methi- fenugreek seed (an ingredient in curry mixtures), and sahlab or <b>salep</b> (the roots of [...] "Orchis mascula", which is commonly used to make a popular beverage). A method of manipulating colors evolved that employed various tools including rakes, combs, and other apparatus, utilized in a series of movements, resulted in incredibly elaborate, intricate, and mesmerizing designs. In India, the abri technique was eventually combined with aks, which are various methods of resist or stencils, to create unique and very rare form of miniature painting. These are commonly associated with the Deccan region today, and especially the city of Bijapur in particular, under Adil Shahi dynasty patronage in the 17th century. The topic of marbling in India is understudied and conclusive determinations have yet to be made, especially in light of discoveries made in the last 20 years.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{difficult}} living {{circumstances and}} at times sociopolitical disturbances, especially in the 19th century, Upper Reka has historically been a region with much outward temporary and permanent migration. Traditionally the population was mainly engaged with animal husbandry and agricultural activities which some of the small remaining population still carry out. As such during the late Ottoman era, Upper Reka males (mainly adults) would seasonally go on kurbet or economic migration. Often they would find employment as pastry makers or as halva, <b>salep</b> and boza merchants and salesmen in the then Ottoman capital Istanbul or regional cities like Skopje and Edirne. In Romania and Bulgaria, some Upper Reka people were also employed in the housing construction industry as stonemasons or builders and likewise when the need arose {{in cities such as}} Shkodër or their local area too. While permanent migratory flows during the late Ottoman era were mainly to neighbouring villages and regions where today these populations often form few households within a settlement amongst their wider Albanian population. In the region of Upper Polog, Upper Reka people relocated to the following villages: Čegrane, Forino, Korito, Balin Dol, Malo Turčane, Dolna Banjica, Sretkovo, Novo Selo, Rečane, Vrutok, Pečkovo, Zdunje, Vrapčište, Kalište and Gradec. In Lower Polog: Gorno Sedlarce, Rakovec, Žerovjane, Radiovce, Tenovo, Lukovica, Sedlarevo and Gurgurnica. In villages within the vicinity of Skopje city: Crn Vrv, Krušopek, Sveta Petka and Patiška Reka, while near Veles at: Gorno Jabolčište, Sogle, Klukovec and Buzalkovo. In some villages, the Upper Reka population migrated there as Christians like in Lukovica and only converted thereafter to Islam. While in Patiška Reka, they remained Orthodox and Albanian speaking until World War Two, before relocating to Skopje thereafter. Some Upper Reka residents from Vrbjani have in recent decades migrated to the neighbouring Muslim Macedonian village of Žirovnica with municipal services in Lower Reka and number some 258 people. While Orthodox Christians migrated from the 1950s onwards to the then Yugoslav capital Belgrade, other cities like Skopje and to nearby Gostivar town where they form the main population of Durtlok neighbourhood. Due to the 2001 insurgency in northern Macedonia, the village of Tanuše was affected by the conflict which made some residents migrate thereafter to other places. Young Upper Reka people in recent times have also emigrated to Western countries, while some older inhabitants return to their homes in Upper Reka during the summer period.|$|E
