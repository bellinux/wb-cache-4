[...] "With {{snow on the ground}} and the slab yonder covered, it would be almost {{impossible}} to locate it." [...] He turned to Jake. [...] "How long would you say it was since the rain or frost brought that <b>small</b> <b>stuff</b> down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Harry {{with the}} same {{strained}} laugh, [...] "dad knows too much for that. Those logs are thick, they won't light easy, and it's only a little pile of <b>small</b> <b>stuff</b> that's burning. Dad has no use for standing out where those fellows can see him unless it's necessary. In the meanwhile the dope men don't {{know where he is}} and that's going to worry them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finding {{that the}} {{propeller}} would now work, Captain Williamson gave orders for full speed astern. As {{soon as the}} engines started there was more crashing of ice, the <b>small</b> <b>stuff</b> being ground down under the ship, and the ice of the pinnacle breaking off along the shrouds. Everybody on deck {{had to get out}} of the way, for the deck took on the appearance of [...] "an ice-house upset," [...] as Chet put it, big chunks of the frozen material lying in all directions.|$|E

60|$|The wind {{seemed to}} be {{dropping}} and the sparks were not quite so bad {{when they reached the}} house. They found a bucket, and after smashing more of the ice upon the shallow well Frank climbed up on the woodshed which reached to the low roof. The latter was covered with cedar shingles and he wondered why it had not ignited, because the sparks were still dropping upon it and there were several charred spots. This, however, was not a question of much consequence, and Harry kept him busy during the next half hour sluicing the roof with water which he passed up in the bucket. Some of it went over Frank's hands and clothing and it was icy cold, but they worked on steadily while the fire worked back farther from them into the bush. It had burned most fiercely when it had the dry branches in the slashing to supply it, but these were all licked up, and though the <b>small</b> <b>stuff</b> blazed the great standing trunks would not burn. There were already rows of them rising, charred and blackened columns, behind the slashing.|$|E
