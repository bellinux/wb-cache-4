40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the value of}} farmers stated <b>succession</b> <b>plans</b> in predicting revealed succession decisions. The stated <b>succession</b> <b>plan</b> exists when a farmer answers in a survey questionnaire that the farm {{is going to be}} transferred to a new entrant within a five year period. The succession is revealed when the farm is transferred to a successor. The stated and revealed behaviour is estimated as a recursive Binomial-Probit- Model, which accounts for censoring of the decision variables and controls for a potential correlation between the estimating equations. The results suggest that the <b>succession</b> <b>plans,</b> as stated by elderly farmers in the questionnaires, do not provide information that is significant and valuable in predicting the true, revealed successions, once certain farm and farmer characteristics are controlled for. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between succession and firm performance. Applying a non-parametric matching approach on a panel of roughly 4, 000 Austrian family firms we evaluate the impact of past succession as well as future <b>succession</b> <b>plans</b> on employment growth. Analysing <b>succession</b> <b>plans,</b> we do not find a 'shadow of succession' effect. No significant difference in employment growth is found between firms that plan to transfer the firm in {{the next ten years}} and those who do not. In contrast, past succession exerts a significant and positive employment growth effect which becomes stronger over time. Thus, our findings provide support for the existence of a positive employment shadow after a transfer, whereas the shadow of succession hypothesis has to be rejected prior to transition.
