The effect of seed burial depth on seedling recruitment in the field was also investigated at Roseworthy, South Australia. Under optimal conditions (30 C, light/dark) germination of perennial <b>wall</b> <b>rocket</b> was rapid, with 90 % of seeds germinating within 48 h of imbibition. Germination was reduced (20 %) at lower, suboptimal temperatures (10 to 20 C) when seeds of perennial <b>wall</b> <b>rocket</b> were exposed to light. Germination declined with increasing osmotic potential and was completely inhibited at osmotic potentials of − 1. 5 MPa.

Eruca sativa, which is widely popular as a salad vegetable, is a species of Eruca native to the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and Portugal in the west to Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey in the east. The Latin adjective sativa in the plant's binomial is derived from satum, the supine of the verb sero, meaning [...] "to sow", indicating that the seeds of the plant were sown in gardens. Eruca sativa differs from E. vesicaria in having early deciduous sepals. Some botanists consider it a subspecies of Eruca vesicaria: E. vesicaria subsp. sativa.

5000|$|The hot gas {{produced}} in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the [...] "throat"), and then through a diverging expansion section. When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle chokes and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times {{the speed of sound}} in air at sea level are not uncommon. About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram). As the gas expands (adiabatically) the pressure against the nozzle's <b>walls</b> forces the <b>rocket</b> engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.|$|R

The aim is to verify the capability of the Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes model to capture the basic characteristics of film-cooled thrust chambers, considering a simplified approach, named pseudo-injector approach, which does not model propellant injection and combustion. This assumption allows a great saving in computational time, in particular when considering 3 D simulations.

40|$|The non-stationary flow of {{cryogenic}} propellants in rocket engines {{is treated}} as quasi one-dimensional. Since cryogenic propellants evaporate {{when they come in}} contact with the <b>walls</b> of those <b>rocket</b> engine components that are initially at ambient temperature, all phase regimes from liquid to gaseous are taken into account. The conservation equations are solved by a method of characteristics and also through use of a Riemann-solver. The practical applicability of the simulation-model is shown with the following examples: Cool-down of a tube when filling it with liquid hydrogen, start-up of a gasgenerator rocket engine and closing of a valve in a liquid oxygen feed line. The results of numerical simulations for a gasgenerator rocket engine give an indication of the difficulties in finding a valve sequence for the start-up procedure in case the pump characteristics have an unstable region. Results from numerical simulations help in explaining effects of valve sequences of the feed system. (orig.)

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of reducing heat transfer rates to inert nozzle <b>walls</b> in solid <b>rockets</b> by addition of silicone oil as a propellant ingredient is explored experimentally. A metallized control propellant and its counterpart with 1 % silicone oil are fired in a 2 1 / 2 -in. diameter end burning all-metal burner. Pressure-time histories are obtained; temperature-time data at the nozzle throat are obtained {{in some of}} the runs. The heat loss by the product gases to the cold inert walls of the nozzle lower the temperature of the gases leading to the condensation of aluminum oxide on the walls. This condensation is used as an index of the heat transfer rate to the nozzle. On a statistical basis it is found that the silicone propellant gives practically no condensation in 70 % of the firings contrasted with 21 % for its counterpart with no silicone oil in it. The gas temperature at the nozzle throat is experimentally seen to be generally higher with the silicone propellant than with its counterpart; this higher temperature is consistent with a preliminary analysis that is used here to relate the nozzle surface temperature to the heat transfer from the product gases...|$|R

During a TMF test, only a small section of the hot gas wall of the real engine (the so called TMF panel) is tested. For such a TMF panel, realistic cooling conditions similar to a full scale rocket engine are chosen. The 2 d measurement of the thermal field of the heat loaded structure provides (together with the measurement of the temperature, pressure and mass flow rate of the coolant of the TMF panel) data for the combined validation of the CFD analysis of the coolant flow and the thermal analysis of the wall structure. The measurement of the deformation of the thermally loaded structure provides (together with the already determined temperature distribution and the above mentioned pressure measurements of the cooling channels) data for the validation of the structural analysis of the thermally loaded structure. Counting the number of laser loading cycles (laser on-off) until the TMF panel fails (by cracks appearing on the laser loaded side of the cooling channels) provides data for the validation of (either post processing or damage parameter based) life time analyses of thermally loaded structures...|$|R
