50|$|Skeletonization {{occurs when}} the UID has decayed {{to the point that}} bones and {{possibly}} some tissues are all that is found, usually when death occurred a significant amount of time before discovery. If a <b>skeletonized</b> <b>body</b> is found, fingerprints and toeprints are impossible to recover, unless they have survived the initial decomposition of the remains. Fingerprints are often used to identify the dead and were used widely before DNA comparison was possible. In some cases, partial remains limit the available information; for example, a woman's skull found in Frankfurt, Germany, was insufficient to estimate her height and weight.|$|E

40|$|The {{established}} {{importance of}} Forensic Dentistry for human identification, mainly {{when there is}} little remaining material to perform such identification (e. g., in fires, explosions, decomposing <b>bodies</b> or <b>skeletonized</b> <b>bodies),</b> has led dentists working with forensic investigation to become {{more familiar with the}} new molecular biology techniques. The currently available DNA tests have high reliability and are accepted as legal proofs in courts. This article presents a literature review referring to the main studies on Forensic Dentistry that involve the use of DNA for human identification, and makes an overview of the evolution of this technology in the last years, highlighting the importance of molecular biology in forensic sciences...|$|R

The blind CFA was made following the Manchester’s protocol. In our test the CFA was compared with a photographic array of ten faces, included the photo of the individual whom belonged the skull. The positive recognition was evaluated by a total of 320 unfamiliar assessors. During the test a survey was also conducted to evaluate which facial feature mostly drive the process of identification. The true positive recognition showed extremely poor results. Only the 5...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the first records of termite activity on non-fossilized human bones in Brazil. The cases reported in this study resulted from forensic analysis of six human skeletons found in northeastern Brazil between 2012 and 2014. Traces of tunnels and nests commonly produced by termites were found on several human bone surfaces as well as the specimens and characteristic signs of osteophagic activity. In four cases, the species were identified: Amitermes amifer Silvestri, 1901, Nasutitermes corniger (Motschulsky, 1855) (on two skeletons), and Microcerotermes indistinctus Mathews, 1977. In two other cases, the activity of termites on bone surfaces was evidenced by remains of nests and tunnels produced by these insects. At least in the samples of human remains available for this report, the number of termites collected was greater on bones found during autumn, the rainy season in the Northeast of Brazil. The human bones examined showed termites like insects with lots of strength at bone degradation, capable of continuing the process of decomposition of human remains even in completely <b>skeletonized</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
50|$|Most remains {{are found}} in a lightly {{contracted}} or contracted position on their sides. Because of the arid desert climate, natural mummification is very common. Without the normal processes of decomposition to <b>skeletonize</b> the <b>body,</b> soft tissues, hairs, and organic grave goods are still often found (e.g., textiles, feathers, leather, fingernails). Grave goods include faience beads, cattle skulls, and pottery. Skeletal collections, like other archaeological evidence, continue to be re-examined and re-interpreted as new research questions arise. Two recent studies highlight {{the kinds of questions}} that bioarchaeologists are asking of the skeletal material excavated from Kerma.|$|R

40|$|The authors made statistica 1 {{observations}} of medico- 1 egal autopsy cases of unidentified {{bodies in the}} Department of Legal Medicine, Nara Medica 1 University School of Medicine, during the last half decade(2009 - 2013). This study revealed that cases of unidentified bodies have been increasing. DNA tests, tooth appraisal, and finger prints were common methods for persona 1 identification. The bodies discovered in their own houses accounted for the large part of total unidentified death and they were left unattended for a long period. A decomposed or <b>skeletonized</b> <b>body</b> was {{the primary cause of}} the unidentified cases. "Unknown" was more frequent than any other cause of death among the unidentified bodies. Determining the cause of death is essential for exact mortality statistics and improvement of pub 1 ic hea 1 th.

Since autopsies for unidentified cases are more complicated than for identified cases, increasing the staff size in the Department of Legal Medicine is an urgent issue to cope with the increasing number of autopsy cases...|$|E
40|$|Burgess Shale-type (BST) biotas occur {{globally}} in Lower and Middle Cambrian shales, {{and were}} preserved under specific and exceptional circumstances. Among {{the circumstances surrounding}} fossilization, benthic redox conditions {{have been the subject}} of particular disagreement. While most authors have assumed that the sites of preservation were anoxic and therefore inhospitable to metazoans, several have recently argued that BST assemblages were preserved in situ under habitable benthic conditions. Here, we use field and laboratory intensive, fine-scale methods to investigate the paleoredox settings of fossil assemblages in two Burgess Shale-type deposits, the Wheeler and Marjum Formations of western Utah (Cambrian Series 3), and review recently published data for other principal Burgess Shale-type deposits. In the Wheeler and Marjum Formations, fossil assemblages and ichnofabrics were evaluated at the millimeter scale. An ichnological model was then applied to reconstruct relative paleo-oxygen content of bottom waters at a bed-to-bed scale through multiple intervals sampled continuously. This approach permits fine-scale evaluation of the relationships of discrete fossil assemblages to paleoredox conditions. Over 7800 individual beds were logged in this study. These data demonstrate that the Wheeler and Marjum Formations were deposited under dynamic benthic redox conditions. In both deposits, beds representing deposition under dysoxic conditions may be interbedded at the millimeter–centimeter scale with those representing deposition under anoxic conditions. Although the beds deposited under both types of redox conditions may be richly fossiliferous, the distribution of fossil assemblages within the Wheeler and Marjum Formations was regulated by dissolved oxygen content of bottom waters as a first-order control. BST preservation occurs within a microfacies inferred to represent deposition under anoxic conditions, and contains transported fossils along a recognizable proximal–distal gradient. Under dysoxic benthic conditions, assemblages of <b>skeletonized</b> <b>body</b> fossils dominated by trilobites occur in both formations. In the Wheeler Formation, the junction of these two benthic redox environments is characterized by dense monospecific associations of the opportunistic trilobite Elrathia kingii, but a comparable exaerobic taxon does not appear to be present in the Marjum Formation. These results demonstrate the control of near-bottom anoxia over preservation of BST assemblages in both formations and are consistent with the findings from the Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang...|$|E
40|$|Recognition of {{handwritten}} manuscripts {{is essential}} for efficient content exploitation of the valuable Old Greek historical collections. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} problem of recognizing Old Greek handwritten manuscripts and propose a novel recognition technique that can be applied to a large number of important historical manuscript collections which are written in lower case letters and originate from St. Catherine’s Mount Sinai Monastery. Based on an open and closed cavity character representation, we propose a novel, segmentation-free, fast and efficient technique for the detection and recognition of characters and character ligatures. First, we detect open and closed cavities that exist in the <b>skeletonized</b> character <b>body.</b> Then, the recognition of a specific character or character ligature is based on the protrusible segments that appear in the topological description of the character skeletons. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will be able}} to use {{a modified}} DNA extraction protocol useful on degraded specimens of bones, teeth, and other various tissues. This presentation will impact the forensic science community presenting factual details that ancient DNA research shares a common problem with forensics and other approaches requiring analyses of museum and non-invasively collected specimens; the amount of endogenous DNA available in the samples is often limited. Thus, extraction techniques that retrieve as much DNA as possible from a specimen are of crucial importance. A wide range of techniques has been published to date, all of which aim to maximize DNA yields, while minimizing the co-extraction of PCR inhibitors. Due to low levels of endogenous DNA, environmental, bacterial, and postmortem DNA damage, as well as the potential presence of environment-borne inhibitors that co-extract with DNA, the recovery of DNA data from degraded specimens can still pose a significant challenge. Previously, DNA extraction from the dental pulp samples was performed following a modified protocol of a Total RNA isolation system, suitable for DNA extraction from samples containing only a small number of nucleated cells. The same method was used for the bone samples. The protocol was partially modified by lengthening the incubation time of the cell lysis step: each sample of dental pulp was placed, overnight, at room temperature, in a single microtube containing 350 L of SV RNA Lysis Buffer. These protocols were applied to five skeletons discovered in Canosa di Puglia (Bari, Italy), during the archaeological excavations of tombs. These protocols do not allow for a complete characterization of genetic systems; however, even though the results obtained were satisfactory considering that the bones were ancient dated between the sixth and seventh centuries. The extraction method on bones, teeth and various tissue fragments of human remains, making some changes to previous protocols used were tested. Following this, the success of amplifying ancient DNA was estimated. Five cases are presented: In the first case, human remains were found in the Apulian countryside in 2002. They most probably belonged to a man who disappeared in 1989 according to the results of parentage testing by forensic hemogenetic investigations performed on the remaining members of the alleged missing man’s family. In the second case, human remains were found in 2006 on an Italian highway which probably belonged to a man reported as missing. Identification was made by comparing the DNA of the remains to a blood sample taken from a brother. The third case involved human remains, discovered in 2009 near a rest home for the elderly in the province of Bari, most likely belonging to an 84 -year-old man who disappeared in 1995. In this case identification was carried out by comparing the genetic profile of the remains to a blood sample taken from the son of the missing man. The fourth case involved the remains of two unknown skeletonized individuals discovered two meters underground. They were discovered in the small town of Marsicovetere, in southern of Italy where a trench for an oil duct was being excavated. In this case, the remains consisted of two full human <b>skeletonized</b> <b>bodies</b> that were highly fragmented. They were presumed to be from a prehistoric period because of their extreme lightness and porosity: they were extremely fragile. The skeletons were removed from the trench by digging around the remains and taking them out along with the soil. The last case concerned remains found in the attic of a church in Potenza in March 2010. DNA extracted from the human remains was compared with the DNA extracted from the blood of members of the missing girl’s family in order to establish identification. The modified method for extracting the DNA genome, followed by the amplification reaction has allowed for the identification of four cadavers and the typification of the fifth. Each of these cases had low expectations for success. These scenarios involved cadavers or remains of unknown origin, which were discovered many years following the time of death. Each was discovered under conditions that did not favor the maintenance of the integrity of nucleic acids...|$|R
