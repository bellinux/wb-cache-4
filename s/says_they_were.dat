25|$|One {{conflicting}} {{issue in}} the belief that the Pashtuns descend from the Israelites is that the Ten Lost Tribes were exiled by the ruler of Assyria, while Maghzan-e-Afghani <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> permitted by the ruler to go east to Afghanistan. This inconsistency {{can be explained by the}} fact that Persia acquired the lands of the ancient Assyrian Empire when it conquered the Empire of the Medes and Chaldean Babylonia, which had conquered Assyria decades earlier. But no ancient author mentions such a transfer of Israelites further east, or no ancient extra-Biblical texts refer to the Ten Lost Tribes at all.|$|E

2500|$|Lucius {{needed to}} make {{extensive}} imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes.

Pausanias <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> from a beast [...] "more than eleven cubits" [...] tall; Philostratus says the it was [...] "thirty cubits" [...] tall.

Some sources thought they froze to death, in temperatures as low as −28°F (−33°C), but the official report <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> killed by smoke infiltration around the improperly closed door. Twelve deaths occurred in the freezer. Five people survived there, but suffered injuries.

There had been Fremen on Poritrin ... a people grown soft with an easy planet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on Bela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus ... Jessica saw the slave cribs on Bela Tegeuse ... saw the weeding out and the selecting that spread men to Rossak and Harmonthep."

[...] The former Imperial capital (and later prison world) Salusa Secundus is [...] "the second stopping point in migrations of the Wandering Zensunni.

2500|$|Rescuers responded from Little Falls, Herkimer, Utica, Ilion {{and other}} nearby towns. [...] Bonfires were set for {{illumination}} and acetylene torches {{were used to}} free victims. Rescue operations were made more difficult by rain, sleet and snow {{that began in the}} early morning hours of April 20. Injured victims were sent to hospitals in Little Falls, Frankfort, Herkimer, Utica, and Ilion as well as to hotels, private homes and churches. The New York State Police estimated that 4,000 people converged at the scene. Wreckage blocked direct vehicular access to the crash site, requiring rescuers to take a three-mile (...) detour between the site and the hospital a half-mile (800m) away. At the state capitol, Governor Herbert H. Lehman directed the State Police and Public Works employees to [...] "give all possible aid". The last body was pulled from the wreckage on April 21. Thirty-five Chinese nationals en route to San Francisco in the custody of a United States Marshall, who were being deported for entering the US illegally, were in the last car and were uninjured.

2500|$|The great antiquity of the Pyramids caused {{their true}} nature to become {{increasingly}} obscured. [...] As the Egyptian scholar Abu Ja‘far al-Idrisi (d. 1251), {{the author of}} the oldest known extensive study of the Pyramids, puts it: [...] "The nation that built it lay destroyed, it has no successor to carry the truth of its stories from father to son, as sons of other nations carry from their fathers what they love and cherish among their stories." [...] As a result, the oldest discussion of the Pyramids that has survived is from the Greek historian Herodotus, who visited them soon after 450 BCE. He describes [...] "the underground chambers on the hill whereon the pyramids stand," [...] which [...] "the king meant to be burial places for himself." [...] Several later classical authors, such as Diodorus Siculus, who visited Egypt ca. 60 BCE, also recorded that the “kings built the pyramids to serve as their tombs”; and similarly Strabo, who made his visit in 25 BCE, explicitly noted that they were “the tombs of kings”; yet in 77 CE the well-read natural historian Pliny the Elder simply <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> “a superfluous and foolish display of wealth,” built by the kings so as “to avoid providing funds for their successors or for rivals who wished to plot against them, or else to keep the common folk occupied.” ...|$|E

[...] After questioning and discussing the source of the book he adds that [...] "the hand of British intelligence is evident, and Andrew clearly has a 'special relationship' with SIS." [...] Then, Reg Whitaker goes on to talk about the British Media when it comes to spies and says that [...] "ever since Burgess and Maclean made their run to Moscow in 1951, the British have treated espionage as a branch of pornography", adding that [...] "it is doubtful that many readers enticed by the advance publicity will actually get very far into this voluminous tome of close to 1000 name and date filled pages. A gripping read it ain't.","is remarkably restrained and reasonable in its handling of Westerners targeted by the KGB as agents or sources.

2500|$|The depot {{building}} {{burned down}} on March 24, 1933. The O did not rebuild it (although {{it continued to}} use the stop for freight operations) and got permission on June 5, 1939, from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to convert it to an unstaffed station. It was finally abandoned in 1957 after the O went bankrupt, and this event largely {{marked the end of}} Orson's notability outside of its contiguity. Many of the village's business establishments closed soon after the railroad did, with the notable exception of the summer camps that would gradually come to replace the railroad as Orson's main source of supra-regional prominence. The first of these was Camp Nehantic, a Jewish girls’ camp that was founded in 1919 by Harry Davidson and his wife, and that had originally been located on Crescent Beach in Niantic, Connecticut. Between 1925 and 1926, Nehantic moved to the western bank of Independent Lake, in Orson, and soon became {{an important part of the}} community's economy. In 1931, the camp was bought by J.A. Wells, and then, between 1936 and 1937, it closed and was replaced in 1937 by Camps Carmelia and Keeyumah, twin Jewish camps for girls and boys, respectively. These two had both opened around 1928 on the banks of Lake Champlain in Milton, Vermont (at least one source <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> located in Oneonta, New York, and refers to the boys' camp as [...] "Keeyuma"). The two camps shared facilities and operated in concert with each other until 1948, when they were consolidated into one coeducational, Jewish camp that seems to have been administratively distinct from them, but was nevertheless also called Camp Keeyumah. This Keeyumah was open until 1979.|$|E
