5|$|The Dermestidae {{are often}} used in {{taxidermy}} and {{in the preparation of}} scientific specimens, to clean <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> from bones. Larvae feed on and remove cartilage along with other <b>soft</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E
5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>tissue</b> was {{apparently}} preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs {{and the rest}} of the body was a layer of smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in the abdominal region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> are no longer available, it is impossible to verify these interpretations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>tissues</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of <b>soft</b> <b>tissues,</b> several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|R

40|$|Distribution {{of metals}} in {{bivalves}} is usually examined based on different metal {{concentrations in the}} different tissues of the bivalves. Patterns of metal distribution between the shells and the different <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> of two geographical populations of the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis were investigated. The correlation analysis showed insignificant correlation between the shells and the different <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> The multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed that the shells were not influential in metal accumulation in the total <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> The cluster analysis showed that the shells were clustered differently, as a single entity, {{from the rest of}} the different <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> All these findings indicate that the capability of metal uptake by the shell of Perna viridis differs...|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the {{indications}} for linezolid use {{approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae; complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and uncomplicated skin and <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> infections caused by S. pyogenes or S. aureus.

30|$|Tension band {{wiring and}} screw {{fixation}} are osteosynthesis methods for patella fractures. However, these surgical procedures are difficult if the fracture is highly comminuted [6]. The roles of peripatellar <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> in patella stability suggest that, {{in addition to}} reduction and fixation of the patella fracture, repair of the peripatellar <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> is important [1, 6, 7, 8, 9].

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Januari 2014. Samples of blood cockle were taken from onthe waters of Tanjung Balai Asahan North Sumatera.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveRecent {{developments}} on high resolution micro computed tomography (μCT) allow imaging of <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> in small animal joints. Nevertheless, μCT images cannot distinguish <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> from synovial fluid {{due to their}} similar mass density, limiting the 3 D assessment of <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> volume and thickness. This study aimed to evaluate a lead chromate contrast agent for μCΤ arthrography of rat knee joints ex vivo. DesignIntact tibiofemoral rat joints were injected with the contrast agent at different concentrations and imaged using a μCT at 2. 7  μm isotropic voxel size. Cartilage thickness was measured using an automated procedure, validated against histological measurements, and analyzed {{as a function of}} μCT image resolution. Changes in hard and <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> were also analyzed in tibiofemoral joints 4 weeks after surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). ResultsThe contrast agent diffused well throughout the whole knee cavity without penetrating the tissues, therefore providing high contrast at the boundaries between <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> and synovial fluid space. Thickness analysis of cartilage demonstrated a high similarity between histology and μ-arthrography approaches (R 2  =  0. 90). Four weeks after surgical DMM, the development of osteophytes (Oph) and cartilage ulcerations was recognizable with μCT, as well as a slight increase in trabecular bone porosity, and decrease in trabecular thickness. ConclusionsA lead chromate-based contrast agent allowed discriminating the synovial fluid from <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> of intact knee joints, and thus made possible both qualitative and quantitative assessment of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> in both intact and DMM tibiofemoral joints using high resolution μCT...|$|R
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, David Martill et al. {{announced}} {{the preservation of}} <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> in a specimen referred to a cf. Scelidosaurus sp., that is, an unnamed species for which a comparison with Scelidosaurus can be illuminating. The fossil, with inventory number BRSMG CF2781, {{was in the early}} 1990s, in an already prepared state, discovered in the legacy of the late Professor John Challinor, which had used it to illustrate his lectures with. Its provenance is unknown. It consists of a series of eight caudal vertebrae in a cut slab of carbonate mudstone, which was judged to date from the late Hettangian to Sinemurian stages. Parts of the fossil were preserved {{in such a way that}} an envelope of preserved <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> is visible around the vertebrae, and show the presence of an epidermal layer over the scutes. The authors concluded that the osteoderms of all basal armoured dinosaurs were covered in a tough, probably keratinous layer of skin.|$|E
