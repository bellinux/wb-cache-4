5|$|The Arctic <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> {{tradition}} {{is a broad}} cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500BCE (4,500years ago). These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits. The Arctic <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000Common Era (CE).|$|E
5|$|Charles Churchill {{suffered}} ill-health in {{his later}} years and retired from active involvement in the companies in 1915. His son, Charles Henry Churchill, assumed the responsibilities of chairman and managing director. Charles Churchill died on 14 or 15 February 1916; his last address was 321 Seven Sisters Road, Stoke Newington, London. His son, C H Churchill, had died six days earlier. W Chamberlain was appointed chairman, and Arthur Lyman Churchill, son of Charles, stepped up from head of the <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> grinding department to become managing director and, in 1920, chairman. Willis Clark Churchill, brother of Arthur, became a board member after 30 years of association with the business but died {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Space Shuttle Discovery docked on 10 March 2001, {{bringing}} to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS. The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds {{the record for the}} longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a <b>small</b> <b>tool.</b> Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discoverys thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris.|$|E

25|$|Several earlier {{indigenous}} peoples {{existed in the}} region. The earliest positively identified North American Eskimo cultures (pre-Dorset) date to 5,000 years ago. They appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the Arctic <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> tradition in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier. Similar artifacts {{have been found in}} Siberia that date to perhaps 18,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the very}} {{enlarged}} wing, an empty RB-57D weighed {{not much more}} than an empty B-57 due to the lightening measures taken. The most extreme measures were taken with the wings, which were thin metal honeycomb sections that formed a full wet wing (even in the leading edges). To avoid the weight of rivets, the wings were assembled with a special glue. The wing skin was waxed for aerodynamic smoothness. With a surface skin of only 0.010inch thick, dropping a <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> on the wing could damage the skin. Even deicing fluid used on the aircraft could potentially cause the glue used to lose strength.|$|E

25|$|At the {{northwest}} corner of the lot, there is a small wood-frame garage and shop building. The garage was built in 1940. It has a shed-roof with asphalt shingles that slopes from front to back. It has 6-inch horizontal clapboard siding and bay doors. There are two windows one {{on the north side of}} the building and one on the south side. The garage faces east and was originally connected to 12th Street by a gravel driveway. Today, the gravel lane has been replaced by a concrete driveway. Inside the garage there are two areas, a main space for storing a car and a <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> shop area.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} North America's {{central and eastern}} Arctic {{are referred to as}} the Arctic <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> tradition (AST) and existed c. 2500 BC. AST consisted of several Paleo-Eskimo cultures, including the Independence cultures and Pre-Dorset culture. The Dorset culture (Inuktitut: Tuniit or Tunit) refers to the next inhabitants of central and eastern Arctic. The Dorset culture evolved because of technological and economic changes during the period of 1050â€“550 BC. With the exception of the Quebec/Labrador peninsula, the Dorset culture vanished around 1500 AD. Supported by genetic testing, evidence shows that descendants of the Dorset culture, known as the Sadlermiut, survived in Aivilik, Southampton and Coats Islands, until the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the Nivkh are hard to discern from current archeological research. Their {{subsistence}} by fishing and coastal sea-mammal hunting {{is very similar to}} the Koryak and Itelmen on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The rigging of dog-sleds is also similar to these Chukotko-Kamchatkan groups. [...] Spiritual beliefs {{are similar to those of}} the Northwest Coast Indians of North America, whose ancestors migrated from this area. The Nivkh are physically and genetically different from the surrounding peoples, and scholars believe they are the indigenous inhabitants of the area. The current archeological model suggests that a sub-Arctic technological culture originating from the Transbaikal region, termed the microlithic culture, migrated across Siberia and populated the Amur and Sakhalin region during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps earlier. Scientists believe that people of this microlithic (<b>small</b> <b>tool)</b> culture were the first to migrate eastward into the Americas.|$|E

2500|$|While young {{birds in}} the wild {{normally}} learn to make stick tools from elders, a laboratory New Caledonian crow named [...] "Betty" [...] spontaneously improvising a hooked tool from a wire. It was known that this individual had no prior experience {{as she had been}} hand-reared. New Caledonian crows have been observed to use an easily available <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> to get a less easily available longer tool, and then use this to get an otherwise inaccessible longer tool to get food that was out of reach of the shorter tools. One bird, [...] "Sam", spent 110 seconds inspecting the apparatus before completing each of the steps without any mistakes. This is an example of sequential tool use, which represents a higher cognitive function compared to many other forms of tool use and is the first time this has been observed in non-trained animals. Tool use has been observed in a non-foraging context, providing the first report of multi-context tool use in birds. Captive New Caledonian crows have used stick tools to make first contact with objects that were novel and hence potentially dangerous, while other individuals have been observed using a tool when food was within reach but placed next to a model snake. It has been claimed [...] "Their [...] tool-making skills exceed those of chimpanzees and are more similar to human tool manufacture than those of any other animal." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little heap of the parson's {{possessions}} {{which he}} {{left on the}} table consisted chiefly of papers, over and above a pipe and a tobacco pouch and some Roman and Saxon coins. The rest were catalogues of old books, and pamphlets, like one entitled [...] "The Use of Sarum," [...] one glance at which was sufficient both for the colonel and the schoolboy. They {{could not see the}} use of Sarum at all. The contents of the boy's pockets naturally made a larger heap, and included marbles, a ball of string, an electric torch, a magnet, a small catapult, and, of course, a large pocketknife, almost to be described as a <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> box, a complex apparatus on which he seemed disposed to linger, pointing out that it included a pair of nippers, a tool for punching holes in wood, and, above all, an instrument for taking stones out of a horse's hoof. The comparative absence of any horse he appeared to regard as irrelevant, {{as if it were a}} mere appendage easily supplied. But when the turn came of the gentleman in the black gown, he did not turn out his pockets, but merely spread out his hands.|$|E
