40|$|Abstract. Non-interactive {{zero-knowledge}} (NIZK) proofs {{have been}} investigated in two models: the Public Parameter model and the <b>Secret</b> <b>Parameter</b> model. In the former, a public string is “ideally ” chosen according to some efficiently samplable distribution and made available to both the Prover and Verifier. In the latter, the parties instead obtain correlated (possibly different) private strings. To add further choice, the definition of zero-knowledge in these settings can either be non-adaptive or adaptive. In this paper, we obtain several unconditional characterizations of computational, statistical and perfect NIZK for all combinations of these settings. Specifically, we show: In the <b>secret</b> <b>parameter</b> model, NIZK = NISZK = NIPZK = AM. In the public parameter model, ⊲ for the non-adaptive definition, NISZK ⊆ AM ∩ coAM, ⊲ for the adaptive one, it also holds that NISZK ⊂ BPP/ 1, ⊲ for computational NIZK for “hard ” languages, one-way functions are both necessary and sufficient. From our last result, we arrive at the following unconditional characterization of computational NIZK in the public parameter model (which complements well-known results for interactive zero-knowledge) : Either NIZK proofs exist only for “easy ” languages (i. e., languages that are not hard-on-average), or they exist for all of AM (i. e., all languages which admit non-interactive proofs). ...|$|E

Bluetooth is a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) Standard that is moderately secure but still has weaknesses in its security architecture. One such weakness has been identified in its pairing mechanism, which leads to an attacker guessing PIN number leading to the guessing of Initialization, Link & Encryption keys. Hence a need arises to make key generation mechanism robust against Pin guessing attack that is even if PIN Number is guessed; it is substantially difficult to crack Initialization, Link & Encryption Keys.

However, we prove in contrary to its designers claim, this protocol does not provide any security. We present an efficient secret disclosure attack which retrieves all <b>secret</b> <b>parameters</b> of the protocol. Given those <b>secret</b> <b>parameters,</b> it would be trivial to apply any other attack in the context on the protocol. However, to highlight other weaknesses of the protocol we present extra reader traceability, impersonation and desynchronization attacks that do not require disclosing the <b>secret</b> <b>parameters</b> necessarily. Success probability of all mentioned attacks is almost “ 1 ” while the complexity is at most two runs of protocol.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{implementations}} of secure RFID rely on digital cryptographic primitives in {{the form}} of hashes and block ciphers. The presence of these blocks is motivated by privacy requirements, but they increase the overall processing latency, the power consumption, and the silicon area budget of the RFID tag. In addition, existing passive RFID systems rely on simple coding and modulation schemes using narrowband radio frequencies, which can be easily eavesdropped or jammed. We propose to implement the link from RFID to reader using ultra-wideband (UWB) communications. We show that the use of an advanced modulation scheme offers a new approach to the secure RFID problem. By using the modulation spreading code as a <b>secret</b> <b>parameter</b> of the communications link, we can make eavesdropping extremely difficult and increase the communication reliability. We also show that it decreases the latency and the risk for side-channel attacks. We present the digital baseband architecture of a passive UWB-RFID that uses time-hopped pulse-position modulation (TH-PPM), and present area- and power estimates that are competitive to solutions using digital cryptography. 1...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{cryptography}} systems use {{a static}} key or {{a pair of}} keys for the encryption and decryption process. It is known {{from the study of}} the authentication method that the dynamic 2 -factor based methods are more secure than the static parameter based authentication method. Also in the static key based encryption technique the entire security is based on the secrecy of the key used. Since the computational power of computers are increasing the key length is also increasing, which in turn force us to record it somewhere which makes it vulnerable. Here arises the need for a dynamic 2 -factor based encryption technique in which the keys are generated based on Just in Time (JIT) principle for the encryption and decryption process. Here we utilize the property of RSA method for the generation of the JIT dynamic key for encryption and decryption process using a mobile agent in Client-Server architecture. In this system both the encryption key and decryption key is generated by the mobile agent in association with the server. A random number generated in both mobile agent and the server using time and a <b>secret</b> <b>parameter</b> as its seed makes the JIT key different for different users at same time and different JIT key for same user at different time. This method provides dynamic nature to the key and protects our system from key compromise. This method also provides an inborn authentication scheme for the users in the system. In conventional RSA system there is a chance for key compromise by brute force attack, but in this system the RSA key changes for ever...|$|E

Public verifiability in signcryption {{achieves}} public {{verification of}} signature by a trustable third party; it ensures {{the reliability and}} secure parity of signcryption scheme. In the paper, we analyzed the public verification algorithm in signcryption and presented signcryption scheme without verifiability based on discrete logarithm problem as a comparison. Signcryption without verifiability satisfies the basic requirements of authenticated encryption; it can achieve secret message transmission and identity authentication in a single protocol. But the signcryption sender can cheat in the protocol with forged information for lack of supervision by public verification. Then we presented an improved signcryption scheme with public verifiability, in the scheme signcryption message is generated with private key of message sender and other public parameters, any trustable third party can verify the signcryption without disclosing private key or <b>secret</b> <b>parameters.</b> Besides, {{the attack on the}} signcryption and <b>secret</b> <b>parameters</b> via public verification data is computationally infeasible.
