5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed <b>something.</b> <b>Because</b> the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E

25|$|In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews {{each week}} base {{the songs of}} the {{services}} {{on the content of}} that week's parashah. For parashah Bamidbar, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Rast, the maqam that shows a beginning or an initiation of <b>something,</b> <b>because</b> the parashah initiates the Book of Numbers. In the common case where this parashah precedes the holiday of Shavuot, then the maqam that is applied is Hoseni, the maqam that symbolizes the beauty of receiving the Torah.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} Gee’s {{identity}} perspectives {{is what he}} calls “the nature perspective (or N-identities)” (p.101). N-identity represents an identity people cannot control, one that comes from forces of nature. An example {{of this type of}} identity would be male or female. While the person has no control over the sex they were born with, this identity only means <b>something</b> <b>because</b> society and culture say this biological difference is important. Gee explains this idea further by stating, “N-identities must always gain their force as identities through the work of institutions, discourse and dialogue, or affinity groups, that is, the very forces that constitute our other perspectives on identity” (p.102).|$|E

500|$|First Aristotle, then Cicero and Laertius each {{alluded to}} a {{connection}} between the conatus and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do <b>something</b> <b>because</b> they think it [...] "good", but rather they think it [...] "good" [...] because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the conatus.|$|E

Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, [...] "Jim (Wang) {{and all of us}} at first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill <b>something</b> <b>because</b> it had been ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions." ...|$|E

[...] The group credited with coining the term [...] "reggae" [...] in song was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving Toots and the Maytals the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.|$|E

If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip <b>something</b> <b>because</b> you do not know it, the story will be worthless.

[...] Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song [...] "really meant the world" [...] to him, and that: [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's {{probably one of the most}} honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter." ...|$|E

[...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing <b>something</b> <b>because</b> you {{think people are going to}} love it.

500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time...
