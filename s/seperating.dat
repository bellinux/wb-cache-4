40|$|An {{accurate}} {{description of}} the mean flow, the rms values, and spectral distributions of the <b>seperated</b> boundary layer fluctuating velocities {{plays an important role}} in predicting trailing edge far field noise. A possible method for describing the mean and rms quantities based on a modification of Coles' law of the wake and Prandtl's mixing length theory is presented. The model is validated against related experiments from literature and new measurements conducted at DLR Braunschweig. Additionally, a comparison between the von Kármán spectrum for isotropic turbulence and the measured spectra inside the <b>seperated</b> boundary layer is given. The results strongly suggest that the spectra as well as the mean and rms values of the <b>seperated</b> flow can be modeled with the proposed approaches...|$|R

In this work, we put our attention to all the <b>seperating</b> hyperplanes for some given polytope (integral and convex) and study the existence and classification of such hyperplanes. We prove the exitence of <b>seperating</b> hyperplanes for the order and chain polytopes for any finite posets that are not a single chain; prove there are no such hyperplanes for any Birkhoff polytopes.
