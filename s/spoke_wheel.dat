This 5 <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{popularly known as}} the AMG [...] "Penta" [...] wheel. The AMG [...] "Penta" [...] <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel</b> by ATS, designed by Hans-Werner Aufrecht in 1979, was the first aluminum alloy rim marketed by AMG {{when it was still}} an independent tuning company.|$|R

50|$|A {{disc wheel}} {{may simply be}} a fairing that clips onto a traditional, <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{addressing}} the drag that the spokes generate by covering them; or the disc can be integral to the wheel with no spokes inside. In the latter case carbon fiber is the material of choice. A <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> with a disc cover may not be legal under UCI Union Cycliste Internationale rules {{because it is a}} non-structural fairing but are again acceptable under ITU International Triathlon Union rules.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the Class 9E, all previous South African electric locomotives ran on <b>spoked</b> <b>wheels</b> and used spur gears. The Swiss-built Class 14E ran on solid wheels and used double helical or herringbone gears, while the locally built Class 14E1 was delivered with the traditional <b>spoked</b> <b>wheels</b> but with helical gears.|$|R
50|$|A new six <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> {{design is}} {{claimed to be}} almost as light as special purpose race wheels. Since the 2006 model the {{sidewall}} profile of the rear tire has been increased from 190/50/ZR17 to 190/55/ZR17.|$|E

50|$|When war {{exploded}} in 1914, the United States Government issued {{a call for}} better truck wheels. Walther heard this and by 1916 was ready to submit his ideas to the War Department. Walther had developed a cast steel, hollow <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to be used with}} a solid rubber tire. It was the first of its kind. Walther carried this wheel on the train to Washington where he presented it to the War Department.|$|E

50|$|Amongst South African {{electric}} locomotives, the Class 14E was {{the first}} to have solid wheels with double helical or herringbone gears. All earlier South African electric locomotives, {{with the exception of the}} Orex Line's Class 9Es, ran on <b>spoked</b> <b>wheels</b> using spur gears.

5000|$|Minor {{revisions}} {{were made}} to the interior, the perforated texture of the Alcantara on the seats now featured white dots and the Recaro Trendline reclining bucket seat was offered {{for the first time as}} an option costing £500 in the regular 182 and £800 in the Cup version. The car also featured a new 8 <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> design which came in Silver on a regular car and Anthracite on a [...] "Cup Packed" [...] car.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2016 Fender {{introduced}} an American Elite Stratocaster featuring [...] "4th generation" [...] noiseless pickups, compound C-to-D neck shape and fingerboard radius, locking tuners with shorter posts, S-1 switch and a <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> truss rod system. This model {{is also available}} as an HSS version with a [...] "Shawbucker" [...] humbucking pickup in the bridge position and a [...] "Passing Lane" [...] switch. Other features include soft-touch control knobs and large pearloid fingerboard dots.|$|E
5000|$|... a is {{the angle}} between (1) the radius to a nipple {{hole in the}} rim to which a spoke is attached, and, (2) the radius to the flange hole holding the spoke. The spoke crosses either 1, 2, or 3 oppositely {{pointing}} spokes depending on the lacing design. On the flange, the angle between the radii of adjacent holes is 360°/m (for equally spaced holes). For each spoke crossed, the hub is rotated {{with reference to the}} rim one [...] "angle between adjacent flange holes". Thus, multiplying the [...] "angle between adjacent flange holes" [...] by k gives the angle a. For example, a 32 <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> has 16 spokes per side, 360° divided by 16 equals 22.5°. Multiply 22.5° ("angle between adjacent flange holes") by the number of crossings to get the angle a—if 3-crosses, the 32 <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> has an angle a of 67.5°. Regarding r3: The size of the spoke holes in the flange does not matter for the needed spoke length. This term removes the effect of the hole size. Since the holes are usually small (just over 2 mm in diameter), the effect is small and in practice matters little.|$|E

5000|$|All {{of these}} {{vehicles}} {{can be found}} with one or both types of the [...] "hub-cap" [...] style wheel, inside a black plastic tire. The 'hub-cap' design was later replaced with an over-sized, simpler, one-piece wheel with five silver triangular 'spokes'. A couple of other wheel styles were a thin, ridged, one-piece design with five trapezoids outlined in silver and a one-piece form with two concentric circles outlined in silver. These were designs for cars, but wheels on trucks and other vehicles were often distinct from these patterns. Most of the models in Appendix 2 are number above 7147 {{and can be found}} with the 5 <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|As the {{automobile}} was introduced and became popular, cars {{also became a}} target for thieves and for a new concept that became known as joyriding. A variety of after-market security devices were introduced. An early invention were locking wheel clamps or chocks that owners could shackle {{onto one of the}} car's road wheels as a hobble, making it impossible to roll the vehicle unless the entire wheel was removed. Between 1914 and 1925 there were at least 25 patents related to wheel locks that attached on the tire and <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel.</b> These devices were available in many sizes from a number of manufacturers (including several patented by Miller-Chapman), and became popular during the early 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The current mill {{was built}} in the 18th century. Two wheels and wheelpits are present. The north wheelpit has a cast iron single-spoke wheel {{connected}} to flour sifting machinery that is dated 1883. It is thought that this end of the building was built on mediaeval foundations. This would explain the installation of a single <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> as this form is the only one narrow enough to fit in either of the two channels separated by a sandstone pier. The south wheelpit has a restored low breast wheel and a complete train of machinery driving three pairs of French burr stones. The ground floor has a quarry tiled floor and a cast iron fireplace.|$|E

50|$|A bare-bones {{version of}} the Scion tC known as the Spec Package was offered without many of the {{standard}} accessories. The Scion tC Spec Package replaces the 17 in alloy wheels with 16 in steel wheels and seven <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> covers. The glass roof is fixed in place and the steering wheel is made of urethane instead of wrapped leather and lacks stereo controls; cruise control is also not offered and many other minor interior and exterior changes. This model, which is meant {{to serve as a}} blank slate to the tuner market, was offered in only four colors: Super White, Flint Mica, Black Sand Pearl and Classic Silver Metallic. MSRP was $1,400 less than the standard model. The Spec Package was discontinued for the 2009 model year.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{influence}} tire pressure has on vehicle safety and efficiency, tire-pressure monitoring (TPM) was first adopted by the European market as an optional feature for luxury passenger vehicles in the 1980s. Some claim the efficiency gains are negligible. The first passenger vehicle to adopt TPM was the Porsche 959 in 1986, using a hollow <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> system developed by PSK. In 1996 Renault used the Michelin PAX system for the Scenic and in 1999 the PSA Peugeot Citroën decided to adopt TPM as a standard feature on the Peugeot 607. The following year (2000), Renault launched the Laguna II, the first high volume mid-size passenger vehicle {{in the world to}} be equipped with TPM as a standard feature. In the United States, TPM was introduced by General Motors for the 1991 model year for the Corvette in conjunction with Goodyear run-flat tires. The system uses sensors in the wheels and a driver display which can show tire pressure at any wheel, plus warnings for both high and low pressure. It has been standard on Corvettes ever since.|$|E

The boot accessed with a coach key, no heater or demister, semaphore indicators, pull-wire starter, manual choke. No water pump, engine cooling by thermosyphon - {{this was very}} basic motoring.When production of the older Ford Anglia and Ford Prefect was stopped in 1953 the Popular was developed as a budget alternative, based on the old, pre-war style E494A Anglia. The E494A was, in turn, a facelift of the Anglia E04A, which was a facelifted version of the 7Y, itself a rebodied Model Y. Thus through several adjustments, updates and name changes, a design with provenance dating back to 1932 was produced by Ford for 27 years. It was powered by a Ford Sidevalve 1172 cc, , four-cylinder engine. The car was very basic. It had a single vacuum-powered wiper, no heater, vinyl trim, and very little chrome; even the bumpers were painted, and the bakelite dash of the Anglia {{was replaced by a}} flat steel panel. The Popular 103E differed visually from the Anglia E494E in having smaller headlights and a lack of trim {{on the side of the}} bonnet. Early 103Es had the three spoke banjo type Anglia/Prefect steering wheel as stocks of these were used up, but most have a two <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> similar to the 100E wheel but in brown. Early Populars also had the single centrally mounted tail/stop-lamp of the Anglia, but this changed to a two tail/stop lamp set up with the lamps mounted on the mudguards and a separate number plate lamp. In total, 155,340 Popular E103s were produced.|$|E
