40|$|A multi-color, {{broad-band}} photographic {{program for}} monitoring atmospheric variability of Jupiter and Saturn with the 61 -cm, f/ 75 telescope was continued. The archivial product consists of approximately 20 sequential images on 3 1 / 4 x 4 1 / 4 glass plates {{with a plate}} scale of 4. 53 arc sec/mm. An eleven-step <b>sensitometric</b> <b>wedge,</b> recorded times of acquisition, and fiducial marks which determine {{the orientation of the}} plate, are recorded on each individual plate. This allows accurate positional measurements, as well as detailed relative surface brightness determinations. Detailed measurements of the Red Spot are being utilized in a study of zonal velocity variation and the ability to predict the longitude of the Red Spot during the Galileo mission. An ongoing 5 -color series of Saturn has been maintained to map the seasonal changes in the belt-zone reflectivity. Digitization of a series of blue images containing the Red Spot and a series of red and blue images excluding the Red Spot are being processed and reduced to normalized surface brightness maps. This data is being utilized to map time-dependent brightness variations of selected features, belts, and ones...|$|E
