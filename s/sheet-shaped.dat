We focus on the features of the convection with the most basic set-ting, so the viscosity is assumed to be constant and other complexities of the mantle are not introduced. We have succeeded in calculating the thermal convection in the spherical shell with Ra up to 108, and attained the numerical results for Ra ranging five orders above the critical value. For all Ra, the convection pattern is illustrated as follows; the <b>sheet-shaped</b> downwelling and upwelling flows originate from the boundary layers and concentrate gradually into cylindrical flows. We have examined the relationship between Ra and the Nusselt number (Nu), and obtained that Nu is proportional to Ra 0. 30. The exponent is larger than those of the existing studies. In addition, we quantify the convection pattern by the power spectrum of the temperature field for each depth in terms of spherical harmonic degrees. The analysis reveals that the structural scale of convection differs between the boundary region and the isothermal core region. The structure near the bound-ary region is characterized by the cell type structure constructed by the <b>sheet-shaped</b> downwelling and upwelling flows, and that of the core region by the plume type structure which consists of the cylindrical flows...|$|E

The experimental results indicated that Laves and δ precipitations obviously appeared within the grain boundary, under HIP treatment and lower solid-solution temperatures (940 °C), which would result in poor mechanical properties. However, Laves and δ phase can be completely dissolved at 1020 °C 1 hour solid-solution treatment. The tensile strength was increased to 1331. 5 MPa, and elongation reached up to 6. 1 % under a 1020 °C solid-solution and aging treatment. Increasing the solid-solution temperature to 1060 °C would cause parts of the NbC to dissolve, thus a large number of the thin <b>sheet-shaped</b> NbC would appear in the solid-solution and aging specimen.

40|$|Covalent organic {{frameworks}} (COFs) are porous and {{crystalline polymer}} with a well defined and predictable network of building blocks. Compared with inorganic porous materials, COFs are {{unique in that}} they are made from lighter elements, are robust towards air and organic solvents, and have tunable skeletons. From a synthetic viewpoint, COFs are attractive motifs since they allow total control over structural parameters, including composition and porosity. Most studies up to date have focused on the development of synthetic methodologies with the aim of optimizing pore size and surface area. In contrast, the functions of COFs, except for gas storage, have not yet been well explored. This motivated me to explore the possibility of constructing functional COFs with novel properties by utilizing highly ordered π-conjugation systems. This thesis consists of the design, synthesis and function exploration of novel <b>sheet-shaped</b> macromolecules and their covalent organic frameworks, with an emphasis on the development of π-electronic organic frameworks. (1) A Belt-Shaped, Blue Luminescent, and Semiconducting Covalent Organic Framework 　　In the first part, the author reported the first example of a luminescent and semiconducting COF, which adopts a belt shape and consists of pyrene and triphenylene functionalities alternatively linked in a mesoporous hexagonal skeleton. 　　A new family of covalent organic framework based on π electron system was synthesized by condensation polymerization with triphenylene and pyrene derivatives as monomers (TP-COF). TP-COF adopts belt morphology with thickness of about 100 nm, width of about 300 nm, and length of micrometers. When triphenylene and pyrene unit were selectively excited by ultraviolet and visible light, TP-COF displays strong blue fluorescence at 474 nm, {{as a result of an}} efficient energy transfer between two units. This result demonstrates that TP-COF collects photons of a wide range covering from ultraviolet to the visible regions and converts them to blue emission efficiently. In addition, due to the ultimate π stacking of large π-conjugated components, TP-COF is electrically semiconducting. The electric current can be repetitively on/off switched without any deterioration. Upon doping with iodine, the electric current was increased remarkably, which suggests that TP-COF is p -type semiconductor. (2) A Poly(pyrene) -Based Blue Luminescent, Semiconducting and Photoconductive 　　Covalent Organic Framework Up to date, two typical architectures i. e., boronic ester and triazine, have been reported as joint points for covalent connection of multiple building blocks into <b>sheet-shaped</b> macromolecules and COFs. Among them co-condensation of boronic acid with phenol derivatives has been demonstrated utility in the synthesis of various boronic ester-based COFs. On the other hand self-condensation of boronic acid derivatives has been limited to one example, i. e., benzene 2, 7 -diboronic acid, which, however, leads to a COF with staggered alignment of 2 D polymer sheet. 　　　In this part, the author demonstrated the synthesis of a new π-electronic COF based on self-condensation of pyrene diboronic acid under solvothermal condition (PPy-COF). FE SEM shows that PPy-COF assumes micrometer-sized cubic shape, while no any other morphology such as belt, fiber, sphere, or rod are present, indicating high phase uniformity. PPy-COF exhibits high blue luminescence at 484 nm upon excitation at pyrene unit (414 nm). PPy-COF is electrically semiconducting and shows p -type character. Moreover, the ultimate alignment of 2 D poly(pyrene) sheets in a perfectly eclipsed fashion allows a large charge carrier mobility. Significantly depolarized fluorescence anisotropy suggests that the excitation energy is not localized but migrate over the framework. PPy-COF is semiconducting and enables an on/off switch of electric current at room temperature. Moreover, PPy-COF is photoconductive with a quick response to light irradiation and a large on/off ratio. (3) Anthracene-Based Photo-Addressable Covalent Organic Framework 　　　In this part, the author disclosed the design and synthesis of a new type of COF based on co-condensation of benzene triboronic acid and 2, 3, 6, 7 -tetrahydroxyanthracene under solvothermal or reflux conditions (An-COF). An-COF consists of benzene and anthracene components alternatively linked in a mesoporous hexagonal skeleton. FE SEM reveals that An-COF adopts well-defined micrometer-scaled 2 D sheet shape. The ultimate alignment of An-COF sheets in a perfectly eclipsed fashion allows photoinduced dimerization and reversible monomerization of anthracence units in An-COF. Such a photo-addressable COF may find applications in tuning luminescence and high-density data storage. Moreover, An-COF is electrically semiconducting and highly luminescent. Exploration of functional COFs is a subject that has a high probability to lead to the development of new materials. In summary, the author has developed a series of novel π-electronic <b>sheet-shaped</b> macromolecules and covalent organic frameworks. Based on the chemistry of boronic ester reaction, the author designed and synthesized a series of new π-electronic monomers and succeeded in the construction of π-electronic <b>sheet-shaped</b> macromolecules. By using different monomers and polymerization methods, 1 D belt-shaped (TP-COF), 2 D sheet-like (An-COF) and 3 D cubic (PPy-COF) COFs were created. These π -electronic organic frameworks show unique photo and electric functions that clearly originate from their highly ordered structure and thus open a new way to polymeric optoelectronics and electronics...|$|E

The free access mat is a <b>sheet-shaped</b> waveguide which consists of a tightly coupled double-layered microstrip resonator array.

Our proposed wireless access system uses a subsidiary waveguide, the free access mat.

The SEM images of the coating residue shown in Fig.  8 e–j reveal that a more dense and continuous char layer with fewer cracks and holes is obtained with increasing number of bilayers from 10 to 30.

Accordingly, it is concluded that two different char structures were generated by different processes: the outer layer is a physical char mainly consisting of graphene sheets, while HPTCP catalyzed the PVA matrix into a chemical char that encapsulated the physical char, thus constituting the inner layer.|$|E

We devised a novel bioreactor (patent pending) which allows individual perfusion of high density cultured hepatocytes with low diffusional gradients, thereby more closely resembling the conditions in the intact liver lobuli. METHODS: The bioreactor consists of a spirally wound nonwoven polyester matrix, i. e. a <b>sheet-shaped,</b> three-dimensional framework for hepatocyte immobilization and aggregation, and of integrated hydrophobic hollow-fiber membranes for decentralized oxygen supply and CO 2 removal. Medium (plasma in vivo) was perfused through the extrafiber space and therefore in direct hepatocyte contact. Various parameters were assessed over a period of 4 days including galactose elimination, urea synthesis, lidocaine elimination, lactate/pyruvate ratios, amino acid metabolism, pH, the last day being reserved exclusively for determination of protein secretion. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of the hepatocytes revealed cytoarchitectural characteristics as found in vivo. The biochemical performance of the bioreactor remained stable over the investigated period. The urea synthesizing capacity of hepatocytes in the bioreactor was twice that of hepatocytes in monolayer cultures. Flow sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the bioreactor construction ensured medium flow through all parts of the device irrespective of its size.

40|$|Abstract: The {{segmentation}} {{of linear}} structures in a gray-scale image {{is widely used}} {{in a variety of}} image analysis and visualization tasks. In case of biomedical image analysis of volumetric data (such as CT or MRI scans), it is very common that a linear structure (blood vessel) is attached to a <b>sheet-shaped</b> (planar) and/or blob-shaped (ellipsoid) region (large tissue or fluid mass such as cistern basin in the brain) but where the image intensity of both structures is the same. Segmentation algorithms (threshold based or statistical approaches) are unable to clearly define and therefore segment the areas of such attachment. Automatic detection of the attachment and locating the start and end of linear structures is important for visualization and quantification in biomedical analysis. In this paper, we present the layered region growing (LRG) algorithm to segment the linear structures from volumetric data. First, we define the LRG algorithm for volumetric data, then present a layer frame for extracting the region of interest, and introduce a width function on the layer. Next, we show that the width function is of constant order if LRG is used to extract a linear structure whatever the selection of seed, O(n) for a sheet-shape, and O(n 2) for a blob-shape, where n is the number of layers in the region. Last, we give an automatic method to detect the change of the width function as a criterion to stop the region growth at the attachment areas where different shaped structures meet. Promising results are shown on simulated data as well as on cerebral vascular CT data...|$|E

In this paper the synthesis of CuO-TiO 2 nanosheets by the wet-chemically technique is reported. Methods CuO-TiO 2 NSs were prepared by a wet-chemical process using reducing agents in alkaline medium and characterized by UV/vis., FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) etc. Results The structural and optical evaluation of synthesized NSs were measured by XRD pattern, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV–vis spectroscopy, respectively which confirmed that the obtained NSs are well-crystalline CuO-TiO 2 and possessing good optical properties. The morphological analysis of CuO-TiO 2 NSs was executed by FE-SEM, which confirmed that the doped products were <b>sheet-shaped</b> and growth in large quantity. Here, the analytical efficiency of the NSs was applied for a selective adsorption of iron(III) ion prior to detection by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The selectivity of NSs towards various metal ions, including Au(III), Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Pd(II), and Zn(II) was analyzed. Conclusions Based on the selectivity study, it was confirmed that the selectivity of doped NSs phase was the most towards Fe(III) ion.

The amorphous TiO 2 was preformed using ZnO flowers as templates. Different three-dimensional SrTiO 3 architectures were coexisted in the garden, including SrTiO 3 flowers composed of several hollow sword-shaped petals, many <b>sheet-shaped</b> petals or numerous flake-shaped petals, and SrTiO 3 grass consisting of a number of long blades. These SrTiO 3 superstructures were simultaneously grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. On the basis of a comprehensive study on the effects of growth time, temperature, initial concentrations of precursor, and pH, the formation of these various hierarchical architectures was attributed primarily to the dissolution of amorphous TiO 2 and precipitation of perovskite crystals, followed by the Ostwald ripening process of perovskite nanocrystals and self-organization of perovskite building blocks. Interestingly, this approach can be readily extended to create other perovskite structures, including dendritic BaTiO 3 and nest-like CaTiO 3, as well as PbTiO 3 transformed from plate-like pyrochlore Pb 2 Ti 2 O 6 after post-thermal treatment. Garden-like SrTiO 3 superstructures showed a superior photocatalytic performance when compared to other as-prepared semiconductors and perovskite materials (i. e., ZnO, TiO 2, BaTiO 3, CaTiO 3 and PbTiO 3), probably due to their intrinsic photocatalytic activity and special garden-like features with a coexistence of various structures that significantly facilitated the adsorption and diffusion of methyl blue (MB) molecules and oxygen species in the photochemical reaction of MB degradation...|$|E

The first one is an ion source with an external spiral antennabehind a dielectric RF-window. The second one uses an internal antenna insimilar ion source geometry. The source needs to generate uniform plasmaover a large (8 cm x 5 cm) extraction area. We expect that the ion sourcewith internal antenna will be more efficient at producing the desiredplasma density but might have the issue of limited antenna lifetime,depending on the duty factor. For both approaches there is a need forextra shielding to protect the dielectric materials from the backstreaming electrons. The source walls will be made of insulator materialsuch as quartz that has been observed to generate plasma with higheratomic fraction than sources with metal walls. The ion beam will beextracted and accelerated by a set of grids with slits, thus forming anarray of 6 <b>sheet-shaped</b> beamlets. The multiple grid extraction will beoptimized using computer simulation programs. Neutralization of the beamwill be done in neutralization chamber, which has over 70 percentneutralization efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a stiffnite are here inferred. A stiffnite is a <b>sheet-shaped,</b> gravity-driven submarine sediment flow, with a fabric {{made up of}} marine ooze. To infer stiffnite dynamics, order of magnitude estimations are used. Field deposits and experiments on materials taken from the literature are also used. Stiffnites can be tens or hundreds of kilometers wide, and a few centimeters / meters thick. They move on the sea slopes over hundreds of kilometers, reaching submarine velocities as high as 100 m/s. Hard grain friction favors grain fragmentation and formation of triboelectrically electrified particles and triboplasma (i. e., ions + electrons). Marine lipids favor isolation of electrical charges. At first, two basic assumptions are introduced, and checked a posteriori: (a) in a flowing stiffnite, magnetic dipole moments develop, with the magnetization proportional to the shear rate. I have named those dipoles as Ambigua. (b) Ambigua are ‘vertically frozen ’ along stiffnite streamlines. From (a) and (b), it follows that: (i) Ambigua create a magnetic field (at peak,> 1 T). (ii) Lorentz forces sort stiffnite particles into two superimposed sheets. The lower sheet, L+, has a sandy granulometry and a net positive electrical charge density. The upper sheet, L–, has a silty muddy granulometry and a net negative electrical charge density; the grains of sheet L – become finer upwards. (iii) Faraday forces push ferromagnetic grains towards {{the base of a}} stiffnite, so that a peak of magnetic susceptibility characterizes a stiffnite deposit. (iv) Stiffnites harden considerably during their motion, due to magnetic confinement. Stiffnite deposits and inferred stiffnite characteristics are compatible with a stable flow behavior against bending, pinch, or other macro instabilities. In the present report, a consistent hypothesis about the nature of Ambigua is provided. 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Jan. 19, 2011 -Jan. 19, 2013 In intra-arterial radioembolization, nano- and micro-scaled carriers are used in patients with liver tumors that cannot be removed by surgery to deliver various radioisotopes {{with the aim of}} improving the outcome of tumor radiotherapy, of minimizing dose to healthy tissue, and of improving the quality of the diagnosis and imaging. In this technique, radioisotopes are incorporated in either nanospheres or microspheres for delivery. The synthesis of these maybe performed either using the isotope in its radioactive form or nonradioative form; however, if the synthesis is performed using non-radioactive isotopes, a subsequent activation by neutron bombardment in a nuclear reactor is required. This investigation focused on neutron-activation simulations using computer models of microspheres loaded with holmium acetylacetonate (HoAcAc) complex in a polymeric matrix that are used for intra-arerial radioembolization therapy of liver cancer. The polymer matrix is made of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) which is both biodegradable and biocompatible. In addition, as a requirement for therapeutic applications of these microspheres, not only their diameter must be within a range between 20 and 50 micrometers, but also before administration to a patient, they must be neutron-activated by turning holmium- 165 into holmium- 166. The main objective of this investigation was to minimize the energy deposited by neutrons and gammas produced by fission and neutron activation reactions that would result in damages to both the microsphere's polymeric matrix and holmium complex. To accomplish this objective, Monte Carlo N-Particle models were created to perform the following simulations: (1) microspheres loaded with a HoAcAc complex in a polymeric matrix were exposed to a neutron flux in the thermal column of a TRIGA reactor while arranged in a <b>sheet-shaped</b> packing configuration, and, similarly, (2) while arranged in a pile-shaped packing configuration, microspheres also loaded with a HoAcAc complex in a polymeric matrix were also exposed to the same neutron flux in the thermal column. Then, results from both types of simulations were analyzed and were compared...|$|E
40|$|Department of Biomedical EngineeringResearchers in {{the optical}} field have {{developed}} light-sheet microscopy to achieve fast scan rates and low photo-toxicity. However, the conventional light-sheet microscopy uses a Gaussian beam or a Bessel beam, {{so that the}} resolution in the z-axis direction is {{not significantly different from}} the confocal microscope widely used in biology and chemistry. In general, the resolution in the z-axis direction is only about 1 / 3 of the resolution in the x- and y-directions, although the resolution in the x- and y- direction has been greatly improved for several decades. This is because the side lobe of the light-sheet exists. Lattice light sheet microscopy overcomes these limitations with thin light sheets using 2 D optical pattern. The lattice beam produces a sheet with a much narrower core, which provides a higher axial resolution. <b>Sheet-shaped</b> illumination eliminates out-of-focus fluorescence emissions and enables high-speed imaging with low photo-toxicity. The Lattice light-sheet microscope can construct a low fluorescence background grating beam and all excitation light is within a narrow focus depth. Therefore, light that is out of focus is not irradiated onto the sample, so damage by light is limited to the focal plane. We also provide a high-resolution, high-contrast image of 200 to 1000 images per second. In this experiment, we will check the performance of Lattice light-sheet microscope complements the disadvantages of conventional confocal microscopy and light sheet microscopy. A sheet-like pattern could be used to create a much thinner light sheet, and it was confirmed that light above the focal plane was gathered higher than the surrounding area. This focuses the fluorescence emission only on the focal plane to prevent further damage to the sample due to phototoxicity of unfocused light. It was also confirmed that the light was uniformly distributed in the light sheet. In addition, when compared to a single-vessel beam light sheet and a lattice light sheet, it was confirmed that the side lobes actually decreased. The fact that the resolution of the Lattice light-sheet microscopy in the z direction corresponds to the range of about 317 nm to 370 nm was confirmed by photographing a fluorescent bead sample. ope...|$|E
