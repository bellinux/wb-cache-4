5|$|On {{arriving}} in <b>Sarajevo</b> on 4 June, Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović went their separate ways. Princip checked in with Ilić, visited {{his family in}} Hadžici and returned to <b>Sarajevo</b> on 6 June taking up residence at Ilić's mother's house with Ilić. Grabež joined his family in Pale. Čabrinović moved back into his father's house in <b>Sarajevo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Igman was {{included}} in the <b>Sarajevo</b> bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Despite <b>Sarajevo</b> being the only previous host city to bid, it was largely regarded as the weakest bid, primarily due to its lack of infrastructure after the war.|$|E
5|$|Lewis MacKenzie, in 1992, {{served in}} the <b>Sarajevo</b> {{division}} of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated {{to keep the peace}} in Croatia. Off describes MacKenzie as being indifferent as hostilities began in <b>Sarajevo</b> because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs. MacKenzie's distrust of all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange, the Breadline Massacre, and broken ceasefire arrangements. MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the <b>Sarajevo</b> International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments. MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and the Bosnians as aggressors and recommending against intervention.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla {{to bring}} the weapons to <b>Sarajevo.</b> Miško Jovanović hid the weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went {{separately}} by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić. Later that day, Ilić returned to <b>Sarajevo</b> by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside <b>Sarajevo</b> and then quickly transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić hid the weapons in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation {{of the reason for}} his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to <b>Sarajevo</b> from Brod to prevent the assassination. Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to <b>Sarajevo</b> to reauthorize the assassination.|$|E
5|$|Security {{arrangements}} within <b>Sarajevo</b> were limited. The local military commander, General Michael von Appel, {{proposed that}} troops line the intended route but {{was told that}} this would offend the loyal citizenry.

5|$|The band {{first became}} {{involved}} with <b>Sarajevo</b> in 1993 on their Zoo TV Tour; approached by aid worker Bill Carter about bringing attention to the Siege of <b>Sarajevo,</b> the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with Bosnians during their shows. These link-ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy. Although the war made it impractical for U2 to visit <b>Sarajevo</b> at the time, they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city. After the conflict ended in November 1995, they made arrangements to visit <b>Sarajevo,</b> and with help from United Nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops, they scheduled and played the concert in 1997.|$|E

Between 29 February and 1 March 1992, a referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian Warwas held. Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital <b>Sarajevo</b> and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in <b>Sarajevo</b> and Doboj.

5|$|Ilić {{recruited}} the Serbian youths Vaso Čubrilović and Cvjetko Popović {{shortly after}} Easter (Orthodox Easter {{as given by}} Dedijer: 19 April 1914), for the assassination, {{as evidenced by the}} testimony of Ilić, Čubrilović, and Popović at the <b>Sarajevo</b> trial. Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the <b>Sarajevo</b> trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to <b>Sarajevo</b> and participate in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near <b>Sarajevo.</b> The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near <b>Sarajevo.</b> On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around <b>Sarajevo</b> and the campaign ceased.|$|E

5|$|On 13 and 14 April, the 8th Panzer Division led a southward thrust towards <b>Sarajevo,</b> {{where both}} the Yugoslav Supreme Command and the {{headquarters}} of the 2nd Army were located, and during that day the 2nd Army asked the Germans for a separate ceasefire agreement, but were rebuffed, as by this stage only the unconditional surrender of the whole Yugoslav Army would be considered by the Germans. On 14 and 15 April, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers were taken prisoner by the Germans during their drive on <b>Sarajevo</b> in the centre of the country, including 30,000 around Zvornik and 6,000 around Doboj. On 15 April, the 8th Panzer Division approached <b>Sarajevo</b> from the east as the 14th Panzer Division entered it from the west, and the 2nd Army surrendered. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} <b>Sarajevo</b> {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to <b>Sarajevo</b> and the other from Maglaj to <b>Sarajevo.</b> Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to <b>Sarajevo</b> for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium were lined with Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E
