5|$|Two large reservoirs, Shasta Lake and Trinity Lake, {{are formed}} {{by a pair}} of dams in the {{mountains}} north of the Sacramento Valley. Water from both of these lakes are released into the Sacramento River, which flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, at controlled rates. There, before it can flow on to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, some of the water is intercepted by a diversion channel and transported to the Delta-Mendota Canal, which conveys water southwards through the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley, supplying water to San Luis Reservoir (a SWP-shared facility) and the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River at Mendota Pool in the process, eventually reaching canals that irrigates farms in the valley. Friant Dam crosses the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River upstream of Mendota Pool, diverting its water southwards into canals that travel into the Tulare Lake area of the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley, as far south as the Kern River. Finally, New Melones Lake, a separate facility, stores water flow of a <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River tributary for use during dry periods. Other smaller, independent facilities exist to provide water to local irrigation districts.|$|E

50|$|Amtrak California {{service at}} Berkeley began in 1986 with the twice-daily <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins,</b> which then {{operated}} between Oakland and Bakersfield. Berkeley was an original {{stop on the}} Capitol Corridor (originally named Capitols) when that service began in late 1991. <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> service at Berkeley ended in 1993 because of low ridership.|$|R
50|$|Routes serving {{this station}} include the Coast Starlight. It also serves the Pacific Surfliner and the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> via Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach).|$|R
5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams on the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River.|$|E

50|$|Oakland - Jack London Square is a {{train station}} in Jack London Square in {{downtown}} Oakland, California. The station is served by the Capitol Corridor, Coast Starlight, and <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> trains. Through Thruway buses, this station serves San Francisco.|$|R
5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commuter}} and interregional bus services {{connect to}} BART, including the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> RTD Commuter (Stockton), Tri Delta Transit (Contra Costa County), Greyhound, California Shuttle Bus, Valley of the Moon Commute Club, Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach, and Modesto Area Express BART Express.|$|E
5|$|State Route 46 (SR 46) is an eastwest {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. It {{is a major}} {{crossing}} of the Coast Ranges, connecting SR 1 on the Central Coast near Cambria and US 101 in Paso Robles with SR 99 at Famoso in the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley.|$|E
5000|$|Sacramento {{is served}} by four Amtrak routes - two daily long-distance routes, and two Amtrak California {{corridor}} routes with multiple daily trains - {{for a total of}} 38 daily trains on weekdays and 30 on weekends. [...] The California Zephyr and Coast Starlight are long-distance routes with one train per day in each direction. The <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> operates two daily round trips with Sacramento as the northern terminus (most <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> trips do not serve Sacramento and terminate at Oakland instead). The Capitol Corridor operates 15 round trips on weekdays and 11 on weekends; Sacramento is the northern terminus for all trains except for one daily round trip which continues to Auburn.|$|R
25|$|Sacramento is the {{northern}} terminus of the Amtrak California <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> route which provide direct multiple-frequency passenger rail service to California's Central Valley {{as far as}} Bakersfield; Thruway Motorcoach connections {{are available from the}} trains at Bakersfield to Southern California and Southern Nevada.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} served by Amtrak California's Capitol Corridor and <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> and Amtrak's Coast Starlight. It is also the western {{terminus}} of Amtrak's California Zephyr; there is no wye at Amtrak's new Oakland station near Jack London Square, {{so it would be}} necessary to back a long train along Oakland's Embarcadero to the Union Pacific yards.|$|R
5|$|Two BART {{stations}} have connections to Amtrak regional rail services: Coliseum and Richmond. Capitol Corridor trains run from Sacramento to San Jose from both stations. Additionally, Richmond has {{connections to the}} <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> and the nationally serviced California Zephyr.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E
5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin,</b> the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E

50|$|BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway) and Union Pacific Railroad {{both have}} railway {{lines in the}} Central Valley. The BNSF Bakersfield Subdivision runs from Bakersfield to Calwa, four miles (6 km) south of Fresno. From Calwa the BNSF Stockton Subdivision {{continues}} to Port Chicago, west of Antioch. The Union Pacific Railroad Martinez Subdivision runs from Port Chicago through Martinez, Richmond and Emeryville to Oakland. The UP's Fresno Subdivision runs from Stockton to Bakersfield and traffic passes through a large and historical yard in Roseville before heading to Oregon or Nevada. Amtrak operates six daily <b>San</b> <b>Joaquins</b> trains over these lines. California High-Speed Rail, linking northern and southern California, broke ground in the Central Valley in 2015.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact on the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's canals, and other items.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133 (SR 133) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California.
