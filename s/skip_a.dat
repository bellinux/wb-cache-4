5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an {{instructor}} at the University of Kansas, and Norman Foster Ramsey, a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and {{an officer in the}} Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding the Rock Island Arsenal. He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the Direction d'Artillerie and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15.|$|E

5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E

25|$|The value, or number, zero is not {{the same}} as the digit zero, used in numeral systems using {{positional}} notation. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a leading zero may be used to distinguish a number.|$|E

Historically, the PRR fast trains going to NY from the west would bypass 30th St Station, and passengers for Philadelphia would change trains at North Philadelphia. One study suggested two daily electric-train round-trips between New York and Harrisburg with stops in North Philadelphia and Ardmore, a routing last used by Keystone trains in 1994.|$|E

The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Gaga's fan bases hailed the choreography with many videos of them interpreting the choreography on YouTube. One notable video is of two Australian boys Jesse and Jermaine D'Vauz dancing to the choreography in their bedroom, which was posted by Gaga on her Twitter page in May 2011. Gaga tweeted: [...] "JUDAS choreography by two sexy boys! Swoon! This is why I love my fans, you don't <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> beat." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{his turn}} in the {{rotation}} approached, Hershiser joked that he would <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> start and rest for the playoffs rather than pursue the record. The Dodgers had clinched the NL West on September 26. [...] Thus, {{the focus of the}} game on the 28th was on Hershiser's need to get nine scoreless innings to tie Drysdale, which was Hershiser's hope. On September 27, Lasorda announced the Dodger starting pitchers for games one (Hershiser) and game two (Tudor) of the NL Championship series, which would begin the following Tuesday, October 4. The Dodgers entered the game with a 92–65 record and a seven-game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds, while the San Diego Padres were 13 games back in fifth place in the division with a 79–78 record entering the game. With the September 28 loss, the Dodgers retained a seven-game lead over the Reds. In the off days leading up to Hershiser's last start, Frank Viola had tied Jackson and Hershiser at 23 wins for the MLB lead.|$|E

500|$|B.J. awakens from a {{nightmare}} covered in blood, finding the word [...] "Sister" [...] slashed into her chest. She also sees a young Cokely {{reflected in the}} mirror behind her. She heads to a stranger's basement and tears away the floorboards, revealing a skeleton that {{is found to be}} the remains of Agent Ledbetter. Cokely is arrested, but denies attacking B.J., insisting he's too old to even leave his residence without his large oxygen flask. Scully tells Mulder that blood on the latest victim matches Cokely's. The agents visit Thibedeaux, who describes her encounter with Cokely in the 1940s. Mulder notices a photo of her at the 1939 World's Fair featuring the Trylon and Perisphere. When pressed, she reveals that the rape resulted in a child, which she put up for adoption. The FBI tracks down the child, who turns out to have been B.J.'s father, causing Mulder to surmise that B.J. is the killer and may be operating on genetic memories which tend to <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> generation.|$|E
500|$|Biko {{spent two}} years at St. Andrews Primary School and four at Charles Morgan Higher Primary School, both in Ginsberg. Regarded as a {{particularly}} intelligent pupil, {{he was allowed to}} <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> year. In 1963 he transferred to the Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township. Biko excelled at maths and English and topped the class in his exams. In 1964 the Ginsberg community offered him a bursary to join his brother Khaya as a student at Lovedale, a prestigious boarding school in Alice, Eastern Cape. Within three months of Steve's arrival, Khaya was accused of having connections to Poqo, the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), an African nationalist group which the government had banned. Both Khaya and Steve were arrested and interrogated by the police; the former was convicted, then acquitted on appeal. No clear evidence of Steve's connection to Poqo was presented, but he was expelled from Lovedale. Commenting later on this situation, he stated: [...] "I began to develop an attitude which was much more directed at authority than at anything else. I hated authority like hell." ...|$|E
500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E

500|$|In Little Busters!, Riki meets {{five other}} girls {{attending}} {{his high school}} who later become members of the Little Busters, in addition to three more girls in Ecstasy; all eight are heroines in the game. The first is Komari Kamikita, a childish girl who takes great interest in fairy-tales, picture books, candy, and clothing with many layers of frills. She is very clumsy, though athletic, and will often not think before she acts. Haruka Saigusa is a schoolmate of Riki's from a different class, but always finds time to hang around in Riki's classroom. She incites uproars for her own personal enjoyment, which causes her twin sister, the public morals chairman Kanata Futaki, to chase after her. Kanata generally acts cold towards her sister, though gets annoyed when Riki gets close to Haruka. Kudryavka Noumi, known as [...] for short, is a girl who is one quarter Japanese, and three-quarters Russian. Despite having a poor handle on the English language, {{she was able to}} <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> year in school due to credits obtained through studying abroad, making her the youngest member of the Little Busters. Kudryavka appears in Key's eighth game, Kud Wafter, as the main heroine.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the spotlight on the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't <b>skip</b> <b>a</b> beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E
2500|$|The premiere drew mainly {{positive}} {{reviews from}} critics, with most to all complementing the new characters.

Frozen fans will be pumped {{that it looks}} like Elsa and Anna are going to stick around for a while as they search for answers about their parents' death. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Regina seeks out an old friend to help her [...] "change the book" [...] so she can finally get her happy ending. And as usual, Rumple can't seem to shake his obsession with power." ...|$|E
