25|$|On April 3, 2009, Scottish {{football}} players Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor were permanently {{banned from the}} Scottish national squad for showing the V sign while {{sitting on the bench}} during the game against Iceland. Both players were in their hotel bar drinking alcohol after the Scottish defeat to The Netherlands until around 11am the next morning, meaning that both of the players breached the SFA discipline code before the incident as well, but the attitude shown by the V sign was considered to be <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> that the SFA decided never to include these players in the national line-up again. Ferguson also lost the captaincy of Rangers {{as a result of the}} controversy. McGregor's ban was lifted by then SFA manager Craig Levein and he returned to Scotland national squad in 2010.|$|E

[...] At first, the [...] "Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke" [...] among Ballinger's friends. In March 2009, however, a Miranda video called [...] "Free Voice Lesson" [...] quickly became a sensation. The video consists of bad advice about singing technique. Miranda's videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, and as they became popular, Ballinger modified {{the character}} in response to the negative comments. She says: [...] "I took what people hated and exaggerated it more in the next video." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Ballinger uses [...] "humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings ... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [...] being conventionally pretty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miranda's creator, Colleen Ballinger, based the {{character}} partly on young women {{that she knew}} in the performance department of her college, Azusa Pacific University. She told The Times of London, [...] "There {{were a lot of}} cocky girls who thought they were really talented, and they ... were <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> and snotty, it drove me nuts. Then I saw all these girls trying to make a career out of putting videos on YouTube ... clueless {{to the fact that they}} were terrible." [...] Ballinger said: [...] "I thought it was so stupid, because I didn't think anybody got famous off of YouTube." [...] Also, when bored in choir class, Ballinger practiced singing slightly sharp or flat to amuse her friends. At first, the [...] "Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke" [...] among Ballinger's friends. Ballinger's YouTube channel received little traffic for more than a year, but in March 2009, she uploaded a video called [...] "Free Voice Lesson" [...] that quickly became a sensation. The video consists of advice to use, and demonstrations of, techniques that real voice teachers would warn students to avoid, delivered in Miranda's arrogant, off-key way. Miranda's videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, as many viewers mistakenly believed {{the character}} was a real person, a [...] "neo-Florence Foster Jenkins". As her videos became popular, Ballinger modified the character in response to the negative comments to make it more extreme, baiting the commenters by adopting the catchphrases [...] "Haters Back Off" [...] and [...] "Haters Make Me Famous". [...] "People would make fun of my hair, and I made it worse. ... I took what people hated and exaggerated it more in the next video." ...|$|E

2500|$|Draco Malfoy {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in the series when he and Harry meet while being fitted for school robes at Madam Malkin's, a clothing shop in Diagon Alley. Not realising that {{the boy in the}} store is Harry Potter—a child whose parents were murdered when he was one year old by the powerful dark wizard Lord Voldemort—Draco engages him in (for him) polite conversation. Harry, however, is alienated by the arrogance of Draco, who asks whether the orphan's parents are [...] "our kind" [...] (pure-blood wizards). Draco then proclaims that [...] "the other sort" [...] (Muggle-borns) should not be allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because [...] "they've never been brought up to know our ways". The two boys part without introductions, but meet again on the Hogwarts Express. After Draco ridicules Ron Weasley's family, Harry rejects his offer of friendship, demonstrated by a handshake, and their mutual antagonism is born. According to Rowling, Malfoy originally makes an effort to be Harry's friend because [...] "it will be cool to turn up at the school being Harry Potter's friend, because Harry is so famous." [...] However, Harry did not want Malfoy as a friend because he [...] "has been <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> about Rubeus Hagrid and about Ron, who Harry likes so much". At the first years' Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat places him into Slytherin (barely touching Draco's head), the house that has developed all of the bad wizards, where he becomes an instant favourite of Potions teacher and Slytherin Head of House, Severus Snape, so-called follower of Lord Voldemort. Draco attempts to get Harry expelled by tricking him into participating in a midnight wizard's duel after secretly informing Argus Filch in advance, but the plan fails when Harry evades Filch and safely makes it back to his dormitory.|$|E

50|$|The {{theme of}} American {{consumerism}} {{can be seen}} in a number of things like the giant props, and the excess of them too. Also it {{can be seen in}} the way the Quakers acted for everything, <b>so</b> snub, <b>rude,</b> and very demanding. There were even metaphors and symbols, like the lines of people throughout the film, and the impatience of the Prince. All four of the cinematic techniques could have helped. People may have many other perspectives on what the film was about, but to some, consumerism is more prominent throughout the Oyster Princess.|$|R
60|$|The rudeness of the Parliament {{soldiers}} began {{from the}} divisions among their officers; for {{in many places}} the soldiers grew so out of all discipline and <b>so</b> unsufferably <b>rude,</b> that they, in particular, refused to march when Sir William Waller went to Weymouth. This had turned to good account for us, had these cursed Scots been out of our way, but they were {{the staff of the}} party; and now they were daily solicited to march southward, which was a very great affliction to the king and all his friends.|$|R

50|$|Rude's Hill is a hill in Shenandoah County, Virginia, United States. It {{was named}} after the Danish Lutheran {{minister}} Anders Rudolph Rude, who arriving in the USA in 1836 had married the widow to the Steenbergen plantation. The hill was an important site in the American Civil War. In April 1862, Confederate General Stonewall Jackson took up his quarter's there in 1862 during the Shenandoah Valley campaign. During fighting, pastor Rude's wife and daughter were unintended victims, and the property suffered heavy damage, <b>so</b> Rev. <b>Rude</b> left in the autumn. In Texas he became a minister and Professor, but this hill continued to reflect his family name.|$|R
