5|$|Linguist Ekkehart Malotki {{challenged}} Whorf's {{analyses of}} Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time. Malotki argues {{that in the}} Hopi language the system of tenses consists of future and non-future and that the single difference between the three-tense system of European languages and the Hopi <b>system,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the latter combines past and present to form a single category.|$|E
5|$|One {{advantage}} of this camera <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it allows the game designers to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|The main {{numbering}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of R. W. Munro {{based on}} the Sibbald MS. The names and numbers used by the 1774 Auld version are also provided. (Monro himself {{did not appear to}} use a numbering system.) The list is presented in geographical sections for ease of use after Haswell-Smith. The Latinised names used by Monniepennie (1612) are also listed along with the modern name, where known, along with various notes where the island's identity is in doubt.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E
5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E

5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which contracted with Inmarsat to provide a satellite communication link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used to transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax, and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a mobile phone network even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E

40|$|A {{frequently}} encountered {{situation in}} the study of delay <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the length of the delay time changes with time, which is of relevance in many fields such as optics, mechanical machining, biology or physiology. A characteristic feature of such <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the dimension of the system dynamics collapses due to the fluctuations of delay times. In consequence, the support of the long-trajectory attractors of this kind of <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> found being fractal in contrast to the fuzzy attractors in most random systems...|$|R
25|$|One {{challenge}} of a sanitation system with UDDTs—and perhaps even with reuse of excreta in agriculture—compared to a conventional sewer-based <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it requires greater {{coordination and cooperation}} amongst stakeholders from different sectors.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{advantage}} of the fourth-rail <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in tunnels with a metallic (usually cast-iron) lining, the return traction current does not leak into the lining causing electrolytic corrosion there or in the neighbouring utility mains.

25|$|The {{price paid}} for the simple syntax of a Hilbert-style <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{complete}} formal proofs tend to get extremely long.

25|$|The D'Amico {{classification}} stratifies men by low, intermediate, or {{high risk}} based on stage, grade, and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings.

25|$|While Clausius {{based his}} {{definition}} on a reversible process, {{there are also}} irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases. The difference between an isolated system and closed <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> heat may not flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.|$|E
