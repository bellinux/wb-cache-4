25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption.

The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among <b>student</b> <b>populations,</b> state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other <b>student</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the city}} was $30,463, and the median income for a family was $48,289. Males had a median income of $31,396 versus $24,611 for females.

25|$|In 2002, Dr. Watson Scott Swail founded EPI to {{establish}} stronger connections between educational research and educational policy, {{with an emphasis}} on historically underserved communities such as students from low-income families, students of color, and students with disabilities. Swail chose this focus because these <b>student</b> <b>populations</b> tend to be the primary target of the majority of educational policy programs, while their voices are simultaneously under-represented in the policy-making arena. This discrepancy points to the need for a greater understanding of what factors have the greatest influence on their educational outcomes.|$|E

In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve <b>student</b> <b>populations</b> under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.|$|E
25|$|Another {{research}} {{focus for}} EPI is {{the expansion of}} access to educational opportunities that {{are found to be}} of high quality, with the rationale that access is only relevant if it is to a quality learning experience. As the economy has become increasingly global, EPI supports the notion that students must be armed with skills that set them up for success in a competitive and technologically savvy market. Thus, EPI recognizes the rising need for students to attain postsecondary degrees, and focuses a great deal of its research on the ability of underserved <b>student</b> <b>populations</b> to matriculate through and graduate from higher education institutions, including the financial and social challenges that come along with this goal.|$|E
