40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{retention}} force of three different types of overdenture attachment systems used in implant-retained mandibular complete overdentures. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one similar acrylic resin blocks were prepared and divided into three study groups: Group A (<b>snap</b> <b>attachment)</b> - 10 specimens, Group B (locator attachment) - 1 specimen, and Group C (syncone attachment) - 10 specimens. A single rectangular heat cure acrylic resin block with two implant analogs 22 mm apart was used with all specimens. Each specimen was subjected to 5500 cycles of insertion and removal in the presence of artificial saliva, representing 5 years of usage. Retention was measured three times for each specimen using universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance at 95 % level of confidence. Results: Locator attachment group (Group B) showed the greatest retention level throughout the study, followed by <b>snap</b> <b>attachment</b> (Group A), and syncone attachment (Group C) showed the lowest retention level. Conclusion: Regardless of the initial retention level of overdenture attachment, gradual loss of retention values is inevitable. However, the rate of retention loss in overdenture attachments is higher in types which comprised plastic parts within their components, rather than those totally made up of noble metals...|$|E
50|$|NSF and <b>SNAPs</b> (NSF <b>attachment</b> proteins) are general {{elements}} of the cellular membrane transport apparatus. The sequence of the predicted 312-amino acid human protein encoded by NAPG is 95% identical to that of bovine gamma-SNAP. NAPG mediates platelet exocytosis and controls the membrane fusion events of this process.|$|R
5000|$|A wax comb {{is a tool}} used in the {{maintenance}} and removal of surfboard wax on a surfboard. Wax combs typically have features such a jagged or toothed edge and a straight, relatively sharp edge. The jagged edge is used to create textured grooves for improving the traction of the wax and the straight edge is used for scraping off unwanted wax. [...] In addition to the straight edge for wax removal, some wax combs even have an inwardly curved edge for the rails (such as Mr. Zog's Sex Wax “Sex Comb”). Additionally, wax combs can have features such as fin key, bottle opener or a <b>snap</b> for portability (<b>attachment</b> to interior pocket loop, lanyard or leash attachment lanyard).|$|R
40|$|AbstractNSF and <b>SNAPs</b> (soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> proteins), {{originally}} {{identified as}} cytosolic components of intracellular vesicular transport mechanisms, {{have recently been}} implicated in Ca 2 +-triggered neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals. Here, we have investigated the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the rodent NSF and SNAP genes. A single transcript of 4. 5 kb is highly expressed in rat brain, whereas only minor amounts of NSF mRNA are found in liver, kidney, heart, lung and skeletal muscle. In situ hybridisation revealed NSF transcripts as early as embryonic day 10 preferentially in the nervous system of mouse embryos. In the adult brain NSF is widely expressed with particularly high levels in the hippocampus. An identical expression profile was observed for α/β-SNAP. Our data are consistent with a central function of NSF and SNAPs in neurotransmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of subdomains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enables this organelle {{to perform a}} variety of functions, yet the mechanisms underlying their organization are poorly understood. In the present study, we show that syntaxin 18, a <b>SNAP</b> (soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> protein) receptor localized in the ER, {{is important for the}} organization of two ER subdomains, smooth/rough ER membranes and ER exit sites. Knockdown of syntaxin 18 caused a global change in ER membrane architecture, leading to the segregation of the smooth and rough ER. Furthermore, the organization of ER exit sites was markedly changed concomitantly with dispersion of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex. These morphological changes in the ER were substantially recovered by treatment of syntaxin- 18 -depleted cells with brefeldin A, a reagent that stimulates retrograde membrane flow to the ER. These results suggest that syntaxin 18 has an important role in ER subdomain organization by mediating the fusion of retrograde membrane carriers with the ER membrane...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the Golgi SNARE (<b>SNAP</b> [soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> protein] receptor) protein Membrin (encoded by the GOSR 2 gene) cause {{progressive}} myoclonus epilepsy (PME). Membrin is a ubiquitous {{and essential}} protein mediating ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion. Thus, {{it is unclear}} how mutations in Membrin result in a disorder restricted to the nervous system. Here, we use a multi-layered strategy to elucidate the consequences of Membrin mutations from protein to neuron. We show that the pathogenic mutations cause partial reductions in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, these alterations were sufficient to profoundly impair dendritic growth in Drosophila models of GOSR 2 -PME. Furthermore, we show that Membrin mutations cause fragmentation of the presynaptic cytoskeleton coupled with transsynaptic instability and hyperactive neurotransmission. Our study highlights how dendritic growth is vulnerable even to subtle secretory pathway deficits, uncovers a role for Membrin in synaptic function, and provides a comprehensive explanatory basis for genotype-phenotype relationships in GOSR 2 -PME...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{resistant}} soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) sources {{are widely used}} against soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe). These include Peking-type soybean, whose resistance requires both the rhg 1 -a and Rhg 4 alleles, and PI 88788 -type soybean, whose resistance requires only the rhg 1 -b allele. Multiple copy number of PI 88788 -type GmSNAP 18, GmAAT, and GmWI 12 in one genomic segment simultaneously contribute to rhg 1 -b resistance. Using an integrated set of genetic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that the rhg 1 -a Peking-type GmSNAP 18 is sufficient for resistance to SCN in combination with Rhg 4. The two <b>SNAPs</b> (soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> proteins) differ by only five amino acids. Our findings suggest that Peking-type GmSNAP 18 is performing a different role in SCN resistance than PI 88788 -type GmSNAP 18. As such, {{this is an example}} of a pathogen resistance gene that has evolved to underlie two types of resistance, yet ensure the same function within a single plant species...|$|R
40|$|An assay {{designed}} to measure the formation of functional transport vesicles was constructed by modifying a cell-free assay for protein transport between compartments of the Golgi (Balch, W. E., W. G. Dunphy, W. A. Braell, and J. E. Rothman. 1984. Cell. 39 : 405 - 416). A 35 - kD cytosolic protein that is immunologically and functionally indistinguishable from alpha <b>SNAP</b> (soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> protein) {{was found to be}} required during vesicle formation. SNAP, together with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) have previously been implicated in the attachment and/or fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. We show that NSF is also required during the formation of functional vesicles. Strikingly, we found that after vesicle formation, the NEM- sensitive function of NSF was no longer required for transport to proceed through the ensuing steps of vesicle attachment and fusion. In contrast to these functional tests of vesicle formation, SNAP was not required for the morphological appearance of vesicular structures on the Golgi membranes. If SNAP and NSF have a direct role in transport vesicle attachment and/or fusion, as previously suggested, these results indicate that these proteins become incorporated into the vesicle membranes during vesicle formation and are brought to the fusion site on the transport vesicles...|$|R
40|$|The NEM-sensitive fusion protein, NSF, {{together}} with <b>SNAPs</b> (soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> proteins) and the SNAREs (SNAP receptors), {{is thought to}} be generally used for the fusion of transport vesicles to their target membranes. NSF is a homotrimer whose polypeptide subunits are made up of three distinct domains: an amino-terminal domain (N) and two homologous ATP-binding domains (D 1 and D 2). Mutants of NSF were produced in which either the order or composition of the three domains were altered. These mutants could not support intra-Golgi transport, but they indicated that the D 2 domain was required for trimerization of the NSF subunits. Mutations of the first ATP-binding site that affected either the binding (K 266 A) or hydrolysis (E 329 Q) of ATP completely eliminated NSF activity. The hydrolysis mutant was an effective, reversible inhibitor of Golgi transport with an IC 50 of 125 ng/ 50 microliters assay. Mutants in the second ATP-binding site (binding, K 549 A; hydrolysis, D 604 Q) had either 14 or 42 % the specific activity of the wild-type protein, respectively. Using coexpression of an inactive mutant with wild-type subunits, it was possible to produce a recombinant form of trimeric NSF that contained a mixture of subunits. The mixed NSF trimers were inactive, even when only one mutant subunit was present, suggesting that NSF action requires each of the three subunits in a concerted mechanism. These studies demonstrate that the ability of the D 1 domain to hydrolyze ATP is required for NSF activity and, therefore is required for membrane fusion. The D 2 domain is required for trimerization, but its ability to hydrolyze ATP is not absolutely required for NSF function...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Different {{types of}} dental restorations {{are used for}} the therapy of {{unilateral}} free-end saddle edentulism. Unilateral complex partial denture {{is one of the}} indications for the Kennedy class II partial edentulism. The abscence of major connector and denture plate is an advantage compared to the conventional restorations, because of better comfort and shorter period of adaptation. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the influence of free-end saddle length change on the behaviour of unilateral complex partial denture supporting structures. Methods. Stress levels of the canine and the first premolar as retentional teeth and the attachments were tested under the influence of physiological forces with the loading point shifting distally in relation to the saddle length change. A virtual real size 3 D model of the fixed part of the restoration (the canine and the first premolar with milled crowns) was created using the CATIA computer program. It was connected to the mobile part of partial denture with the SD <b>snap</b> in latch <b>attachment.</b> Mobile part of the restoration was designed in the region of 2, 3 and 4 lateral teeth (second premolar, first, second and third molar). By using the finite element method (FEM) stress levels analysis was performed under the load of physiological forces of 150 N in the free-end saddle teeth zone. Results. The results of analysis show that physiological forces cause a different stress distribution on the abutment teeth and the attachment, depending on the saddle length. Conclusion. The stress level values obtained for the abutment teeth as well as the attachment are far lower than the marginal ones. The behaviour of the system changes under this defined stress, but no plastic deformation occurs...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} here will summarize the major events taking {{place during the}} synthesis, intracellular transport and discharge of secretory proteins from the pancreatic acinar cell. We will summarize the work {{that led to the}} definition of the regulated secretory pathway in the acinar cell followed by an update of the major steps in the pathway to incorporate new information on vesicular transport that has been gathered over the past 10 years from a number of laboratories. These studies arise from an amazing convergence of information derived from studies on the simpler eukaryote, S. cerevisiae, from biochemical analysis of neurotransmitter release, and from in vitro membrane fusion systems that have allowed for the dissection of the proteins involved in membrane recognition and fusion. Taken together, these {{studies have shown that the}} major proteins involved in membrane targeting and fusion, and the accessory proteins that control these events, are highly conserved over vast periods of evolutionary time. Thus, information derived from each of these systems and approaches can be transferred directly to regulated exocytosis in the pancreatic acinar cell — a system that has superimposed on it the complexities of organization into a polarized epithelium and control from the extracellular milieu via neurohormones. The ensuing hypothesis that integrates this body of information is termed the SNARE hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the core complex of NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein) and <b>SNAPs</b> (soluble NSF <b>attachment</b> proteins) pair with their cognate receptors, SNAREs, present on the vesicles (v-SNARE) and the target membrane (t-SNARE) to form a complex that can lead to specific docking and fusion of the vesicles with their target membranes. This process is believed to be controlled by a variety of accessory proteins including synaptotagmin, a Ca 2 + binding clamp for exocytosis and members of the rab family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. Several of these proteins have been found by us to be present in the pancreatic acinar cell and are likely involved in similar processes that have been worked out in simpler systems. For example, we have shown that rab 3 D is uniquely associated with the cytosolic side of zymogen granule membranes as an integral membrane protein and that peptides from the effector domain of the rab proteins are able to induce secretion from permeabilized acinar cells, suggesting a role for this process in regulated exocytosis. These types of approaches are being used to define the localizaiton and function of members of the SNARE family of proteins and of proteins that control formation of the SNARE complex with a particular emphasis on their role in hormonally-elicited secretion. In our presentations, we will also discuss the acquisition of stimulus secretion coupling during the perinatal period in the developing rat pancreas since this system provides the possibility of defining, in a system that does not require exogenous transfection, the sequential expression of factors involved in membrane targeting and fusion. For example, during secretogenesis, rab 3 D is initially cytosolic at a time when the machinery of exocytosis is present but not functional, and only becomes associated with zymogen granule membranes after birth when stimulus-secretion coupling is acquired...|$|R
