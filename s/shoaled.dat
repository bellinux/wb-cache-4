Although informed of this during the conference, Captain Brown and Commander Millett left the conference under the mistaken belief that there were still five buoys marking the acoustical range.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shoaling</b> {{preferences}} in banded killifish differ in <b>shoal</b> species composition, <b>shoal</b> size, and individual body size within the <b>shoal.</b> The shift in preferences is triggered by predatory stimuli. In {{the presence of}} predatory stimuli, a banded killifish individual will prefer the bigger conspecific <b>shoal,</b> but {{only as long as}} the <b>shoal</b> is homogenous in individual fish size. If the size of individual fish were different, they would join a <b>shoal</b> of similarly sized fish regardless of <b>shoal</b> size. This preference is maintained by predatory threat.

2500|$|Cities {{and towns}} in the Sacramento Valley {{experienced}} {{an increasing number of}} devastating floods, while the rising riverbeds made navigation on the rivers increasingly difficult. [...] Perhaps no other city experienced the boon and the bane of gold mining as much as Marysville. Situated at the confluence of the Yuba and Feather rivers, Marysville was the final [...] "jumping off" [...] point for miners heading to the northern foothills to seek their fortune. Steamboats from San Francisco, carrying miners and supplies, navigated up the Sacramento River, then the Feather River to Marysville where they would unload their passengers and cargo. [...] Marysville eventually constructed a complex levee system to protect the city from floods and sediment. [...] Hydraulic mining greatly exacerbated the problem of flooding in Marysville and <b>shoaled</b> the waters of the Feather River so severely that few steamboats could navigate from Sacramento to the Marysville docks. The sediment left by such efforts were reprocessed by mining dredges at the Yuba Goldfields, located near Marysville.|$|E
30|$|During the depositional {{period of}} KT-II, the open {{platform}} water energy changed intermittently, {{leading to the}} alternate deposition of high-energy <b>shoals,</b> low-energy <b>shoals,</b> and inter <b>shoals</b> (the low-lying land between <b>shoals).</b> Nonreservoirs deposited between <b>shoals</b> are tight and strong in resistance to pressure, while reservoirs between <b>shoals</b> are loose and weak in resistance to pressure. Under tectonic stress, the reservoirs of high-energy <b>shoals</b> and low-energy <b>shoals</b> would release pressure first since their particles were breaking up, resulting {{in the formation of}} microfractures; then, the tight nonreservoirs between <b>shoals</b> would form macrofractures. Thus, structural macrofractures of open platform facies carbonate deposition are mostly present in tight nonreservoirs, accounting for 84.4  %, and seldom in low-energy <b>shoals.</b> High-energy <b>shoals</b> are dominated by granular fracturing microfractures.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of body length and parasitism on the positioning behaviour {{of individuals in}} wild fish <b>shoals</b> was investigated by a novel means of capturing entire <b>shoals</b> of the banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus, Lesueur) using a grid-net that maintained the two-dimensional positions of individuals within <b>shoals.</b> Fish in the front section of a <b>shoal</b> were larger {{than those in the}} rear. Individuals parasitized by the digenean trematode (Crassiphiala bulboglossa, Haitsma) showed a tendency to occupy the front of <b>shoals.</b> Parasitized fish were also found more in peripheral positions than central ones in a significant number of <b>shoals.</b> <b>Shoal</b> geometry was affected by the overall parasite prevalence of <b>shoal</b> members; <b>shoals</b> with high parasite prevalence displayed increasingly phallanx-like <b>shoal</b> formations, whereas <b>shoals</b> with low prevalence were more elliptical. There was no relationship between body length and parasite abundance or prevalence in the fish population which suggests body length and parasite status are independent predictors of positioning behaviour.

25|$|Fish {{generally}} prefer larger <b>shoals.</b> This makes sense, as larger <b>shoal</b> usually {{provide better}} protection against predators.

Larger <b>shoals</b> may also find food faster, though that food {{would have to be}} shared amongst more individuals.

40|$|Observations {{were made}} on three fish species (banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni)) in a {{temperate}} lake (New Brunswick, Canada) in order to investigate the relationship between <b>shoal</b> choice behaviour of individual fishes and <b>shoal</b> composition. Encounters between <b>shoals</b> were observed to take place every 1. 1 min per <b>shoal</b> and an encounter lasted 3. 7 s on average. The duration of <b>shoal</b> encounters was influenced by <b>shoal</b> size but not by differences between <b>shoals</b> in either body length or species.

Conversely, the outcome of <b>shoal</b> encounters (i. e. whether or not an individual changes <b>shoal)</b> was influenced by body length and species differences but not by <b>shoal</b> size. Together, {{these results suggest that}} encounter duration itself is unlikely to have an important influence on encounter outcome. The collection of ten entire fish <b>shoals</b> showed that they were assorted by species and body length. A simulation model demonstrated that individual <b>shoal</b> choice behaviour alone could account for the generation and maintenance of the observed levels of size assortedness of <b>shoals</b> without invoking the existence of other sorting mechanisms such as differential swimming speeds. However, the generation of species assortedness was not predicted by the model. Furthermore, our data suggest that fish density acts as a constraint on <b>shoal</b> choice, influencing both <b>shoal</b> size and composition.

40|$|Abstract We studied <b>shoaling</b> {{behaviour}} in {{a species}} of fish (Garra barreimiae) from Oman.

The stimulus <b>shoal</b> was confined to (1) clear Plexiglas cylinders in light, (2) wire-mesh cylinders in light, or (3) wire-mesh cylinders in darkness. The surface form exhibited a strong preference for the stimulus <b>shoal</b> during the experiments in light, but also in darkness, when only non-visual cues from the <b>shoal</b> could be perceived. The cave form did not show a preference when solely visual cues were available (Plexiglas cylinder). When non-visual cues from the <b>shoal</b> could be perceived (wire-mesh), the cave form did show a preference to associate with the <b>shoal,</b> but the <b>shoaling</b> tendency was considerably weaker than in the surface form. The <b>shoaling</b> tendency has probably been genetically reduced in the cave form...|$|R

40|$|Group {{living in}} fish can provide {{benefits}} of protection from predators and some parasites, more efficient foraging for food, increased mating opportunities and enhanced energetic benefit when swimming. For riverine species, <b>shoaling</b> behaviour can {{be influenced by}} various environmental stressors, yet little is known how flow rate might influence the <b>shoaling</b> of diseased fish <b>shoals.</b> In view of the increasingly unpredictable flow rates in streams and rivers, this study aimed to assess the combined effect of flow condition and parasitism on the <b>shoaling</b> behaviour of a model fish species. <b>Shoal</b> size, <b>shoal</b> cohesion and time spent <b>shoaling</b> of female guppies Poecilia reticulata were compared when infected with the directly transmitted ectoparasite Gyrodactylus turnbulli under flow and static conditions. Flow condition was {{an important factor in}} influencing <b>shoaling</b> behaviour of guppies with the fish forming larger <b>shoals</b> in the absence of flow. When a <b>shoal</b> member was infected with G. turnbulli, <b>shoal</b> cohesion was reduced, but the magnitude of this effect was dependent on flow condition. In both flow and static conditions, bigger fish formed larger <b>shoals</b> than smaller counterparts. Future changes to stream hydrology with more frequent flooding and drought events will affect the <b>shoaling</b> tendency of fish. During high-flow events, diseased fish {{may not be able to}} keep up with <b>shoal</b> mates and therefore have a higher risk of predation. Additionally, these findings may be important for aquaria and farmed species where an increase in flow rate may reduce aggregation in fish...|$|R
