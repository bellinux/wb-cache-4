50|$|The Milkor Stopper is a riot gun {{used for}} riot control, {{designed}} {{to fire a}} 37/38mm or 40mm cartridge, {{which can be a}} 9mm Buckshot, Rubber ball buckshot, teargas canister, rubber <b>shot</b> <b>cartridge</b> or explosive. The weapon is simple to operate and all metal surfaces are treated with a coating for corrosion protection, plus long-life dry film lubrication. It fires one shot before reloading. It is a conventional single shot, break-open weapon (opening at the breech like an ordinary shotguns (not pump-action)) with a floating firing pin mechanism that ensures safety when accidentally dropped. As a security or assault weapon, it can be fired from the shoulder or like a pistol by hand. The components of the weapon are interchangeable (client dependent), providing a range of applications from Less Lethal 37/38mm to a 40mm Lethal weapon.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} past a very {{beautiful}} area along the interior coastal environment of Venice lagoon {{was used as a}} Clay Pigeon Shooting for a wide period. The sport of Clay Pigeon Shooting involves using a shotgun to shoot at and break a circular flying target made from a fragile material. It is released from a trap positioned in front of, or at the back of, a shooter; then, a typical target flight area characterizes each shooting site, where, in time, pellets (leadshot), <b>shot</b> <b>cartridge,</b> clay pigeon fragments and generic ammunition residues are found. So, in a brackish water contest soil/sediment treatment, waste removal and potential re-use are extremely delicate processes. The first step of our work was investigate if heavy metal (Pb, As and Sb) release and following leaching event occurred. Therefore, soil/sediment profiles in three hot sites of the target flight area has been performed and metal’s total and bioavailable fraction has been investigated. As well, grassy layer coating the sites and organisms living into has been picked, in order to verify a potential uptake and bioaccumulation...|$|E
50|$|The KBP OTs-20 Gnom ("Gnome") 12.5x40mm is a {{conventional}} large-frame revolver designed to fire cut-down 32-gauge full-brass shotgun shells. It fires the STs110 armor-piercing-core lead slug, STs110-04 hollow-point lead slug, and STs110-02 lead <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In September 1937, a smoothbore version {{intended}} for short-range varmint control was introduced, chambered for [...]22 Short, [...]22 Long, [...]22 Long Rifle, or [...]22 Long Rifle <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> interchangeably. Other than {{the absence of}} rifling, it was largely similar to the standard model.|$|R
50|$|The shotgun is multicharged, with a tubular underbarrel {{magazine}} of 3-cartridge capacity. Reloading {{is provided with}} a removable fore-end. The presence of the special barrel rear projection on the frame combined with the rear sight gives the possibility of mounting an optical sight. The shotgun is intended for the amateur hunting with <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
40|$|At {{the present}} time, optical {{examinations}} {{are not used}} in routine to analyze the gunshot residues, except for the counting and the localization of particles. Indeed, the sequence of examinations often starts immediately with destructive techniques, contrary to the widely accepted law saying that we should progress from general to particular and from non-destructive to destructive and which is recommended for all the fields of forensic sciences. When a cartridge is shot, and before the projectile leaves the gun, all the powder grains should must be completely burnt; however, if this ideal case does not happen, {{it is possible to}} find unburnt and/or partially burnt gunpowder particles [H. H. Meng, R. Caddy, Gunshot residue analysis-a review, J. Forensic Sci. 42 (1997) 553 - 570]. The goal {{of this paper is to}} study the morphological characteristics of the powder before and after the shot, to establish if it is possible to determine which type of ammunition has been used on the basis of these characteristics. A set of 181 cartridges of different calibers was considered and various tests carried out to evaluate the technique. On the basis of the observation of the gunpowder particles found on the target, a list of potential cartridges can be established with the actually <b>shot</b> <b>cartridge</b> always found among them. It is important to underline that a maximum of eight cartridges were proposed for each experiment. Consequently, the method can be judged very discriminating. A database was then created, including information related to the morphological characteristics of the gunpowder before and after the shot as well as to the class characteristics of the analysed cartridges...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, pen {{guns that}} can fire bullet or <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{and do not}} require a {{reconfiguration}} to fire (e.g., folding {{to the shape of}} a pistol) are federally regulated as an Any Other Weapon (Title II). They require registration under the National Firearms Act and a tax in the amount of five dollars is levied.|$|R
5000|$|Lancaster's pattern {{centerfire}} and pinfire [...]410 <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{first appeared}} in Eley Brothers Ltd. flysheets in 1857. By 1874, Eleys were advertising modern centerfire [...]410 cartridges. It appears to have become popular around 1900, although it was recommended as [...] "suited {{to the requirements of}} naturalists, and for such weapons as walking-stick guns", presumably for self-defense, in 1892 by W. W. Greener. [...] The first ammunition was 2.0 inches (50.8 mm) long, compared with the modern 2.5 and 3.0 in sizes.|$|R
5000|$|The 6-inch guns used [...] "non-fixed ammunition", that is, the {{explosive}} cartridge that propelled the shell was stored and loaded {{separately from the}} shell or <b>shot.</b> <b>Cartridges</b> were made of raw silk, and stored in wooden crates in a special high-security section of the underground magazine. There were five types of shell on the Fort Rodd manifest in 1897: High Explosive (Lyddite), Armour-piercing, Common Pointed (for non-armoured maritime targets), and Shrapnel. The other class of projectile (and the one most often fired) was a solid steel shot (without any cavity for explosives or fuses, it was cheapest to produce). The shells and shot all had the same service weight of 94 pounds (to simplify calculation of elevation and depression) and diameter of 6 in; therefore, lengths of the various types varied.|$|R
5000|$|To further complicate matters, special <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> are {{available}} for typical handgun chamberings such as 9 mm Parabellum, [...]45 ACP, [...]38 Special/.357 Magnum, [...]44 Special/.44 Magnum, and [...]45 Colt, as well as [...]22LR. These rounds are either crimped in or in a plastic casing, replacing the bullet. These are not generally considered [...] "shot shells" [...] by shotgun users, and the patterning performance is questionable, since they are fired through rifled barrels. Thompson/Center has manufactured special pistol barrels in for their Contender frames in [...]38/.357, [...]44 and [...]45 Colt/.410 (.45/.410 Also available for T/C Encore frames) that have [...] "straight rifled" [...] chokes in them to reduce the spin of the shot column and produce better patterns, {{but they are still}} suitable only for pest control at very short ranges.|$|R

5000|$|In 1868, Remington began {{offering}} five <b>shot</b> metallic <b>cartridge</b> conversions of the revolver in [...]46 rimfire. Remington paid a royalty fee to Smith & Wesson, {{owners of the}} Rollin White patent (#12,648, April 3, 1855) on bored-through revolver cylinders for metallic cartridge use.

5000|$|Other, {{less common}} shotgun {{cartridges}} {{have their own}} unique uses. Ammunition manufacturer CCI produces 9 mm (.355 in.) and several other popular pistol calibers up to [...]45 ACP as well as [...]22 (5.5 mm) for firing from handguns. These are commonly called snake <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges.</b> [...] Larger gauges, up to 4 bore, too powerful to shoulder, have been built, but were generally affixed to small boats and referred to as punt guns. These were used for commercial waterfowl hunting, to kill large numbers of birds resting on the water. Single and double derringers have also been produced {{that are capable of}} firing either [...]45 (Long) Colt or [...]410 shotgun shells from the same chamber; they are commonly known as [...] "snake guns", and are popular among some outdoorsmen in the South and Southwest regions of the United States. There are also some revolvers, such as the Taurus Judge, that are capable of shooting the [...]45LC/.410 rounds; but as with derringers, these are handguns that shoot [...]410 shotgun shells, and are not necessarily considered shotguns.|$|R
60|$|According the Ogula {{they should}} have reached the {{confines}} of the great lake several days before and landed on healthful rising ground {{that was part of the}} Asiki territory. But this had not happened, and now he doubted whether it ever would happen. It was more likely that they would come to their deaths, there in the marsh, especially as the few ball and <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> which they had saved in their flight were now exhausted. Not one was left; nothing was left except their revolvers with some charges, which of course were quite useless for the killing of game. Therefore they were in a fair way to die of hunger, for here if fish existed, they refused to be caught and nought remained for them to fill themselves with except water slugs, and snails which the boatmen were already gathering and crunching up in their great teeth. Or, perhaps the Ogula, forgetting friendship under the pressure of necessity, would murder them as they slept and--revert to their usual diet.|$|R

The group's armed struggle was regarded as treasonous by the British government, who executed captured participants by hanging. Matthieu's participation was discovered and the youth was forced to flee Canada for refuge in the United States, crossing the border there by means of a forged passport.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the largest}} {{handheld}} pulse weapon. Pulse Bursters release an explosive charge of pulse energy from all eight barrels of the burster at the same time. The charge explodes upon impact with any hard target, usually destroying it. These heavy weapons are hard to handle and are difficult to aim. However, they're unparalleled weapons for thinning out large masses of enemies who foolishly clump together. (Crais uses one in Infinite Possibilities).

50|$|Donahue's {{reconstruction}} of the trajectories of the shots that struck Kennedy and Governor Connally supported the single-bullet theory for the second shot. Donahue decided that the impossible trajectory suggested by the Warren Commission was only necessary because there was an error in their positioning of Connally.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Excavations {{performed}} at the historic Smith House (ORYA 3) located in Dayton, Yamhill County, Oregon, recovered a large collection of artifacts. Categories of artifacts previously analyzed include flat glass, nails, glass containers, ceramic hollowware and flatware, brick, bone, metal containers, illumination devices, currency, footwear, tobacco, and lead balls, <b>shot,</b> and <b>cartridge</b> casings. A category not analyzed was children's toys. This thesis addresses this category of artifact. The thesis discusses the historical context of the Smith House, and examines children, play and toys. The theoretical construct of symbolic anthropology is used to provide {{a model for the}} process of enculturation. Detailed analysis of glass and clay marbles and of ceramic doll and doll-related artifacts is performed. Proveniences and associations of these artifacts are undertaken. Appendices provide for a chronology of doll manufacturing and for a detailed description of artifacts. Conclusions drawn from the analysis of the toys at the Smith House suggest that a larger collection of toys and better provenience of collected materials are necessary in order to apply the symbolic approach to toys as tools of enculturation. Recommendations for future avenues of research are given. It is suggested that this analysis provides a basis for future comparison with other historical archaeological sites...|$|R
5000|$|The Type 31 was {{introduced}} in 1898, with the “Type 31” designation indicating that the gun was developed in 31st year of reign of Emperor Meiji. [...] Designed by Colonel Arisaka Nariakira, it had a barrel made of steel, which improved the range and accuracy of the gun over the earlier 7 cm mountain gun, which had a bronze barrel.The Type 31 used smokeless powder <b>cartridge</b> <b>shots,</b> and had a semi-rigid recoil system using cables connected {{to a set of}} springs. It had a range of approximately 7800 meters, using a 6.0 kilogram explosive shot. The Type 31 also came in a lighter mountain gun version, which had a shorter range (4300 meters).Approximately 620 were produced and deployment to combat units was completed by 1902.

5000|$|British accountOn 25 August 1798 boats from [...] cut Torride {{out from}} under the guns of castle of Berquier (Abu Kir) in a hard-fought action lasting 15 minutes. Torride had a crew of 70 men under the command of {{lieutenant}} de vaisseau Martin Bedat (or Bedar), and was armed with three 18-pounder guns and four swivel guns. Despite fire from the castle, the British suffered only two men wounded, including Lieutenant William Debusk, who led the attack; the French suffered four men killed, and ten wounded, including Bedat. Captain Thomas Foley of Goliath sent Bedat ashore under a flag of truce. Several French prisoners escaped by jumping overboard and swimming ashore.French accountFrench Adjutant-general Escale, in a letter to General Kléber, states that if one didn’t know the facts of Torrides capture one would have thought that treason had to have been involved. She had no watch, no guards, the crew was asleep, and the wicks from which the guns could be lit were not lighted. The crew was able to fire only three gun shots before the British boarding party was already on board. Her captain redeemed himself by fighting bravely, sustaining eight wounds.In a letter dated 4 September, Napoleon wrote to General Menou that he was not surprised at what had happened with Torride. Recent developments (i.e., the Battle of the Nile), had eroded navy morale, and it had been stupid to have left her in such an exposed position.In a letter dated 11 January 1799 Napoleon wrote to Contre-Amiral Ganteaume that he should have the aviso Torride and a second aviso carry into Lake Bourlos the artillery for three batteries: two Gomer mortars of [...] "12 pouces", four Gomer mortars of [...] "8 pouces", four 24-pounder guns, two grills for heating <b>shot,</b> 150 <b>cartridges</b> per mortar, and 200 cartridges per gun. Apparently it had slipped Napoleon’s mind that Torride was now serving the Royal Navy.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located {{on the right side}} of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single <b>shot</b> action, the <b>cartridges</b> were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram rod and percussion cap which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|R
