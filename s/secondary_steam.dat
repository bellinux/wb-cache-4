5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the <b>secondary</b> <b>steam</b> cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E

25|$|IGCC also consumes {{less water}} than {{traditional}} pulverized coal plants. In a pulverized coal plant, coal is burned to produce steam, {{which is then}} used to create electricity using a steam turbine.

Sensitivity analyses show about 10 % reduction in cost is achieved by increasing the chimney height from 8 m to 15 m, 22 % cost reduction by increasing the capacity factor from 70 - 90 % and 13 % cost reduction by decreasing the construction time from 7 to 3 years. These cost reductions are comparable to those which can be achieved for the ABR with a <b>steam</b> <b>secondary</b> system. The increased cost for the helium versus the <b>steam</b> <b>secondary</b> side results principally from the thermal efficiency difference and the cost difference between steam cycle and helium cycle components.

The work of this report is focused on 1) identifying the allowable design region for the important design parameters, 2) selecting the set of design parameter values for the <b>steam</b> <b>secondary</b> system {{which leads to the}} lowest electricity generation cost and 3) comparing this approach to alternative fast systems. An analysis was performed to examine the capital cost of the ABR and the sensitivity of the capital cost to key design parameters: degree of superheat, secondary system pressure and reactor chimney height. These capital cost estimation and sensitivity analyses were based on the cost estimate of the ALMR report. The following optimal design parameter values for the <b>steam</b> <b>secondary</b> system were established by parameter studies presented in this report. - Pb-Bi in-tube design for the steam generator - Triangular tube lattice in the steam generator - Superheat in steam generator (30 °C superheat) - Secondary pressure (70 bar) in the steam generator - No recirculation in the steam generator - Steam generator coolant inlet temperature. The ABR capital cost shows around 15 % reduction compared to the ALMR. This is mainly due to the lower cost of the coolant systems due to elimination of the intermediate heat transport system and main coolant pump. Whether, the same ration of reduced cost can be expected in comparison to S-PRISM which is not known but is likely given that the same simplification apply. The ABR capital cost sensitivity analysis shows that the capital cost does not change with degree of superheat, increases with secondary system pressure and decreases with increased reactor chimney height.

Future decontamination activities at the ICPP could result in the production of 5 million gallons or more of sodium-bearing waste using current decontamination techniques.

With the curtailment of reprocessing at the ICPP, the focus of decontamination is shifting from maintenance for continued operation of the facilities to decommissioning. Treatment of sodium-bearing waste is a particularly difficult problem due to the high content of alkali metals in the sodium-bearing liquid waste. It requires a very large volume of cold chemical additive for calcination. In addition, the sodium content of the sodium-bearing waste exceeds the limit that can be incorporated into vitrified waste without the addition of glass-forming compounds (primarily silicon) to produce an acceptable immobilized waste form.
