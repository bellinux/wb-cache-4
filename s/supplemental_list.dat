The contents of Đại Việt sử lược were divided into three volumes (quyển), the first called Quốc sơ diên cách corresponded with the period from the foundation of Văn Lang, the first nation of Vietnam in the 7th century BCE to the 12 Lords Rebellion (10th century), the second and third books were named Nguyễn kỷ (Period of the Nguyễn) and narrated the reign of the Lý Dynasty with the royal family name Lý was changed to Nguyễn by the Trần Dynasty {{in order to avoid the}} given name of Trần Lý, grandfather of the emperor Trần Thái Tông, and make people forget the former dynasty. The quality of compilation of Đại Việt sử lược was not coherent, there were periods which were recorded in details but also some very brief sections. The author of Đại Việt sử lược appeared to attach special importance to the reign of the Lý Dynasty with extensive records while the compilation of the period up to the middle of the 10th century was mainly based on Chinese sources.|$|E

Applicants' rank order lists can include a combination of categorical programs (training that is 3-5 years in length and begins in the first post-graduate year); preliminary programs (training that is one year in length and begins in the first post-graduate year); or advanced programs (training that is 3-4 years in length and begins after one or more years of preliminary training).

40|$|Engaging and accessible, {{this book}} teaches readers {{how to use}} {{inferential}} statistical thinking to check their assumptions, assess evidence about their beliefs, and avoid overinterpreting results that may look more promising than they really are. It provides step-by-step guidance for using both classical (frequentist) and Bayesian approaches to inference. Statistical techniques covered side by side from both frequentist and Bayesian approaches include hypothesis testing, replication, analysis of variance, calculation of effect sizes, regression, time series analysis, and more. Students also get a complete introduction to the open-source R programming language and its key packages. Throughout the text, simple commands in R demonstrate essential data analysis skills using real-data examples.
