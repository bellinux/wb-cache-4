40|$|Port {{planning}} {{is a complex}} multidisciplinary subject. To fulfill its functions, {{it is essential that}} the different elements of a port work together. The full potential of a terminal can only be reached when the wet infrastructure of a port (access channel, inner basins, turning circles) can keep up with the traffic load. From the literature study, it has become apparent that simulation tools have become increasingly popular for assessing the capacity of ports and waterways. However, the application has often been aimed at a specific case study and the existing models are not easily reusable for new applications. In this master thesis project, the assessment through a generic simulation tool of the effective capacity of the wet infrastructure of a port is investigated. The model considers the processes taking place from the point a vessel arrives at the entrance of the access channel until the start of the (un) loading procedures and the departure of the port until exiting the access channel. The analysis capabilities of the model are demonstrated by studying the Port of Hazira. The main processes of the model relate to vessels obtaining authorisation to sail towards a destination. To receive this authorisation, the vessels must find a moment when the correct weather conditions occur, the tidal elevation is adequate, the waterways are available and sufficient quay length is available. The authorisation is given in a dynamic way, depending on the dimensions of the vessels, waterways and quays. Based on their origin and destination, vessels can determine their route based on the shortest path available and waterways available depending on their vessel type. Once this is done, a vessel will construct a <b>sailing</b> <b>plan</b> by finding a suitable timeslot to through each section of the port. When doing so, a vessel takes into account the sailing plans of other vessels and the sailing rules that apply for each section. As a result, a vessel can construct a suitable <b>sailing</b> <b>plan</b> based on an origin and destination which can be applied to any port layout. During this study, it has become apparent that many processes should be included to properly determine the capacity of port. Simulation software offers the possibility of including all these processes and observe their interactions in order to locate bottlenecks more efficiently. Simio has proven to be able to incorporate all the required process to properly model the wet infrastructure of a port. However, it does not offer a user-friendly interface to handle different scenarios and facilitate the handling of both the input and output of the model. To this easier, an interface has been created with Scenario Navigator. This interface enable the storing and comparing of input parameters and results of different scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The {{training}} ship of the Nagasaki University Faculty of Fisheries, "the Nagasaki-maru", suffered about 15 % decrease in speed {{on account of}} the bottom fouling at sea 112 days after her docking. In order to seek a paint suitable for "the Nagasaki-maru" which had been at anchor {{for a long time in}} Nagasaki Harbor where the ship's bottom is liable to be fouled by attaching organisms, the authors painted the bottom in seven kinds of paint in seven sections and obtained some data from the experiment at her docking after 134 days. Some studies on these results are reported here. 1) The species of the bottom fouling animals most abundant in Nagasaki Harbor from February to June was Hydroides norvegica, as shown by the results of the practical tests on the ship's bottom: 99. 8 % of Hydroides norvegica and 0. 2 % of Balanus amphitrite communis. The predominant bottom foulers are generally believed to be Balanus, and the contradictory result of the present experiment to this may be due to the environmental condition of Nagasaki Harbor, 2) The most suitable bottom paint for anti-fouling in Nagasaki Harbor was a combination of copper poison and mercury. A mixture of copper poison and organic poison proved to be unsuited for the antifouling bottom paint. The mixing rates of mercury and of modified rosin varnish relating to the leaching rate of the poison are left as problems for a future study. 3) In order to control the leaching rate of the poison which is influential in the anti-fouling properties of the paints, the ship's bottom should be coated with a thick layer of the paint suitable for her mother port or with a combination of the paint with some other paints of different ingredients having a property of anti-sea-water-defacement, according to the <b>sailing</b> <b>plan</b> from the time of docking. Thus, the bottom fouling will be prevented for a long time. 4) In parallel with the study to keep the bottom from fouling for a long time by selecting the suitable paint for the harbor and controlling the leaching rate of the poison, the preventive of propeller fouling must be devised﻿ 5) Based on the facts obtained from these experiments, furthe tests on sectional painting of the bottom, and studies on the larvae of attaching animals, which are important factors of the bottom fouling, are being carried out. ﻿(1) 長崎港内に於て, 2 月より 6 月までの間に,船底汚損生物は,カサネカンザシが大部分であり,実船試験による結果は,カサネカンザシ 99. 8 %フジツボ 0. 2 %であった. 一般に船底汚損生物にはフジツボが多いと云われて居るが,これは長崎港の環境条件によるものと思われる.
