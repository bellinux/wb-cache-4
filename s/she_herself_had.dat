5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was born}} {{an only child}} on 17 November 1876 in Jhansi, {{in the state of}} Uttar Pradesh, India. His father Hesketh Brodrick Prichard, an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, died from typhoid six weeks before he was born, leading him to be raised alone by his mother, Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard. <b>She</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> come from a {{military}} family, her father being Major-General Browne William Ryall.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, {{arguing that}} feminists should not support or attempt to reform {{criminal}} obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book Pornography were held for inspection by Canada Customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under {{a law that}} <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance, Dworkin {{did not support the}} decision, and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) were held temporarily as part of a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the Butler decision.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

5|$|The {{magazine}} Paris Flash {{claim that}} Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, {{on the basis}} of a misinterpreted interview with Professor Calculus. This results in an avalanche of congratulations from Haddock's friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary power cut. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine Tempo di Roma with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a magazine reporter.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2013, {{a second}} European leg through 2014 was {{announced}} {{bringing the total}} number of shows to 132, thus becoming Beyoncé's longest running tour to date. Similar to the first European leg, a frenzied rush for tickets, further enhanced by the release of the singer's self-titled fifth studio album three days before ticket sales began, resulted in extra dates being added for all United Kingdom shows, Dublin, Cologne, Amsterdam and Antwerp. For the second European leg, Beyoncé had beaten the record <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> set earlier in the year, by selling 40,000 tickets in under one hour for the two 2014 concerts at Antwerp. Pollstar ranked The Mrs. Carter Show at number 2 on its year-end chart of the top twenty grossing worldwide tours with a gross of $188.6 million from the 2013 shows. Tickets were sold with an average gross of $2,449,248 per city. In April 2014, Billboard reported that Beyoncé's 2014 European shows grossed $41.1 million and played for an audience of 384,730. This brought The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour's total gross to $229.7 million when combined with the 107 shows performed in 2013, and the total attendance to 2,082,848, averaging 15,779 attendance and $1.74 million gross per night. The tour is Beyoncé's highest grossing to date before being surpassed by The Formation World Tour which grossed over $256 million, and one of the highest grossing tours of the decade.|$|E

25|$|Coulter later {{stated that}} she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a {{favorable}} settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would {{give the impression that}} Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.|$|E
25|$|Minfong Ho, in {{her four}} novels, {{presented}} to her readers realistic depictions of her native Southeast Asia. Despite being fictions, her stories were all {{set against the}} backdrop of real historical events that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> experienced or at least observed firsthand. Her optimistic central theme remains similar throughout all four books. So do the central figures, who are all young girls facing harsh realities of life unimaginable by their more fortunate contemporaries in developed countries. With her sensitivity for the emotional world of her characters, Ho showed her readers the humane side behind atrocities of the October 6 massacre of student protesters in Bangkok and the Khmer Rouge regime. Against poverty, sexual discrimination, oppression, war, loss of loved ones, she maintained that human spirit should prevail.|$|E
25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} as he held that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This {{was evident in the}} manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some in the nature of a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the line of questioning that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to prove its case and not the judge's duty to do so, even if it was an attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E

25|$|Poventud {{was born}} in Guayama, Puerto Rico, to Francisco Poventud, a law {{enforcement}} officer in the San Juan Police Department, and Concepción Aponte, a seamstress. Descendent of Carlos Armstrong and Eulalia Pou, Poventud {{was the youngest of}} five siblings. From the age of five Poventud, known as El Niño Prodigio de Guayama (The Child Prodigy of Guayama), looked forward to trips to the town Plaza accompanied by his mother, dressed in clothes that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> sewn. While he was a student at the Escuela Parada Guamani, he suffered a spinal cord injury caused by a biking accident and was hospitalized for two years, which left him immobile at the age of 10. His mother was stricken by TB and died shortly after he was discharged from the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Conrad's {{treaty was}} met with disdain by Adelaide and Henry. Though Adelaide was Burgundian by birth, she was raised as an Italian. Her father Rudolf II of Burgundy was briefly king of Italy prior to being deposed and <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> briefly been queen of Italy until her husband Lothair II of Italy's death. Berengar II imprisoned her when she refused to marry his son, Adalbert of Italy. Henry had other reasons to {{disapprove}} of the peace treaty. As Duke of Bavaria, he controlled territory on the northern side of the German-Italian border. Henry had hope that, with Berengar II being deposed, his own fiefdom would be greatly expanded by incorporating territory south of the Alps. Conrad and Henry were already not on good terms, and the proposed treaty drove the two dukes further apart. Adelaide and Henry conspired together to persuade Otto to reject Conrad's treaty.|$|E
25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley {{would be less}} likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard she would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E

25|$|The governess {{occupied}} a uniquely awkward {{position in the}} Victorian household, because she was neither a servant nor yet {{a member of the}} host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. <b>She</b> <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away {{from the rest of the}} family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.|$|E
500|$|They {{took them}} out of the house and, at the corner of a nearby lane they were stood against a fence and shot. The {{documentary}} included an interview with Dorina Mazzola who said that her mother had seen the shooting.

The documentary went on to claim that the later shootings at the Villa Belmonte were subsequently staged as part of the [...] "cover up".|$|E

I thought I could have someone like Janice because she's so outrageous." [...] Banks stated that she thought Dickinson provided a warning to models not to follow the path she had taken because it had proved dangerous:" [...] When she's telling a girl, 'Don't do this,' she's saying, 'Don't do this because it didn't work for me.' I {{thought it was a good}} balance." ...|$|E
