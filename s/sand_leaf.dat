Calli were {{initiated}} from corms of Gladiolus hybrida variety Princess Lee by culturing on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l napthaline acetic acid (NAA) and 20 g/l sucrose. In vitro shoots were regenerated from the calli by transferring into MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose without growth regulators. Regenerated shoots produced cormlets {{at the base}} of the shoot on full or half strength MS medium supplemented with 40 - 60 g/l sucrose. Highest number of large corms (diameter> 1. 5 cm) was obtained in the half strength MS medium containing 60 g/l sucrose. Multiplication of in vitro-grown cormlets was achieved by transferring them on to half strength MS medium containing 60 g/l sucrose with 5 or 10 mg/l gibberellic acid (GA 3). Multiplied corms were successfully acclimatized on a medium containing soil: sand: brick pieces at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio.

40|$|Box turtle {{populations are}} under {{significant}} threat from historic and current alterations of land-use where remaining populations often occur in remnant patches of suitable habitat {{surrounded by a}} heterogeneous mixture of anthropogenically altered, unsuitable habitat. Ornate box turtles Terrapene ornata are a prairie-dependent species, are considered Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and are Endangered or Threatened within many US states. Since their range exists largely in northern latitudes, aspects of hibernacula are particularly important for winter survival. How box turtles select hibernacula within prairies is likely of great importance to better understand which microhabitats are selected for and to identify areas of suitable habitat for management purposes. Using radio telemetry in conjunction with temperature dataloggers (iButtons), we examined the phenology and thermal characteristics of box turtle hibernation, and quantified microhabitat selection of their hibernacula in remnant prairie patches. We monitored hibernation initiation/termination phenology and turtle carapace temperatures, and quantified vegetative and soil microhabitat variables of hibernacula for seven turtles in 2014 / 2015 and 18 turtles in 2015 / 2016. Box turtles initiated (descended into hibernacula) and terminated (ascended out of hibernacula) at similar time periods across two years. Although the ambient thermal environment consistently experienced temperatures below freezing, turtle hibernacula offered a buffer against those temperatures and thus the temperature of turtle carapaces never fell below freezing. Turtles selected microhabitat hibernacula with higher percentages of <b>sand,</b> <b>leaf</b> litter and bare ground, and lower percentages of clay, silt, shrubs and herbaceous ground cover. Our study suggests the phenology of box turtle hibernation may be similar across years and that hibernacula selection is driven by above- and belowground characteristics that ultimately {{lead to a more}} stable and warmer thermal environment...|$|E

Two different self-healing treatments {{were given to the}} test samples prepared from the composites. In the first treatment, a 3 mm diameter hole was drilled along the sample and a low melting point alloy (60 Sn- 40 Pb) which served as secondary reinforcing material was pierced into the hole and then heat treated at a temperature of 250 Â°C. The second treatment that was adopted involved subjecting the test samples to two-steps under-ageing treatment. The first step involved ageing at 160 Â°C for 15 minutes and quenched in water. Thereafter, the second ageing treatment {{was carried out}} at 50 Â°C for 24 h. The samples were then subjected to Charpy impact testing. The results show that the composites had lower absorbed energy compared with Al- Mg-Si alloy.

Although, the under-aged samples had a slightly higher absorbed energy in comparison with the samples containing 60 Sn- 40 Pb, the presence of silica <b>sand</b> and bamboo <b>leaf</b> ash did not have significant influence on the absorbed energy.

Amino acids were analyzed in benthic material (epilithic biofilms, <b>sand</b> sediments, <b>leaf</b> material) {{as well as in}} the flowing water (dissolved organic matter, DOM). A principal component analysis and the estimation of the amino acid degradation index (DI) elucidated differences in amino acid composition and quality among the wet-drought-wet cycle.

The highest-quality OM (high DI and high N content) occurred on epilithic biofilms and the most degraded and lowest-quality OM occurred in sandy sediments. Differences between the pre- and post-drought periods were evident in DOM quality; autochthonous-derived material was predominant during the pre-drought (wet period preceding drying), while allochthonous inputs dominated during the post-drought period (wet period following drying).

Maintaining a properly saturated solution with the correct purity is vital, especially for membrane cells. Many plants have a salt pile which is sprayed with recycled brine. Others have slurry tanks that are fed raw salt and recycled brine. The raw brine is treated with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide to precipitate calcium and magnesium. The reactions are often carried out in a series of reactors before the treated brine is sent to a large clarifier where the calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide are settled out. A floculating agent may be added just prior to the clarifier to improve settling.

Ant workers showed a clear preference for certain materials to be used as tool objects.

We evaluated {{the potential of}} a triazole fungicide, tebuconazole (TBZ), to adsorb to submerged leaves and sand and assessed TBZ effects on sand- and leaf-associated microbial communities. An indoor stream channel experiment was designed to test TBZ effects slightly above concentrations measured in agricultural streams (10. 7 Â± 0. 3 Î¼g Lâ 1) on the microbial communities associated with either submerged leaves alone, sand alone or a mixed substratum of leaves + sand over 5 weeks. Weekly samples were taken to determine TBZ effects on the biomass and activity (litter breakdown rate, fungal sporulation rate and extracellular enzyme activities) of fungi and bacteria {{as well as the}} dissipation of TBZ in stream channels. TBZ significantly reduced fungal biomass (17 â 20 % relative to controls) but increased bacterial biomass (34 â 50 %) on leaves and sand incubated separately. TBZ also significantly inhibited phenol oxidase activity (36 %) in sand but not in leaves. Differences in TBZ effects between leaves and sand communities were not explained by differences between substrata in TBZ adsorption but more likely were related to differences in biomass accrual and structure of the microbial communities. Mixing leaves+sand tended to attenuate TBZ effects on microbial communities, which was probably explained by a greater surface area available for TBZ adsorption to the substrata. This hypothesis is supported by the greater TBZ dissipation in stream channels receiving both leaves and <b>sand.</b> However, <b>leaf</b> and <b>sand</b> mixtures not only diluted but also modified TBZ effects on sand communities (14 % increase in fungal biomass and 82 % increase in the sporulation of aquatic hyphomycetes).
