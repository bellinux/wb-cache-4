5|$|Although his {{reputation}} underwent a renaissance during the Reagan administration, modern assessments of Coolidge's presidency are divided. He is adulated among advocates of <b>smaller</b> <b>government</b> and laissez-faire; supporters {{of an active}} central government generally view him less favorably, while both sides praise his stalwart support of racial equality.|$|E
5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, <b>smaller</b> <b>government,</b> and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the Ownership society, {{premised on the}} concepts of individual accountability, <b>smaller</b> <b>government,</b> and the owning of property. Critics have argued this contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis, by encouraging home ownership for those unable to afford them and insufficient regulation of financial institutions. The number of economic regulation governmental workers was increased by 91,196, whereas Bill Clinton had cut down the number by 969.|$|E
5000|$|The size of {{government}} explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism. Introduced by Patrick J. McDonald, {{the idea is that}} <b>smaller</b> <b>governments</b> are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with <b>smaller</b> <b>governments</b> more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with <b>smaller</b> <b>governments,</b> and thus [...] "capitalist" [...] economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.|$|R

He stated he entered the political arena by chance due to a local zoning dispute. Blocher joined the SVP in 1972 and became the SVP president of the SVP chapter in Meilen in 1974. After being elected to the Cantonal Council of Zürich in 1975, Blocher {{was elected to the}} Swiss National Council and represented the canton of Zürich there from 25 November 1979 until his election to the federal council on 12 December 2003 as a deputy of the Swiss People's Party (Schweizerische Volkspartei/Union démocratique du centre; SVP/UDC), and then again from 4 December 2011 to 30 May 2014.|$|E
25|$|By 1995, Ontario's {{unemployment}} rate was skyrocketing and the deficit was growing bigger, leaving most people {{convinced that the}} government of Bob Rae had become ineffective. Commentators predicted an easy win for Lyn McLeod's Liberals, but the resurgent Progressive Conservative Party of Mike Harris, which had been reduced to third-party status since the 1987 election, made a comeback and won a majority. Macleod alienated voters by flip-flopping on campaign issues such as civil unions for same-sex couples. Towards the end of the campaign, the Liberals attempted to copy many Tory policies. Mike Harris, on the other hand campaigned on a controversial, but straightforward agenda known as the Common Sense Revolution, promising to solve Ontario's economic woes and problems with lower taxation, <b>smaller</b> <b>government</b> and pro-business policies to create jobs. He also campaigned as a populist, which gave him the support of several working-class ridings that normally voted NDP. The 1995 election gave the PC Party a large majority, bringing the Tories back into power, however not under their traditional centrist or Red Tory agenda.|$|E

500|$|After leaving office, Reagan {{became an}} iconic {{influence}} within the Republican party. His policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by Republican presidential candidates since 1988. The 2008 Republican presidential candidates were no exception, for they aimed to liken themselves to {{him during the}} primary debates, even imitating his campaign strategies. Republican nominee John McCain frequently said that he came to office as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution."

500|$|In February 2006, Willis {{appeared}} in Manhattan {{to talk about}} his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a <b>smaller</b> <b>government,</b> I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican." ...|$|E
500|$|Thatcher and {{her party}} had {{supported}} British {{membership of the}} EC in the 1975 national referendum, but she believed {{that the role of}} the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC's approach was at odds with her views on <b>smaller</b> <b>government</b> and deregulation. Her opposition to further European integration became more pronounced during her premiership and particularly after her third election victory in 1987. During a 1988 speech in Bruges she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community (EC), forerunner of the European Union, for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making. She said: [...] "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels." ...|$|E

500|$|Jacobitism was revived by the unpopularity of the union. In 1708 James Francis Edward Stuart, {{the son of}} James VII, {{who became}} known as [...] "The Old Pretender", {{attempted}} an invasion with a French fleet carrying 6,000 men, but the Royal Navy prevented it from landing troops. A more serious attempt occurred in 1715, soon {{after the death of}} Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian king, the eldest son of Sophie, as George I of Great Britain. This rising (known as The 'Fifteen) envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales, Devon, and Scotland. However, government arrests forestalled the southern ventures. In Scotland, John Erskine, Earl of Mar, nicknamed Bobbin' John, raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier. Mar captured Perth, but let a <b>smaller</b> <b>government</b> force under the Duke of Argyll hold the Stirling plain. Part of Mar's army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the Battle of Preston, surrendering on 14 November 1715. The day before, Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. At this point, James belatedly landed in Scotland, but was advised that the cause was hopeless. He fled back to France. An attempted Jacobite invasion with Spanish assistance in 1719 met with little support from the clans and ended in defeat at the Battle of Glen Shiel.|$|E

2500|$|Mailer {{held the}} rare {{position}} that the Cold War was not a positive ideal for America. [...] It allowed the State to become strong and invested in {{the daily lives of}} the people. [...] He critiqued conservative politics as they, specifically Barry Goldwater, supported the Cold War which called for an increase in government spending and oversight. [...] This, Mailer argued, stood in opposition with conservative principles like lower taxes, and <b>smaller</b> <b>government.</b> [...] He believed that conservatives were pro-Cold War because that was politically relevant to them and would therefore help them win.|$|E

2500|$|Supply-side {{economics}} {{is a school}} of macroeconomic thought that argues that overall economic well-being is maximized by lowering the barriers to producing goods and services (the [...] "Supply Side" [...] of the economy). By lowering such barriers, consumers are thought to benefit from a greater supply {{of goods and services}} at lower prices. Typical supply-side policy would advocate generally lower income tax and capital gains tax rates (to increase the supply of labor and capital), <b>smaller</b> <b>government</b> and a lower regulatory burden on enterprises (to lower costs). Although tax policy is often mentioned in relation to supply-side economics, supply-side economists are concerned with all impediments to the supply of goods and services and not just taxation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{party was}} {{generally}} considered {{to be part of the}} Christian right. Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the Pentecostal church in South Australia, and nationally from smaller Christian denominations. Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-Liberals via Robert Brokenshire and Bob Day. Originally advocating a moral and family values agenda, Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to begin to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and <b>smaller</b> <b>government,</b> which brought Family First closer to Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives. Day's High Court Senate disqualification and protracted personal and business financial crisis impoverished Family First. Family First and their two state incumbents merged in to Bernardi's Conservatives in April 2017.|$|E
