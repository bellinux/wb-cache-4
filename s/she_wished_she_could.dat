500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Robbins as [...] "confident", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "cheerful". Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The {{relationship between the two}} is referred to by fans by the portmanteau [...] "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, {{due to a lack of}} chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: [...] "They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them." [...] Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have found Callie a love interest that [...] "sparkled" [...] sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{released}} two {{highly successful}} albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions (1991), the singer {{had yet to}} embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of [...] "Someday", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back {{to give it a}} rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> [...] "delete some of the overproduction," [...] which is why she decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. In addition to MTV Unplugged, the song was included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, Number 1 to Infinity (2015–17).|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 2007, Morissette {{released}} a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection [...] "My Humps", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied {{only by a}} piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively {{with a group of}} men and hits the ones who attempt to touch her [...] "lady lumps", had received 16,465,653 views on February 15, 2009. Morissette did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy [...] "Fergie" [...] Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her latest album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do a simple song like [...] "My Humps" [...] in a conversation with Guy Sigsworth and the joke just took {{a life of its own}} when they started working on it.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the most}} notable {{influencer}} for Wolfe was Michael Crichton. Wolfe admires Crichton’s versatile talent and acute, analytical mind. <b>She</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have had the privilege to meet Crichton before his untimely death.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's head {{man at the}} Tappit Hen public now," [...] {{answered}} Tommy; [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{find out}} where Jean Myles bides, so as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> write and {{tell her that she}} is grand too, and has six hair-bottomed chairs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although she {{supports}} her husbands mission <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have {{her family in}} tact. After Abir was kidnapped and injured, Nassrin refuses to speak with Taufiq and demands that she go see her daughter in Israel, no matter what others will think.|$|R
6000|$|Her feet {{upon the}} mossy track [...] The married maiden set: [...] That moment--I have heard her say-- [...] 250 [...] <b>She</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "I love you!" [...] she cried. <b>She</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{have remembered}} his first name. It would have rounded off the {{sentence}} neatly. In such {{a moment she}} could hardly call him [...] "Mr. Peters." [...] "You are the only man I love." ...|$|E
6000|$|After Pansy {{had been}} led away, she found Lord Warburton drawing near her again. She rested {{her eyes on}} him steadily; <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sound his thoughts. But he had no {{appearance}} of confusion. [...] "She has promised to dance with me later," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} stanza Elizabeth asks for less intense {{feelings}}, saying <b>she</b> is fragile. <b>She</b> <b>wishes</b> Anjou were less nice so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get over her feelings more easily. The fourth line means either that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel good or bad, which {{would seem to}} contradict the first line, or that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> show (and vent) these feelings properly, or perhaps that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel one extreme or the other, rather than both at once: high OR low. Finally, she says if she cannot be happier, {{she would like to}} die so that thoughts of love no longer trouble her. She doubts she will ever be fulfilled in terms of love. Whether she really wanted to die or said that for dramatic effect is unclear, and of course the overall sincerity of the poem is also unclear.|$|R
50|$|La Wally {{returns to}} her home. The anger she felt has now {{subsided}} and <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take back her words. At that moment {{there is a knock}} at her door. It is Gellner, who describes how under cover of darkness he was able to set upon Hagenbach and hurl him into a deep ravine.|$|R
50|$|Sofia's {{faith in}} her society begins to waver when she {{encounters}} {{a gang of}} 21st century astronauts who are still attached {{to the idea of}} love, lust and family. Sofia eventually sacrifices herself to save the Shaft (with Mika in it) and the Bilkis, but confesses to Mika before <b>she</b> dies that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have been a mother.|$|R
60|$|The clear waves {{seemed to}} invite her: <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lie {{down to sleep}} on them and pass from sleep into death. But Romola could not {{directly}} seek death; the fulness of young life in her forbade that. She could only wish that death would come.|$|E
60|$|And she lay face {{downwards}} on the downs, {{that were}} so strong, that cared only for their intercourse with the everlasting skies, and <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become a strong mound smooth under the sky, bosom and limbs bared to all winds and clouds and bursts of sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} nice of you, Rose," [...] she said, and they walked off together. She talked about the flowers in the grass, and Rose ran to and fro, {{climbing}} fences to pick all sorts that she knew. She did not laugh when the teacher told her the botanical names. <b>She</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember them.|$|E
50|$|Damon {{goes into}} the house to compel Jeremy while Elena tells Stefan that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> forget {{everything}} as well, even meeting him, but she cannot because {{she does not want}} to forget how she feels about him. Damon comes back informing that he has done what Elena asked. Elena goes back into the house leaving the two brothers alone staring at each other.|$|R
50|$|Belinda {{suffers from}} {{conflicting}} emotions. Part of her wishes to be normal, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be carefree {{and spend time}} with Garrett, for whom she has a tender spot in her heart. However, for the most part, she is just as ruthless and cruel as her father. Although she confesses to Garrett often that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{get rid of this}} part of herself, she knows well enough that she never will.|$|R
50|$|Veola is {{the owner}} of the magic shop in Kavoc. She is a very taciturn and {{reserved}} girl, bordering on anti-social, but as the game progresses she starts to open up more and becomes good friends with Klein and his crew, though <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be more than friends with Klein. Because of this, she also develops a not-so-friendly rivalry with Lita over winning Klein over, but they eventually become good friends.|$|R
6000|$|John kept {{trotting}} up and slapping {{down in her}} lap {{grass or}} dead leaves which he called [...] "tea," [...] and she arranged them methodically but absent-mindedly, laying the flowery heads of the grasses together, thinking how Archer had been awake again last night; the church clock was ten or thirteen minutes fast; <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> buy Garfit's acre.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt this}} night and {{prospect}} mournfully lovely. <b>She</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be happy; <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> know inward peace; she wondered Providence had no pity on her, {{and would not}} help or console her. Recollections of happy trysts of lovers, commemorated in old ballads, returned on her mind; she thought such tryst in such scene would be blissful. Where now was Robert? she asked. Not at the Hollow; she had watched for his lamp long, and had not seen it. She questioned within herself whether she and Moore were ever destined to meet and speak again. Suddenly the door within the stone porch of the hall opened, and two men came out--one elderly and white-headed, the other young, dark-haired, and tall. They passed across the lawn, out through a portal in the garden wall. Caroline saw them cross the road, pass the stile, descend the fields; she saw them disappear. Robert Moore had passed before her with his friend Mr. Yorke. Neither had seen her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! grow not jealous {{before there}} is need, Olaf. She {{made no mention}} of the name of our future divine master, for whosoever can rule Irene, if such a one lives, will {{certainly}} rule us also. All she said was that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find some man to guide, guard and comfort her, who grew lonely amidst many troubles, and hoped for more sons than Constantine." ...|$|E
5000|$|Back in Brooklyn, Daniel and Betty {{manage to}} lose the paparazzi {{on the streets and}} duck into a cozy pizza restaurant. Betty tells Daniel that he is a much better person now because he was ready to put his heart out there for the real thing (Sofia). <b>She</b> says <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel that way. Daniel says it's obvious that Henry is really into her. Daniel then freaks out as Betty drags him up onstage to sing karaoke. She insists they have to because the price is half off if you sing. Although Daniel protests, [...] "But I'm rich," [...] they head up and do a {{rendition}} of “I Got You Babe” and look like they're having fun.|$|R
50|$|Clara {{is ready}} to embrace her {{childhood}} fantasies and her beloved companion, but sadly refuses; <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but the adventures of growing up and her family {{are still waiting for}} her. The dolls start to turn back into inanimate toys, and a dying Mouse King suddenly arrives for one last chance at revenge. The Nutcracker tries to save her, but slowly turns back into a toy himself. Clara tries to keep the Mouse King at bay, but he corners her on a balcony.|$|R
50|$|Cornelia, {{the main}} {{character}} of this book and the narrator, is the assumed daughter of the artist Rembrandt. All her life <b>she</b> tells, how <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{have some of the}} things the richer kids could get, for example, she tells her friend that she has an ivory doll, but she really doesn’t. She gets the taste of engaging with the higher class when a young, handsome man, Carel, starts to talk and visit her. She also has better skills for painting than her brother Titus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] he ejaculated quickly. But he had understood. His eyes shone weirdly on her. She {{felt the}} strange terror and loveliness of his passion. And <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lie down there by that town gate, in the sun, and swoon for ever unconscious. Living {{was almost too}} great a demand on her. His yellow, {{luminous}} eyes watched her and enveloped her. There was nothing for her but to yield, yield, yield. And yet she could not sink to earth.|$|E
60|$|The {{grasp on}} her hand became compelling, and she moved her foot from the stirrup as the man's arm reached upwards towards her waist. Had <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have helped herself; as she slipped from the saddle the arm closed round her and it was several seconds before she and Grant stood a pace apart, with {{tingling}} blood, looking at one another. There {{was no sign of}} Flora Schuyler, they were alone, enfolded in the silence of the bluff.|$|E
60|$|She knew, vaguely, {{that all}} the time he was not satisfied, all the time he was trying to force {{something}} from her. Ah, how <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> succeed with him, in her own way! He was there, so inevitable. She lived in him also. And how she wanted to be at peace with him, at peace. She loved him. She would give him love, pure love. With a strange, rapt look in her face, she awaited his homecoming that night.|$|E
40|$|Matilda {{is expecting}} that the Moore's {{will start to}} be on their way to see her. She {{received}} news from Tobe and Florence. They keep on moving. She talks about the weather and the state of the crops. Dinkie writes about picking blackberries and catching geese with Birdie, Bessie, and Mattie. Bettie got a new dress. <b>She</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see Mary, but she moved too far away. Birdie would write, but is busy playing. She asks that they come quickly, she wants to see them...|$|R
5000|$|She {{insists that}} Nina undress and places the sari on her. The Contessa then cuts Nina's long, {{dark hair and}} puts makeup on her and {{transforms}} the maid into a beautiful woman. Nina tells the Contessa <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be just like her, but the Contessa says that is a silly desire. While listening to the Contessa's stories, Nina imagines herself living out the Contessa's existence, triggering a series of fantasy sequences, all set in elaborate settings such as casinos and Venetian palazzos.|$|R
50|$|During summertime, Meribella, {{a magical}} kingdom, {{is going to}} have its five {{hundredth}} anniversary. Princess Tori and her younger sisters Meredith and Trevi are very busy, having to attend ceremonies and balls, and always be poised and proper. The princesses think it is hard work. Whenever they have the chance, they sneak away and play together. Before Meribella's five hundredth anniversary, the princesses have to greet royal visitors, who come to Meribella for the occasion. Tori <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have an exciting, music-filled life like her favorite popstar, Keira. <b>She</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> watch Keira performing near her palace.|$|R
6000|$|Gwendolen {{was very}} much pleased, on one account, and a little the other way in another; pleased with the new clothes and the {{improvement}} which they had achieved; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole. Yesterday's pink had hardly interested her; this one was just like it, but somehow it had got her immediate attention, and kept it. <b>She</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think of some way of getting at its history in a properly colorless and indifferent way. Presently she made a venture. She said: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kendal {{gave his}} arm to Mrs. Meadows, saying gravely that Lucy must not be {{encouraged}} in her habit of gossiping and inaccuracy. Mrs. Meadows quite agreed with him, {{it was a very}} bad habit for a girl, she was very sorry for it, <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have attended to the dear children better, but she was sure dear Mrs. Kendal would make them everything desirable. She only hoped that she would remember their disadvantages, have patience, and not recollect this against poor Lucy.|$|E
60|$|Marian was not up {{much later}} than usual the next morning, {{but she had}} a long time to wait {{for the rest of the}} party. She read, wrote, drew, tried to busy herself as usual all the morning, but whether it was that she was tired with her ball, or that she was anxious about Caroline, she did not prosper very much, and grew restless and dissatisfied. She wished she knew whether she had done right, <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel that she had been kind and accommodating.|$|E
50|$|A very warm-hearted woman, she {{is always}} there for Betty, very proud of her, and is always willing to help with her problems. Still, she hopes that Betty will {{eventually}} outgrow her tomboy phase and embrace some of Veronica's more desirable traits (though Betty does have several traditionally feminine interests). In later years, it is implied that Alice works, but this has not really been explored. She secretly envies the Lodge wealth a little, mainly because <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> afford to buy Betty the nice things the Lodges buy for Veronica.|$|R
50|$|It is Halloween and Officer Patrick Flanagan finds a {{discarded}} Raggedy Ann {{and decides}} {{that it will}} make a good present for Billie, the blind daughter of the pretty Mrs. Davis whom Flanagan fancies. When Billie receives Raggedy Ann she is very thankful but <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see Ann. Raggedy Ann tells her that she can see her through her imagination. Billie imagines a fantastic voyage where she and Ann travel through a carnevalesque land based on the real world but run by Mr. Giuseppe the calliope player.|$|R
