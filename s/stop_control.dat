25|$|Un{{controlled}} and yield (give way) controlled intersections require large sight triangles {{clear of}} obstructions {{in order to}} operate safely. At uncontrolled intersections, the basic right-of-way rules apply (either yield to the vehicle on the right, or the boulevard rule, depending on the location). Vehicle drivers {{must be able to}} see traffic approaching on the intersecting road at a point where they can adjust their speed, or stop if need be, to yield to the other traffic before reaching the intersection. It isn't the only criterion for allowing these types of intersection control. Changing an intersection to <b>stop</b> <b>control</b> is a common response to poor safety performance.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} two {{new types}} of deterministic optimal <b>stopping</b> <b>control</b> problems: optimal <b>stopping</b> <b>control</b> with hard terminal constraints only and opti-mal <b>stopping</b> <b>control</b> with both minimum control effort And hard termind constraints. Both problems are ini-tially formulated in continuous-time (a discretetime formulation is given {{towards the end of}} the paper) and soIutions given via dynamic programming. A numeric solution to the continuous-time dynamic programming equations is then briefly discussed. The optimal stopping with terminal constraints prob-lem in continuous-time is a natural description of a par-ticular type of missile guidance problem. This missile guidance appiication is introduced and the presented solutions used in missile engagements against targets. ...|$|R

500|$|Puzzling {{features}} of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard. Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced. The keyboard, which is largely original, is [...] "unique in construction", with [...] "square ivory buttons" [...] with round lathe-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is [...] "practical and convenient" [...] they are spaced such that [...] "it {{is almost impossible to}} stretch the hand to play an octave". The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys. The two <b>stop</b> <b>control</b> knobs for the organ are located, [...] "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles. The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V video of a recent performance.|$|E

5000|$|In modern organ building, an {{accepted}} standardized scheme {{is used for}} the layout of the stops and pistons on the console.

50|$|The {{operation}} of a tubular-pneumatic organ is accomplished by a change of air pressure within lead tubes of about 1/4 in inside diameter that connect the organ's console to its windchest.

5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no <b>stop</b> <b>controls.</b> Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk. Around 1450, controls were designed that allowed {{the ranks of the}} Blockwerk to be played individually. These devices were the forerunners of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|R
5000|$|In any organ, each pipe has a valve {{located at}} its foot which {{responds}} to the organist's commands from the console's keyboard, pedalboard and <b>stop</b> <b>controls.</b> These valves are contained in windchests upon which the organ's pipework is set. Any type of apparatus that connects an organ's console with its windchest {{is referred to as}} its [...] "action".

50|$|According to {{researcher}} and writer Atul Gawande, {{the concept of}} a pre-flight checklist was first introduced by management and engineers at Boeing Corporation following the 1935 crash of the prototype Boeing B-17 (then known as the Model 299) at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, killing both pilots. Investigation found that the pilots had forgotten to disengage the crucial gust locks (devices which <b>stop</b> <b>control</b> surfaces moving in the wind while parked) prior to take-off. Life magazine published the resulting lengthy and detailed B-17 checklist in its 24 August 1942 issue.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} for operating the stops varies widely, but {{the principle is}} the same: the <b>stop</b> <b>control</b> at the console allows the organist to select which ranks of pipes will sound when a key is pressed. When the organist desires a rank to sound, he or she operates the corresponding control at the console, allowing wind to flow to the pipes. Likewise, the organist can deny wind to the pipes by operating the same control in the opposite direction. Common stop controls include stop knobs, which {{move in and out}} of the console, and stop tabs, which toggle back and forth in position.|$|E
50|$|The {{pipe organ}} is played {{from an area}} called the console or keydesk, which holds the manuals (keyboards), pedals, and <b>stop</b> <b>controls.</b> In electric-action organs, the console is often movable. This allows for greater {{flexibility}} in placement of the console for various activities. Some very large organs, such as the van den Heuvel organ at the Church of St. Eustache in Paris, {{have more than one}} console, enabling the organ to be played from several locations depending {{on the nature of the}} performance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to designing the organ, Harris and McDonough installed each pipe, all compressed air lines, and each windchest, restoring existing ones and constructing new ones, as required. Several miles of electrical wire were installed to connect each pipe valve to the relay system, which is {{operated by the}} <b>stop</b> <b>controls</b> on the console. Damaged pipes were repaired as needed. Finally, each pipe was [...] "voiced", which is the fine tuning of volume, pitch, brilliance, speech, and other tonal characteristics.|$|R
