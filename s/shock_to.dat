40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{purpose of}} this paper is to identify the nature of impulse mechanism, from which random <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> general price and income levels are generated. In recent business cycle literature, it is generally accepted that business cycles are triggered by random productivity and technology shocks. However, this approach can not explain the current degree of volatility of business cycle fluctuations. Especially, New Keynesian economists emphasized the influence of demand shocks under the assumption of nominal and real rigidities and some other market imperfections. Therefore, it is convenient to identify whether the <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the general prices and national income are on demand or supply side. It is shown in the paper that between the first quarter of 1987 and the fourth quarter of 2003 in Turkey, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> national income are mostly composed of <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> demand factors. On the other hand, the <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> cost factors influence the <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> general price level more frequently than <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> demand factors. ...|$|R

40|$|The tug-o-war for {{supremacy}} between ination targeting {{and monetary}} tar-geting {{is a classic}} yet timely topic in monetary economics. In this paper, we revisit this question {{within the context of}} a pure-exchange overlapping genera-tions model of money where spatial separation and random relocation create an endogenous demand for money. We distinguish between <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> real output and <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the real interest rate. Both <b>shocks</b> are assumed <b>to</b> follow AR(1) processes. Irrespective of the nature of shocks, the optimal ination target is always positive. Under monetary targeting, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> endowment require neg-ative money growth rates, while under <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> real interest rates it may be either positive or negative depending on the elasticity of consumption substi-tution. Also, monetary targeting welfare-dominates ination targeting but the gap between the two vanishes as the shock process approaches a random walk. In sharp contrast, for <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the real interest rate, we prove that monetary targeting and ination targeting are welfare-equivalent only in the limit whe...|$|R
