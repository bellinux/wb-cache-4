40|$|The report {{presents}} a concept for an economically efficient district heating grid for Neubrandenburg {{which is based}} on the existing supply systems. Its main section {{presents a}}n analysis of the grid hydraulics and of the technical systems available for heat distribution. Neubrandenburg has both steam and hot water <b>grids.</b> However, most <b>steam</b> <b>grids</b> are currently being shut down or converted into hot water grids, so that they are left out of account in this long-term sanitation concept. The hot water grid of Neubrandenburg comprises primary and secondary grids. The latter, with few exceptions, are connected to the primary grid via heat exchanger stations. This grid structure, with its hydraulic separation of primary and secondary grids, is prevalent in East Germany, so that the present sanitation concept is also applicable to many other supply grids in East Germany.

40|$|Rönnskärverken {{is part of}} Boliden Mineral AB and {{is located}} on the coast outside of Skellefteå. Rönnskär {{receives}} raw materials from mines and electronic scrap to produce mainly copper, but also gold, silver, zinc and lead. In addition byproducts of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid are produced from the metal production. Besides this waste heat from processes is collected and produces steam and district heating. The steam is used to keeping boilers warm and in certain processes and production of district heating for local heating at Rönnskärsverken and consumers in Skelleftehamn and Ursviken. In the current situation waste heat from some processes is used and in addition to these, there are additional sources of heat that can be taken advantage of. Among these are the waste heat in a chimney connected to the sulfuric acid production and a cooler linked to the sea. This report deals with an investigation of the effect on Rönnskär’s steam- and district heating grid that a temperature increase on the produced district heating provides. The effects of two proposals on the utilization of the waste heat from a chimney tied to the sulfuric acid production and a proposal with the use of water vapor from the <b>steam</b> <b>grid</b> were investigated and compared economically. The investigation showed that one of the proposals, which uses waste heat from the chimney and a reduction in thermal cooling of heat with sea water, is of the examined proposals more advantageous from a financial perspective. This proposal corresponds to a saving of approximately 681 m 3 oil of the type fuel oil 5 per year and is calculated to repay its investment cost within 6 months.

5000|$|The game {{presents}} the action from a top-down perspective. Players explore 25 procedurally-generated levels, looking on each level for treasure, a lever {{to unlock the}} stairs to the next level, and then the stairs themselves. At the same time the player tries to avoid harmful <b>spike</b> and <b>steam</b> traps. [...] Players are asked to manage three statistics: Dodge, representing their ability to avoid damage from traps; Detect, representing their ability to discern hidden traps; and Disable, representing their ability to disarm traps to proceed past them. Players also collect health tonics, which can be consumed to restore life energy, and disposable tools, which can be used to disarm traps, as well as a range of equipment which can be used to boost {{some or all of the}} three statistics. Gold can also be found, which serves no purpose during the game but acts as a scoring mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of soil compaction caused by tractor wheel traffic on the limiting water range (LLWR), shoot growth and levels of compaction and four replications in a completely randomized experimental design. Soil samples with preserved structure were collected in the layers: 0. 02 - 0. 05; 0. 08 - 0. 11; 0. 15 - 0. 18 and 0. 22 - 0. 25 m to determine macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density, resistance to penetration and LLWR. The evaluated corn parameters were: plant and first <b>spike</b> height, <b>steam</b> diameter, number of spikes per plant, plant dry matter, dry matter of 1000 seeds and seed productivity. The soil compaction restricted all corn parameters except the number of spikes per plant and dry matter of 1000 seeds. The LLWR was reduced by the soil resistance to penetration, even in the tilled soil with bulk density of 1. 12 Mg m- 3. Only the treatment with 11 Mg tractor, repeated four times on the area, demonstrated bulk density above critical bulk density in the LLWR that was 1. 37 Mg m- 3, where the seed productivity was significantly smaller...|$|R

5000|$|The Coats Steamer was an American steam {{automobile}} promotion by George A. Coats. A corporation {{was formed}} and perhaps two prototypes were assembled. Five incrementally different designs were described. The first was by a [...] "Norwegian engineer" [...] and used two three-cylinder radial engines {{on the rear}} axle, one powering each wheel. The second was by James Yeikichi Sakuyama, for years an engine designer at Indianapolis, with a V-3 engine, gearbox and cast <b>grid</b> <b>steam</b> generator. It was quickly changed to a fire tube steam generator and inline-3 cylinder engine flat in the chassis. The fourth design took that Sakuyama chassis and engine and replaced the steam system in late 1923 with Charles A. French's patent design. The French-Coats was technically the most superior, probably {{the most likely to}} have been functional, and the car used in photographs. The fifth design was simply the chassis of Purdue professor Allen C. Staley, shown as a high grade Coats steam car at three shows. The car price remained the same at $1085 throughout the promotion, and dealerships and distributorships were sold to finance the development and sales effort. Eventually Coats obtained the confidence of Y. F. Stewart who had manufacturing facilities. A pickle factory in Bowling Green, Ohio was obtained and a defunct coachbuilder's factory in Columbus, Ohio was purchased. The Cumberland tire company was shown in advertisements as a third factory, as they were to be the tire supplier. All was gone by mid 1924 when the Columbus plant was sold. Coats went on to many enthusiastic promotions including road building equipment in 1924 in New Jersey and inadvertently became one of the creators of the syndicate which quickly became CBS. He stayed in radio promotion in New York City and was buried in the family cemetery in Indiana.|$|R
2500|$|On 16 June Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) {{submitted}} a competing proposal in which Siemens would acquire Alstom's gas turbine activities for €3.9 billion and MHI would form {{joint ventures with}} Alstom, acquiring 40, 20 and 20% stakes in Alstom's steam and nuclear, electrical grid, and hydroelectric businesses respectively, for €3.1billion. The proposal included an additional offer to acquire a further 10% stake from shareholder Bouygues and the option to form a joint venture in rail transport. On 19 June, GE revised its bid, valuing the assets at the same price, but with a lower cash transaction value. [...] The revised bid proposed to form a 50:50 joint venture combining GE's and Alstom's renewable and electric grid business, and a 50:50 joint venture in Alstom's steam turbine and nuclear power business. GE also announced a memorandum of understanding between the two firms in the rail transport sector, where GE would sell its rail signalling business to Alstom. On 20 June, Siemens and MHI modified their offer, with MHI increasing its stake in Alstom's <b>steam,</b> hydro, and <b>grid</b> businesses to 40% in all three (total €3.9billion), and with Siemens increasing its offer by €400million to €4.3billion. Subsequently, Economy minister Arnaud Montebourg stated he would block both bids, but stated the French government was now backing the GE offer, and had given GE additional specifications regarding commitments and guarantees. It also announced it intended to take two thirds of Bouygues' shareholding (20%). [...] The Alstom board met {{the next day and}} backed GE's revised bid. On 22 June, the French state agreed terms with Bouygues, enabling the purchase of part of their shareholding in Alstom, taking a 20% stake in [...] Alstom from Bouygues before payment, with an agreement to buy the shares at a 2–5% discount on a value of a minimum of ≈€35 per share. Analysts commented Bouygues would be under pressure to make a deal with the state in order to gain positive political capital due to regulation issues the company was facing in the French telecoms sector.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{data were}} {{collected}} and visualized to characterize the 3 -dimensional patchiness of zooplankton at a thermally stratified site on Georges Bank. The work was carried out {{as part of a}} field study conducted {{to examine the effects of}} springtime water-column stratification on the distributions of zooplankton and larval fish on the Bank. The acoustic data were acquired as the ship <b>steamed</b> a survey <b>grid</b> relative to the track of a surface drifter with a subsurface drogue. Although quite irregular in geographical coordinate space, the ship's track relative to the moving water closely matched the intended grid pattern once the drifter's movement in the tidal flow was taken into account. After changing coordinate systems to compensate for tidal advection, the acoustic data set was transformed from its curtain-like distribution in 3 -dimensional space to a volumetric distribution. Two-dimensional point kriging was performed on the irregularly spaced data from each 2 -m-thick depth stratum to produce a series of 2 -dimensional, regularly spaced data grids. These data grids were then stacked to construct the 3 -dimensional data grid required for volumetric visualization. A similar procedure was followed with the error variance values produced at each grid point through kriging to construct a three-dimensional, volumetric distribution of the error variance. To examine zooplankton patchiness within the surveyed volume of water, isosurfaces corresponding to specific levels of acoustic backscatter were highlighted in the visualization. The 3 -dimensional distribution of error variance was used to control the opacity of the isosurfaces to provide an objective, visual approach for displaying the statistical confidence one can have in the patches detected. In this survey, the ship steamed directly over a large, southwest- to northeast-oriented patch of zooplankton on at least three different passes. It also steamed over several smaller patches. The vertically compressed nature of the patches and their high degree of spatial heterogeneity in the horizontal plane are characteristic of the zooplankton distributions found in the deeper, seasonally stratified portions of Georges Bank...|$|R
40|$|A {{high demand}} of both {{electricity}} and heat exists in Arizona Chemical (a chemical plant dedicated to the distillation of Crude Tall Oil) for production processes. Due to {{the rising cost of}} resources and electricity, more and more companies are trying to decrease the energy expenses to increase their competitiveness in a global market, thus increasing their profit. Some companies look at their energy consumption in order to diminish it or to explore the opportunity to generate their own and cheaper energy. In companies where the production of steam already takes place, cogeneration can be a good solution to palliate the cost of the energy used. This study addresses this issue through three actions such as the characterization of the boiler, a better <b>steam</b> flow measurement <b>grid</b> and the generation of electricity. The first one addresses the state of one of the key parts of steam production, the boiler, through the calculation of its efficiency with two different methods (direct and indirect calculation). These methods require some measurements which were provided afterwards by the company supervisor. This will allow the company to identify the weaknesses of the boiler to be able to improve it in the future. The second one aims to improve the knowledge about the steam system. New flow measurement points were suggested after doing an analysis of the current controlled flows to have a better overview outline of the steam use. The third one studies the generation of electricity with a Rankine cycle. The limitations in the characteristics of the steam were identified and different configurations are proposed in accordance to the restrictions identified. An efficiency of 93 % is obtained for the boiler with the direct method and 82. 3 % for the indirect one. The difference between them {{can be explained by the}} use of datafrom different time frames for both methods. The main contributors to the losses are the ones related to the dry flue gas and the hydrogen in the fuel. In the current status only 40 % of the steam flows are identified, a number which is expected to raise with the new measurement points. It was not possible to estimate the effect of the new points due to the desire of the company to not disturb the current production. Due to the fuel price the production of steam for only electricity was not profitable and instead the generation of both {{electricity and heat}} from the same steam is proposed. This integrated system is now possible to implement due to its low payback time (2. 3 years). This solution can generate 758 kW of electricity and provide the company with 6437 MWh of electricity each year. Then, the effect of the variation of different variables over the performance of the cycle were studied: different electricity prices, steam rate production, fuel cost and the state of the condensate recovery were discussed. The variation of both the condensate recovery and fuel cost did not affect the payback time due to their costs being neutralised by the revenues obtained from them. The variation of the electricity prices and steam production affects the payback but due to the high revenue that is expected it does not hamper the good nature of the investment. The generation of electricity is recommended due to the low payback time obtained. The different variations studied in the system did not change the payback time notably and showed that the investment is highly profitable in all the scenarios considered. The use of two smaller turbines instead of the one chosen (with a maximum rated power of 6 MW while only 758 kW is generated with the proposed solution) should be studied since the turbines would work closer to their maximum efficiency...|$|R
