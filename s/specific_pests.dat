30|$|Crop is an {{essential}} part of the human food resources for sustainable development. Therefore, crop yields directly affect social and economic development as well as social stability. In recent years, in order to improve the yield of crops and meet the needs of human survival, people used a lot of pesticide [1 – 4] to keep pest down to improve the yield of crops, but the excessive use of pesticides will make the pests drug-resistant, pollute the environment, and also do some harm to people and animals. So how to reduce the effect caused by pests but doing no harm to the living environment of human beings and animals is an issue which has attracted extensive concern of ecologists and biomathematics researchers.
