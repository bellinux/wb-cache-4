50|$|The {{scientific}} method is iterative. At any stage {{it is possible}} to refine its accuracy and precision, so that some consideration will lead the <b>scientist</b> <b>to</b> repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a <b>scientist</b> <b>to</b> re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a <b>scientist</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject.|$|R

5|$|Steorn {{challenged}} {{the scientific community}} to investigate their claim and, in December 2006, said that it had chosen a jury of <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> do so. In June 2009 the jury gave its unanimous verdict that Steorn had not demonstrated the production of energy.|$|E

5|$|The raid {{was entirely}} successful. The {{airborne}} troops suffered relatively few casualties, and {{the pieces of}} the radar they brought back, along with a captured German radar technician, allowed British <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures to neutralise them.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> suggest that the toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|Again {{working with}} Johnston, Alvarez's last {{task for the}} Manhattan Project {{was to develop a}} set of {{calibrated}} microphone/transmitters to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> calculate the bomb's energy. He observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> study entire populations in the wild.|$|E

5|$|During World War II he {{returned}} to active duty as Groves' executive officer in the Operations Branch of the Construction Division under the Office of the Quartermaster General. He went to the China-Burma-India theater to help build the Ledo Road. In January 1945, Groves chose Farrell as his second-in-command of the Manhattan Project. Farrell observed the Trinity test at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range with J. Robert Oppenheimer. In August 1945, he went to Tinian to supervise the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Afterwards he led teams of <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> inspect {{the effects of the}} atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed <b>scientists</b> <b>to</b> monitor volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
