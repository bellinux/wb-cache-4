40|$|High-protein {{nutrition}} (HPN) bars (≥ 30 % protein) {{have limited}} shelf life and become excessively hard during storage. Various mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain the hardening. The objectives of this research were to investigate the chemistry of HPN bar hardening and propose solutions for slowing it and improving bar texture. In phase 1, HPN bars were made containing 34 % whey protein isolate (WPI) or milk protein concentrate (MPC) powder, along with either <b>sorbitol</b> <b>syrup</b> or glycerol, and vegetable shortening or cocoa butter. Substituting MPC for WPI made the bars brittle and crumbly. Using glycerol initially made bars softer but accelerated hardening. Cocoa butter increased bar hardness because of its higher solid to liquid content. Most water (~ 99 %) in HPN bars made using <b>sorbitol</b> <b>syrup</b> is present as bound water, with ~ 0. 9 % as intermediate water and ~ 0. 1 % as bulk water. During storage bound water increased ~ 0. 02 g/ 100 g of solids while intermediate water decreased, suggesting changes in state of water taking place at protein surfaces. During storage, there were changes in protein conformation indicated by an increase (~ 4 °C) in heat denaturation temperature of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin and a 15 to 40 % decrease in denaturation enthalpy. In phase 2, various bar formulations were tested involving different proportions of proteins, lactose, glycerol, and <b>sorbitol</b> <b>syrup,</b> as well as type of lipid component, and disulfide bonds inhibition. Decreases in bar hardening occurred when MPC and WPI and <b>sorbitol</b> <b>syrup</b> and glycerol were used in combination. In phase 3, HPN bars made with 38 % protein powder as a 50 : 50 combinations of WPI and MPC and with 20 % of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>syrup</b> substituted with glycerol, had good texture and minimal hardening during storage. Bar hardening was not caused by phase separation of protein and sorbitol, Maillard browning, or formation of inter-molecular disulfide bonds. Minimizing bar hardening requires prevention of entropy-induced protein aggregation by masking hydrophobic regions on protein surfaces and preventing formation of extended protein networks. It is proposed that preferential exclusion of cosolvents causes glycerol to be oriented at protein surfaces such that its carbon backbone masks hydrophobic regions thus avoiding a decrease in entropy of water molecules.

40|$|Water {{activity}} {{reduction of}} intermediate moisture yellowstrip trevally was studied. The optimal time (8, 12, 16, 20 hrs.) for curing marinade was investigated. The effects of different humectants (glycerol, <b>sorbitol,</b> lactitol, glucose <b>syrup)</b> at 50 % w/w of curing ingredients were compared. Results showed that moisture content and water activity of cured yellowstrip trevally decreased as curing time increased (p 0. 05). However, the hardness of intermediate moisture Yellowstrip trevally, determined by texture analyzer, decreased. Hardness, shear force, L a b value of sample added with various humectants {{were lower than}} those of the control (p 0. 05). The glycerol-added samples had the highest overall acceptability score and were higher than control, whereas the glucose syrup-added samples had the lowest score. Moisture content of the samples with the addition of various humectants was higher than that of the control (18. 28 %). The samples added with glycerol retained the highest moisture (24. 94 %). The adsorption isotherm studies showed that the equilibrium moisture of sample added with glycerol was higher than that added with lactitol...|$|R

An 87 -year-old woman was hospitalized for the onset of confusion, tremors, an inability to walk, and a fever {{that she had been}} experiencing for 36 hours. She often took high dosages of lactulose and <b>sorbitol</b> <b>syrup</b> as a laxative (about 70 g/day). During her physical examination, the patient was confused, drowsy, and she presented hyposthenia in her upper and lower limbs, symmetric and diffuse moderate hyporeflexia, and her temperature was 37. 8 °C. Laboratory tests revealed severe hyponatremia with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis. Moreover, rhabdomyolysis markers were found. The correction of hydroelectrolytic imbalances with saline, potassium and sodium chlorure, calcium gluconate was the first treat-ment.
