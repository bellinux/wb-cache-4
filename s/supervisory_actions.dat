Following study by Sweneey and Boyle on Irish in 2005, junior accountants working in public accounting firms in Central Java and Yogyakarta was chosen as object of this research. Data was collected using questionnaires in 2007. Data was analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM) with the program VisualPLS (Partial Least Square) software. Findings of this research indicated that from seven hypothesis proposed, {{there is no one}} was accepted. Hypothesis 1 (there ware positive influence of leadership and mentoring on job satisfaction) hypothesis 2 (there ware negative influence of leadership and mentoring on turnover intentions), hypothesis 3 (there ware positive influence of working conditons on job satisfaction), hypothesis 4 (there ware negative influence of working conditons on turnover intentions), hypothesis 5 (there ware positive influence of work assigments on job satisfaction), hypothesis 6 (there ware negative influence of work assigments on turnover intentions) and hypothesis 7 (there ware negative influence of job satisfaction on turnover intentions) ware rejected.

Poor performance could be reflected under three main categories, such as employee availability, employee productivity, and employee conduct. The reasons and causes of this poor performance could be a personal issue related to the employee.

More serious difficulties and the abuse of these problems-if not resolved-may cause unending issues at work.

From this perspective, the design of the right incentives for a sounder and more prudent management of banks has attracted increasing attention, especially for those who are attempting to identify an effective discipline for bank organizations and their board members. Coherently with the evolution of financial markets and the increase of challenges which supervisory authorities have to face in order to guarantee a more reliable financial system, we move throughout an analysis of the evolution which has been characterizing the supervisory behaviour during last decade, in order to highlight which are the latest objectives supervisors are going to pursue in their undertaking. Thus, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the supervisory enforcements, we take into consideration the role of on-site inspections and sanctions inflicted by supervisory authorities.
