50|$|Button whirligigs {{are simple}} {{spinning}} toys whereby two looped ends of twisting thread are pulled with both arms, causing the button to <b>spin.</b> <b>Button</b> whirligigs are often seen today in craft shops and souvenir {{stores in the}} southern Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
50|$|To aid the rotozoan on its quest, {{the game}} will spawn certain items during the {{progression}} of a stage. If the rotozoan has lost one or more lives, Heart items may occasionally float by. On every stage, there will also spawn one Cyclone item, that can be activated at the player's discretion when absorbed. To activate the Cyclone, the player must press and hold either <b>spin</b> <b>button,</b> {{in order to build}} up Cyclone energy. If the rotozoan is damaged during the charging process, the Cyclone energy will discharge, and the player will have to repeat the process. Once the Cyclone energy is fully charged, the rotozoan can unleash the Cyclone. During a Cyclone, the rotozoan becomes invincible, while spinning automatically with all its tentacles spread out. It can then effortlessly absorb any goobug within the ooze for a limited time, allowing its tentacles to extend accordingly when the Cyclone has completed.|$|E
5000|$|First {{announced}} at a Nintendo press summit held in San Francisco, California on February 24, 2010, Rotozoa {{was developed by}} skip Ltd, under the executive production of Satoru Iwata. The game sports a dark and fluid visual theme, with graphic design credited to Yohei Kikuchi, while Kazuomi Suzuki's credit for sound design also spans an extensive soundtrack of ethnic beats and chants, fused with atmospheric electronic sounds. According to producer Kensuke Tanabe, the primary focus {{in the development of}} an Art Style game is the fusion between [...] "visuals and sounds from an artistic viewpoint, using video games as a method". The soundtrack features a unique song for every stage and mode in the game, adding up to more than 35 tracks. As the player makes progress extending the rotozoan's tentacles, the music will begin to evolve, adding more elements to the sound. In an interview with Nintendo of Europe, Suzuki explained the concept as an idea of making [...] "exclusive experiences that only can be made in video games", also noting that it has been {{an integral part of the}} Art Style project itself since its beginning. This feature can be noticed particularly when a significant amount of progress is lost by the breaching of a tentacle, as the additional elements in the music will simultaneously fade. Similarly, when the player rotates the rotozoan, an additional drum loop will layer with the music for as long as either <b>spin</b> <b>button</b> is held, sporting a unique drum pattern for every stage and mode.|$|E
50|$|Drill Dozer is {{an action}} {{platformer}} {{in which the}} player controls Jill and her Drill Dozer. All seventeen massive stages are flooded with enemies, obstacles, and puzzles which force Jill to use Drill Dozers drill {{in a wide variety}} of ways. The drill is activated by simply pushing one of the shoulder buttons. The R <b>button</b> <b>spins</b> the drill forward and the L <b>button</b> <b>spins</b> it backwards.|$|R
5000|$|First {{practiced in}} Chinese martial arts, the {{butterfly}} kick, or [...] "xuan zi", is {{widely viewed as}} ineffective for actual combat. However, its original purpose was to evade an opponent's floor sweep and flip to the antagonist's exposed side {{or it may be}} used as a double aerial kick to an opponent standing off to the side. It is now widely used in demonstrative wushu forms (taolu) as a symbol of difficulty. Also note the similarity in execution when compared to an ice skating maneuver known as a flying camel <b>spin</b> (aka: <b>Button</b> Camel).|$|R
40|$|In our {{intermediate}} macroeconomics {{class in}} order to initiate student interest we introduce the aggregate supply-aggregate demand models using spreadsheet based interactive graphs. Although we use Excel in our classrooms, we have developed the same framework using ―Calc‖. Our goal is to engage students in using aggregate supply-aggregate demand models to analyze the impacts of demand and supply shocks by focusing on adjustments over time {{which are based on}} price or inflation expectations. We use two models: model 1 is a traditional AS-AD model where updating of price expectations is the key for economic adjustment; model 2 uses the monetary policy rule to derive the (dynamic) aggregate demand curve (DAD) and the Phillips curve to derive the (dynamic) aggregate supply curve (DAS). Here the dynamic adjustment is brought about by updating of expected inflation. To create interactive graphs that students can control we insert ―scrollbars ‖ and ―spin buttons ‖ from Excel’s toolbar (accessible from the Developer tab in 2007 Excel) on a work sheet that contains the AS-AD or DAD-DAS models. The scrollbars are linked to price or inflation expectations and demand parameters. <b>Spin</b> <b>buttons</b> are linked to demand and supply shocks. Students can move the slider of the scrollbars to the right or to the left to change the values of expected price or inflation. They can also adjust the parameters of the monetar...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1. AnyButton turns unmodified {{buttons on}} the {{clothing}} into op-portunistic mobile controls, by adding three motion sensors on the index fingernail, on the wrist and elbow. The user tunes up the music volume by pinching up and <b>spinning</b> the second <b>button.</b> This paper presents wearable opportunistic controls using un-modified clothing buttons. Buttons are commonly sewn on formal clothing and often came with multiple duplicates. In this paper, we turn passive buttons into dial widgets. Each button provides simple input modalities (e. g., tap and <b>spin</b> inputs). Multiple <b>buttons</b> allow for modeless and rich interac-tions. We present AnyButton, a wearable motion-sensor set, allowing for transferring buttons on clothing into mobile in-put on the move. Our prototype consists of three motion sen-sors attached on the index fingernail, the wrist, and the elbow. We interpret which button is under user interaction according to the wrist and elbow orientations, and how the button in the user’s finger pinches being operated according to the motions on the fingertips. Each button allows for partial tap, discrete spin and dwell spin inputs. By distributing interface to the buttons, applications such as music players and call centers can use opportunistic clothing buttons as wearable controls...|$|R
50|$|A Johansson Mikrokator (also called Abramson's movement) is a {{mechanical}} comparator {{used to obtain}} mechanical magnification {{of the difference in}} length as compared to a standard. It works on the principle of a <b>button</b> <b>spinning</b> on a loop of string. A twisted thin metal strip holds a pointer, which shows the reading on a suitable scale. Since there is no friction involved in the transfer of movement from the strip to the pointer, it is free from backlash. It was reportedly designed by Hugo Abramson in 1938.|$|R
50|$|After the post-fire {{reconstruction}} Blandford {{remained a}} thriving market town. Wool <b>spinning</b> and <b>button</b> making were also significant, and the brewing and hostelry trades expanded. The turnpike road between Salisbury and Dorchester {{was made in}} 1756 and passed through the town, {{and the arrival of}} the coaching era increased the town's prosperity, though the built fabric of the town changed little until {{the first half of the}} 19th century, when houses for wealthier inhabitants were built to the north alongside the roads to Salisbury and Shaftesbury. Later in the 19th century, perhaps following the installation of piped water, more densely packed buildings were built to the northeast, replacing gardens and barracks for the poor (that had been erected following the fire) between the roads to Salisbury and Wimborne Minster. Rail transport arrived in Blandford in the 1860s, though this didn't impact greatly on the town's economy.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternate}} mode is a two-player {{game called}} Match Play. In this mode, {{a much smaller}} table, only one screen tall, houses a number of buttons and switches that lower the score of the player on that side by various amounts. Four sensors {{in the middle of}} the table will switch the scores of the two players whenever they all become lit. A slot machine is <b>spun</b> by the <b>buttons</b> on the outer walls, and its bonus is enacted by hitting the button on the top wall. The first player to lose all his or her points loses.|$|R
50|$|Lussi {{introduced}} {{checking the}} jump landings instead of turning a three after landing, a program as composition with a {{beginning and ending}} instead of the official just banging a gong to signal {{the end of the}} allotted time to perform, closing the figures on the backward pushes which until that time were left open, the original design for the Pattern 99 blade, the flying sit spin, the flying camel or <b>Button</b> Camel <b>spin</b> with Dick <b>Button,</b> the crossed-leg rotation position in jumping and spinning, the double Axel jump, the triple jumps, the delayed Axel and delayed-rotation double and triple jumps.|$|R
500|$|When the larva {{is fully}} grown, hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) are produced. At {{this point the}} larva stops feeding, and begins [...] "wandering" [...] {{in the quest for}} a {{suitable}} pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it <b>spins</b> a <b>button</b> of silk which it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a cocoon to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position. Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.|$|R
50|$|A {{slot machine}} (American English), informally fruit machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English slang), the slots (Canadian and American English), poker machine (or pokies in slang) (Australian English and New Zealand English) or simply slot (American English), is a casino {{gambling}} machine {{with three or}} more reels which <b>spin</b> when a <b>button</b> is pushed. Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by one lever {{on the side of}} the machine as distinct from a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the player in debt and impoverished. Many modern machines are still equipped with a legacy lever in addition to the button.|$|R
50|$|In IIDX games, players {{recreate}} the musical score of songs {{available to them}} {{through the use of}} a DJ simulating controller. The player must coordinate their hands in order to hit the correct keyboard <b>buttons,</b> <b>spin</b> the turntable, or a combination of both in correspondence to color-coded notes that approach the judgement bar displayed on screen. Notes are divided on screen by columns which separate them accordingly to match the seven buttons and the turntable on the DJ simulating controller. As a result of hitting notes, different sounds are then produced throughout a songs duration. Correctly hitting notes will produce an accurate musical score, while incorrectly hitting notes will produce inaccuracies and mistakes in the music.|$|R
5000|$|The {{slot machine}} is a casino {{gambling}} machine {{with three or}} more reels which <b>spin</b> when a <b>button</b> is pushed. Though slot machines were originally operated mechanically by a lever {{on the side of}} the machine (the one arm) instead of an electronic button on the front panel as used on today's models, many modern machines still have a [...] "legacy lever" [...] in addition to the button on the front. Slot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play. The machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops. Modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept.|$|R
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session on Friday afternoon, with Räikkönen the only driver to lap the course in less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>spun</b> out in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|R
50|$|With 10 laps remaining, {{the first}} six drivers were split by fewer than four seconds. On lap 69 and Vergne pitted to switch to {{intermediate}} tyres; the only driver {{to do so in}} the race. Still behind Kovalainen, Button locked up his brakes next to the swimming pool and spun. That left Pérez behind him to attack the Caterham, which Pérez succeeded in passing. Vergne's move to intermediate tyres had not worked, as he was losing over seven seconds every lap to his rivals. Two laps after <b>Button</b> <b>spun,</b> he had caught back up to Kovalainen. Button attempted an overtake on Kovalainen around the outside of turn 1. Button, who was able to brake later in his McLaren, launched down the outside of Kovalainen in the braking zone of turn 1. At the same time Kovalainen moved left and the Finn's front wing hit Button's front right tyre, causing a puncture on the McLaren, and Kovalainen damaged his front wing. A subsequent pit stop for Kovalainen put him down to 13th place, meanwhile Button retired from the race due to his puncture.|$|R
5000|$|The weather {{remained}} wet for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard was fastest in {{the third}} session, setting a time of 1:33.614; Häkkinen ended with the second quickest lap. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello were third and fifth respectively; they were separated by Ralf Schumacher. The Jordan drivers ended sixth and seventh with Frentzen quicker than Trulli. Mika Salo, Pedro Diniz and Jos Verstappen followed in the top ten. In the final practice session, Häkkinen ended up fastest {{with a time of}} 1:33.132, with Coulthard setting the third quickest lap time. The pair were separated by Michael Schumacher with his teammate Barrichello fourth fastest. Ralf Schumacher was fifth overall. Fisichella followed in sixth, having lost most of the session due to an oil leak, requiring an engine change. Frentzen, Verstappen, Trulli and Salo completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Diniz spun off the circuit damaging his car's front suspension in a crash. Williams driver Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>spun</b> into the gravel trap at turn 14 and was subsequently hit by Irvine's Jaguar. The Williams sustained a broken front and rear suspension whilst the Jaguar's monocoque was punctured. Both drivers were unhurt. [...] I am very happy with my first pole for Ferrari. I like these conditions and I know Silverstone well. The team gave me a good car and we timed the final laps just right. I was lucky not to have any traffic. I {{did not know what to}} expect because, last week in testing, I only drove in the wet, and only did two laps in the dry yesterday. I tried to guess what the weather conditions were going to do. The only thing to do was to keep concentrated and pray for no traffic. The team did a good job with my car, I know this track very well and I pushed right to the very limit. Michael Schumacher, todayI went out early because I thought it might rain later. That is why I went out early again for my second run at a different time to the others. Starting from pole tomorrow will be important if the weather is bad for the race. Rubens Barrichello, commenting on taking pole position. Saturday's afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in cloudy weather conditions but on a drying race track. The air temperature was 14 C and the track temperature was 10 C. Barrichello clinched his third pole position of his career, his first at the circuit, with a time of 1:25.703. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Frentzen recording a lap 0.003 seconds slower. It was also his best qualifying performance of the season. Häkkinen qualified third having been forced to ease off the throttle after making a mistake during his final quick lap. He was in front of teammate Coulthard who encountered traffic on his final qualifying runs. Michael Schumacher—who made a change to his car, only to see him make more mistakes—qualified fifth and missed starting his final lap by 0.1 seconds. Button and Ralf Schumacher clinched sixth and seventh positions respectively although both drivers had mixed feelings over their performances. Verstappen initially held the pole position in the session's closing seconds but spun off the track and was demoted to eighth. Irvine took ninth and Villeneuve rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Trulli qualified in eleventh position but was prevented from setting a quicker time as he was held up by one of the Williams. He was ahead of Fisichella in the faster of the two Benettons. Diniz qualified in 13th position, eight-tenths of a second ahead of teammate Salo in 18th; both drivers disadvantaged by the timing of their runs. The two were separated by Johnny Herbert who encountered yellow flags during the session. He was followed up by Jean Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prosts, who sandwiched Zonta. Behind Heidfeld, Pedro de la Rosa in the slower Arrows set the 19th fastest time and made a mistake during his final qualifying run. Wurz ran his team's spare car due to an unidentifiable problem on his race car and was 20th quickest. The two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane completed the final row of the grid.|$|R
