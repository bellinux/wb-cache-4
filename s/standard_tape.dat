500|$|... "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill" [...] {{was written}} by Lennon after an American visitor to Rishikesh left {{for a few weeks}} to hunt tigers. It was {{recorded}} as an audio vérité exercise, featuring vocal performances from almost everyone who {{happened to be in the}} studio at the time. Ono sings one line and co-sings another, while Chris Thomas played the mellotron, including improvisations at the end of the track. The opening flamenco guitar flourish was a recording included in the Mellotron's <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> library.|$|E

50|$|The IBM 727 Magnetic Tape Unit was {{announced}} for the IBM 701 and IBM 702 on September 25, 1953. It became IBM's <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> drive for their early vacuum tube era computer systems. Later vacuum tube machines and first-generation transistor computers used the IBM 729-series tape drive. The 727 was withdrawn on May 12, 1971.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} version, this version could play any <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> of similar tape, but the user needed to first push the [...] "Question" [...] button (or the [...] "2/A/No" [...] button would work as well, playing the correct channel). Pressing three or four buttons would play one of the channels on the reverse side of the tape backwards.|$|E

50|$|Duct tape, {{sometimes}} called duck tape, is cloth- or scrim-backed pressure-sensitive tape, often coated with polyethylene. There {{are a variety}} of constructions using different backings and adhesives. One variation is black gaffer tape, which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed, unlike <b>standard</b> duct <b>tape.</b> Another variation is heat-resistant foil (not cloth) duct tape useful for sealing heating and cooling ducts, produced because <b>standard</b> duct <b>tape</b> fails quickly when used on heating ducts. Duct tape is generally silvery gray, but also available in other colors and even printed designs.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other home {{computers}} of the time, software {{can be saved}} and loaded on standard cassette tapes. The UK101 uses the Kansas City <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> format. I/O is managed by a Motorola 6850 ACIA. This allows a full RS-232 port to be implemented, {{with the addition of}} a few extra components and minor modifications to existing jumpers on the board.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>tape</b> speeds {{varied by}} factors of two — 15 and 30 in/s {{were used for}} {{professional}} audio recording; [...] for home audiophile prerecorded tapes; [...] for audiophile and consumer recordings (typically on [...] reels). [...] and occasionally even [...] were used for voice, dictation, and applications where very long recording times were needed, such as logging police and fire department calls.|$|E
50|$|The {{recorder}} employed miniature reel-to-reel technology {{adapted from}} <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> recorders {{and used by}} small, portable dictation machines since the 1940s. Bloom foresaw utilizing the machine to broadcast marketing messages to passing shoppers, {{with or without a}} mechanical or laser triggering mechanism, presaging today's store public address systems, audio boxes linked to museum exhibits, and ultimately the audio cassette player introduced by Philips in Europe in August 1963.|$|E

5000|$|Data Storage Technology (DST) is a 19 mm wide {{magnetic}} tape data storage format created by Ampex in 1992. The DST format was also made by Ampex as a digital videotape format, DCT, {{using the same}} design of cassette. DST is relatively high capacity and high speed, especially compared to other tape technologies available in the 1990s. There are 3 <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> cartridge sizes compatible with each generation, [...] "Small", [...] "Medium", and [...] "Large".|$|E
50|$|The {{thickest}} tape {{normally used}} in cassettes is about 16 µm in thickness, {{and is used}} in C60 cassettes and in shorter lengths such as the C46. As the <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> speed for a compact cassette is 1⅞ ips and a C60 cassette records 30 minutes per side, a C60 cassette in theory holds 281¼' (85.73 m) of tape. In practice there is some variation, for example Maxell quote their C60s as being 90 m (295') in length.|$|E
5000|$|LINCtape, and its derivative, DECtape, were {{variations}} on this [...] "round tape". They were essentially a personal storage medium. The tape was 0.75 in wide and featured a fixed formatting track which, unlike <b>standard</b> <b>tape,</b> made it feasible {{to read and}} rewrite blocks repeatedly in place. LINCtapes and DECtapes had similar capacity and data transfer rate to the diskettes that displaced them, but their [...] "seek times" [...] were on the order of thirty seconds to a minute.|$|E

5000|$|When {{used with}} tape drives, Backup Exec uses the Microsoft Tape Format (MTF), {{which is also}} used by Windows NTBackup, backup {{utilities}} included in Microsoft SQL Server, and many other backup vendors and is compatible with BKF. Microsoft Tape Format (MTF) [...] was originally Maynard's (Backup Exec's first authors) proprietary backup Tape Format (MTF) and was later licensed by Microsoft as Windows <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> format. In addition, Microsoft also licensed and incorporated Backup Exec's backup engine into Windows NT, the server version of Windows.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the Pravetz series 8 {{personal}} computers, {{manufactured in}} Bulgaria, which were equipped with decent dedicated displays, floppy discs and good quality keyboards, the entire series used a TV {{set for a}} monitor (by standard TV-UHF via coaxial cable, composite video, or RGB) and a <b>standard</b> <b>tape</b> recorder as data storage. The keyboards were of low quality. The KC 85/1 used an integrated calculator-style keyboard with small [...] "keys" [...] of hard plastics, while KC 85/2-4 used a separate keyboard driven by a remote control IC.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of passive elements in ceramic interconnect devices promises higher package densities and reliability. LTCC compatible high-k dielectrics are commercially available with k-values up to 250. Barium titanate dielectrics stand {{out for their}} high permittivity even at low sintering temperatures. This fact allows the co-firing with common metallization and commercially available tapes. In this study we investigate the co-firing of barium titanate LTCC tapes with commercially available <b>standard</b> <b>tapes.</b> Pressure assisted sintering and constraint sintering {{is used for the}} manufacturing of buried capacitators. Crucial parameters are worked out using a statistical setup according to Taguchi. High k-values up to 2300 are obtained for embedded dielectric tape patches. Beside of the capac itator properties the process constancy is observed...|$|R
