For example, they harvested with sickles manufactured by inserting flint blades into the inside of curved pieces of wood. One diagnostic tool, the [...] "shoe-last celt", was made of a ground <b>stone</b> <b>chisel</b> blade tied to a handle. The blade was pulled over a piece of wood by the handle, removing flakes, {{in a manner similar to}} a plane. Augurs were made of flint points tied to sticks that could be rotated. Scrapers and knives are found in abundance. The use of flint pieces, or microliths, descended from the Mesolithic, while the ground stone is characteristic of the Neolithic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Being thus baffled {{of winning}} the tomb from below, and being unprovided with ladders to scale, I found a way by much {{circuitous}} journeying {{to the top of}} the cliff. Thence I caused myself to be lowered by ropes, till I had investigated that portion of the rock face wherein I expected to find the opening. I found that there was an entrance, closed however by a great stone slab. This was cut in the rock more than a hundred feet up, being two-thirds the height of the cliff. The hieroglyphic and cabalistic symbols cut in the rock were so managed as to disguise it. The cutting was deep, and was continued through the rock and the portals of the doorway, and through the great slab which formed the door itself. This was fixed in place with such incredible exactness that no <b>stone</b> <b>chisel</b> or cutting implement which I had with me could find a lodgment in the interstices. I used much force, however; and by many heavy strokes won a way into the tomb, for such I found it to be. The stone door having fallen into the entrance I passed over it into the tomb, noting as I went a long iron chain which hung coiled on a bracket close to the doorway.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>chisels</b> {{are used}} to carve or cut stone, bricks or {{concrete}} slabs. To cut, as opposed to carve, a brick bolster is used; this has a wide, flat blade that is tapped along the cut line to produce a groove, then hit hard in the centre to crack the stone. Sculptors use a spoon chisel, which is bent, with the bevel on both sides. To increase the force, <b>stone</b> <b>chisels</b> are often hit with club hammers, a heavier type of hammer.|$|R

50|$|Almost all (95%) moai {{were carved}} from compressed, easily worked {{solidified}} volcanic ash or tuff {{found at a}} single site {{on the side of}} the extinct volcano Rano Raraku. The native islanders who carved them used only <b>stone</b> hand <b>chisels,</b> mainly basalt toki, which lie in place all over the quarry. The <b>stone</b> <b>chisels</b> were sharpened by chipping off a new edge when dulled. While sculpting was going on, the volcanic stone was splashed with water to soften it. While many teams worked on different statues at the same time, a single moai took a team of five or six men approximately a year to complete. Each statue represented the deceased head of a lineage.|$|R

It has two prominent towers, rectangular in shape, dominating the landscape near the wharf. Between the two towers, a blue Maltese cross has been affixed, which also {{appears on the}} flag of Wallis. The massive cathedral structure represents a distinctive [...] "bulwark of Gaulish Catholicism". In 1951, construction of a coral block cathedral began.|$|R
5|$|Maya stelae were {{worked with}} <b>stone</b> <b>chisels</b> and {{probably}} with wooden mallets. Hammerstones were fashioned from flint and basalt and {{were used for}} shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.|$|R
50|$|Masbate {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{settlements}} in the Philippines. Archaeological records show that Batungan (in Mandaon) and Bagumbayan (in Palanas) were major settlement sites during the Bronze Age (4000-1000 BC). The development of bronze metallurgy in South-East Asia coincided with an increasingly hierarchical society, firmly based on agricultural village settlements. It was these crucial changes, the introduction of new technologies, new social forms, and a new economic base, which culminated in the foundation of the proto-urban settlements of the 1st millennium AD. A fine <b>stone</b> <b>chisel</b> from Mount Batungan is dated to the twelfth century BC. Of the age of Philippine neoliths it is only possible to say that polished stone adzes from Masbate have been dated from 2710 BC to AD 179.2 Kalanay (in Aroroy) was an island site from 1000 BC-AD 850 (early metal). Masbateño burial jars and a small pottery skull box found in caves dated to the beginning of the Christian era. Exquisite goldwork represents an old Philippine wealth in both an economic and an artistic sense: all sorts of wrought or molded ornaments and jewelry demonstrate both the availability of the raw material and the skill of the artisan - finger rings, earrings, head-bands, pendants and pectoral ornaments, heavy chains with interlocking serrated edges, light filigree work, delicate necklaces of fine twisted wires, 12-millimeter beads composed of 184 separate granules soldered together, thin hammered sheets for decorating grosser objects like earplugs or the visages of corpses, and a charming little snail of unknown use. Productive mines in Benguet, Butuan, Masbate, and Paracale were in operation and gold being panned in riverbeds all over the archipelago when the Spaniards arrived.|$|E

The Saraswati shrine within the Trikuteshwara temple complex has exquisite stone columns.|$|R
50|$|It {{claims to}} be the world's oldest church that still has daily prayers and India's oldest church that haven't been reconstructed till now. The church has three main parts built in the 17th century and a 20th-century {{entrance}} hall. Its walls are built of locally quarried <b>stone,</b> <b>chiseled</b> with a multi-tipped chisel, a technique known in Kerala and possibly introduced there by foreign contact in the 16th century.Thiruvithamcode (also spelled Thiruvithancode, Thiruvithankodu and Thiruvithangodu) is a small panchayat town located in the Kanyakumari district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.It is about 20 km from Nagercoil, and 2 km from Thuckalay.|$|R

Speaking on behalf of the women of Hawaii, she advocated for Hawaii's spot in the proposed memorial suggesting [...] "a pillar of laval <b>stone</b> <b>chiselled</b> from the laval flows of Kilauea, be placed within this Hall of Remembrance to symbolize Hawaii" [...] and for the recognition of the early pioneering American missionary wives, Queen Kaʻahumanu or High Chiefess Kapiʻolani. The pillar representing Hawaii was never erected.|$|R
50|$|Chaim Goldberg {{began to}} {{experiment}} with new shapes and mediums, such as wood carving and <b>stone</b> <b>chiseling</b> in Israel, in the year 1964. He began with abstract drawings of three-dimensional shapes floating and shooting into space. These darting and frequently marching shapes were influenced by the space race between the United States and Russia. He continued to develop his modernist side, despite his commitment to memorialize {{the life of the}} Shtetl. It is a very rate to see this dichotomy between realism and making art for art sake in abstract forms with any artist. He continued this dichotomy throughout {{the rest of his life}} by dividing his day into sessions in different parts of his studios.|$|R

Where, indeed, the entire shaft is composed {{of four or five}} blocks set one upon another, the diameters may be easily determined at the successive joints, and the <b>stones</b> <b>chiselled</b> to the same slope. But this becomes sufficiently troublesome when the joints are numerous, so that the pillar is like a pile of cheeses; or when it is to be built of small and irregular stones. We should be naturally led, in the one case, to cut all the cheeses to the same diameter; in the other to build by the plumb-line; and in both to give up the tapering altogether.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{as early}} as seven {{thousand}} years ago and apparently peaking around 3000 B.C., Native Americans dug copper from the southern shore of Lake Superior. This development was possible in large part because, in this region, large deposits of copper were easily accessible in surface rock and from shallow diggings. Native copper could be found as large nuggets and wiry masses. Copper {{as a resource for}} functional tooling achieved popularity around 3000 B.C., during the Middle Archaic Stage. The focus of copper working seems to have gradually shifted from functional tools to ornamental objects by the Late Archaic Stage c. 1200 B.C. Native Americans would build a fire to heat the rock around and over a copper mass and, after heating, pour on cold water to crack the rock. The copper was then pounded out, using rock hammers and <b>stone</b> <b>chisels.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2012, archaeologists {{excavating}} at {{the foot}} of the city's southern seawall found a quay and other evidence of a 2,300-year old port. Mooring stones weighing 250-300 kilograms each were unearthed at the edge of a 5-meter long <b>stone</b> platform <b>chiseled</b> in Phoenician-style, thought to be an installation that helped raise military vessels from the water onto the shore.|$|R

60|$|For {{the most}} part, the House of the Afternoon {{was but a}} wing built against a mansion wrought by the hand of Nature herself; a grotto running {{into the side of}} the mountain. From high over the mouth of this grotto, sloped a long arbor, {{supported}} by great blocks of <b>stone,</b> rudely <b>chiseled</b> into the likeness of idols, each bearing a carved lizard on its chest: a sergeant's guard of the gods condescendingly doing duty as posts.|$|R
50|$|The Bruce family took up {{the ambitious}} project of {{building}} Symbister House in 1823 in a grand Georgian architectural style with brown coloured granite <b>stones</b> <b>chiseled</b> into square blocks. They employed forced labour for the construction, yet it cost the huge sum of £30,000, as they brought quarried granite stones from the tidal affected area of North Nesting. The house, which was the largest building complex {{on the island of}} the time, is also known as New Haa. Local stories mention that the landlord who built it did not want ownership to pass to his son, with whom he had strained relationship. This resulted in hard times for the Bruce family who inherited the property. Even to maintain it they had to take on boarders in the 1920s and 30s. The last of the lairds died here in 1944. The building then remained vacant for some years and was subject to deterioration. It was only in 1963 that the local council took possession of the building and refurbished part of the complex into a school. After renovation, the school opened in 1964 as the Whalsay Junior High School. It has been renovated in recent years by the council.|$|R
6000|$|Indian relics {{abound in}} Concord,--arrow-heads, <b>stone</b> <b>chisels,</b> pestles, and {{fragments}} of pottery; {{and on the}} river-bank, large heaps of clam-shells and ashes mark spots which the savages frequented. These, and every circumstance touching the Indian, were important in his eyes. His visits to Maine were chiefly for love of the Indian. He had the satisfaction of seeing the manufacture of the bark-canoe, {{as well as of}} trying his hand in its management on the rapids. He was inquisitive about the making of the stone arrow-head, and in his last days charged a youth setting out for the Rocky Mountains to find an Indian who could tell him that: [...] "It was well worth a visit to California to learn it." [...] Occasionally, a small party of Penobscot Indians would visit Concord, and pitch their tents for a few weeks in summer on the river-bank. He failed not to make acquaintance with the best of them; though he well knew that asking questions of Indians is like catechizing beavers and rabbits. In his last visit to Maine he had great satisfaction from Joseph Polis, an intelligent Indian of Oldtown, who was his guide for some weeks.|$|R

5000|$|Evidence of neolithic Tibetan {{inhabitants}} and settlements {{have been}} found mainly [...] "in river valleys {{in the south and}} east of the country". Archaeological sites consist of those in Nyingchi County, Medog County, and Qamdo County. Archaeologists have found pottery and stone tools, including <b>stone</b> axes, <b>chisels,</b> knives, spindle-whorls, discs, and arrowheads. Findings in Nyingchi culturally resemble the Neolithic Qijia culture in Gansu and Qinghai, while findings in Qamdo resemble the Dadunzi site in Yunnan, although there may be some connections with the Neolithic culture of the Yellow River valley.|$|R

60|$|The {{party who}} had been working upon this block were much disheartened, when Stanley went up to relieve them. Owing to the {{inclination}} of the <b>stone,</b> their <b>chisels</b> could get but little bite and, though they had been working for six hours at it, they had scarcely made any impression; indeed, at only one point had they so far broken the face that the chisel would cut. Meinik had come down two hours before, to report to Stanley the nature of the obstacle and, when he went up, he took with him the second ramrod, which had not hitherto been used.|$|R
