50|$|The {{use of a}} glow {{discharge}} for solution of certain mapping problems was described in 2002. According to a Nature news article describing the work, researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that gives tourists luminous route indicators. To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass slide. Fitting a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs. When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B - and the gas glows like a tiny glowing <b>strip</b> <b>light.</b> The approach itself provides a novel visible analog computing approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a {{glow discharge}} in a microfluidic chip.|$|E
50|$|Riders {{will start}} in the Ashworth Pool parking lot, in {{downtown}} Des Moines. After a short ride through trees the trail will merge into the Great Western Trail. Riders will then cross a busy street, and after riding through trees, an airport landing <b>strip</b> <b>light,</b> and the first mile marker, they will arrive near Des Moines International Airport. The scenery won't change much as riders cross a small bridge and another road, but soon they'll be in a lush grassy meadow for a long while, until they enter a thicket of trees farther up the path. Eventually they will pass under Highway 28 and Army Post Road, which leads into a peaceful golf course. After the golf course {{they will be in}} rural areas for a while, until passing through Orilla, which is just north of Norwalk, home to Brandon Routh, the star of Superman Returns. Cumming is not too far ahead. After Cumming, the trail will pass through countryside and over the Middle River for over eight miles (13 km) to Martensdale, where the trail ends.|$|E

40|$|The {{appliance}} (1) has a {{light source}} (2, 3) projecting a light beam (5, 6) {{on to the}} surface (8) of the object and a light sensor (4) to detect light scattered from foreign bodies (impurities) on the surface. The light beam is directed as <b>strip</b> <b>light</b> on to the surface. Foreign bodies on the surface cause scattering of the light beam but otherwise the light is subjected to no or only insignificant change. The light sensor is located so that {{at least part of}} the scattered light is detected. The light beam can be directed approximately in parallel to the surface. USE/ADVANTAGE - For detecting irregularities on the surface of silicon wafers.

40|$|Among {{all the air}} {{cleaning}} techniques used to removal the indoor VOCs, photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) method {{is one of the}} fastest developing and the most widely used techniques in recent years because of its high removal efficiencies for most VOCs. However, the removal efficiency can be as low as 30 % (conversion) for some VOCs such as isopropyl benzene. The objective of this research is to investigate the enhancement effect of the UV/O 3 process on the removal efficiency of indoor VOCs by PCO. We chose toluene, m-xylene, and mesitylene in this study to investigate how the removal efficiency of VOCs is related to their physical and chemical properties. The photoreactor used in this study is made up of 45 -cm-long quartz tube with 2. 5 -cm interior diameter. A glass plate coated with Degussa P- 25 Titania photocatalyst is positioned in the quartz tube. The UV lamp used is a 15 -W, UV-C, long-life <b>strip</b> <b>light</b> bulb. The rate constant of PCO found in this study is proportional to kOH, while the Langmuir adsorption constants show a negative linear relationship with kOW. The rate constant of PCO for toluene, m-xylene, and mesitylene ranges from 4. 33 to 37. 6 (µ-mole m- 2 s- 1). The enhancement index for toluene, m-xylene, and mesitylene ranges from 1. 40 × 10 - 6 to 1. 87 × 10 - 6 (µ-mole-m- 2 -s- 1 /ppb-O 3), and it is proportional to kOH. ...|$|E

40|$|DE 10244819 A UPAB: 20040525 NOVELTY - Apparatus for {{detection}} of material layer(s) on technical surface, comprises lamp which directs bundled light beam at material on surface. Detector(s) register fluorescent radiation generated by material through illumination. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An apparatus for the {{detection of}} material layer(s) (2) on a technical surface (1), comprises a lamp (3) which directs a bundled light beam (6) at the material on the surface. Detector(s) (4) register the fluorescent radiation (9) generated by the material through the illumination. The bundled light beam forms a point or linear pattern on the surface forming an enclosed angle with it of 0 deg. at most alpha at most 90 deg.. The detector forms a position resolution camera system with a camera viewing direction (8) forming an enclosed angle with the surface of 0 deg. at most beta at most 90 deg.. alpha and beta are unequal. The surface can be moved in relation to the bundled light beam. USE - The apparatus is {{for the detection}} of fluorescence generated from layer(s) of material on a technical surface which is classified according to its purity or the type or degree of contamination. It is used to give a qualitative or quantitative measurement of organic residue or soiling on a non-fluorescent technical surface, is useful as a quality check of finished and/or semi-finished products, and is also useful for registering the presence of insulation residue on an electrical contact surface area cleared of insulation. ADVANTAGE - The system combines the principle of fluorescence measurement with <b>strip</b> <b>light</b> projection. The measurements are without contact, or affected by external influences, giving a trouble-free and in-line test process...|$|E
