5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds of {{all but two of}} its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even higher than those of High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout <b>Streams</b> <b>in</b> Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E
5|$|Class A Wild Trout Waters are {{the highest}} biomass class given to <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They are {{considered}} to contain the highest-quality naturally reproducing trout populations in Pennsylvania.|$|E

Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat and with M.mystacinus.|$|E
50|$|Numerous bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} over Beaver Run. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 3003 was built over the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> 1909 and repaired in 1973. It is 29.9 ft long and is 2 mi northwest of Mooresburg. A steel truss bridge carrying T-308 was built over the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> 1912 and repaired in 1997. It is 41.0 ft long and is 1.3 mi east of Potts Grove. A concrete bridge was constructed over the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> 1924 1.7 mi northwest of Mooresburg. This bridge is 26.9 ft long and carries T-318. A concrete slab bridge was constructed over the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> 1941 and repaired in 2007, 2 mi northwest of Mooresburg. This bridge is 24.9 ft long and carries State Route 3003. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T-306 was constructed across the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> 1991. It is 44.9 ft long and is 1 mi southeast of Potts Grove. A concrete culvert bridge carrying T-843 was built across the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> the same year, is 24.0 ft long, and is 1.6 mi southeast of Potts Grove. In 1999, a bridge of the same type was constructed over the stream 2 mi west of Mooresburg. It is 25.9 ft long and carries State Route 3004.|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the upper}} tributaries of Shamokin Creek are in the Western Middle Anthracite Coalfield and {{nearly all of the}} <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> this part of the {{watershed}} are impacted by mining, except for Furnace Run. Various mine drainage sites occur in the watersheds of all other <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> the upper Shamokin Creek watershed. None of the tributaries in the lower reaches of the Shamokin Creek watershed are affected by mining. Four tributaries of Shamokin CreekLick Creek, Millers Run, Bennys Run, and Trout Runare not designated as impaired waterbodies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Another five tributariesNorth Branch Shamokin Creek, Locust Creek, Quaker Run, Coal Run, and Carbon Run are impaired by metals due to abandoned mine drainage. Furnace Run is impaired by channelization and habitat alteration, while Little Shamokin Creek and its tributary Plum Creek are impaired by siltation, organic enrichment, and low levels of dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} {{decisions}} made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact.

5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
