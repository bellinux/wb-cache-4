30|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{have become}} a research focus owing to their various applications in self-cleaning [1, 2], corrosion resistance [3, 4] and anti-icing [5]. It has been proven both surface energy [6] and roughness [7, 8] are the crucial factors to obtain superhydrophobicity. Based on these two factors, coating [9, 10], chemical depositing [11] and many other approaches have been advanced to prepare artificial superhydrophobic surfaces. On account that the surface modification technics to lower surface energy are well-developed, method to construct the rough structures becomes a key issue. There are two forms of rough surfaces {{that can be applied}} to obtain superhydrophobicity, surfaces with disordered structures and ordered structures. The ordered structured arrays with designed parameters appear to be more effective in revealing the mechanism of superhydrophobic surfaces or endowing special functions [12, 13]. For example, it has been reported recently that micro arrays with specific parameters allow a reduction in contact time when water droplets impact on this kind of superhydrophobic surfaces [14, 15], which results in these surfaces with micro post arrays being promising for application prospects in anti-icing from freezing rain. Several methods to prepare superhydrophobic post arrays have been reported, including photolithography, electric <b>spark</b> <b>wire</b> cutting and laser texturing. Ã–ner and co-workers [16] obtained superhydrophobic post arrays on silicon substrates with a variety of topographies by changing the photomasks in lithography process. Butt et al. [17] used lithography to prepare SU- 8 photoresist arrays with superhydrophobicity. Liu et al. [14] prepared superhydrophobic tapered posts on copper (Cu) substrates by using wire electro discharge machining followed by chemical etching and coating thin polymer. Van et al. [18] utilized laser texturing as well as surface energy modification to fabricate superhydrophobic square posts on stainless steel substrates. However, for the aforementioned methods, the machining efficiency of wire electro discharge machining for large-area array structures is very low, in addition, {{it is very difficult to}} fabricate post arrays with diameters of several tens of micrometers. Laser texturing not only requires expensive equipment but also is difficult to efficiently fabricate post arrays with diameter of several tens of micrometers. Photolithography is a highly efficient method to prepare superhydrophobic micro arrays, but currently, it can only be applied on silicon and photoresist substrates. Considering that metals are one of the most widely used materials, an effective method to fabricate superhydrophobic array structures on engineering metals has great significance for moving superhydrophobic surfaces towards real-world applications.|$|E

50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic <b>spark</b> plug <b>wire</b> retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned <b>spark</b> plug <b>wire</b> retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|R

When he goes to retrieve his hat and tries to pull it free, Bond grabs a <b>sparking</b> <b>wire</b> severed by the hat earlier on and thrusts the open end onto the bars.

5000|$|In 1999, when Oswalt {{was with}} the Class A Michigan Battle Cats in the Midwest League, he {{suffered}} an apparently serious shoulder injury. After a month of pain in his upper shoulder, Oswalt was convinced that his shoulder was torn. Shortly thereafter, he was checking the <b>spark</b> plug <b>wires</b> on his pickup truck. He touched one of the <b>spark</b> plug <b>wires,</b> causing the truck's engine to start. The truck's electric current flowed through Oswalt's body, and consequently {{the muscles in his}} hand tightened on the <b>spark</b> plug <b>wire.</b> Unable to let go of it, Oswalt grasped the wire for almost one minute. Oswalt then claimed his foot slipped off the truck's bumper and he was finally [...] "thrown off." [...] After the electric shock, Oswalt told his wife that his shoulder's condition improved and that he no longer felt any pain. According to Sports Illustrated, he reported it thus to his wife: [...] "My truck done shocked the fire out of me, and my arm don't hurt no more." [...] Apparently, the electric charge loosened accumulated scar tissue in the shoulder. Oswalt claims he has not felt any pain in his shoulder since the incident. He finished 1999 with 143 strikeouts and a club-high 13 wins.|$|R

50|$|In 1997, for {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Camry, the 5S-FE was updated for the last time. This engine received a direct ignition system with external camshaft and crankshaft sensors. This system used a waste-spark design, and the coils had integrated igniters. The engine did not use a typical coil-on-plug design, but rather two coil+igniter assemblies mounted near cylinder four, and provided spark via normal high-tension cords (<b>spark</b> plug <b>wires).</b> This change means that the 1997-01 Camry 5S-FE has a blocked off distributor mounting hole and could be used with older 5S-FEs without swapping cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|On 3 June 1929 {{the first}} two-way, radiophone {{communication}} {{took place over}} the skies of the Packard Proving Grounds in Utica, (now Shelby Township, Michigan).

50|$|The top of {{the spark}} plug {{contains}} a terminal to connect to the ignition system. The exact terminal construction varies depending {{on the use of}} the spark plug.

A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the distributor cap, where a spinning rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders' <b>spark</b> plug <b>wires.</b> Ignition dwell, advance and retardation were electronically controlled by the SBEC.|$|R
