The whole geest region with its rural {{settlements}} has a distinctly rural character, {{with the exception of}} the town of Peine. The area is crossed from east to west by the Mittelland Canal, the A 2 motorway and the B 188 federal road.This area, also called the Burgdorf-Peine Geest (or Sand) Plateaus, belongs to the Lower Saxon geest countryside, that covers large parts of the North German Plain. The surface of the Burgdorf-Peine Geest is gently rolling. It is divided into depressions like the Fuhse (running from north to south) and valleys with fen country. In many areas the original forests have been cleared to make way for agriculture. One remaining large area of woodland is the Hämeler Forest near Hämelerwald. The landscape is dominated by arable fields, in which rye, oats and potatoes produce good returns. Asparagus is also widely grown on the dry, sandy soils, Burgdorf Asparagus (Burgdorfer <b>Spargel)</b> being particularly well known in Germany as a whole. The grazing of cattle is also a common mode of farming due to the poor soils. Near Hänigsen a loamy ground moraine rises close to the surface which improves the soil quality.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{mass and}} {{activity}} must {{be adapted to}} tissue function, cellular growth and nutrient availability. In mammals, the related transcriptional coactivators PGC- 1 α, PGC- 1 β and PRC regulate multiple metabolic functions, including mitochondrial biogenesis. However, we know relatively little about their respective roles in vivo. Here we show that the Drosophila PGC- 1 family homologue, <b>Spargel,</b> {{is required for the}} expression of multiple genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Accordingly, <b>spargel</b> mutants showed mitochondrial respiration defects when complex II of the electron transport chain was stimulated. <b>Spargel,</b> however, was not limiting for mitochondrial mass, but functioned in this respect redundantly with Delg, the fly NRF- 2 α/GABPα homologue. More importantly, in the larval fat body, <b>Spargel</b> mediated mitochondrial activity, cell growth and transcription of target genes in response to insulin signalling. In this process, <b>Spargel</b> functioned in parallel to the insulin-responsive transcription factor, dFoxo, and provided a negative feedback loop to fine-tune insulin signalling. Taken together, our data place <b>Spargel</b> at a nodal point for the integration of mitochondrial activity to tissue and organismal metabolism and growth...|$|E

Recent {{studies have reported}} that significant functional similarities are shared between vertebrate and invertebrate PGC- 1 ’s based on their role in mitochondrial functions and biogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and most likely in transcription and RNA processing. With the help of genetic epistasis analysis, we established that Drosophila Spargel/dPGC- 1 affects cell growth process as a terminal effector in the Insulin-TOR signaling pathway. The association between <b>Spargel</b> and Insulin signaling could also explain {{its role in the}} aging process. Here we provided a further comparison between Spargel/dPGC- 1 and PGC- 1 focusing on nuclear localization, oxidative stress resistance and a possible role of Spargel/dPGC- 1 in oogenesis reminiscing the role of <b>Spargel</b> in reproductive aging like many Insulin signaling partners.

40|$|We used Drosophila melanogaster as a {{model system}} to study the absorption, {{metabolism}} and potential health benefits of plant bioactives derived from radish sprouts (Raphanus sativus cv. Rambo), a Brassicaceae species rich in glucosinolates and other phytochemicals. Flies were subjected to a diet supplemented with lyophilized radish sprouts (10. 6 g/L) for 10 days, containing high amounts of glucoraphenin and glucoraphasatin, which can be hydrolyzed by myrosinase to the isothiocyanates sulforaphene and raphasatin, respectively. We demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster takes up and metabolizes isothiocyanates from radish sprouts through the detection of the metabolite sulforaphane-cysteine in fly homogenates. Moreover, we report {{a decrease in the}} glucose content of flies, an upregulation of <b>spargel</b> expression, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian PPARγ-coactivator 1 α, as well as the inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase in vitro. Overall, we show that the consumption of radish sprouts affects energy metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster which is reflected by lower glucose levels and an increased expression of <b>spargel,</b> a central player in mitochondrial biogenesis. These processes are often affected in chronic diseases associated with aging, including type II diabetes mellitus.

Following {{the application of the}} green tea extract {{a significant increase in the}} mean lifespan (+ 3. 3 days) and the 50 % survival (+ 4. 3 days) as well as improved fitness was detected. These effects went along an increased expression of <b>Spargel,</b> the homolog of mammalian PGC 1 α, which has been reported to affect lifespan in flies. Intriguingly, in flies, treatment with the green tea extract decreased glucose concentrations, which were accompanied by an inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity. Computational docking analysis proved the potential of EGCG to dock into the substrate binding pocket of α-amylase and to a greater extent into α-glucosidase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EGCG downregulates insulin-like peptide 5 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, major regulators of glucose metabolism, as well as the Drosophila homolog of leptin, unpaired 2. We propose that a decrease in glucose metabolism in connection with an upregulated expression of <b>Spargel</b> contribute to the better fitness and the extended lifespan in EGCG-treated flies...|$|E
40|$|Endurance {{exercise}} is an inexpensive intervention that {{is thought to}} provide substantial protection against several agerelated pathologies, as well as inducing acute changes to endurance capacity and metabolism. Recently, it has been established that endurance exercise induces conserved alterations in physiological capacity in the invertebrate Drosophila model. If the genetic factors underlying these exercise-induced physiological alterations are widely conserved, then invertebrate genetic model systems will become a valuable tool for testing of genetic and pharmacological mimetics for endurance training. Here, we assess whether the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate exercise response gene PGC- 1 a <b>spargel</b> (srl) is necessary or sufficient to induce exercise-dependent phenotypes. We find that reduction of srl expression levels acutely compromises negative geotaxis ability and reduces exercise-induced improvement in both negative geotaxis and time to exhaustion. Conversely, muscle/heart specific srl overexpression improves negative geotaxis and cardiac performance in unexercised flies. In addition, we find that srl overexpression mimics some, but not all, exercise-induced phenotypes, suggesting that other factors also act in parallel to srl to regulate exercise-induced physiological changes i...|$|E

Male and female w 1118 D. melanogaster were fed diets based on sucrose, corn meal, and yeast. Flies either received a control diet or a diet supplemented with 500 µmol/L resveratrol. Dietary resveratrol did not affect mean, median, and maximal life span of male and female flies. Furthermore, body composition remained largely unchanged following the resveratrol supplementation. Locomotor activity, as determined by the climbing index, was not significantly different between control and resveratrol-supplemented flies. Resveratrol-fed flies did not exhibit an improved stress response towards hydrogen peroxide as compared to controls. Resveratrol did not change mRNA steady levels of antioxidant (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, NADH dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase 2) and longevity-related genes, including sirtuin 2, <b>spargel,</b> and I’m Not Dead Yet.

40|$|Syndecans are {{a family}} of type-I transmembrane {{proteins}} {{that are involved in}} cell-matrix adhesion, migration, neuronal development, and inflammation. Previous quantitative genetic studies pinpointed Drosophila Syndecan (dSdc) as a positional candidate gene affecting variation in fat storage between two Drosophila melanogaster strains. Here, we first used quantitative complementation tests with dSdc mutants to confirm that natural variation in this gene affects variability in Drosophila fat storage. Next, we examined the effects of a viable dSdc mutant on Drosophila whole-body energy metabolism and associated traits. We observed that young flies homozygous for the dSdc mutation had reduced fat storage and slept longer than homozygous wild-type flies. They also displayed significantly reduced metabolic rate, lower expression of <b>spargel</b> (the Drosophila homologue of PGC- 1), and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Compared to control flies, dSdc mutants had lower expression of brain insulin-like peptides, were less fecund, more sensitive to starvation, and had reduced life span.

40|$|Background Parkinson disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder presenting with symptoms of resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and additional severe cognitive impairment over time. These symptoms arise from {{a decrease of}} available dopamine in the striatum of the brain resulting from the breakdown and death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. A process implicated {{in the destruction of}} these neurons is mitochondrial breakdown and impairment. Upkeep and repair of mitochondria involves a number of complex and key components including Pink 1, Parkin, and the PGC family of genes. PGC- 1 α has been characterized as a regulator of mitochondria biogenesis, insulin receptor signalling and energy metabolism, mutation of this gene has been linked to early onset forms of PD. The mammalian PGC family consists of three partially redundant genes making the study of full or partial loss of function difficult. The sole Drosophila melanogaster homologue of this gene family, <b>spargel</b> (srl), has been shown to function in similar pathways of mitochondrial upkeep and biogenesis. Results Directed expression of srl-RNAi in the D. melanogaster eye causes abnormal ommatidia and bristle formation while eye specific expression of srl-EY does not produce the minor rough eye phenotype associated with high temperature GMR-Gal 4 expression. Ddc-Gal 4 mediated tissue specific expression of srl transgene constructs in D. melanogaster DA neurons causes altered lifespan and climbing ability. Expression of a srl-RNAi causes an increase in mean lifespan but a decrease in overall loco-motor ability while induced expression of srl-EY causes a severe decrease in mean lifespan and a decrease in loco-motor ability. Conclusions The reduced lifespan and climbing ability associated with a tissue specific expression of srl in DA neurons provides a new model of PD in D. melanogaster which may be used to identify novel therapeutic approaches to human disease treatment and prevention...|$|E
40|$|Es sind Untersuchungen zur Quantifizierung des Wasserhaushalts von Asparagus officinalis L. mit Ausrichtung auf Trockenstress durchgeführt worden. Hintergrund dieser Studie ist eine Optimierung der Wasserversorgung von Spargelkulturen durch eine Anpassung der Bewässerungssteuerung an den pflanzlichen Wasserbedarf. Ziel war es, anhand von pflanzeninternen hydraulischen Parametern eine Einschränkung des Wasserhaushalts durch Trockenheit aufzuzeigen, bevor Trockenschäden an der Pflanze entstehen. In diesem Kontext wurde geprüft, ob mit kritischen Schwellenwerten präventive Maßnahmen gegen Trockenstress im Spargelanbau abzuleiten sind. Dazu sind die zwei wirtschaftlich relevanten Bleichspargelsorten Gijnlim und Grolim mit unterschiedlichem Ertragspotenzial und Trockenanfälligkeit im Anbau physiologisch und morphologisch miteinander verglichen worden. Anhand dieses Sortenvergleichs wurde geklärt, welche Strategien der Trockenstressvermeidung bzw. -toleranz sortenspezifisch sind. Im Gewächshaus wurden optimal bewässerte Spargelpflanzen mit voll entwickelten Trieben in 15 l-Containern durch Bewässerungsstopp und Evapotranspiration ausgetrocknet. Dabei wurden an Seitentrieben das Wasserpotenzial (psixyl) frühmorgens, die hydraulische Leitfähigkeit (Lh) und der stomatäre Gaswechsel gemessen. Für die Untersuchung der Lh ist eine spezielle Messapparatur für die krautigen Triebe entwickelt worden. Die dabei angewandte Methode erwies sich für <b>Spargel</b> als erfolgreich, trockenheit-induzierte Embolien im Wasserleitsystem festzustellen. Die Stomatamorphologie und die Wasserrückhalte-Charakteristik von Triebgewebe sind an ungestressten Pflanzen ermittelt worden. "Grolim" weist durch die von "Gijnlim" stark unterschiedliche Stomata-Charakteristik höhere {{maximale}} Assimilationsraten und eine bessere Steuerung der Stomata auf. Bei starker Luft- oder Bodentrockenheit deutet die höhere Empfindlichkeit von "Grolim"-Stomata auf bessere Schutzmechanismen vor schädigenden Wasserverlusten hin. Triebe von "Grolim" gewährleisten mit ihrer höheren maximalen Lh eine bessere Wasserversorgung der Assimilationsorgane als Triebe von "Gijnlim". Aus hydro-physiologischer und morphologischer Sicht sind bei Trockenheit sowie optimaler Bodenfeuchte die Triebe von "Grolim" gegenüber "Gijnlim" hinsichtlich ihrer Produktivität im Vorteil. Die Gesamtbetrachtung aller hydraulischen Parameter zeigte keine wesentlichen Sortenunterschiede in der Reaktion auf moderaten Trockenstress. Die Wasserführung bis zum Beginn der schädigenden Luft- und Bodentrockenheit ist somit artspezifisch. Beide Spargelsorten zeigen einen trockenresistenten Wasserhaushalt. Unter starkem Trockenstress verfolgt "Gijnlim" die Überlebensstrategie der Trockentoleranz und "Grolim" die der Trockenheitmeidung. Für den einsetzenden Trockenstress lagen die Schwellenwerte der hydraulischen Parameter für beide Sorten indifferent in dem Bodensaugspannungsbereich um - 600 hPa. Ab diesen Werten traten massive Änderungen des pflanzlichen Wasserhaushalts auf. Als erster Prozess wurde der H 2 O- und CO 2 -Gaswechsel beeinträchtigt. Die Bildung von Kavitationen in den Leitbahnen steuerte die Absenkung des psixyl. Der damit verringerte Turgor der Phyllokladien bewirkte eine starke Einschränkung der stomatären Blattleitfähigkeit (gH 2 O). Trotz reduzierter gH 2 O wurde die Abnahme der Lh in den Seitentrieben nicht vermindert. Die Steuerung des psixyl erfolgte aufgrund des anisohydrischen Charakters der Spezies sortenindifferent nicht zur Prävention vor zu starken Wasserverlusten. Die reduzierte Spaltöffnung verhinderte nicht die Bildung von Embolien in den Leitbahnen. Der vollständige und dauerhafte Ausfall des Wassertransports zu den Assimilationsorganen trat sortenunterschiedlich für "Gijnlim" bei - 700 und für "Grolim" bei - 800 hPa ein. Unterhalb dieser Saugspannung wurde der letale Turgorverlust der Triebe festgestellt. Der Wasserversorgungszustand und die Photosyntheseleistung beider hydrolabilen Sorten wurden bis zum Erreichen der Schwellenwerte auf hohem Niveau gehalten. Somit ist es möglich, mit den angewandten und entwickelten Methoden, Trockenstress frühzeitig nachzuweisen. Die für viele Kulturen implementierte pflanzliche Größe, das frühmorgendliche psixyl, stellt sich auch für <b>Spargel</b> als geeignet zur Bewässerungssteuerung heraus. Nach einer Anpassung der kritischen Schwellenwerte der Modell-Pflanzen an Freilandbedingungen kann Wassermangel im praktischen Anbau erkannt und rechtzeitig behoben werden. Water {{relations of}} asparagus officinalis L. were investigated concerning drought stress. The motivation {{of this study}} was to determine if drought stress could be prevented in the crop by optimizing water supply in response to plant water demands, through the manipulation of irrigation practices. The aim was to reveal drought-induced limitations in water relations on the basis of plant hydraulic parameters before damage to the plant occurred. The identification of thresholds pointing out the onset of drought stress was desired in order to transfer this knowledge into irrigation practices that prevent water stress. Two white asparagus cultivars, with high commercial relevance in Germany and with contrasting differences in yield and drought susceptibility during cultivation, were compared at both the physiological and morphological level. With this comparison, plant strategies concerning the avoidance or tolerance of drought stress were associated with hydraulic attributes of the cultivars and the species, respectively. One-year old plants were cultivated in 15 L pots in a greenhouse under optimal water supply until branches were fully developed. Subsequently, plants were gradually desiccated by evapotranspiration and irrigation stop. During desiccation course, water potential (psixyl) at predawn, hydraulic conductivity (ch) and gas exchange were determined on lateral ferns. For this, a novel ch-measuring system, adapted for the herba-ceous monocot asparagus, was designed. The methodology of this new measuring technique was successful in determining drought-induced embolisms in the water-conducting system. The stomatal properties, "stomata density" and "pore length", and water retention characteristics of cladophyll tissue were determined in unstressed plants. Due to extremely different stomatal characteristics, "Grolim" showed higher maximum assimilation rates and better stomatal control than "Gijnlim". Under high evaporative demand and soil drought, the more sensitive stomatal regulation of "Grolim" indicates a more efficient protective mechanism against detrimental water loss. The higher maximum ch in ferns of "Grolim" ensures a better water supply of the assimilation organs than of "Gijnlim". For productivity purposes, "Grolim" ferns benefit more from hydraulic and morphologic features than "Gijnlim". The interpretation and combination of all hydraulic parameters indicated no substantial cultivar differences. Therefore, the water management of asparagus until the onset of detrimental evaporative demand and soil drought seems to be typical for this species. Both cultivars demonstrate drought resistant hydraulics. This research sug-gests that during periods of drought, "Gijnlim" employs a strategy of drought tolerance whereas "Grolim" employs one of drought avoidance. The thresholds derived from hydraulic parameters at the beginning of drought stress were almost equal for "Gijnlim" and "Grolim", at a matric potential of approximately - 60 kPa. Below this value, strong changes appeared in water relations of the plants. The first affected process was the gas exchange of water vapour and carbon dioxide. The formation of cavitations in xylem conduits controlled the debasement of psixyl in cladophylls. The following decrease in turgor pressure resulted in an increased limitation of stomatal conductance (gs). Despite reduced gs, the decrease of the ch was not impeded. psixyl in cladophylls was not controlled in order to prevent extreme water loss due to the anisohydric character of this species. Lowering the gs did not avert the formation of embolisms. Complete loss of ch appeared in ferns of "Gijnlim" at a matric potential (psi) of - 70 kPa and for "Grolim" at - 80 kPa. Below this psi-range the lethal turgor pressure loss was determined. The water status and the photosynthetic activity of both anisohydric cultivars were maintained at a high level until psixyl and psi reached the thresholds for drought stress. These results suggest that the applied and developed methods used in this study were successful in detecting the onset of drought stress in asparagus plants. The frequently used predawn psixyl-measurement in irrigation management of crops has promise for asparagus crops, too. The application of the critical thresholds of these model experiments into field conditions enables the recognition and subsequent avoidance of water deficiency in practice...|$|E
