Meanwhile, Thea LaFond ranked dead last with a score of [...] LaFond {{said that in the}} middle of her first jump, she felt that <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> hamstring and perhaps the same with her middle finger.

5000|$|Iona Rozeal Brown is a {{contemporary}} artist who sarcastically comments on cultural identity. <b>She</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> inspiration from ukiyo-e printmaking and contemporary hip-hop. She touches upon African American culture and Japanese ganguro culture which appropriates black culture.|$|R
5000|$|Hair stylist Orlando Pita {{created an}} updo for a strong, {{confident}} woman; the kind where <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> hair back, scrapes {{it back with}} her fingers, and then puts it in this bun that has pieces falling down.” ...|$|R
50|$|In {{front of}} Constantine’s grave <b>she</b> was <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> hair off.|$|R
60|$|He {{scarcely}} saw {{her face}} again. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> veil down, {{and he knew}} that silence was best.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> arm away, {{her face}} working as she {{fought against the}} tears that would not keep back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{think too}} seriously of it, Marian," [...] she said simply, as <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> sleeve down again. [...] "It doesn't hurt me now." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> fairly <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> visitor {{into the}} hall, {{and led her}} to the sitting-room.|$|R

40|$|Photograph {{of a man}} {{helping a}} woman into her jacket. In the image, the {{unidentified}} woman looks at the camera wearing a dress while a man stand directly holding her jacket open as <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> hand through.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> {{hand out}} of his arm, which she had taken, and halted him by her abrupt pause. [...] "You're {{not going to get}} through!" ...|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{glanced at}} him covertly. His face was compassionate, but there was rather toleration than concern in it, and <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> hand away from him.|$|E
60|$|In {{another few}} moments a shadowy figure had materialised {{out of the}} prairie. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> horse up with a {{struggle}} when Leland drew bridle beside her.|$|E
60|$|He {{kissed her}} upon the cheek. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> down <b>her</b> veil. The cab had stopped {{before the door}} of her hotel.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "Oh, when he {{is calling}} on her, Kentucky Summers pretends to fly into a rage with <b>her</b> sister, and <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> hair down, and slams {{everything}} round the room, and scolds, and drinks champagne, and wants him to drink with her, and I don't know what all.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> down <b>her</b> veil {{and left}} the place hurriedly. When she reached the {{boulevard}} she slackened her pace, and drew a little breath of relief.|$|R
6000|$|The face of Miss Port now grew radiant, and <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> chair {{nearer to}} Captain Asher. [...] "Tell me," [...] said she, [...] "is he really anybody?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> hand away. [...] "No, I {{shall not}} take any more medicine. You think {{everything}} is physical. Why don't you ask at once to see my tongue?" ...|$|E
60|$|Carrie {{laughed as}} <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> team {{up near the}} sloo. She, at least, looked delightfully fresh and almost cool in her long white dress and big white hat.|$|E
60|$|That brought Charlie {{round at}} once, for Rose's lips trembled a little, though {{she tried to}} hide it by smelling the flower <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> from <b>her</b> sash.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will go to}} the waiting-room for a moment,' whispered Viviette hurriedly; and, loosing {{her hand}} from his arm, <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> down <b>her</b> veil and {{vanished}} inside the building.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> away <b>her</b> hand. [...] "Do it always!" [...] She bounded to meet Sir Claude, and as {{she left}} the Captain she heard him ring out with {{apparent}} gaiety: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> {{hands away}} and flung {{them up to}} her face, her form shaken by stormy sobs. In {{distress}} {{he put his arm}} about her and drew her closer.|$|E
6000|$|Kitty {{looked after}} her {{affluent}} grandmother with eyes that stared respectfully in ignorant admiration. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> father's coat-tail, and addressed herself gravely to his private ear. [...] "Oh, papa, what noble words grandmamma has!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never can}} come out, {{for every one}} will hate me," [...] sobbed Bab among the straw, as <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> in <b>her</b> foot, as if {{retiring}} for ever from an outraged world.|$|R
40|$|The {{demonstrator}} {{sits on a}} stool that rotates on a low-friction bearing, holding weights out at arm's length, {{as shown}} in Figure 1. Upon being started into rotation by an assistant, the demonstrator pulls the weights in, decreasing her moment of inertia. Because moving her arms inward or outward involves no external torque, the angular momentum of the system remains constant. Therefore the angular speed of the demonstrator increases when <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> arms in and decreases when she pushes her arms out...|$|R
6000|$|Liza {{remained}} there, now shivering with cold, now panting for breath, {{listening to}} the regular, heavy breathing by her side, and in her pain <b>she</b> sobbed. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> at <b>her</b> pillow and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Jean Isbel {{was sweet}} on me, dad ... {{but he will}} never be again," [...] {{returned}} Ellen, in low tones. With that <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> saddle off Spades and, throwing it over her shoulder, she walked off to her cabin.|$|E
60|$|She cantered {{off down}} the drive {{and out of the}} gate, leaving a very puzzled young woman {{watching}} her from the window. But when Virginia reached the forest at the bend of the road, <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> horse down to a walk.|$|E
60|$|Of the passers-by that jostled them {{a couple}} had now paused {{to watch a}} scene that had {{an element of the}} unusual in it. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> wimple closer to her face, took him by the arm, and drew him with her into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] said she. [...] "How can {{you talk}} in that way, when my heart is bleeding,--bleeding." [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> away <b>her</b> hand, and again clasped it with the other upon her forehead.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the player}} decides that Nima should save Jess, <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> up while the embryo {{canister}} is crushed under the T. rex's foot. Gerry, Jess and Nima escape the island together.
