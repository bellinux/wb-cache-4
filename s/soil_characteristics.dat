25|$|With the {{exception}} of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more {{than in any other}} field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between soil moisture and soil matric suction is called <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve, which its measurement is time-consuming and expensive. One of the estimation methods of <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve {{is using the}} soil particle size distribution curve and bulk density which contains a scaling parameter (). In this study, 10 soil samples were selected from Marvdasht region in Fars province, and soil texture and <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve of each soil were measured. Then, the soil particle size distribution curve of each soil was estimated based on Fooladmand and Sepaskhah model (FS) and Fooladmand and Mansuri model (FM), and also eight methods were used for determining the scaling parameter including linear procedure with constant void ratio (N), logistic procedure with constant void ratio (G), linear procedure with local void ratio (LN), logistic procedure with local void ratio (LG), Alfa- 1 (A 1), Alfa- 2 (A 2), Alfa- 3 (A 3) and Alfa- 4 (A 4). Therefore, the <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve of each soil was estimated with 16 different methods, {{and all of them}} were compared with measured <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve data. For this purpose, Standard error (SE), geometric mean error ratio (GMER) and geometric standard deviation of the error ratio (GSDER) were used. The results sowed that the FM model for estimating the soil particle size distribution curve and then estimation the <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve was better than the FS model. In general, the results indicated that the procedures of FM-A 1, FM-A 2, FM-A 3, FM-N and FM-LN were appropriate for estimating the <b>soil</b> moisture <b>characteristic</b> curve...|$|R
40|$|Investigating the {{influences}} of <b>soil</b> <b>characteristic</b> factors on dinoseb adsorption parameter with different statistical methods would be valuable to explicitly figure out the extent of these influences. The correlation coefficients and the direct, indirect effects of <b>soil</b> <b>characteristic</b> factors on dinoseb adsorption parameter were analyzed through bivariate correlation analysis, and path analysis. With stepwise regression analysis the factors which had little influence on the adsorption parameter were excluded. Results indicate that pH and CEC had moderate relationship and lower direct effect on dinoseb adsorption parameter due to the multicollinearity with other soil factors, and organic carbon and clay contents {{were found to be}} the most significant soil factors which affect the dinoseb adsorption process. A regression is thereby set up to explore the relationship between the dinoseb adsorption parameter and the two soil factors: the soil organic carbon and clay contents.

25|$|The {{pollutant}} {{creates a}} contaminant plume within an aquifer. Movement {{of water and}} dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area. Its advancing boundary, often called a plume edge, can intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and spring, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater pollution may focus on <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> and site geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, {{and the nature of}} the contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} primary {{function}} {{of being the}} discharge of treated stormwater, infiltration systems are generally positioned as the final element in a WSUD system. Infiltration trenches should not be located on steep slopes or unstable areas. A layer of geotextile fabric {{is often used to}} line the trench in order to prevent the soil from migrating into the rock or gravel fill. Infiltration systems are dependent on the local <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> and are generally best suited to soils with good infiltrative capacity, such as sandy-loam soils, with deep groundwater. In areas of low permeability soils, such as clay, a perforated pipe may be placed within the gravel.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{groundwater}} {{and surface}} water are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, {{also referred to}} as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. By its very nature, groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies, and the distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. A spill or ongoing release of chemical or radionuclide contaminants into soil (located away from a surface water body) may not create point or non-point source pollution but can contaminate the aquifer below, creating a toxic plume. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> and site geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, {{and the nature of the}} contaminants.|$|E

40|$|Permeability {{coefficients}} of fluids occupying the pore {{space of a}} porous medium have significant influence on the flow of these fluids through the porous medium. In the case of unsaturated soils, {{in addition to other}} parameters such as void ratio, void distribution, particle size distribution and initial density the degree of saturation also affects the permeability coefficient of water. The degree of saturation, in unsaturated soil, {{is directly related to the}} matric suction of the soil through <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve. Matric suction is one of the two stress state variables widely used to characterize the deformation behavior of unsaturated soils. Therefore, it can be stated that both flow and deformation behaviors of unsaturated soil are affected by the permeability coefficient of water. Numerical modeling of coupled deformation-flow behavior of unsaturated soil requires a mathematical equation that relates the permeability coefficient to the degree of saturation. Since the parameters that affect the permeability coefficient of water in unsaturated soil have similar direct or indirect effects on the <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve, permeability can be effectively predicted using the <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve as done in statistical models. In this paper, a statistical model is proposed for the permeability of water in unsaturated soil using <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve of the soil. The calibrated parameters of the <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve are directly used in the prediction of permeability with- ou...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve {{shows the}} {{relationship}} between soil water content and matric suction, which has {{an important role in}} water movement in the soil. The measurement of this curve is expensive and time-consuming in laboratory; therefore, many methods have been proposed for its estimation including pedotransfer functions. By using the pedotransfer functions, <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve can be estimated based on other easily measured soil physicochemical properties. Parametric pedotransfer functions have been offered for parameters of the existing <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve models. In this study, 12 internal and external parametric pedotransfer functions of Brooks and Corey, Campbell and van Genuchten models were used and evaluated for 30 top soil samples in Fars province. To this end, the <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve and other necessary soil properties were measured, and then all soils according to the texture were divided into three groups of fine, medium and course textures. The results showed that the parametric pedotransfer functions of van Genuchten model were better than the other models, beacause of the better fit of this model to the measured data. Also, the results demonstrated that the parametric pedotransfer functions of Wosten et al. were the most appropriate method for estimating the <b>soil</b> water <b>characteristic</b> curve for the selected soils in Fars province, and that internal pedotransfer functions were not appropriat...|$|R

2500|$|Restoration {{failures}} {{may occur}} when appropriate ecosystem conditions are not reestablished, such as <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> (e.g., salinity, pH, beneficial soil biota, etc.), surface water and groundwater levels, and flow regimes.

For example, restoration of soil biota, including symbiotic myccorhizae, invertebrates, and microorganisms may improve nutrient cycling dynamics. [...] Restoration of physical processes may be a prerequisite to the reestablishment of healthy riparian communities. Ultimately, a combination of approaches taking into account causes for degradation and targeting both hydrology and the reestablishment of vegetation and other life forms may be most effective in riparian zone restoration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four soil series recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics,</b> its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, consistence, pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs. [...] The San Joaquin soil was first recognized in the survey of the Fresno Area in 1900.|$|E
