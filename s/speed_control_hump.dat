40|$|Most {{passenger}} {{and goods}} traffic goes by road. Of all the systems with which {{people have to}} deal every day, road traffic systems are the most complex and the most dangerous. One of the main concerns to tackle unsafe roads and decrease casualties, is controlling the driving speed. Traffic calming refers {{to a combination of}} engineering measures and urban planning to enhance road safety as well as other aspects of livability for residents. This academic research project, instituted by University College Ghent (Belgium) in association with Ghent University (B), explores the infrastructural measures that enforce or support an appropriate speed for the local environment and road users in urban areas. Because of the relatively fast and simple implementation, speed control humps are frequently used as a short-term solution for areas with dangerous road situations. Only traffic calming methods are more than just implanting speed control humps. Are they so effective and acceptable as for a long-term result? Only a profound evaluation of speed platforms, on traffic related as well as environmental field, can initiate new developments and improved regulations in speed control impact. Various aspects of the <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>hump</b> concerning the geometric structure, the speed reduction, vibration effect, noise production, etc. will be investigated to lead this broadly-based PhD study to favorable conclusions...|$|E
40|$|When {{vehicles}} are driven on consecutive <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps,</b> {{the parameters of}} <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps</b> such as height, width, and space and vehicle’s speed are the important factors to affect safety and comfort of passengers. The paper assumes that the excitation function of the consecutive <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps</b> is a half-sine wave and a SCHs-speed coupling excitation model called 7 -DOF nonlinear full-vehicle model and differential equation are established by introducing the time delay of incentive input and then by using numerical simulation to analyze chaotic vibration in 7 -DOF nonlinear full-vehicle model excited by consecutive <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps.</b> The numerical simulation results show that chaotic vibration phenomenon possibly appears as {{vehicles are}} driven on consecutive <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps.</b> Further studies indicate that the influence of nonlinear running state of vehicle on driving comfort becomes manifest as the state changes from chaotic motions to the periodic motion of the high speed and the periodic motion of the low speed, and this phenomenon can be avoided by changing the parameters of consecutive <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps.</b> The results can be applied in design of vehicle and road humps pavement...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of hump parameters (cross section, dimensions, spacing, etc.) on the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle and the driver. Vehicle safety and driver comfort are most important in evaluating the effectiveness of <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps.</b> A mathematical model representing the vehicle and the driver is developed. Several hump profiles are tried. A "basic" hump is selected and the effects of the individual parameters of the hump on the dynamic response of the system are evaluated through the computer simulation.

40|$|Streets {{in which}} the people live must not only give {{possibilities}} of reaching the destination by motorized traffic. They have many other functions. Children must play, cyclists and pedestrians must have their rights, {{there must be a}} place for recreation and there must be a place for parking. To achieve all this, physical measures are needed which influence the traffic behaviour and increase the traffic safety. One of these measures is the construction of <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps.</b> From the literature it is shown that these humps can decrease the driving speed of the motorized traffic; they can avoid rat runs; they must not be allowed to lead to more traffic noise; they can influence pedestrian behaviour in a positive way and they can influence traffic safety in a positive way in certain circumstances...|$|R
30|$|The {{problem of}} car <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> at <b>humps</b> was {{considered}} by Bessonenko et al. [9]. They proposed {{to set the}} cut exit speed from the first braking position, proceeding from the conditions of preserving the initial interval between the cuts at the hump top and ensuring their separation at the second brake position, and the braking mode at the second position—from the condition of cut separation at the switches. Some other researchers [10, 11] proposed {{to solve the problem}} of controlling the car rolling speed at the humps based on neural network training. The problem with this approach is that the methods based on the use of neural networks are heuristic and often lead to ambiguous solutions; as a result, the behavior of the trained neural network cannot always be clearly predicted. This increases the risk of their use in real-time systems related to traffic safety.|$|R

Each type of existing roads in the urban area (the main street, {{the road in the}} neighborhood, residential shared street) can be, step by step, reconstructed with individual structural elements to ensure greater safety for pedestrians and cyclists, the economic efficiency of the road and creates vibrant community spaces for the welfare of people and local economic activities. By changing the width of the travel lane, sidewalks, curb radius turn, chicanes and the use of vertical <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> elements (<b>speed</b> <b>humps,</b> speed tables, speed cushions, dedicated bus lanes) we influence on greater visibility in the intersection and reducing the driving speed.

40|$|An {{important}} part within {{developments in the}} field of telematics is Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA). Especially in Sweden, where the policy objective is to have zero fatalities or seriously injured victims on the road in 2020, research has been conducted on ISA during the last 10 years. In the Netherlands an experiment is planned in a new district of the city of Tilburg. Intelligent Speed Adaption (ISA) can be done in several ways: (a) the driver is provided continuously with information about local speed limits; (b) the driver is warned when speeding by sound or light signals; and (c) the system reacts automatically to make speeding impossible (through counterpressure of the accelerator or reduction in fuel supply). There are different ways in which information about local speed limits can be obtained: (i) by manual adjustment of a maximum level by the driver; (ii) by a signal to the vehicle, from a beacon along the road driven on; and (iii) an autonomous system in which the road network and relevant speed limit data is stored in the vehicle and in which the vehicle is located by a Global Positioning System (GPS). It is therefore known at every moment where the vehicle is, and what speed limit is. Current dat can be transmitted to the vehicle, so that a lower speed limit is installed as soon as, for example, there are road works ahead or poor weather conditions. In some new cars, especially the more expensive brands, a maximum speed can be manually adjusted. A warning signal is given when this speed is exceeded. Some systems even make braking the adjusted speed limit impossible because the fuel supply is automatically cut off. An important question {{is the extent to which}} ISA is accepted by the driver. From Swedish research it is known that after experiencing ISA's obligatory speed reduction, the acceptance is greater than beforehand. When car drivers have the choice between an ISA system and <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> <b>humps</b> (and other infrastructural measures), they choose for ISA. In general, a warning system is preferred above a system limiting speed. The acceptance is greater when the problem situations are recognizable: in residential areas, on roads where fast and slow traffic are not separated, at the approach of complex intersections, at road works, and during bad weather conditions, etc. ISA also influences driver behaviour. The effects found are: average speed reduced by a few km/h, driving at a constant speed, increase in travel time by 9 %, and increased alertness towards other road users. In Sweden preparations are being made for large scale experiments in several towns, where the beacons as well as autonomous system will be tested. For the Tilburg experiment SWOV has made the research design. How exactly the experiment will be conducted is not yet known. Testing a mixed system - both beacons and autonomous - appears to be desirable. The advantage is that mobile beacons can be used under changing conditions such as road works. Regulations on ISA should be international. That is why research and testing should be conducted in an international framework. On the short term it is expected that more and more new cars will be equipped with a manual speeding warning and also systems in which a voluntary manual speed limit cannot be exceeded. The navigation systems that can be bought nowadays use a CD-ROM and a Global Positioning System (GPS). In the not too distant future they can easily be extended with ISA. In the future it is possible to imagine a mandatorily selective application of ISA. It can be applied, for example, to notorious speeders. ISA could also be used in cars of young drivers. Young drivers have, namely, a relatively large chance of being involved in a road accident. Speeding could be one of the causes. It is evidently clear to begin with applying the automatic systems of ISA in residential and municipal areas, because there a many vulnerable road users in such areas. The public acceptance there will also be the highest. Then followed by the 60 km/h and 80 km/h roads on which many conflict situations between rapid and slow traffic occur, as well as mutually between different types of rapid traffic.
