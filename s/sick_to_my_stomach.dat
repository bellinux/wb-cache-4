60|$|Thus were {{my hopes}} again revived that I should finally meet with an {{opportunity}} to quit the desolate island. Beyond doubt these seas were frequented by whalemen, and, so long as I kept up a stout heart, sooner or later I should be saved. For seven years I had lived on seal meat, so that at sight of the enormous plentitude of different and succulent food I fell a victim <b>to</b> <b>my</b> weakness and ate of such quantities that once again I was well nigh to dying.

Hog and hominy are not only inartistic <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> but they give indigestion <b>to</b> <b>my</b> moral sentiments. And I thought of Colonel Jackson T. Rockingham, president of the Sunrise & Edenville Tap Railroad, and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy Southerners.

But on this evening, I looked at Galbraith and saw an opportunity to take the leaps I have always craved. My hope was that by being bold and brave in these halls, I could transform into the human I wished to be outside the building. 	The more I challenged myself to make choices that scared me, the more joy I found in the leap. Yes, I was often missing the mark but I was also reaching new glorious heights. 	If existing in the uncomfortable was the barometer for this new way of life, then there was no greater test then that of MOVERS AND SHAKERS. I felt <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> every day in rehearsal. However, three years in, I knew I had solid training as my foundation and two years of practice in being brave.
