5|$|Superman the Ride, {{along with}} Millennium Force, have held {{the top two}} spots in the Golden Ticket Awards poll every year since 2001. Superman the Ride is praised by the roller coaster community, and the ride is noted for its <b>smoothness</b> and large amount of airtime.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialized}} test train, Dasye set744 in a commemorative livery, {{arrived to}} conduct the fourth phase of testing, which began on 28 September 2015. During this phase, more than 200 test runs would be performed on the line. The test runs would test ride <b>smoothness,</b> performance of the catenary, radio communications, and the signalling system. During some runs, the test train would operate at 10% above the planned operational speeds for the line when it enters service. Some automated safety systems were disabled to allow the test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions. Orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between January and March 2016 {{prior to the start}} of commercial service on the line, which was scheduled for 3 April 2016 at the time of the accident. In January 2016, SNCF announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until to 3 July 2016.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the <b>smoothness</b> of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and <b>smoothness</b> of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and <b>smoothness</b> of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|The PS4 {{version of}} Leifthrasir {{received}} an aggregate score of 87/100 based on 49 reviews, becoming the 15th best-reviewed title of 2016. The Vita version received {{a score of}} 93/100 based on five reviews. Reviewing Leifthrasir, Famitsu praised the increased <b>smoothness</b> and battle frequency, noting that the title still felt fresh despite being the remake of a 2007 title. They also praised the graphical upgrade {{and its effect on}} the artwork. Critics generally agreed that Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its technical performance, lack of the original's framerate problems, graphical upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation.|$|E

25|$|To make {{ice cream}} smooth, {{recrystallization}} must occur {{as slowly as}} possible, because small crystals create <b>smoothness,</b> meaning that r must decrease.|$|E
25|$|In this {{magnified}} view, {{it becomes}} clear that, while the overall <b>smoothness</b> of the text seems to improve, there is also color fringing of the text.|$|E
25|$|Choose a <b>smoothness</b> bound B. The number π(B), {{denoting}} {{the number}} of prime numbers less than B, will control both {{the length of the}} vectors and {{the number of}} vectors needed.|$|E
25|$|Singeing is {{designed}} to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce <b>smoothness.</b> The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames.|$|E
25|$|A {{dress shirt}} is {{typically}} ironed {{to remove any}} wrinkles and can be treated with starch for added <b>smoothness</b> and stiffness. There are also cotton shirts available in the market which do not require ironing.|$|E
25|$|The running walk, a four-beat lateral gait with footfalls in {{the same}} {{sequence}} as the regular walk, but characterized by greater speed and <b>smoothness.</b> It is a distinctive natural gait of the Tennessee Walking Horse.|$|E
25|$|In {{watching}} George at {{work one}} was conscious {{not so much}} of physical strength as of suppleness and balance; so rhythmical and harmonious was his progress in any steep place... that his movements appeared almost serpentine in their <b>smoothness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, UFDs arise {{because of}} <b>smoothness.</b> More precisely, {{a point in}} a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at the point is a regular local ring. A regular local ring is a UFD.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} 15th century, oil {{paintings}} were generally {{done in a}} meticulous manner that simulated the <b>smoothness</b> and luminescent layering of tempera. In the 16th century {{the handling of the}} paint became freer and painters exploited the possibility of laying paint on in broad, visible and varied brushstrokes.|$|E
25|$|In PLD, a large {{supersaturation}} {{occurs on}} the substrate during the pulse duration. The pulse lasts around 10–40 microseconds {{depending on the}} laser parameters. This high supersaturation causes a very large nucleation density on the surface as compared to molecular beam epitaxy or sputtering deposition. This nucleation density increases the <b>smoothness</b> of the deposited film.|$|E
25|$|Metaxa's <b>smoothness</b> {{comes from}} its Muscat wine. The {{resulting}} distillates {{are kept in}} cellars, in limousin French oak barrels. French barrels are considered more desirable than those made in North America since French Oak has smaller pores than its American counterpart. This slows the transfer of flavor between the barrel and the liquor contained within.|$|E
25|$|The CB750 was {{the first}} modern four-cylinder machine from a {{mainstream}} manufacturer, and the term superbike was coined to describe it. Adding to the bike's value were its electric starter, kill switch, dual mirrors, flashing turn signals, easily maintained valves, and overall <b>smoothness</b> and low vibration both under way and at a standstill. Much-later models from 1991 included maintenance-free hydraulic valves.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{quality is}} judged by <b>smoothness,</b> friction, hardness, and brittleness. Factors {{affecting}} ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, an ice temperature of 24°F (-4°C) is generally preferred. Typically after every two warm-up groups, an ice resurfacer cleans and smooths {{the surface of}} the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters' performances.|$|E
25|$|From about 1615, the potters {{began to}} coat their pots {{completely}} in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They {{then began to}} cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and <b>smoothness</b> to cobalt blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the money}} market {{practitioners}} might use different techniques to solve for {{different areas of}} the curve. For example, at the short end of the curve, where there are few cashflows, the first few elements of P may be found by bootstrapping from one to the next. At the long end, a regression technique with a cost function that values <b>smoothness</b> might be used.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, the {{advancing}} rear hoof oversteps {{the spot where}} the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the <b>smoothness</b> of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.|$|E
25|$|Real {{analysis}} (traditionally, {{the theory}} of functions of a real variable) is a branch of mathematical analysis dealing with the real numbers and real-valued functions of a real variable. In particular, it deals with the analytic properties of real functions and sequences, including convergence and limits of sequences of real numbers, the calculus of the real numbers, and continuity, <b>smoothness</b> and related properties of real-valued functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} tungsten deposition from the WF6/SiH4 are high speed, good adhesion and layer <b>smoothness.</b> The drawbacks are explosion hazard and high {{sensitivity of the}} deposition rate and morphology to the process parameters, such as mixing ratio, substrate temperature, etc. Therefore, silane is commonly {{used to create a}} thin tungsten nucleation layer. It is then switched to hydrogen, that slows down the deposition and cleans up the layer.|$|E
25|$|ClearType {{uses this}} method {{to improve the}} <b>smoothness</b> of text. When the {{elements}} of a type character are smaller than a full pixel, ClearType lights only the appropriate subpixels of each full pixel in order to more closely follow the outlines of that character. Text rendered with ClearType looks “smoother” than text rendered without it, provided that the pixel layout of the display screen exactly matches what ClearType expects.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{geometry}} views a {{plane as}} a 2-dimensional real manifold, a topological plane which {{is provided with}} a differential structure. Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but {{there is now a}} concept of <b>smoothness</b> of maps, for example a differentiable or smooth path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} subfield of numerical analysis, a B-spline, or basis spline, is a spline function that has minimal support {{with respect to}} a given degree, <b>smoothness,</b> and domain partition. Any spline function of given degree can be expressed as a linear combination of B-splines of that degree. Cardinal B-splines have knots that are equidistant from each other. B-splines can be used for curve-fitting and numerical differentiation of experimental data.|$|E
25|$|A piecewise/composite Bézier {{curve is}} a series of Bézier curves joined with at least C0 {{continuity}} (the last point of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve). Depending on the application, additional <b>smoothness</b> requirements (such as C1 or C2 continuity) may be added. C1 continuous curves have identical tangents at the breakpoint (where the two curves meet). C2 continuous curves have identical curvature at the breakpoint.|$|E
25|$|The Feature Twirler {{position}} {{offers one}} of the most prestigious twirling opportunities in the country. Through competitive auditions for one-year appointments, nationally recognized twirlers are used prominently during all Sun Devil Marching Band shows. Handling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures, and patterns, executed with dexterity, <b>smoothness,</b> fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air.|$|E
25|$|Statues of elephants, which symbolize {{independence}} and power, are seen {{all around the}} complex. As Thai kings fought wars mounted on elephants, it has become customary for parents to make their children circumambulate the elephant three times {{with the belief that}} it would bring them strength. The head of an elephant statue is also rubbed for good luck; this act of the people is reflected in the <b>smoothness</b> of the surface of elephant statues here.|$|E
25|$|Given {{an integer}} n {{that will be}} factored, where n is an odd {{positive}} integer greater than a certain constant. In this factoring algorithm the discriminant Δ is chosen as a multiple of n, , where d is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one d there exist enough smooth forms in GΔ. Lenstra and Pomerance show that the choice of d can be restricted to a small set to guarantee the <b>smoothness</b> result.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining {{to restore the}} desired track geometry and <b>smoothness</b> of vehicle running. Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a resilient pad).|$|E
