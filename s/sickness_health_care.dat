40|$|ABSTRACT Health {{is clearly}} not the mere absence of disease. Good health confers on a person of groups freedom from illness – {{and the ability to}} realize ones potential. As human beings, we are at, all times prone to falling sick or getting a disease. Sometimes even a change inthe weather causes <b>sickness.</b> <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> is very {{expensive}} nowadays. More than the disease itself, it is oftenthe cost of treatment that takes its toll. Health insurance policy covers medical expenses incurred during pre and post hospitalizationstages. Health Insurance is an emerging social security instrument for the rural poor, for whom, chronic healthproblems, arising due to prevalence of diseases and inaccessibility to an affordable health care system is a major threat totheir income earning capacity...|$|E

40|$|Background: Because of {{the aging}} working {{population}} and the increasing age of retirement {{the number of workers}} with chronic illnesses and disabilities is growing. It is important that workers with health complaints receive efficient <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in order to remain fully or at least partly productive. Objective: To explore workers' opinions about the effectiveness of contact with <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers in shortening sickness absence duration. Methods: Data come from a four-wave study from 2005 to 2008 among Dutch workers (n= 1, 424). Data were obtained on visits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers, <b>sickness</b> absence and workers' opinions on whether and how their absence could have been shortened. Results: A third of the workers were of the opinion that the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> provider (most often the general practitioner, GP) had played a role in preventing sickness absence and 35 % were of the opinion that the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> provider had limited their absence. Most often the physical therapist (71 %) and mental health therapist (61 %) shortened sickness absence duration, in contrast to the occupational physician (OP, 25 %) and GP (32 %). The effectiveness of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers' treatment was associated with the cause of sickness absence. Approximately 15 % of the workers reported that their sickness absence could have been shortened if <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers had provided the proper treatment and if waiting times had been reduced. Conclusions: <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> providers differ in their potential to shorten <b>sickness</b> absence duration. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> providers can further reduce <b>sickness</b> absence and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs by providing the proper treatment and by reducing waiting times...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{is unclear}} whether the {{well-known}} risk factors for the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) also {{play an important role}} in the determining consequences of MSD in terms of <b>sickness</b> absence and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> use. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 853 shipyard employees. Data were collected by questionnaire on physical and psychosocial workload, need for recovery, perceived general health, occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints, and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> use during the past year. Retrospective data on absenteeism were also available from the company register. Results In total, 37 %, 22 %, and 15 % of employees reported complaints of low back, shoulder/neck, and hand/wrist during the past 12 months, respectively. Among all employees with at least one MSD, 27 % visited a physician at least once and 20 % took at least one period of sick leave. Various individual and work-related factors were associated with the occurrence of MSD. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> use and absenteeism were strongest influenced by chronicity of musculoskeletal complaints and comorbidity with other musculoskeletal complaints and, to a lesser extent, by work-related factors. Conclusion In programmes aimed at preventing the unfavourable consequences of MSD in terms of <b>sickness</b> absence and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> use it is important to identify the (individual) factors that determine the development of chronicity of complaints. These factors may differ from the well-know risk factors for the occurrence of MSD that are targeted in primary prevention. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. In Sweden 10 percent (550, 000) of {{the labour}} force, aged 18 to 65 years are {{disability}} pensioners and about four percent are on sick leave. The {{knowledge of the}} course from healthy individual to disability pensioner is not well known and was {{the theme of this}} thesis. Objectives, Material and Methods. The aims of the thesis were to follow the study population regarding <b>sickness</b> absence, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation, quality of life, and survival. Population based data including 14, 538 women and men from three cities in Sweden were used, of whom 1, 952 were granted a disability pension at baseline or received one during follow up. Register data, including <b>sickness</b> spells, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation, and mortality data during 30 years of follow up, and questionnaire data including socio-economic and quality of life data were used. Results. The most powerful determinant for being granted a disability pension was cumulative annual sick leave days, more powerful than all other tested determinants together. The degree of explanation for all determinants combined was 96 %. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation among disability pensioners continued to be high also after disability pension, 2. 3 times higher for hospital admissions and 8 times higher for primary health case appointments than among referents. Disability pensioners had lower quality of life than non-pensioners and old age pensioners. For those who became disability pensioners after the baseline measurements quality of life measures decreased progressively until disability pension was granted and were then stabilised on a low level. During follow up 525 (7. 6 %) subjects died. Compared with subjects who did not become disability pensioners the hazards ratio was 2. 78 among women and 3. 43 among men, even when the effect of a number of other outcome affecting variables were taken into account. The mortality differences were not explained by underlying disease. Conclusions. The risk of disability pension may be predicted but only late in the course of events. Disability pensioners continue to have a high level of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation, and have a worse quality of life development and a higher mortality rate than non-pensioners. Given the unfavourable outcome of disability pension, other means of managing the reduced work capacity might be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} guiding <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{reforms in}} Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands were {{to increase efficiency}} and consumer satisfaction {{in the provision of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services. This paper sums up incentives and instruments of competition for consumers, <b>sickness</b> funds and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands which are necessary to fulfill these objectives. Incentives for risk selection of sickness funds are high in Germany and Switzerland while they are low in the Netherlands. Incentives for consumer choice are also highest in Germany and Switzerland.

40|$|This {{study is}} an effort to assess whether the concept of 'migration personality' applies in the context of Eastern Nigerian urban dwellers. <b>Sickness</b> and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{behaviour}} is compared between two groups [...] migrant urban households living in Uyo and Calabar and non-migrant rural households living in Ediene and Ibiono. The respondents' conceptions and perceptions of illness, disease and health as well as the medical services frequently used are analysed. The findings tend to confirm the existence of marked differences in disease beliefs and related <b>health</b> <b>care</b> behaviour in the two groups. These differences are crystallised along residency, socio-economic, age and income characteristics. The implication of the study is that even though it is not possible meanwhile to determine whether migration is an independent or intervening variable, or one of several other and inter-related variables, the fact that rural-urban migrants are so prone to modern medical practices, raises the desirability of using them as a target population for primary acceptance of modern medical programmes such as those concerning family planning, child nutrition and health. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a summary and four papers. The first two concerns <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and <b>sickness</b> absence, and the last two pharmaceutical costs and prices. Paper [I] presents an economic federation model which resembles the situation in, for example, Sweden. In the model the state governments provide <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> the federal government provides a sickness benefit and both levels tax labor income. The {{results show that the}} states can have either an incentive to under- or over-provide <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> The federal government can, by introducing an intergovernmental transfer, induce the state governments to provide the socially optimal amount of <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> In Paper [II] the effect of aggregated public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> expenditure on absence from work due to sickness or disability was estimated. The analysis was based on data from a panel of the Swedish municipalities for the period 1993 - 2004. Public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> expenditure was found to have no statistically significant effect on absence and the standard errors were small enough to rule out all but a minimal effect. The result held when separate estimations were conducted for women and men, and for absence due to sickness and disability. The purpose of Paper [III] was to study the effects of the introduction of fixed pharmaceutical budgets for two health centers in Västerbotten, Sweden. Estimation results using propensity score matching methods show that there are no systematic differences for either price or quantity per prescription between health centers using fixed and open-ended budgets. The analysis was based on individual prescription data from the two health centers and a control group {{both before and after the}} introduction of fixed budgets. In Paper [IV] the introduction of the Swedish substitution reform in October 2002 was used as a natural experiment to examine the effects of increased consumer information on pharmaceutical prices. Using monthly data on individual pharmaceutical prices, the average reduction of prices due to the reform was estimated to four percent for both brand name and generic pharmaceuticals during the first four years after the reform. The results also show that the price adjustment was not instant. vertical fiscal externalities; sickness absence; <b>sickness</b> benefits; <b>health</b> <b>care</b> expenditure; fixed budgets; pharmaceuticals; cost containment; dynamic panel data models; endogeneity; propensity score matching...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Workers {{with common}} mental {{disorders}} (CMDs) frequently experience recurrent sickness absence but scientifically evaluated interventions to prevent recurrences are lacking. The objectives {{of this study}} are to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of a problem solving intervention aimed at preventing recurrent sickness absence in workers with CMDs compared to care as usual. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a cluster-randomised controlled trial with 12 months follow-up. Treatment providers were randomised to either a 2 -day training in the SHARP-at work intervention, i. e. a problem solving intervention, or care as usual. Effect outcomes were the incidence of recurrent sickness absence and time to recurrent <b>sickness</b> absence. Self-reported <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation was measured by questionnaires. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from the societal perspective and a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) from the employer’s perspective were conducted. Results: The CEA showed that the SHARP-at work intervention was more effective but also more expensive than care as usual. The CBA revealed that employer’s occupational <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to care as usual. Overall, the SHARP-at work intervention showed no economic benefit compared to care as usual...|$|R
40|$|Depression ranges {{among the}} {{leading causes of}} early exit from the labor market worldwide. We aimed to {{investigate}} the associations of socio-demographic factors, <b>sickness</b> absence, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and prescription patterns with {{the risk of being}} granted a disability pension in psychiatric outpatients with depression. All non-retired patients aged 18 - 60 years and living in Sweden 31. 12. 2005 with at least one psychiatric outpatient care visit due to a depressive episode during 2006 (N =  18, 034) : were followed from 01. 01. 2007 to 31. 12. 2010 with regard to granting of all-cause and diagnosis-specific disability pension. Uni- and multivariate Rate Ratios (RR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) were estimated for the various risk markers by Poisson Regression. During the four years of follow-up, 3044 patients (16. 8 %) were granted a disability pension, the majority due to mental disorders (2558, 84 %). In the multivariate analyses, being female, below 25 or above 45 years of age, with low educational level, living alone, residing outside big cities and being born outside Europe were predictive of a granted disability pension. Frequent in- and outpatient care due to mental disorders, prescription of antidepressants and long sickness absence spells were also associated with an increased risk of disability pension (range of RRs 1. 10 to 5. 26). Somatic <b>health</b> <b>care</b> was only predictive of disability pension due to somatic disorders. The risk of being granted a disability pension remained at the same level as at the start of follow-up for about 1. 5 years, when it started to decrease and to level off at about 20 % of the risk at the end of follow-up. Identified risk markers should be considered when monitoring individuals with depression and when designing intervention programs...|$|R
40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to show that a well-designed Welfare State is a {{fundamental}} fiscal policy instrument which allows mending of the main shortcomings of the market mechanism, i. e. lack of Stability, Inequality, disregard of Needs, lack of economic Security: in short, we call them the market’s SINS. We show how the family is the main agent for an effective Welfare State, as the firms are for the market. We use detailed data on all the European countries to characterize the different models of welfare within Europe. A cross-section analysis shows that the main goals are better achieved when the social protection benefits focus on the functions of family and children, <b>sickness</b> and <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> because they induce the greatest poverty reduction. We show that for families with children the better working arrangement – which is associated with higher GDP per capita and lower inequality – is one parent working full-time and one parent part-time. We quantify the cross-section variability related to the age structure for the function of pensions. For a sample of seven major European countries we measure the degree of pro-cyclical or countercyclical relationship between social protection expenditures and GDP per capita from 1995 to 2010. In Germany, a Keynesian economic policy in 2009 is associated with a sharp rebound in 2010. We measure the relationship between Welfare State benefits and public budget, given as a constraint.

40|$|Background: The most {{important}} attribute {{to which all}} human beings aspire is good health because it enables us to undertake different forms of activities of daily living. The emergence of scientific knowledge in Western societies has enabled scientists to explore and define several parameters of health by drawing boundaries around factors that are known to influence the attainment of good health. For example, the World Health Organization defined health by taking physical and psychological factors into consideration. Their definition of health also included a caveat that says, “not merely the absence of sickness. ” This definition has guided scientists and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers in the Western world {{in the development of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> programs in non-Western societies. Objective: However, ethnomedical beliefs about the cause(s) of illness have given rise to alternative theories of <b>health,</b> <b>sickness,</b> and treatment approaches in the developing world. Thus, there is another side to the story. Method: Much of the population in developing countries lives in rural settings where the knowledge of <b>health,</b> <b>sickness,</b> and <b>care</b> has evolved over centuries of practice and experience. The definition of health in these settings tends to orient toward cultural beliefs, traditional practices, and social relationships. Invariably, whereas biomedicine is the dominant medical system in Western societies, traditional medicine — or ethno-medicine — is often the first port of call for patients in developing countries. Results: The 2 medical systems represent, and are influenced by, the cultural environment in which they exist. On one hand, biomedicine is very effective in the treatment of objective, measurable disease conditions. On the other hand, ethnomedicine is effective in the management of illness conditions or the experience of disease states. Nevertheless, an attempt to supplant 1 system of care with another from a different cultural environment could pose enormous challenges in non-Western societies. Conclusion: In general, we, as human beings, are guided in our <b>health</b> <b>care</b> decisions by past experiences, family and friends, social networks, cultural beliefs, customs, tradition, professional knowledge, and intuition. No medical system has been shown to address all of these elements; hence, the need for collaboration, acceptance, and partnership between all systems of care in cultural communities. In developing countries, the roads to health are incomplete without an examination of the intersection of culture and healing. Perhaps mutual exclusiveness rather inclusiveness of these 2 dominant health systems is the greatest obstacle to health in developing countries...|$|R

The analysis finds evidence of significant inefficiencies in Croatia''s spending on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and education, related to inadequate cost recovery, weaknesses in the financing mechanisms and institutional arrangements, weak competition {{in the provision of}} these services, and weaknesses in targeting public subsidies on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and education. These inefficiencies suggest that government spending on health and education could be reduced without undue sacrifices in the quality of these services. The paper identifies ways to do that.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} European Welfare State {{according}} to a theoretical framawork based on four main social goals – stability, inequality, need, safety (SINS) – which the market mechanism fail to achieve: they are the market’s SINS. We propose a theoretical framework {{which is based on}} the distinction between “private goods”, which are the domain of the market, and “common goods”, which are the the domain of the Welfare State and the other lower layers of social institutions. The main result is that a high level of social protection benefits, properly allocated to these goals, can be effective for achieving economic goals, because it allows to amend market’s shortcoming for SINS, while allowing the flexibility for complying with the public budget constraint, given the positive relationship between GDP per-capita and the share of social protection benefits. A cross-section analysis shows that the goals of SINS are better achieved when the social protection benefit focuses on the functions of family and children and <b>sickness</b> and <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> because they are the most poverty reduction: they allow to better achieve the goal of reducing inequality and providing families needs. We show that for the families with children the better working arrangement – which is associated with higher GDP per-capita and lower inequality – is one parent working full time and one parent part-time. We explain the cross-section variability for the functions of pensions, housing and social exclusions in relationship with the goals of stability and and safety. We analysis a sample of seven major European countries for the period 1995 - 2009, focusing on the goal of economic stability and the degree of procyciclical or countercyclical relationship between social protection expenditures and GDP per-capita. A number of econometric and numerical results are derived: countries with better economic performances can have both procyclical and countercyclical behavior, but they have in common higher value of social protec-tion benefits on the onset of the cyclical downturn or recession: the flexibility for budget adjustment come from the political leeway of the high starting value of social protection and the higher share of in-kind benefits. The GDP per-capita in the year 2000 is a good predictor of the average primary balances for the European countries over the decade...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} interest in universal <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> {{little is known}} about the optimal way to finance, design, and implement it. This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing some general policy recommendations on this important issue. While most of the paper addresses the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries, its policy implications are applicable to any country. The paper finds that the best financing option is country-specificÂ¯depending on a country’s economic, cultural, institutional, demographic and epidemiological characteristics, as well as political economy considerations. However, taxation should be the primary financing source. It also concludes that an appropriate and realistic benefit package would need to be designed to ensure the system’s financial viability. Regarding the optimal way to implement universal <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> certain preconditions are needed, including sound public administration, a small informal economy, and a transparent health financing system that builds social consensus.
