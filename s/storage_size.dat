40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to the problem of optimal <b>sizing</b> of energy <b>storage</b> required for compensation of wind farm generation variability. Using wind farm production data from the BPA, we assess the effect of forecast quality and economic dispatch timing on the <b>size</b> of <b>storage</b> and critical power rating required to nearly perfectly match the committed energy. We develop a Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) based operational model following NERC standard recommendations. Different forecasts are considered and compared from the <b>storage</b> <b>sizing</b> perspective. The results of our simulations can be fit by two simple relations, connecting the <b>storage</b> <b>sizing</b> with forecast error, wind variability, and the timescales of scheduling. A more accurate forecast reduces the <b>storage</b> <b>sizing.</b> However, diminishing returns are observed when the forecast error becomes comparable to natural wind variability within the commitment time interval.

40|$|The {{wide range}} of {{performance}} characteristics of storage technologies motivates {{the use of a}} hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) that combines the best features of multiple technologies. However, HESS design is complex, in that it involves the choice of <b>storage</b> technologies, the <b>sizing</b> of each <b>storage</b> element, and deciding when to charge and discharge each underlying storage element (the operating strategy. We formulate the problem of jointly optimizing the sizing and the operating strategy of an HESS {{that can be used for}} a large class of applications and storage technologies. Instead of a single set of <b>storage</b> element <b>sizes,</b> our approach determines the Pareto-optimal frontier of the <b>sizes</b> of the <b>storage</b> elements along with the corresponding optimal operating strategy. Thus, as long as the performance objective of a storage application (such as an off-grid microgrid) can be expressed as a linear combination of the underlying <b>storage</b> <b>sizes,</b> the optimal vector of <b>storage</b> <b>sizes</b> falls somewhere on this frontier. We present two case studies to illustrate our approach, demonstrating that a single storage technology is sometimes inadequate to meet application requirements, unlike an HESS designed using our approach. We also find simple, near-optimal, and practical operating strategies for these case studies, which allows us to gain several new engineering insights...|$|R

2500|$|The smaller <b>storage</b> <b>size</b> of ROM {{cartridges}} {{limited the}} number of available textures.

Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include Resident Evil 2, Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth, and Conker's Bad Fur Day as they feature more ROM space, allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|Jürgen Schmidhuber's formal {{theory of}} {{creativity}} postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products {{of a simple}} computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model [...] "wow-effects." [...] This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even {{when there are no}} external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (<b>storage</b> <b>size,</b> number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present [...] "wow-effect" [...] due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are [...] "boring" [...] by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.|$|E
