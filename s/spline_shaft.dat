40|$|Abstract. <b>Spline</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is widely}} used {{as one of the}} {{important}} parts in machinery. Cold rolling process is currently the main processing method to small module splines. For the spline with position requirements, that is: one of the spline tooth is located at an angle of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> cross section, cold rolling processing can't guarantee the spline tooth position. The paper analyzes the defects existed in the rolling and processing of this kind of spline. Through transforming a hydraulic press and design special frock clamp to ensure the spline tooth position angle, the small modulus involute spline processing with position requirements is realized in the way of punch press processing...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} control the quality of <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> in rolling process, an {{efficient}} measurement method for rolling performance evaluation is essential. Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed. The prototype is intended for the automated evaluation of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> rolling performance by measuring the dimensional change of tooth root, which is correlated with the surface residual stress and micro-hardness. Laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder are used to record the polar radius and polar angle of each point on measuring section. Data are displayed in a polar coordinate system and fitted in a gear. Through multipoint curvature method, the roots of <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> are recognized automatically. Then, the dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth root circle before and after rolling. Systematic error covering offset error is also analyzed and calibrated. At last, measurement test {{results show that the}} system has advantages of simple structure, high measurement precision (radius error <[*] 0.6  μm), high measurement efficiency (measuring time <[*] 2  s) and automatic control ability, providing a new opportunity for the efficient evaluation of various spline shafts in high-precision mechanical processing.|$|E

30|$|The {{dimensional}} {{change of the}} tooth root is about 20  μm after rolling. Thus, the measurement precision of the conventional mechanical measuring instrument is not enough and it is time-consuming due {{to the complexity of}} the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft.</b> In order to solve such problems, it is necessary to develop a new measuring system with high efficiency and high precision. The laser triangulation displacement sensor (LDS) is a common-used tool in high precision and short-distance measuring, which can measure the displacement change of an object without any contact. It is mainly used in automatically measuring the geometrical parameter such as thickness, distance, diameter, etc [7 – 10]. Over a period of time there were several novel measuring systems by combining it with other devices, such as identification of location error of rotary axes for five-axes machine tools [11], on machine measurement of RFQS [12], automated inner dimensional measurement system for long-stepped pipes [13] and piston secondary motion measurement [14]. For <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> measuring system, a rotary encoder is needed to record the rotation angle. Together with the radius recorded by the laser displacement sensor, the section contour of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> is obtained by plotting each point of the measuring section in a polar coordinate system.|$|E
30|$|Through {{multipoint}} curvature method (MCM) {{and joint}} least square fitting method, {{the roots of}} the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> were recognized automatically. The dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth root circle before and after rolling. The offset error was also analyzed and calibrated in data processing.|$|E
30|$|<b>Spline</b> <b>shaft</b> is an {{important}} part of a machine to transmit power or bear torque. Its section contour is like a gear. It suffers from great loads and alternating stress during the runtime. The tooth root of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> has a risk of fracture due to fatigue stress [1 – 4]. Thus, it is essential to conduct a surface hardening process such as rolling after machining. In order to control the quality of product, a rolling performance evaluation becomes essential. The commonly used evaluation parameters of surface integrity involve the surface roughness, the surface residual stress and the micro-hardness. However, measurement of surface roughness or through-thickness residual stresses in difficult locations or complex geometries is not easy. Many measurement techniques are destructive, such as the centre-hole drilling method, the ring core method and the block removal method. There are non-destructive techniques (e.g., X-ray and neutron diffraction, optical, magnetic or ultrasonic methods) [5], but they often require the off-machine measuring. Note that for the rolling process, it is an efficient alternative to conventional cutting processes to manufacture <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> as it possesses several advantages i.e. shorter process times, no material loss and no chip disposal, high surface quality [6]. The residual stress is only induced by the residual strain and the residual strain appears as the dimensional change in the macroscopic view. Therefore, it is probably feasible to use the dimensional change of tooth root as an alternative evaluation parameter.|$|E

Cold rolling is an {{advanced}} splinterless processing method, {{which has been}} applied to process many parts, like spur gears, helical gears, <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> and ballscrew, etc. Ballscrew which determines the motion characteristics has been used as key transmission part of ballscrew pair.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the application of the metal magnetic memory (MMM) technique for investigations on fatigue crack propagation in a ferromagnetic material. Fatigue failure caused by stress concentration is serious in practical engineering. However, early fatigue damages cannot be detected by using traditional nondestructive testing (NDT) methods. Therefore this paper study about NDT method called metal magnetic memory (MMM) that has potentials for evaluating the fatigue damage at the early damage and critical fracture stages. While its capacity to evaluate the distribution of self-magnetic leakage field signals on the component’s surface is well-established, there remains a need to scrutinize the physical mechanism and quantitative analysis aspects of this method. To begin with, a fatigue test involving a loading of 7 kN was conducted on a SAE 1045 carbon steel specimen. This material is frequently used in the manufacturing of automotive transmission components that include the axle and <b>spline</b> <b>shaft.</b> MMM signals were measured along a scanning distance of 100 mm and analysed during the propagation stage. Other than revealing that the value of the magnetic flux gradient signals dH(y) /dx increased in tandem with the crack length, the results also led to the detection of the crack growth location. It was anticipated that the dH(y) /dx value will also exhibit an upward trend with a rise in the fatigue growth rate of da/dN. A modified Paris equation was utilized to correlate dH(y) /dx with da/dn through the replacement of the stress intensity factor range ΔK. This resulted in the log-log plot of da/dN versus dH(y) /dx portraying an inclination similar to the log-log plot of da/dN versus ΔK. A linear relationship was established between dH(y) /dx and ΔK with the R 2 value as 0. 96. Players in the automotive industry can benefit from the disclosure that dH(y) /dx can effectively replace ΔK for the monitoring of fatigue crack growth behaviour...|$|E
