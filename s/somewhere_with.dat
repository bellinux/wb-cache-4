In October 1926, she married Giovanni Martinuzzi (1901–1978), and her only child was born in 1937 but died when he was only six months old. The marriage was not a happy one, so in 1938 Morano separated from her husband, driving him out of the house; he died in 1978.|$|E
500|$|Patton's [...] "big break" [...] came in 2002, when he {{was cast}} to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's {{television}} program Blue's Clues. [...] He was up for a part in [...] at the time, but considered the role as Joe [...] "a happy accident". [...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a tape out there, <b>somewhere,</b> <b>with</b> both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E

500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't {{seem to be getting}} the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go <b>somewhere</b> <b>with</b> the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E

It is, as we have said, clear that, with one exception the clothing in the primary suitcase was the clothing purchased in Mr Gauci's shop on 7 December 1988. The purchaser was, on Mr Gauci's evidence, a Libyan. The trigger for the explosion was an MST-13 timer of the single solder mask variety. A substantial quantity of such timers had been supplied to Libya. We cannot say that it is impossible that the clothing might have been taken from Malta, united <b>somewhere</b> <b>with</b> a timer from some source other than Libya and introduced into the airline baggage system at Frankfurt or Heathrow. When, however, the evidence regarding the clothing, the purchaser and the timer is taken with the evidence that an unaccompanied bag was taken from KM180 to PA103A, the inference that that was the primary suitcase becomes, in our view, irresistible. As we have also said, the absence of an explanation as to how the suitcase was taken into the system at Luqa is a major difficulty for the Crown case, but after taking full account of that difficulty, we remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at Luqa. The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception, planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin. While no doubt organisations such as the PFLP-GC and the PPSF were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisfied that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this particular act of terrorism, and the evidence relating to their activities does not create a reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime." ...|$|E
