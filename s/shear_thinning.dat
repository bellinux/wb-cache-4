25|$|A {{lava flow}} is a moving outpouring of lava created during a non-explosive effusive eruption. When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock. The term lava flow is {{commonly}} shortened to lava. Although lava can {{be up to}} 100,000 times more viscous than water, lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and <b>shear</b> <b>thinning</b> properties.|$|E
2500|$|Ketchup is a non-Newtonian fluid {{meaning that}} its {{viscosity}} changes under stress {{and is not}} constant. It is a <b>shear</b> <b>thinning</b> fluid which means its viscosity decreases with increased shear stress. The equation used to designate a Non-Newtonian fluid is as follows: [...] This equation represents apparent viscosity where apparent viscosity is the shear stress divided by shear rate. Viscosity is dependent on stress. This is apparent when you shake a bottle of tomato sauce/ketchup so it becomes liquid enough to squirt out. Its viscosity decreased with stress.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{generalized}} element {{which has}} the behaviors both of dashpot and spring is utilized to describe the visco-elasticity of a type of MR (Magneto-Rheological) Damper. A fractional derivative equation of motion which needs 4 parameters is developed to consider the nonlinear characteristics of the MR Damping system. It is demonstrated that the controlling current affects {{the order of the}} fractional system significantly, the increasing of the currents lead to the increasing of systemic order, strengthen the influence of viscosity remarkably and weaken the influence of inertia simultaneously. Nonlinear characteristics for <b>shearing</b> <b>thin</b> MRF damping system are also studied...|$|R

Mesonychid dentition consisted of molars modified to generate vertical <b>shear,</b> <b>thin</b> blade-like lower molars, and carnassial notches, but no true carnassials. The molars were laterally compressed and often blunt, and {{were probably}} used for shearing meat or crushing bones. Many species are suspected of being fish-eaters, and the largest species are considered to have been scavengers.|$|R
40|$|A direct {{difference}} {{method has}} been developed for Non-Newtonian power law fluids to solve the simultaneous non-linear partial differential equations of melt spinning, and to determine the critical draw ratio for draw resonance. The results show that for <b>shear</b> <b>thin</b> fluids, the logarithm of the critical draw ratio has a well defined linear relationship with the power index for isothermal and uniform tension melt spinning. When the power index approaches zero, the critical draw ratio points at unity, indicating no melt spinning can be processed stably for such fluids. For shear thick fluids, the critical draw ratio increases in a more rapid way with increasing the power index...|$|R
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the <b>shear</b> <b>thinning</b> property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E
50|$|Ketchup is a <b>shear</b> <b>thinning</b> fluid. <b>Shear</b> <b>thinning</b> {{means that}} the fluid {{viscosity}} decreases with increasing shear stress. In other words, fluid motion is initially difficult at slow rates of deformation, but will flow more freely at high rates.|$|E

40|$|Extensional {{detachment}} systems separate hot footwalls from cool hanging walls, but {{the degree}} to which this thermal gradient is the product of ductile or brittle deformation or a preserved original transient geotherm is unclear. Oxygen isotope thermometry using recrystallized quartz-muscovite pairs indicates a smooth thermal gradient (140 degrees C/ 100 m) across the gently dipping, quartzite-dominated detachment zone that bounds the Raft River core complex in northwest Utah (United States). Hydrogen isotope values of muscovite (delta D-Ms similar to- 100 parts per thousand) and fluid inclusions in quartz (delta D-Fluid similar to- 85 parts per thousand) indicate the presence of meteoric fluids during detachment dynamics. Recrystallized grain-shape fabrics and quartz c-axis fabric patterns reveal a large component of coaxial strain (pure <b>shear),</b> consistent with <b>thinning</b> of the detachment section. Therefore, the high thermal gradient preserved in the Raft River detachment reflects the transient geotherm that developed owing to <b>shearing,</b> <b>thinning,</b> and the potentially prominent role of convective flow of surface fluids...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fundamental mechanisms of synovial fluid lubrication in artificial joints. Film thickness measurements {{were made for}} bovine serum solutions in a model test device. In contact imaging was also carried out to aid interpretation of these results. The results indicated that two types of film are formed; a boundary layer of adsorbed protein molecules, which are augmented by a high-viscosity fluid film generated by hydrodynamic effects. The high-viscosity film is due to inlet aggregation of protein molecules forming a gel which is entrained into the contact preferentially at low speeds. As the speed increases this gel appears to <b>shear</b> <b>thin,</b> giving much lower lubricant film thickness. Results suggest that protein-containing fluids do not obey classical Newtonian EHL models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Here we resolve this apparent contradiction. We demonstrate that shear thickening can be masked by a yield stress and can be recovered when the yield stress is decreased below a threshold. We show the generality of this argument and quantify the threshold in rheology experiments where we control yield stresses arising from a variety of sources, such as attractions from particle surface interactions, induced dipoles from applied electric and magnetic fields, as well as confinement of hard particles at high packing fractions.
