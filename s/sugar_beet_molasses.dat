40|$|This study {{examines}} the financial feasibility of producing ethanol biofuel from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> in central North Dakota. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, biofuel from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> uniquely qualifies as an “advanced biofuel”. EISA mandates production of 15 {{billion gallons of}} advanced biofuels annually by 2022. A stochastic simulation financial model was calibrated with irrigated <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> data from central North Dakota to determine economic feasibility and risks of production for a 10 MGY (million gallon per year) and 20 MGY ethanol plant. Study results indicate that feedstock costs, which include <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> and <b>beet</b> <b>molasses,</b> {{account for more than}} 70 % of total production expenses. The estimated breakeven ethanol price for the 20 MGY plant is $ 1. 52 per gallon and $ 1. 71 per gallon for the 10 MGY plant. Breakeven prices for feedstocks are also estimated and show that the 20 MGYplant can tolerate greater ethanol and feedstock price risk than the 10 MGY plant. Our results also show {{that one of the most}} important factors that affect investment success is the price of ethanol. At an ethanol price of $ 1. 84 per gallon, and assuming other factors remain unchanged, the estimated net present value (NPV) of the 20 MGY plant is $ 41. 54 million. By comparison, the estimated NPV of the 10 MGY plant is only $ 8. 30 million.

40|$|Molasses is an {{important}} by-product of sugar beet or sugar cane refining industry {{and it was one}} of the first sweeteners used in human nutrition. Sugar cane molasses has unique characteristics that can make it suitable for application in food industry, especially in confectionery and bakery products. On the other hand, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> has not had greater application in the human diet, primarily because of its strong smell and taste of the beet, which makes it unattractive for consumption. Since recent investigations showed that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> can be used as a hypertonic solution in osmotic dehydration of different materials of plant and animal origin, the objective of this work was to review recently studied <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> in terms of its applications in osmotic dehydrations of fruits and vegetables. Previous studies showed that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> is an excellent medium for osmotic dehydration of fruits and vegetables (apple, carrot, plum, etc.) primarily due to a high content of dry matter (80 %, w/w) and specific nutrient content. An important advantage of using <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> as a hypertonic solution is an enrichment of the dehydrated material in minerals and vitamins, which penetrate from molasses into the plant tissue. Concentration of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> solution and immersion time had the biggest influence on the process of osmotic dehydration of fruit and vegetables, while the temperature of the solution was the least influential parameter. The effect of immersion time on the kinetics of osmotic dehydration in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> increases with an increase in concentration of hypertonic solution. Fruit and vegetables dehydrated in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> had a higher dry matter content compared to samples treated in sucrose solutions. Besides, application of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>molasses</b> in osmotic dehydration of fruits and vegetables had some other advantages such as lower cost of molasses compared to sugar and its liquid aggregate state. Molasses caused darkening of osmotically treated materials due to transfer of colouring compounds (melanoidins) from molasses solution to plant tissue.

For the past 170 years, since Achard found that sugar could be used for human consumption and that pulp might be fed to cattle, sugar processors have made limited use of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> These materials have been disposed of almost exclusively as livestock ration supplements.

At this critical period in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry, it is difficult to overemphasize the need for {{a better understanding of the}} chemical constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and the effects of various physiological factors upon them. One of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> which has recently received attention is glutamic acid.

Preliminary investigations at the Utah Experiment Station (14) showed that of all the chemical constituents determined, glutamic acid was the most variable. This agreed with earlier work in this field (16, 42). Being highly variable this constituent is a chief contributor to difficulties in sugar processing.

Commercialized GM <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> make use of a glyphosate-resistance modification developed by Monsanto and KWS Saat. These glyphosate-resistant beets, also called 'Roundup Ready' <b>sugar</b> <b>beets,</b> were developed by 2000, but not commercialized until 2007. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beets</b> are allowed a Maximum Residue Limit of glyphosate of 15 mg/Kg for international trade. As of 2016, GM <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> are grown in the United States and Canada. In the United States, they {{play an important role}} in domestic sugar production. Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional (non-GMO) <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b>|$|R
