50|$|In 2005 Terry Hoeppner ("Coach Hep") left Miami (OH) and {{was named}} {{head coach of the}} Hoosiers. He quickly made an impact by nearly leading the team to a bowl {{appearance}} in 2006. With 49 true or redshirt freshmen and 72 underclassmen overall, that team was the youngest team in the Big Ten. Despite such youth, the team garnered five victories, the most since the 2001 season. The 2006 Hoosiers picked up three Big Ten wins {{for the first time since}} 2001. Coach Hep rejuvenated the Indiana fan base; attendance increased 39 percent, season ticket sales increased 46 percent, and <b>student</b> <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales increased 110 percent. In 2006, Hoeppner announced he was taking a medical leave of absence but died shortly afterward following a lengthy battle with brain cancer. Hoeppner's final record at IU is 9 - 14.|$|E

40|$|Theme 3 The Cairo Metro {{the first}} in Africa and the Middle East is a two-line system, heavily-used. Data from the {{operator}} and a direct passenger survey are used to illustrate patterns of use and draw policy implications for other systems. While current revenue exceeds operating costs, cross-subsidies may exist between different passenger groups {{as a result of}} highly-discounted <b>student</b> <b>season</b> <b>tickets.</b> A fare increase in 1996 is used to estimate short-run elasticity of demand with respect to price, approximately 0. 2, a similar figure to other metro systems. Substantial use is made of motorised feeder modes, notably shared taxis (paratransit minibuses). The high level of use occurs despite a substantial premium over other public transport fares, and lack of integrated ticketing. A likely explanation is that the fares are reasonable compared with incomes, and that the price differential is offset for many users by the time savings vis a vis congested traffic conditions.

25|$|Rumors also {{circulated}} that Hinrichs {{intended to}} detonate his homemade bomb inside the stadium; these included {{allegations that he}} tried to enter the stadium that evening but was denied entry after he refused to be searched. Hinrichs was not a <b>student</b> football <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holder; {{there was no evidence that}} Hinrichs tried to enter the stadium, and Hinrichs apparently neither bought nor tried to buy a game ticket. Agents scoured hundreds of hours of security camera tapes and found no images of Hinrichs, but, since not all entrances had cameras, they conceded they may never know if Hinrichs wanted to enter or tried to enter the stadium that night. Boren noted that Hinrichs waited until the game was underway and pre-game fans and students had cleared the South Oval; there would have been injuries or deaths to bystanders had Hinrichs detonated his device in the same area prior to or after the game.|$|R
40|$|At {{regional}} honors conferences, {{which typically}} occur {{around the same}} time as the NCAA and NIT basketball tournaments, many of us have facetiously wondered aloud whether basketball teams and their coaches spend as much time talking about honors as we spend talking about basketball. Back on our home campuses, a more serious connection between honors and athletics programs often takes the form of mutual recruitment efforts, schedule coordination, arrangement of make-up tests, co-advising, and enthusiastic attendance at sports events when honors students are in the competition. Many honors programs and colleges also sponsor their own sports events, fielding intramural teams or hosting Frisbee tournaments. Academics’ attitudes toward sports programs are often complex; a faculty member might simultaneously play pick-up volleyball with her <b>students,</b> have <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> to the school’s football games, and grumble loudly about how much attention and money are devoted to the athletic budget. Some of that complexity occurs among honors administrators as well. The complexity and diversity that we value in honors is well represented in this issue’s Forum on “Honors and Athletics,” where the range of perceptions fairly well covers the spectrum...|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, the school's mascot, Colonel Reb, was {{discontinued}} from official {{participation in}} athletic events by the school. The school solicited ideas to replace Colonel Reb, but after an exceedingly lackluster response, {{decided to go}} without a mascot. An unofficial Colonel Reb mascot still makes appearances in The Grove, Ole Miss' tailgating area, before home games. In 2010, the university began its plan to phase out the use of Colonel Reb on official merchandise such as hats and shirts. The university has reclassified the Colonel Reb trademark as a historical mark of the university. On October 14, 2010, {{it was announced that}} <b>students,</b> alumni and <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders at the university had picked Rebel Black Bear as their new mascot.

25|$|A 2002 {{report by}} a {{researcher}} at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while {{it was true that}} a higher proportion of City <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). However, the report warned that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders had risen hugely; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales to increase further. The 2002 report has lost most of its validity as both clubs <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> sales have fluctuated further as of 2010, with United selling 52,000 <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> and City selling out all of its allocated 36,000 <b>season</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R

50|$|For the Gateshead Thunder game in 2009, {{chairman}} Steve O'Connor offered {{free admission}} for all Vikings fans. As <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders did {{not benefit from}} this special offer (as they had already paid for the game when purchasing their <b>season</b> <b>ticket),</b> the club decided they would give vouchers to the 2009 <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders who renewed their <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> during an 'Ealry Bird' promotion. The vouchers were for fans to use on kit manufacturer O'Neills merchandise in the January sales.|$|R
50|$|During the off-season, Kerr {{informed}} {{fans that}} the team would need to reach 1000 <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders {{by the start of}} this season, to stay viable on the coast.

5000|$|In 2002, {{construction}} crews {{replaced the}} south end zone bleachers with a rounded bowl, adding luxury boxes and covered club seating in an upper deck, as well as additional general admission seating for <b>students</b> and <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders; these renovations expanded seating capacity by nearly 10,000, giving Vaught-Hemingway a capacity of 60,580. In August 2011 the school announced Forward Together, a new capital campaign that would seek {{to build a new}} basketball arena and expand the stadium. Phase 1 of the campaign includes adding 30 luxury suites and 770 club level seats. In addition new stadium lights, sound system, and 2 new video boards will be added to the current south end zone. Phase 2 calls for the stadium's capacity to increase giving it the ability to hold 64,038 fans. This would be done through closing off the north endzone. In addition a plaza would be built outside the north endzone to serve as a [...] "front door" [...] to the stadium and celebrate Ole Miss tradition and history. In the summer of 2012 Ole Miss announced that they had received a million-dollar gift that was {{to be used in the}} Forward Together capital campaign. The school announced in honor of the gift they would start a new tradition and include a bell tower in the north endzone expansion that would be rung before Ole Miss games to let fans know the game is starting soon and after Ole Miss victories. The most recent expansion, completed in 2016, completed the stadium's bowl shape and added 3,458 additional seats. This brought the total capacity to 64,038 making Vaught-Hemmingway the largest stadium in the state of Mississippi.|$|R
