5|$|The {{presence}} of a strictly freshwater <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the Seychelles is hard to explain, biogeographically. Several possible explanations have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus, H.americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to {{the three}} known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora; the <b>species</b> <b>on</b> H.gammarus has not been described.|$|E
5|$|Another {{key feature}} of N. rajah is the {{relative}} {{ease with which}} {{it is able to}} hybridise in the wild. Hybrids between it and all other Nepenthes <b>species</b> <b>on</b> Mount Kinabalu have been recorded. However, due to the slow-growing nature of N. rajah, few hybrids involving the species have been artificially produced yet.|$|E
40|$|An ethno botanical {{study has}} been carried out to focus on {{medicinal}} utility of 101 plant species eaten during Bohag Bihu in Assamese society. Amongst 101 species, 25 species are found to have effect on gastrointestinal problem, 18 <b>species</b> effect <b>on</b> skin diseases, 16 <b>species</b> effect <b>on</b> respiratory ailments, 14 species effect as anti diabetic, 7 <b>species</b> effect <b>on</b> gynaecological problems, 6 species effect as blood purifier, 4 <b>species</b> effect <b>on</b> rheumatism, 3 <b>species</b> effect <b>on</b> eye-sight improvement and 2 <b>species</b> effect <b>on</b> jaundice. These plants contain various phytochemicals likesaponins, alkaloids, sterols, flavanoids, glycosides, terpenoids which have certain medicinal values. The paper reflects the rich ethno medicinal value of the herbs along with their phytochemical constituents The further scrutiny and evaluation of the safety parameters of each component of the herb used in the recipe may be investigate to develop a pharmacologically potent lead molecule...|$|R
50|$|This <b>species</b> occurs <b>on</b> alkali flats. The {{caterpillar}} of the <b>species</b> feeds <b>on</b> saltgrass (Distichlis spicata var. stricta). There {{is little}} other {{information about the}} biology of the species.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the debates}} <b>on</b> <b>species</b> touch <b>on</b> {{philosophical}} issues, such as nominalism and realism, and on issues of language and cognition.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of <b>species</b> <b>on</b> earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois {{mentioned}} that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which {{may have led to}} Réunion visitors mostly ignoring it. It was the last of the indigenous parrots of Réunion to become extinct. The only endemic bird <b>species</b> <b>on</b> Réunion that disappeared after the Mascarene parrot was the hoopoe starling in the mid-19th century.|$|E
50|$|Conifericola clade: {{contains}} <b>species</b> {{that live}} <b>on</b> conifers, such as L. conifericola and L. huroniensis. All {{of the other}} tested <b>species</b> grow <b>on</b> angiosperms.|$|R
3000|$|... a) Maximum densities differ greatly {{among the}} two <b>species</b> grown <b>on</b> the same site and within the same <b>species</b> grown <b>on</b> {{different}} sites; {{it is possible to}} relate these differences to site index in both species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>species</b> feeds <b>on</b> bryozoans.|$|R
5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|G. juniperina subsp. juniperina – is {{endemic to}} Western Sydney, {{restricted}} to clay soils from Blacktown west to Penrith and Marsden Park and north to Pitt Town. It {{is listed as}} a vulnerable <b>species</b> <b>on</b> Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 in New South Wales. Its habitat is threatened by housing development, road upgrading, inappropriate fire regimes, weed invasion, rubbish dumping and trampling either by people or cars. It grows as a spreading shrub that is 0.5–1.5m (1.5–5ft) high.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few {{decades of the twentieth}} century, American {{paleontologist}} E. C. Case authored many studies on Dimetrodon and described several new species. He received funding from the Carnegie Institution for his study of many Dimetrodon specimens in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History and several other museums. Many of these fossils had been collected by Cope but had not been thoroughly described, as Cope was known for erecting new <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the basis of only a few bone fragments.|$|E

5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced in late summer. Other non-native <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E
5|$|Many other endemic <b>species</b> <b>on</b> Réunion became extinct {{after the}} arrival of humans and the {{resulting}} disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the Réunion ibis, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Réunion and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} <b>species,</b> <b>on</b> the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E

5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, pitch pine, red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants on the ridge include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer <b>species</b> <b>on</b> dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{have been documented}} that can help confirm the identify of this <b>species.</b> <b>On</b> the cap flesh, application of formaldehyde turns the tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a colour change to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia usually makes brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange.|$|E

5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} the zones. Of the 496 <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare in {{one or two of the}} zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{endemic to}} the island of Tawi-Tawi and its nearby islets in the southwestern part of the Philippines's Sulu Archipelago. The bleeding-heart is {{believed}} to be extirpated on the Tawi-Tawi mainland, but there are indigenous reports of the <b>species</b> <b>on</b> the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. There is also an unconfirmed nineteenth-century sight record of the species from the island of Jolo {{in the center of the}} Sulu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is both the}} {{national}} bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. In the late 20th century {{it was on the}} brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered <b>species</b> <b>on</b> July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.|$|E
