Other research has used data on a film’s levels of sex, violence and profanity (SVP), to explore the link between SVP, movie rating, and box office revenues. In this paper, we use a more recent data set and include additional variables to account for movie quality to further explore this relationship. We investigate the issue of how the amount of SVP has changed in the last fifteen years. We also use theater-level data for a major Midwestern theater chain to extend our analysis beyond total box office revenues, examining the effects on revenues in four ticket categories: adult, child, <b>senior</b> <b>citizen,</b> <b>and</b> <b>student.</b> Finally, we explore the difference between foreign and domestic box office responses to SVP levels and suggest that there is a justifiable reason why movie studios continue to produce far more PG- 13 and R movies than G and PG movies...|$|R

40|$|Analyzing a new dataset of 110, 000 {{consumer}} complaints lodged with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB” or the “Bureau”), the authors find that: (i) Bank of America, Citibank, and PNC Bank {{were significantly less}} timely in responding to {{consumer complaints}} than the average financial institution; (ii) consumers {{of some of the}} largest financial services providers, including Wells Fargo, American Express (“Amex”), and Bank of America, were significantly more likely than the average consumer to dispute the provider’s response to their initial complaints; and (iii) among the companies included in the database that provide mortgages, OneWest Bank, HSBC, Nationstar Mortgage, and Bank of America all received more mortgage complaints relative to mortgages sold than other mortgage providers.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{developing}} an intergenerational curriculum module based on skill sharing among {{the older generation}} and secondary school students. The module development was targeted at demonstrating how the module {{can be used in}} efforts to breach the gap between the generations and to give an opportunity to the older generation to make a meaningful contribution through the intergenerational program. This study used the Design and Development Research approach first introduced by Richey dan Klein (2007) that consists of three phases. The first phase involved needs analysis using the questionnaire administered on 618 senior citizens to identify their needs in building the intergenerational curriculum module. The second phase used the Fuzzy Delphi approach to develop a module based on the views and consensus of a 21 - member panel of experts. The threshold value (d) was calculated to verify the consensus of experts toward all the questionnaire items. Three experts were selected to revise the prototype module. The third phase was the module usability evaluation using semi structured interviews with 10 students and seven senior citizens. Semi structured interviews were carried out on the sample to evaluate the usability of the intergenerational curriculum module. Findings from the first phase show that the majority of senior citizens had confidence and were willing to share their time and skills with the secondary school students. This shows that there exists a need for developing an intergenerational curriculum module based on skills for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>students.</b> Findings from the second phase resulted in development of the module made up of the design, main module components, and 30 activities that need to be put into the intergenerational curriculum module. Three classifications of intergenerational programs were suggested (elders serve the youth, shared program and reciprocal mutual learning). The third phase findings show that the sample was satisfied with the intergenerational activities, duration and location afforded by the module. The third phase findings also show that the intergenerational curriculum module had four main strengths: the module gave opportunity and space for students and senior citizens to interact and communicate, share their skills, give opportunities for students to help the aged and generate mutual respect and make the aged feel needed. The intergenerational curriculum module based on skill sharing produced by this study {{can be used as a}} guideline for the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, Senior Citizen Associations, and selected agencies when carrying out intergenerational programs in future...|$|E

40|$|Abstract artikkel 1 Subjective {{well-being}} (SWB) is {{an upcoming}} concept that has {{caught the attention}} of the scientific community and society in general. Although much has been learned about the nature of “happiness” both the definition and measurements are still a work in progress. The current paper aimed to examine how global subjective well-being best can be measured based in the current theoretical understanding of the definition and assessment methods. SWB is by Diener (2009) considered to have three main components: positive affect, negative affect and life satisfaction. The concept is complex with many interconnecting dimensions and correlates. The choice of SWB measurement method or instrument should be based on an {{understanding of the nature of}} SWB in addition to the study’s design and purpose. Self-report measures are the most utilized and generally shows good psychometric properties. This paper primarily recommends using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin 1985) combined with Scale of Positive And Negative Experience (SPANE; Diener et al. 2009) to measure SWB. Abstract artikkel 2 The interest and knowledge of subjective well-being (SWB) and its applicability has the latest decades grown both socially and scientifically. Assessment instruments validated for different languages and cultures can assist in the further development of the SWB concept as well as provide a base for monitoring communities’ fluctuations in SWB levels and operate as a social indicator index. Objective: The following study aimed at translating and validating four acknowledged SWB instruments on a Norwegian sample. Participants: Self-completion questionnaires were administered to convenience samples of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> university <b>students</b> in Trondheim, Norway. n = 254, 154 females, age 19 - 96. Design: Psychometric properties such as internal consistency, normative data, factorial structure and convergence validity were examined using independent sample t-tests and principal component factor analyses.   Results and conclusions: The findings were overall consistent with previous findings. Overall no major divergences from the scales established psychometric standards were found which suggests that the questionnaires are fit for use on Norwegian samples. Furthermore, the study supports the scales as having good psychometric properties.  ...|$|R

The study compared two telephone interventions using a 4 -month longitudinal randomized controlled trial.

For these eight follow-up calls, participants were randomized into either {{one of the two}} following groups with different conditions. For the Psychoeducation with BA (PsyED-BA) group, participants received eight biweekly sessions of BA practice focused on pleasant event scheduling and improving communications. For the Psychoeducation only (PsyED Only) group, there were eight biweekly sessions of general discussion of psychoeducation and related information. The telephone administration of the BA and general discussion component were administered with the help of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> also university <b>students</b> engaged as paraprofessionals. A total of 96 family caregivers of persons living with dementia were recruited, and 93 caregivers completed the whole study.

Caregivers who reported longer caregiving hours at baseline were found to benefit more from the intervention. The PsyED-BA group showed an increased frequency in the use of emotional regulation strategies after the BA training.
