40|$|Photoproduction of the {{pentaquark}} particle Theta^+ on the nucleon {{has been}} studied by using an isobar and a Regge model. Using the isobar model, total cross sections around 100 nb for the gamma n [...] > K- Theta+ channel and 400 nb for the gamma p [...] > K̅ 0 Theta+ process are obtained. The inclusion of the K* intermediate state yields a substantially large effect, especially in the gamma p [...] > K̅ 0 Theta+ process. The Regge approach predicts <b>smaller</b> cross <b>sections,</b> <b>i.</b> e., less than 100 nb (20 nb) for the process on the neutron (proton). By using an elementary operator from the isobar model, cross sections for the process on a deuteron are predicted.
