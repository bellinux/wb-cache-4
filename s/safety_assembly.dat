When the {{scaffold}} construction method is applied on long-span steel trussed arch bridges, reasonable {{setting of the}} temporary pier elevation has significant influence on assembly linearis and <b>safety</b> <b>assembly</b> of long-span steel trussed arch bridges with semi-cantilever. In this paper, {{in accordance with the}} manufacturing linearis steel trussed beam bridge and steel truss beam linearis changing during building process, the calculation of temporary pier elevation was studied systematically, and practical function was deduced. Then, the method was applied to a long-span steel trussed arch bridge. The obtained result by in-situ assembly and dismantling presents that: 50 mm preserved method is considered in this paper, which can provide convenience for removing the temporary pier. At the same time, the rationality and reliability of the presented approach are verified. It also can provide reference for similar bridge construction...|$|E
40|$|NASA is {{building}} a high-fidelity prototype of an advanced Portable Life Support System (PLSS) {{as part of the}} Advanced Exploration Systems Program. This new PLSS, designated as PLSS 2. 5, will advance component technologies and systems knowledge to inform a future flight program. The oxygen ventilation loop of its predecessor, PLSS 2. 0, was driven by a centrifugal fan developed using specifications from the Constellation Program. PLSS technology and system parameters have matured {{to the point where the}} existing fan will not perform adequately for the new prototype. In addition, areas of potential improvement were identified with the PLSS 2. 0 fan that could be addressed in a new design. As a result, a new fan was designed and tested for the PLSS 2. 5. The PLSS 2. 5 fan is a derivative of the one used in PLSS 2. 0, and it uses the same nonmetallic, canned motor, with a larger volute and impeller to meet the higher pressure drop requirements of the PLSS 2. 5 ventilation loop. The larger impeller allows it to operate at rotational speeds that are matched to rolling element bearings, and which create reasonably low impeller tip speeds consistent with prior, oxygen-rated fans. Development of the fan also considered a shrouded impeller design that could allow larger clearances for greater oxygen <b>safety,</b> <b>assembly</b> tolerances and particle ingestion. This paper discusses the design, manufacturing and performance testing of the new fans...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this part of}} the 6 th framework Pan-European EUR-ACTIVE ROOF-er project is to improve the interaction between design participants of dynamic adaptable Active Roofs in product development and Active Roofs from an architects/ customers perspective. Improvements in Active Roof design on the basis of those technological product requirements that architects / customers deem {{to be the most important}} product / system benefits. This requires a common framework for information exchange that is scaleable with respect to the level of sophistication of each of the organisations and designers / engineers involved. Moreover, the desired information to be shared must be interpretable (language, terminology and definition) by all designers/ engineers [EURACTIVE ROOFer 2005]. Especially conditions for developing a design method for innovative roof-concepts are an essential result of the research. Part of the project is focussed on special roofs which are adaptable in function, structure or in material. Properties of these active roofs are: tensile / membrane, inflatable or retractable structures. Subscription of the several aspects of design (i. e. building physics), - sustainable energy and use (i. e. maintenance, <b>safety,</b> <b>assembly),</b> is information needed for better innovative products. The knowledge generated in this project directly benefits the Building Services research and education at Eindhoven University of Technology, Delft University of Technology and the department of innovation of renewable energy systems at TNO Building and Construction Research.

40|$|This paper {{promotes}} compositional {{reasoning in}} the context of safety-critical systems, and demonstrates a safety-oriented component model using an application from the automotive industry: an Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC). The application consists of four components for which a set of 18 fault modes have been identified. We show the impact of all single faults and double faults selected from this set, on a safety property associated with the ACC assembly. Analysis related to each fault mode is performed using compositional rules and derived safety interfaces for each component. The derivation of safety interfaces for the ACC components has been supported by implementation of two extensions to the SCADE tool set: (1) a front end that iteratively and automatically builds the environment in which the component is resilient in presence of a given fault, (2) fault mode libraries that can be reused for modeling several classes of faults affecting the input of a component. The result of the study is the illustration of system level safety in presence of certain single and double faults, based on compositional reasoning and the automatically generated interfaces. The component model uses reactive modules as the formal notation. The instantiation of the model in terms of modules specified in SCADE provides a link between formal analysis of components in safety-critical systems and the traditional engineering processes supported by model-based development.

5000|$|Despite this, a 2012 study {{conducted}} by the University of Utah Department of Psychology has received wide international media attention for calling into question the findings reported by the University of New Hampshire researchers. In the University of Utah's study, researchers Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael A. Sustaíta, and Jordan Rullo surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14-18 and found that nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 percent indicated that they had forwarded it to others. In addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. Strassberg, McKinnon, et al. note: [...] "The news-worthiness of University of New Hampshire study derives from their figure 2.5% being far below (by a factor of 5 or more) the prevalence rates reported in the previous surveys. However, while technically accurate, the 2.5% figure is actually rather misleading. As seen in Table 1 of their publication, Mitchell et al. found that among the quarter of their sample that were ages 10-12, than 0.6% 'appeared in, created, or received a nude or nearly nude image' while among those age 15-17, 15% of participants reported having done so. Despite it being widely reported in the media, the overall prevalence figure of 2.5% masks a dramatic age effect that indicates that more than 1 in 8 mid-teen minors admit to having sexted."

In this study, a new multi-objective model for solving assembly line balancing problem is developed and discussed in order to include also the ergonomics aspect. First, based on main features of assembly workstations, the energy expenditure concept is used in order to estimate the ergonomics level, thanks to a new technique, called Predetermined Motion Energy System, which helps rapidly estimate the energy expenditure values. Then, a multi-objective approach, based on four different objective functions, is introduced in order to define the efficient frontiers of optimal solutions. To complete the study, a simple numerical example for a real case is presented to analyse the behaviour of Pareto frontiers varying several parameters linked to the energy and time value...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} variant of Proof-Carrying Code (PCC) in which the trusted {{inference}} rules are represented as a higherorder logic program, the proof checker {{is replaced by a}} nondeterministic higher-order logic interpreter and the proof by an oracle implemented as a stream of bits that resolve the nondeterministic interpretation choices.

This oracle-based variant of PCC is able to adapt quite naturally to situations when the property being checked is simple or there is a fairly directed search procedure for it. As an example, we demonstrate that if PCC is used to verify type <b>safety</b> of <b>assembly</b> language programs compiled from Java source programs, the oracles that are needed are on the average just 12 % {{of the size of the}} code, which represents an improvement of a factor of 30 over previous syntactic representations of PCC proofs.
