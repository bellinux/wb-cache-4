Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to San Sebastián on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things that might have been.|$|E
5|$|He had {{intended}} {{to go to the}} bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E

5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by {{the bride and}} groom (including the <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name of Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required for marriage. More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E

25|$|To complicate matters, Halakha, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{relative}} hour, {{states that}} there are always 12 hours between the break of dawn and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.|$|E

25|$|Gossip and backbiting are {{prohibited}} and viewed as particularly {{damaging to the}} individual and their relationships. Backbiting, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faults of others in their absence, is described as the greatest sin and the most hated human characteristic. This practice is seen as having a deeply {{negative effect on the}} community as well as the individuals involved.|$|E
25|$|Life is a {{major source}} of complexity, and {{evolution}} is the major process behind the varying forms of life. In this view, evolution is the process describing the growth of complexity in the natural world and in <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergence of complex living beings and life-forms, this view refers therefore to processes of sudden changes in evolution.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this context}} of {{conflict}} between East and West that the Monothelite Patriarch Paul of Constantinople made accusations against Pope Theodore of Rome for <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son. Pope Theodore's expression was in a letter that he wrote, not in the Creed, which was not yet used liturgically in Rome.|$|E

Cleitarchus, Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch all mention burning of children as an offering to Cronus or Saturn, {{that is to}} Baal Hammon, the chief god of Carthage.|$|E
25|$|Third person {{participants}} can {{be marked}} with a special set of endings indicating their absence from the general area of the focus of discourse. For example, absentative endings are used when <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased (even if the corpse is physically present), as in the sentence no·lăčahko·ná·na nkahe·səná·na ("our (excl.) mother (abv.) treated us well"), in which both verb and noun are marked with the absentative /-a/ ending.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} such a toponym, {{indicating}} {{the presence of}} dwarf fan palms on the spot, was recorded in some written documents. The theologian and writer Salvatore Vidal, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sinis peninsula in his Clypeus Aureus excellentiae calaritanae (1641), reports the toponym Montigu de Prama. The Franciscan friar Antonio Felice Mattei, who wrote in the 18th century a historiography of Sardinian dioceses and bishops, mentions Montigu Palma {{as one of the}} localities within the Sinis peninsula.|$|E

25|$|While {{the term}} Scandinavia is {{commonly}} used for Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the term the Nordic countries is used unambiguously for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). Scandinavia can thus be considered {{a subset of the}} Nordic countries. Furthermore, the term Fennoscandia refers to Scandinavia, Finland and Karelia, excluding Denmark and overseas territories; however, the usage of this term is restricted to geology, when <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fennoscandian Shield (Baltic Shield).|$|E
25|$|But {{without the}} benefit of hindsight, the 1854 {{elections}} would seem to indicate the possible triumph of the Know-Nothing movement rather than anti-slavery, with the Catholic/immigrant question replacing slavery as the issue capable of mobilizing mass appeal. Know-Nothings, for instance, captured the mayoralty of Philadelphia with a majority of over 8,000 votes in 1854. Even after opening up immense discord with his Kansas–Nebraska Act, Senator Douglas began <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Know-Nothings, rather than the Republicans, as the principal danger to the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|German Americans by {{this time}} usually had only weak ties to Germany; however, they were fearful of {{negative}} treatment they might receive if the United States entered the war (such mistreatment was already happening to German-descent citizens in Canada and Australia). Almost none called for intervening on Germany's side, instead calling for neutrality and <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superiority of German culture. They were increasingly marginalized, however, and by 1917 had been excluded almost entirely from national discourse on the subject.|$|E

It {{is considered to be}} the parallel prayer to Yotzer ohr, which is recited in the same place at Shacharit. Just as Yotzer Ohr <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> light, HaMaariv Aravim <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> darkness.|$|R
25|$|Two ancient testimonies exist {{about the}} mission of Saint Bartholomew in India. These are of Eusebius of Caesarea (early 4th century) and of Saint Jerome (late 4th century). Both these refer to this {{tradition}} while <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported visit of Pantaenus to India in the 2nd century. The studies of Fr A.C. Perumalil SJ and Moraes hold that the Bombay region on the Konkan coast, a region {{which may have been}} known as the ancient city Kalyan, was the field of Saint Bartholomew's missionary activities.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{formulation}} {{is called}} an optimization problem or a mathematical programming problem (a term {{not directly related}} to computer programming, but still in use for example in linear programming – see History below). Many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in this general framework. Problems formulated using this technique in the fields of physics and computer vision may refer to the technique as energy minimization, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of the function f as representing the energy of the system being modeled.|$|E

However, his political position had eroded during his absence. He wished {{to make a statement}} attacking Nasser as a puppet of the Soviets, attacking the United Nations and <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “lessons of the 1930s”, but was prevented from doing so by Macmillan, Butler and Lord Salisbury.|$|E
