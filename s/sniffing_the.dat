5|$|Though {{they were}} {{documented}} by droppings and tracks, {{pictures of the}} Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. On 24 April 2007, {{it was announced that}} cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, peering through jungle foliage, and <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> film equipment. The World Wildlife Fund, which took the video, has used it in efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone. Monitoring has continued; 50 new cameras have been set up, and in February 2010, {{what appeared to be a}} pregnant rhino was filmed.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E
25|$|Mighty Mouse was {{cancelled}} amidst controversy {{for allegedly}} depicting {{the main character}} snorting cocaine. Ralph Bakshi maintained that neither he nor Kricfalusi had the character sniffing cocaine, and that the character was <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> crushed petals of a flower, which were handed {{to him in a}} previous scene in the cartoon. In 1994, Kricfalusi pitched a revival series of Mighty Mouse to Paramount, which would have featured other Terrytoons characters such as Deputy Dawg, but they rejected the idea.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine sniffing behavior in male and female dogs in open places. It was observed 468 dogs. Female dogs more often <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> head of another dog than male dogs. Male dogs more frequently <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> backside of another dog than female dogs. Female dogs more often <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> belly of another dog than male dogs. Further research is needed to understand <b>the</b> dog’s <b>sniffing</b> behavior on walks...|$|R

500|$|Hearing is {{sensitive}} and eyesight is strong—the serow {{is able to}} detect and react to movement from a distance, and it can see well in low lighting. [...] Sense of smell is also strong, and the serow can be observed raising its head and <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> air around it.|$|E
500|$|Courtship {{begins with}} the {{dominant}} male approaching the female, who then assumes a low-head posture and urinates. Unresponsive females run away on being pursued by a male. A male keen on <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> female's vulva keeps flicking his tongue. As they continue their [...] "mating march", the male licks the female's rump and persistently attempts mounting her. On mounting, the males tries to clasp her flanks tightly. If she stands firmly, {{it is a sign}} that she is ready to mate. Copulation is marked by a single ejaculation, after which both animals stand motionless or a while, and then resume grazing.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the episode [...] "The Littlest Tramp", editor Tom Klein expressed concern that a sequence showing Mighty Mouse <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> remains of a crushed flower resembled cocaine use. Bakshi did not initially view the footage; he believed that Klein was overreacting, but agreed to let him cut the scene. Kricfalusi expressed disbelief over the cut, insisting that the action was harmless and that the sequence should be restored. Following Kricfalusi's advice, Bakshi told Klein to restore the scene, which had been approved by network executives and the CBS standards and practices department. The episode aired on October 31, 1987, without controversy.|$|E

500|$|ScreenCrush's Britt Hayes {{said that}} Miss Rosa and Vee's stories {{dominated}} the second season. But {{was disappointed that}} the two stories collided to form the series finale. She {{felt that it was}} both comical and absurd. Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast opined that the scene Miss Rosa learns she is dying was handled phenomenally. He also said that she deserved an award for killing Vee. Kate Zernike of The New York Times criticized the characters's accent believing it sounded more Russian. She thought Miss Rosa's last scene was both brilliant and exhilarating. But least expected her to kill Vee because fellow enemies sparred with Vee more. But Perri Nemiroff from Screen Rant praised the ending because it was emotional. She described Morello offering her freedom as an [...] "especially moving season-ending thrill". She summed up Miss Rosa as being a kind person and branded it all more [...] "gratifying" [...] when she killed Vee. Entertainment Weekly readers voted Miss Rosa killing Vee as the [...] "most shocking moment" [...] of season two. Jayme Deerwester (USA Today) said that Miss Rosa provided the best moments of season two and deserved an Emmy Award. Dana Piccoli from AfterEllen.com said Miss Rosa was a character with the ability to [...] "beguile me and break my heart". She branded the scene with her <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> stolen money as [...] "euphoric". Lauren Hoffman of Cosmopolitan believed that her cancer struggle almost ignorable during the first season. But viewers later saw her true self and her branded her refusal to care as her strength.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} vulnerability {{is present}} in the last step in the authentication scheme when TLS / SSL are not used: the redirect-URL from the Identity Provider to the Relying Party. The problem with this redirect is the fact that anyone who can obtain this URL (e.g. by <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> wire) can replay it and get logged into the site as the victim user. Some of the Identity Providers use nonces (number used once) to allow a user to log into the site once and fail all the consecutive attempts. The nonce solution works if the user is the first one to use the URL. However a fast attacker who is <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> wire can obtain the URL and immediately reset a user's TCP connection (as an attacker is <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> wire and knows the required TCP sequence numbers) and then execute the replay attack as described above. Thus nonces only protect against passive attackers but cannot prevent active attackers from executing the replay attack. [...] Use of TLS/SSL in the authentication process eliminates this risk.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{demonstrated}} by the dog picture, which depicts a Dalmatian dog <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> ground {{in the shade of}} overhanging trees. The dog is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts. [...] Instead, the dog appears as a whole, all at once. Gestalt theory does not have an explanation for how this perception of a dog appears.|$|E

2500|$|At the June 16, 1971, Eugene City Council meeting, {{the council}} adopted an {{ordinance}} enforcing seven pages of rules prohibiting some behaviors at the mall. The mall had been open only four months, {{but in that}} time {{it had become a}} place for young people to [...] "hang out." [...] They lounged on the lawns, climbed on the main plaza fountain, and waded in fountain pools. The council tabled an ordinance requiring parental consent before purchase of toxic glue, although community leaders expressed concern about the dangers of glue <b>sniffing.</b> <b>The</b> presence of a transient, non-customer population on the mall would be a frequent challenge for merchants.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} positive review, {{giving it a}} C. She notes [...] "I was hoping against hope for Morgan Le Fay to show up, because outside of Guinevere, Camelot is pretty much a dudefest. But Adam Horowitz recently pointed out at a Comic Con that {{she will not be}} appearing, that they just didn’t have room for everyone, which is too bad. The knights are fun, but the earthy witches and sorcery of the women of Camelot (Morgan, Morgause, and Vivian) add a deeper dimension to the story. At least in between we get Snow and Charming having another real relationship talk (well, fight, but even that was refreshing), along with a simple example of trickery with a fake dagger that enables them to reveal Arthur’s menace. But it’s not a lot to pin a whole episode on, unless we all start <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> pink stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Time Lords {{resemble}} humans, their physiology differs in key respects. Like {{other members}} of his race, the Doctor has two hearts (binary vascular system), a [...] "respiratory bypass system" [...] that allows him to go without air, an internal body temperature of 15–16°C (60°F) and occasionally exhibits a super-human level of stamina and the ability to absorb, withstand and expel large amounts of certain types of radiation. [...] (The Tenth Doctor stated they used to play with Röntgen bricks in the nursery, after absorbing the radiation from an x-ray of significantly magnified power.) This ability would seem to have limitations which have yet to be fully explained, as the Doctor is harmed by radiation in The Daleks, Planet of the Spiders and The End of Time. The Doctor has withstood, with minimal damage, exposure to electricity deadly enough to kill a human (Terror of the Zygons, Genesis of the Daleks, [...] "Aliens of London", [...] "The Christmas Invasion", [...] "The Idiot's Lantern", [...] "Evolution of the Daleks" [...] and spin-off audio Spare Parts). Certain stories imply that he is resistant to cold temperatures ("42"). To counter extreme trauma, such as exposure to the poisonous fungus in The Seeds of Death and after being shot in Spearhead from Space, he can go into a self-induced coma until he recovers. His hypersensitive body and senses enable him to detect anomalies humans cannot, such as identifying alien species, blood type or chemical composition by taste and determining location or time period by <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> air. In [...] "The Unicorn and the Wasp" [...] (2008) he was able to sense the changes in his body's enzymes (i.e. cyanide poisoning) and expel the cyanide from his body by ingesting a concoction of ginger beer, protein foods and salts.|$|E
