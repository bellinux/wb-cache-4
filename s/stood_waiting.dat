500|$|The {{field at}} Waterloo was 5.5km wide, with two {{parallel}} ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4km across. The Allies took {{position on the}} northern ridge. As the army prepared for battle on 18 June, the 2nd Division were initially held in reserve, placed in the centre left, behind Major-General Cooke's 1st Division. Following the French cavalry's battering of the British squares over the afternoon, Adam's brigade was brought up to reinforce the right. In this position the 52nd endured a heavy bombardment, of which Ensign Leeke of the 52nd reported afterwards [...] "the old officers, who had served during {{the whole of the}} Peninsular War, stated that they were never exposed to such a cannonade as the 52nd squares had to undergo on this occasion for 2½ hours from French artillery ½ mile to the front". While the 52nd's squares <b>stood</b> <b>waiting,</b> British artillery fired over their heads.|$|E
