A random population mail survey about food choice was conducted among a sample of 1000 South Australians. An additional (non-random) survey of 106 vegetarians and <b>semi-vegetarians</b> was also conducted, giving a total of 707 participants from both samples. The main predictors of the belief that vegetarian diets provide health benefits for all respondents were found to be the belief that meat is neither healthy nor necessary and frequent searching for information on healthy eating.

40|$|Abstract: A {{quantitative}} study on vegetarianism among young adults {{was conducted in}} the Klang Valley of Malaysia. The findings show that among the vegetarians, there are fewer full time vegetarians (21 %) compared to <b>semi-vegetarians</b> (79 %). Most of the vegetarians (22 %) eat plant foods and dairy products (lacto-vegetarians) and only 9 % consume plant foods only (vegans). The reasons for being vegetarians include influence {{from friends and family}} members, concern for global warming, health issues and weight management, religion and mercy for animals in descending order of significance. This study also investigated the respondents’ opinions on vegetarian foods. A majority of the <b>semi-vegetarians</b> (73 %) found that vegetarian foods are tasty, whereas 86 % of full time vegetarians stated that vegetarian diets are boring {{due to the lack of}} food choices, resulting in a desire in some to switch back to meat-eating. A total of 62 % of the respondents will encourage their children to become vegetarians in the future. Although the young vegetarians are aware of the health benefits of plant-based diets, many lack the knowledge of the health-promoting compounds from plant sources, such as antioxidants and other phytochemicals that strengthen our immune system and protect us against various diseases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{mortality}} rates of vegetarians and non-vegetarians. DESIGN: Collaborative analysis using original data from five prospective studies. Death rate ratios for vegetarians compared to non-vegetarians {{were calculated for}} ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancers of the stomach, large bowel, lung, breast and prostate, and for all causes of death. All results were adjusted for age, sex and smoking. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates of effect for all studies combined. SETTING: USA, UK and Germany. SUBJECTS: 76, 172 men and women aged 16 - 89 years at recruitment. Vegetarians were {{those who did not}} eat any meat or fish (n = 27, 808). Non-vegetarians were from a similar background to the vegetarians within each study. RESULTS: After a mean of 10. 6 years of follow-up there were 8330 deaths before the age of 90 years, including 2264 deaths from ischaemic heart disease. In comparison with non-vegetarians, vegetarians had a 24 % reduction in mortality from ischaemic heart disease (death rate ratio 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 94). The reduction in mortality among vegetarians varied significantly with age at death: rate ratios for vegetarians compared to non-vegetarians were 0. 55 (95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 85), 0. 69 (95 % CI 0. 53 - 0. 90) and 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 16) for deaths from ischaemic heart disease at ages < 65, 65 - 79 and 80 - 89 years, respectively. When the non-vegetarians were divided into regular meat eaters (who ate meat at least once a week) and <b>semi-vegetarians</b> (who ate fish only or ate meat less than once a week), the ischaemic heart disease death rate ratios compared to regular meat eaters were 0. 78 (95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 89) in <b>semi-vegetarians</b> and 0. 66 (95 % CI 0. 53 - 0. 83) in vegetarians (test for trend P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective : The overall aim of {{this study}} was to examine a variety of belief and {{demographic}} factors that are associated with the perception that meat is intrinsically unhealthy. Design : State-wide survey (written questionnaire) that included questions on meat and nutrition beliefs, perceived barriers and benefits of vegetarian diets, personal values, number of vegetarian friends and family members, and use and trust of health/nutrition/food information sources. Setting : South Australia. Subjects : Six hundred and one randomly selected South Australians and 106 non-randomly selected vegetarians and <b>semi-vegetarians.</b> Results : For all respondents considered as a group, the most important predictors of the belief that meat is intrinsically unhealthy were the perceived benefits of vegetarian diets (all positive predictors). These included: (1) the perceived links between vegetarianism, peace and increased contentment; (2) animal welfare and environmental benefits; and (3) health benefits. There were differences between different dietary groups however. For non-vegetarians, social concerns about vegetarianism (positive) were most important, followed by health and non-health benefits (positive) of vegetarianism. Red meat appreciation was the strongest (positive) predictor for vegetarians, with health benefits of vegetarianism (positive) and education (negative predictor) also important. Conclusions : The implications of the findings for health and other issues are discussed. Judgements about the healthiness of meat are likely to be related to moral and environmental beliefs and, for non-vegetarians, to social concerns about vegetarianism, in addition to health beliefs. These need to be considered if any attempts are made to influence meat consumption. <br /...|$|R

Numerous studies {{have addressed the}} dietary habits of vegetarians and vegans in terms of disease prevention and nutritional deficiencies but the relationship between overweight and obesity and the demographic, psychosocial, lifestyle, and dietary intake of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans has received less attention. Guided by the social-ecological model, this study included a cross-sectional, quantitative, anonymous web-based survey to obtain dietary information on omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans. Vegans demonstrated a significantly lower mean and median body mass index (p= 0. 00) than omnivores, <b>semi-vegetarians,</b> and vegetarians. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated {{no significant difference in}} the odds of overweight (OR= 0. 41; p= 1. 14) and obesity (OR= 0. 47; p= 0. 28) in vegans compared to omnivores. Alcohol was significantly protective against obesity for both 1 - 2 (OR= 0. 33; p= 0. 03) and 3 - 30 (OR= 0. 20; p= 0. 01) days drinking per month while binge drinking significantly increased the odds of obesity (OR= 4. 44; p= 0. 01). Multiple logistic regression analysis stratified for levels of exercise revealed an interaction between diet and exercise.

Coupled with prior studies these results may contribute to positive social change by facilitating a broad-based paradigm shift in the view of diet and exercise as well as providing evidence that can be implementated in broad-based obesity control programs to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} dietary {{determinants of}} ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in health conscious individuals {{to explain the}} reduced risk in vegetarians, and to examine the relation between IHD and body mass index (BMI) within the normal range. DESIGN: Prospective observation of vegetarians, <b>semi-vegetarians,</b> and meat eaters for whom baseline dietary data, reported weight and height information, social class, and smoking habits were recorded. SUBJECTS: 10, 802 {{men and women in}} the UK aged between 16 and 79, mean duration of follow up 13. 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death rate rations for IHD and total mortality in relation to dietary and other characteristics recorded at recruitment (reference category death rate = 100). RESULTS: IHD mortality was less than half that expected from the experience reported for all of England and Wales. An increase in mortality for IHD was observed with increasing intakes of total and saturated animal fat and dietary cholesterol-death rate ratios in the third tertile compared with the first tertile: 329, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 150 to 721; 277, 95 % CI 125 to 613; 353, 95 % CI 157 to 796, respectively.

Within the study, death rate ratios were increased among those in the upper half of the normal BMI range (22. 5 to or = 25) compared with those with BMI 20 to < 22. 5. CONCLUSIONS: In these relatively health conscious individuals the deleterious effects of saturated animal fat and dietary cholesterol appear to be more important in the aetiology of IHD than the protective effect of dietary fibre. Reduced intakes of saturated animal fat and cholesterol may explain the lower rates of IHD among vegetarians compared with meat eaters.

40|$|A random {{population}} survey (n= 601) and {{a survey}} of vegetarians (n= 106) were conducted to examine South Australians' beliefs about meat and vegetarianism. Meat beliefs, barriers and benefits of vegetarianism, meat consumption, personal values, use of and trust in sources of food/nutrition/health information and demographic variables were measured via a written questionnaire. There were differences in the responses of vegetarians, <b>semi-vegetarians,</b> and non-vegetarians. For example, vegetarians {{were more likely than}} non-vegetarians to use and trust unorthodox information sources and to hold universal values (e. g. 'equality'). The factors associated with meat consumption and four sets of health-related beliefs about meat and vegetarianism (Meat is Necessary, Vegetarianism Health Concerns and Appreciates Meat, Meat is Unhealthy, Health Benefits of Vegetarianism) were examined. Other (health and non-health) beliefs, barriers and benefits of vegetarianism were the most important factors overall to be associated with these beliefs and with meat consumption. Information sources were also associated (particularly orthodox, unorthodox, mass media, advertising, and social sources). Together, these results provided insight into how consumption of meat and plant foods might be influenced. Finally, the proportion of prospective vegetarians was gauged. Approximately 15 % of non-vegetarians were found to hold similar beliefs about vegetarianism as vegetarians. Prospective vegetarians were distinct from vegetarians and the remaining omnivores. For example, they were less likely than the remaining omnivores to eat red meat as frequently or to be Anglo-Australian. The research suggested that {{a significant portion of the}} population is interested in vegetarian diets, but that certain barriers need to be overcome if this is to increase and lead to dietary change; in particular, the beliefs that vegetarian diets are nutritionally inadequate and that meat is essential for health. Tailored communications about how to prepare healthy, tasty vegetarian meals may also be useful. The results indicated the sources of food/nutrition/health information that may be most appropriate to disseminate such messages. Additionally, it was found that ethical (e. g. environmental, animal welfare) issues were linked to health and dietary behaviour. They may need to be more fully addressed by health professionals if the public is to obtain maximum benefit from plant-based diets, with minimum risk. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Young women in both groups had similar values of body mass index, concentrations of vitamin C, vitamin B 9 and -carotene. In vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian group was found the significantly increased daily intake of fiber, whole grain products, pulses, seeds and nuts. These finding suggest that both nutritional groups had the similar nutritional regimen from view of fruit and vegetables and different from view of other key vegetarian food commodities. Vitamin B 12, vitamin D and long-chain n- 3 fatty acids are not contained in plant food. Bioavailability of iron from food can be lower in presence of phytic acid from whole grain products and pulses and fiber pulses, seeds, nuts, whole grains. In group of lacto ovo vegetarians narrow range of animal food consumption vs. non vegetarian or semi vegetarian groups were found the significantly reduced concentrations of vitamin B 12, vitamin D and iron with a greater incidence of deficient values 49 per cent vs. 13 and 15 per cent for vitamin B 12, 67 vs. 46 and 50 for vitamin D, 44 vs. 20 and 30 for iron. Long chain n 3 fatty acid intake eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic in lacto ovo vegetarian group was significantly reduced and very low no fish consumption in comparison to non vegetarians and semi vegetarians. Intake of these acids in semi vegetarians vs. non vegetarians was non significantly increased. The substrate for long chain n 3 fatty acid biosynthesis linolenic acid was significantly more consumed in vegetarian groups mainly from linseeds. The findings suggest that limited consumption of animal food and dominant consumption of plant food can be connected with possible health risks higher incidence of deficient values of vitamin B 12, vitamin D, iron and long-chain n 3 fatty acids...|$|R

Results: In general terms, the omnivorous diet contained a significantly higher mineral content than the <b>semi-vegetarian</b> one. The mineral intake from both diets implied no health risk to the women studied, as their estimated daily intake (EDI) of toxic elements such as Cd and Pb was lower than their respective provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of these minerals. Hair of the semi-vegetarians contained higher amounts of Al (p < 0. 01), Ba (p < 0. 01), K (p < 0. 001), Na (p < 0. 001), Pb (p < 0. 001) and Mn (p < 0. 01) but lower levels of Ca (p < 0. 05) and Zn (p < 0. 05) than that of their omnivorous counterparts.

Interestingly, we found that the prevalence of vitamin B 12 deficient Korean centenarians was not higher compared with those from Western nations with animal-oriented traditional foods. We assumed that there might be some unveiled sources for vitamin B 12 in the Korean traditional foods. Screening of vitamin B 12 contents has revealed that some traditional soybean-fermented foods, such as Doenjang and Chunggukjang, and seaweeds contain considerable amounts of vitamin B 12.

The type of vegetarian diet was categorized based on a food-frequency questionnaire. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % CIs using multivariate-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS — Mean BMI was lowest in vegans (23. 6 kg/m 2) and incrementally higher in lacto-ovo vegetarians (25. 7 kg/m 2), pesco-vegetarians (26. 3 kg/m 2), semi-vegetarians (27. 3 kg/m 2), and nonvegetarians (28. 8 kg/m 2). Prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased from 2. 9 % in vegans to 7. 6 % in nonvegetarians; the prevalence was intermediate in participants consuming lacto-ovo (3. 2 %), pesco (4. 8 %), or <b>semi-vegetarian</b> (6. 1 %) diets. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, physical activity, television watching, sleep habits, alcohol use, and BMI, vegans (OR 0. 51 [95 % CI 0. 40 – 0. 66]), lacto-ovo vegetarians (0. 54 [0. 49 – 0. 60]), pesco-vegetarians (0. 70 [0. 61 – 0. 80]), and semi-vegetarians (0. 76 [0. 65 – 0. 90]) had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. CONCLUSIONS — The 5 -unit BMI difference between vegans and nonvegetarians indicates a substantial potential of vegetarianism to protect against obesity. Increased conformity to veg-etarian diets protected against risk of type 2 diabetes after lifestyle characteristics and BMI were taken into account. Pesco- and <b>semi-vegetarian</b> diets afforded intermediate protection. Diabetes Care 32 : 791 – 796, 2009 V egetarian diets may play a beneficialrole in promoting health and pre-venting obesity (1 – 3). Vegetarian-ism encompasses a spectrum of eating patterns: from diets that leave out all ani-mal meats and products (vegan) to diets that include eggs, milk, and milk prod-ucts (lacto-ovo vegetarian) or even fish in addition to eggs, milk, and milk products (pesco-vegetarian). A previous study has indicated that BMI increases when a wider spectrum of animal products are eaten...|$|E
