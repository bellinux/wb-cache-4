In a <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> a crowd {{estimated}} at 300,000, Jinnah stated (in English) that Urdu alone {{should be the}} national language, believing a single language was needed for a nation to remain united. The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and later in 1971 the official language issue {{was a factor in}} the region's secession to form the country of Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E

5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing {{at the conclusion of the}} concert.

5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas were guilty of polyandry in a <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> a gathering of Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, and held them captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{called a}} New England Woman’s Rights Convention in Boston on June 2, 1854, to expand her petitioning efforts. The {{convention}} adopted her resolution for petitioning all six New England legislatures, {{as well as}} her proposed form of petition, and it appointed a committee in each state to organize the work. In a <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> the second New England Woman’s Rights Convention, held in June, 1855, Stone urged that one reason women needed suffrage was to protect any gains achieved, reminding them that “the next Legislature may undo all that the last have done for women.” The convention adopted a resolution calling the ballot “woman’s sword and shield; the means of achieving and protecting all other civil rights” and another urging the national convention to make suffrage petitioning its priority.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive for}} women's {{suffrage}} was reinvigorated in the 1870s, and {{was sponsored by}} the leaders of the prohibition movement, especially the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The Indiana branch of the American Woman Suffrage Association was re-established in 1869. In 1878 May Wright Sewall founded the Indianapolis Equal Suffrage Society, which fought for world peace before the nation plunged into World War I. Several Indiana women also became temperance leaders and took {{an active role in the}} movement. The Indiana chapter of the WCTU was formed in 1874 with Zerelda G. Wallace as its first president. Like many other suffrage leaders, Wallace was radicalized for woman's suffrage through her temperance reform work. During her 1875 <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> the Indiana General Assembly in support of prohibition, legislators demonstrated an open contempt for women involved in politics and speaking in public. Afterward, Wallace credited the experience with her embrace of suffrage.|$|E
5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects {{that he may be}} growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As a result of the trauma of attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally cynical and rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> he met Mana.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} {{primaries}} on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates {{to become the}} presumptive nominee. In a <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763; {{at the time of}} the clinching, Clinton had 286superdelegates to Obama's 395, with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner. Clinton and Obama each received over 17million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{is sought}} after by the town's women but begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose {{to her at}} the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a <b>speech.</b> <b>Before</b> the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a <b>speech</b> <b>before</b> a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E
