5|$|Lithuania {{is divided}} into three layers of {{administrative}} divisions. The first-level division consists of 10 counties (Lithuanian: <b>singular</b> – apskritis, plural – apskritys). These are sub-divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: plural – savivaldybės, <b>singular</b> – savivaldybė), which in turn are further sub-divided into over 500 smaller groups, known as elderships (Lithuanian: plural – seniūnijos, <b>singular</b> – seniūnija).|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of bare <b>singulars</b> in Norwegian was thoroughly examined in Borthen (2003). The present paper outlines {{an account of}} these data in a type-logical semantics of the Neo-Carlsonian kind. The focus is primarily on the syntax-semantics interface, which here, somewhat simplified, amounts to assigning semantic types in the appropriate sortal domain to bare <b>singulars.</b> I argue that bare <b>singulars</b> can have their denotation both {{in the domain of}} ordinary individuals and kinds. Furthermore, they can either be used with their property type or function as names. This explains why bare <b>singulars</b> can be both predicates and arguments. Concerning bare <b>singulars</b> in the direct object position, the phenomenon of incorporation also seems to play a role. The various restrictions on the use of bare <b>singulars</b> can basically be accounted for in terms of competition with more marked grammatical forms, notably (in) definite DPs...|$|R

The Mayer–Vietoris sequence in <b>singular</b> homology for the triad (X, A, B) is a long exact sequence relating the <b>singular</b> homology groups (with coefficient group the integers Z) of the spaces X, A, B, and the intersection A∩B.

5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially <b>singular</b> (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For <b>singular</b> (co)homology, the <b>singular</b> (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E

The {{secondary}} forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund–participle and a past participle. The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person <b>singular</b> form is and the form are is used second person <b>singular</b> and all three plurals.

5|$|The {{territory}} of Lithuania {{is divided into}} 10 counties (Lithuanian: <b>singular</b> apskritis, plural apskritys), all named after their capitals. The counties are divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: <b>singular</b> savivaldybė, plural savivaldybės): 9 city municipalities, 43 district municipalities and 8 municipalities. Each municipality is then divided into elderates (Lithuanian: <b>singular</b> seniūnija, plural seniūnijos). This division was created in 1994 and slightly modified in 2000. On 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished, and since that date, counties remains as the territorial and statistical units.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the syntactic properties of weak definites and bare <b>singulars</b> in locative PP constructions. The realization of these weakly referential phrases (i. e. nominal phrases {{that do not}} seem to set up individual discourse referents) is studied in nine European languages. The goal of this study is twofold. First of all, this thesis is aimed at achieving a descriptive overview of the realization of weakly referential phrases. Regarding the realization of these phrases, the empirical facts show that languages do not behave differently in a systematic way {{on the basis of their}} geographical location. The second goal of this thesis is to provide a syntactic analysis for weak definites and bare <b>singulars.</b> The syntactic structure of weakly referential phrases is studied using syntactic elements that exist in the nominal domain (diminutives, adjectives, plural morphology). The thesis dicusses their effects on the grammaticality and interpretation of weak definites and bare <b>singulars.</b> The general pattern across languages is that bare <b>singulars</b> do not allow adjectival modification and diminutives. In some cases bare <b>singulars</b> can bear plural morphology, but in those cases the bare nouns lose their weak reading. Weak definites generally allow diminutives, adjectives and plural morphology, but these elements cause the weak definites to lose their weak reading. Following Longobardi (2004), most of these facts can be accounted for in terms of N-to-D movement and expletive articles...|$|R
