5000|$|In telecommunications, {{parallel}} transmission is the simultaneous {{transmission of the}} <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> of a character or other entity of data. In digital communications, {{parallel transmission}} is the simultaneous transmission of related <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> over two or more separate paths. Multiple electrical wires are used which can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is used internally within the computer, for example the internal buses, and sometimes externally {{for such things as}} printers, The major issue with this is [...] "skewing" [...] because the wires in parallel data transmission have slightly different properties (not intentionally) so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. A parity bit can help to reduce this. However, electrical wire parallel data transmission is therefore less reliable for long distances because corrupt transmissions are far more likely.|$|R

An overview of hierarchical processing systems is included as well as a presentation of various approaches to signal representation, feature representation and feature extraction.

A new representation, the operator representation is developed. It is based on an interpretation of features in terms of signal transformations. This representation has no references to any spatial ordering of the <b>signal</b> <b>element</b> and also gives an explicit representation of signal features.

40|$|Blockade of {{prostaglandin}} (PG) {{production by}} COX inhibitors is {{the treatment of}} choice for inflammatory pain but is also prone to severe side effects. Identification of <b>signaling</b> <b>elements</b> downstream of COX inhibition, particularly of PG receptor subtypes responsible for pain sensitization (hyperalgesia), provides a strategy for better-tolerated analgesics. Here, we have identified PGE 2 receptors of the EP 2 receptor subtype as key <b>signaling</b> <b>elements</b> in spinal inflammatory hyperalgesia. Mice deficient in EP 2 receptors (EP 2 -/- mice) completely lack spinal PGE 2 -evoked hyperalgesia. After a peripheral inflammatory stimulus, EP 2 -/- mice exhibit only short-lasting peripheral hyperalgesia but lack a second sustained hyperalgesic phase of spinal origin. Electrophysiological recordings identify diminished synaptic inhibition of excitatory dorsal horn neurons as the dominant source of EP 2 receptor-dependent hyperalgesia. Our results thus demonstrate that inflammatory hyperalgesia can be treated by targeting of a single PG receptor subtype and provide a rational basis for new analgesic strategies going beyond COX inhibition...|$|R

40|$|SummarySex is {{determined}} in C. elegans by a chromosome-counting mechanism that tallies X chromosome dose {{relative to the}} sets of autosomes, the X:A ratio. A group of genes on X called X signal elements (XSEs) communicates X chromosome number by repressing {{the activity of the}} master sex-determination switch gene xol- 1 in a dose-dependent manner. xol- 1 is repressed by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms and is inactive in XX animals (hermaphrodite) but active in XO animals (male). Prior to our work, the nature of the autosomal signal and its target(s) were unknown. Here we show the signal includes discrete, trans-acting autosomal signal elements (ASEs) that counter XSEs to coordinately control both sex determination and dosage compensation. sea- 1, the first autosomal <b>signal</b> <b>element,</b> encodes a T-box transcription factor that opposes XSEs by activating transcription of xol- 1.

40|$|The major immediate-early gene {{of human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} encodes several isoforms of an immediate-early protein which has distinct transcriptional regulatory properties. The IE 86 isoform autorepresses the major immediate-early promoter by directly binding the cis repression <b>signal</b> <b>element</b> located between the TATA {{box and the}} mRNA cap site. In addition to this activity, IE 86 stimulates other viral and cellular promoters. One mechanism by which eukaryotic regulatory proteins are thought to stimulate transcription is by contacting one or more general transcription factors. We show that the IE 86 protein physically interacts with the DNA-binding subunit (TATA-binding protein) human transcription factor IID via the TATA-binding protein-contacting domain in the N terminus of IE 86. In a mobility shift assay, IE 86 was also observed to stabilize the binding of TATA-binding protein to promoter DNA. The domains within IE 86 responsible for mediating transactivation and repression functioned independently. These experiments thus demonstrate the elegant ability of human cytomegalovirus to join different protein domains to produce distinct multifunctional proteins...|$|E

We used a novel stimulus to investigate how signals are combined to improve estimates of global orientation. Stimuli were 29 × 29 element arrays of 4 c/deg log Gabors, spaced 1 ° apart. A proportion {{of these elements}} had a coherent orientation (horizontal/vertical) with the remainder assigned random orientations. The observer's task was to identify the global orientation. The spatial configuration of the signal was modulated by a checkerboard pattern of square checks containing potential <b>signal</b> <b>elements.</b> The other locations contained either randomly oriented elements (''noise check'') or were blank (''blank check''). The distribution of <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> was manipulated by varying the size and location of the checks within a fixed-diameter stimulus.

For small check sizes, however, the pooling occurred indiscriminately over relevant and irrelevant locations. For these check sizes, thresholds for the noise check and blank check conditions were similar, suggesting that the limiting noise is not induced by {{the response to the}} noise elements. The results are described by a model that filters the stimulus at the potential target orientations and then combines the signals over space in two stages.
