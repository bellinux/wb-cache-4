The Ca 2 + contents of <b>synaptosomes</b> prepared from menadione (10 mg/kg) -treated animals in vivo and <b>synaptosomes</b> reoxygenated after anoxia were unchanged. In <b>synaptosomes</b> prepared from menadione-treated animals, acetylcholine release was no longer significantly stimulated by K+, whereas it was unchanged from control (normoxic) values in <b>synaptosomes</b> reoxygenated after anoxia. None of these treatments caused any measurable damage to the synaptic plasma membrane (as judged by the release of lactate dehydrogenase), or to synaptosomal phospholipases (as judged by choline release from membrane phospholipids). <b>Synaptosomes</b> prepared from menadione-treated rats were found to be a good model for the study of post-anoxic damage to nerve-terminal function...|$|R

50|$|A <b>synaptosome</b> is an {{isolated}} synaptic terminal from a neuron. Synaptosomes are obtained by mild homogenization of nervous tissue under isotonic conditions and subsequent fractionation using differential and density gradient centrifugation. Liquid shear detaches the nerve terminals from the axon and the plasma membrane surrounding the nerve terminal particle reseals. Synaptosomes are osmotically sensitive, contain numerous small clear synaptic vesicles, sometimes larger dense-core vesicles and frequently {{one or more}} small mitochondria. They carry the morphological features {{and most of the}} chemical properties of the original nerve terminal. Synaptosomes isolated from mammalian brain often retain a piece of the attached postsynaptic membrane, facing the active zone.|$|E
50|$|Synaptosomes {{were first}} {{isolated}} {{in an attempt}} to identify the subcellular compartment corresponding to the fraction of so-called bound acetylcholine that remains when brain tissue is homogenized in iso-osmotic sucrose. Particles containing acetylcholine and its synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase were originally isolated by Hebb and Whittaker (1958) at the Agricultural Research Council, Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, UK. In a collaborative study with the electron microscopist George Gray from University College London, Victor P. Whittaker eventually showed that the acetylcholine-rich particles derived from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were synaptic vesicle-rich pinched-off nerve terminals. Whittaker coined the term <b>synaptosome</b> to describe these fractionation-derived particles and shortly thereafter synaptic vesicles could be isolated from lysed synaptosomes.|$|E
5000|$|At recombination, two {{directly}} repeated res {{sites with}} resolvase dimers bound to each sub-site, {{come together to}} form a large complex structure called the <b>synaptosome.</b> Resolvase bound to sites II and III initiates the assembly of this complex. In this structure, exact architecture of which is still unclear, two res sites are intertwined {{in such a way as}} to juxtapose two copies of site I, allowing resolvase dimers bound to each site to form a tetramer. Again, it is the interaction between the resolvase dimers bound at accessory sites (sites II and III) and resolvase at site I that causes the two dimers to synapse and form a tetramer. After the tetramer is formed it becomes activated and the top and bottom DNA strands are simultaneously cleaved in the middle of the site I with a 2bp overhang. The strand exchange ensues by as yet unknown mechanism with a resulting net rotation of 180°. The strand exchange is then followed by the religation (Stark et al., 1992).Recombination between two directly repeated res sites separates, or resolves, the “cointegrate” into two original molecules, each one now containing a copy of the Tn3 transposon. After resolution these two molecules remain linked as a simple two-noded catenane which can be easily separated in vivo by a type II topoisomerase (Grindley 2002). Wild type resolvase system absolutely requires a supercoiled substrate and that the recombination sites are oriented in a direct repeat on the same DNA molecule. However, a number of “deregulated” or “hyperactive” mutants that have lost the requirement for the accessory sites have been isolated. These mutants are capable of catalysing recombination between two copies of site I only, which basically reduces the recombination site size from 114bp to only 28bp. [...] Furthermore, these mutants have no supercoiling or connectivity requirements (Arnold et al., 1999) and have been shown to work in mammalian cells. Hyperactive resolvase mutants have so far proven useful in creating resolvases with altered sequence specificity [...] but also in structural work.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} epilepsy-associated {{changes in}} the presynaptic terminal, we isolated and characterized <b>synaptosomes</b> from biopsies resected during surgical treatment of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. Our main findings are: (1) The yield of synaptosomal protein from biopsies of epilepsy patients was about 25 % of that from rat brain. Synaptosomal preparations were essentially free of glial contaminations. (2) <b>Synaptosomes</b> from TLE patients and naive rat brain, quickly responded to K+-depolarization with a 70 % increase in intrasynaptosomal Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i), and a 40 % increase in B- 50 /GAP- 43 phosphorylation. (3) Neocortical and hippocampal <b>synaptosomes</b> from TLE patients contained 20 50 % of the glutamate and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents of rat cortical <b>synaptosomes.</b> (4) Although the absolute amount of glutamate and GABA released under basal conditions from neocortical <b>synaptosomes</b> of TLE patients was lower than from rat <b>synaptosomes,</b> basal release expressed as percentage of total content was higher (16. 4 % and 17. 3 %, respectively) than in rat (11. 5 % and 9. 9 %, respectively). (5) Depolarization-induced glutamate and GABA release from neocortical <b>synaptosomes</b> from TLE patients was smaller than from rat <b>synaptosomes</b> (3. 9 % and 13. 0 % vs. 21. 9 % and 25. 0 %, respectively). (6) Analysis of breakdown of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) indicates that resection time (anoxic period during the operation) is a critical parameter {{for the quality of}} the <b>synaptosomes.</b> We conclude that highly pure and viable <b>synaptosomes</b> can be isolated even from highly sclerotic human epileptic tissue. Our data show that in studies on human <b>synaptosomes</b> it is of critical importance to distinguish methodological (i. e., resection time) from pathology-related abnormalities...|$|R

All synaptosomal preparations demonstrated a basal [Ca 2 +]i of about 200 nM, except neocortical <b>synaptosomes</b> from MTS-associated TLE patients (420 nM). K+-induced depolarization resulted in a robust increase of the basal [Ca 2 +]i in all preparations. Neocortical <b>synaptosomes</b> from TLE patients contained 22. 9 ± 3. 0 nmol glutamate and 4. 6 ± 0. 5 nmol GABA per milligram synaptosomal protein, whereas rat cortical <b>synaptosomes</b> contained twice as much glutamate and four times as much GABA. Hippocampal <b>synaptosomes</b> from MTS-associated TLE patients, unlike those from T-associated TLE patients, contained about 70 % less glutamate and 55 % less GABA than neocortical <b>synaptosomes.</b> Expressed as percentage of total synaptosomal content, <b>synaptosomes</b> from MTS-associated TLE patients exhibited an increased basal and a reduced K+-induced glutamate and GABA release compared to rat cortical <b>synaptosomes.</b> In MTS-associated TLE patients, only GABA release from neocortical <b>synaptosomes</b> was partially Ca 2 +-dependent. Control experiments in rat <b>synaptosomes</b> demonstrated that {{at least part of the}} reduction in K+-induced release can be ascribed to resection-induced hypoxia in biopsies. Thus, <b>synaptosomes</b> from MTS-associated TLE patients exhibit a significant K+-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i, but the consequent release of glutamate and GABA is severely impaired.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance {{has been used}} to study the association of atropine and eserine with acetylchol inesterase extracted from squid head ganglia and <b>synaptosome</b> membranes from rat brain cortex. Line width changes of the N-methyl and phenyl groups of atropine and the N-methyl and C-methyl groups of eserine resulting from association with the enzyme and the <b>synaptosome</b> membranes have been used to study the interactions. The results show that whereas eserine binds at the active site of the enzyme, atropine binds at a site distinct from the active center. Further proof that the binding sites of the two ligands are distinct from each other was obtained by showing that the antichol inesterase, tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) diminished the binding of eserine but not of atropine. The effect of pH, ionic strength and TEPP on the binding of <b>synaptosome</b> membranes was similar to the results obtained with soluble acetylchol inesterase.

The brain origin of mouse <b>synaptosome</b> cybrid mtDNAs was confirmed using sequence polymorphisms in the mtDNA COIII, ND 3 and tRNAArg genes. The brain origin of the human <b>synaptosome</b> cybrids was confirmed using a rare mtDNA MboI polymorphism. Fusion of synaptosomes from the brain of a 35 -year-old woman resulted in 71  synaptosome cybrids.

Three percent of the cybrid clones had mtDNAs with 10 Cs, 76 % had nine, 18 % had eight and 3 % had seven Cs. Comparable results were obtained by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of mtDNA control regions directly from the patient’s brain tissue, but not when the control region was amplified and cloned from a <b>synaptosome</b> cybrid homoplasmic for a mtDNA with nine Cs. Thus, we have clonally recovered mtDNA control region length variants from an adult human brain without recourse to PCR, and established the variant mtDNAs within living cultured cells.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} in quantitative yield the synaptic intermediate formed during site-specific recombination by Tn 3 resolvase and characterized it by restriction endonuclease mapping, electron microscopy and topological methods. The intermediate accumulates at low reaction temperatures and is stabilized by crosslinking of the resolvase protomers with glutaraldehyde. The DNA-resolvase complex that maintains {{the structure of}} the intermediate (the <b>synaptosome)</b> is approximately 100 A in diameter, forms specifically at resolution (res) sites, and requires two res sites in a supercoiled DNA molecule. Resolvase bound to individual res sites protects approximately - 0. 5 supercoil per site from relaxation by a topoisomerase, whereas the formation of the <b>synaptosome</b> protects - 3 supercoils and condenses the associated DNA to a supercoil density 2. 5 times that of the non-complexed substrate. Although recombination requires two directly repeated res sites, both direct and inverted sites form synaptosomes.

In striatal <b>synaptosomes,</b> prelabelled with [3 H]dopamine (DA), chronic nicotine did not modify the releasing effect of nicotine. No significant change was observed in experiments with <b>synaptosomes</b> from nucleus accumbens prelabelled with [3 H]DA. Exposure of hippocampal <b>synaptosomes</b> prelabelled with [3 H]choline to nicotine elicited release of [3 H]acetylcholine; this effect was almost abolished in <b>synaptosomes</b> from animals administered nicotine for 10 days, suggesting downregulation of nicotinic autoreceptors. In hippocampal <b>synaptosomes</b> prelabelled with [3 H]D-aspartate, the releasing effect of epibatidine following chronic nicotine treatment did not differ from that in controls.

Therefore, the modified procedure was better than the older method in effort to isolate more pure synapse protein for improved result outcome. To advance the method for our study, the following modifications were made to the regularly used protocols: • The pellet consisting of synaptosomes was cleaned two to three times in HEPES buffer containing proteases inhibitor and centrifuged at 12, 000  × g for 15  min each. This step is highly essential to remove any contamination of sucrose-HEPES buffer and other organelle's which interfere with protein purification analysis. • Following this step, the <b>synaptosome</b> pellets were suspended in RIPA buffer (mixed with protease inhibitor and PMSF) along with 0. 2 % TritonX- 100 and further centrifuged at 20, 000  × g. • Further, the resulting pellet was discarded and suspended in RIPA buffer (mixed with protease inhibitor and PMSF) only. The sample was immediately used for protein estimation and protein electrophoresis...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that complement alone releases glutamate from human and mouse cortical terminals in an antibody-independent manner. In order to expand our knowledge on complement-mediated effects, we investigated whether the presence of an antigen-antibody complex in synaptosomal plasmamembranes could also trigger complement-induced functional responses that might affect neurotransmitter release. To this aim, we focused on the chemokine 5 receptor (CCR 5) expressed in human and mouse cortical glutamate terminals, whose activation by CCL 5 elicits [(3) H]D-aspartate ([(3) H]D-ASP) release. Preincubating <b>synaptosomes</b> with an antibody recognizing the NH 2 terminus of the CCR 5 protein (anti-NH 2 -CCR 5 antibody) abolished the CCL 5 -induced [(3) H]D-ASP release. Similarly, enriching <b>synaptosomes</b> with an antibody recognizing the COOH terminus of CCR 5 (anti-COOH-CCR 5 antibody) prevented the CCL 5 -induced [(3) H]D-ASP release. The antagonist-like activity of the anti-NH 2 -CCR 5 antibody turned to facilitation when anti-NH 2 -CCR 5 -treated <b>synaptosomes</b> were exposed to complement. In these terminals, the releasing effect was significantly higher than that elicited by complement in untreated <b>synaptosomes.</b> On the contrary, the complement-induced [(3) H]D-ASP release from anti-COOH-CCR 5 antibody-entrapped <b>synaptosomes</b> did not differ from that from untreated <b>synaptosomes.</b> Preincubating <b>synaptosomes</b> with anti-beta tubulin III antibody, used as negative control, neither prevented the CCL 5 -induced releasing effect nor it amplified the complement-induced [(3) H]D-ASP release. Finally, serum lacking the C 1 q protein, i. e. the protein essential to promote the antibody-mediated activation of complement, elicited a comparable [(3) H]D-ASP release from both untreated and anti-NH 2 -CCR 5 antibody-treated <b>synaptosomes.</b> Thus, we propose that antibodies raised against the outer sequence of a receptor protein can trigger the activation of the complement through the classic, C 1 q-mediated antibody-dependent pathway, which results in an abnormal release of glutamate that could be deleterious to central nervous system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} [14 C]GABA release from <b>synaptosomes</b> induced by native and {{monoclonal}} antibodies-modified α-latrotoxin (LTX). Modification of LTX eliminates the toxin's ability to increase [Ca 2 +]i influx into <b>synaptosomes.</b> It {{has been shown}} that native LTX does not change 22 Na influx into rat brain <b>synaptosomes.</b> Both toxin forms studied, native and modified by monoclonal antibodies, stimulate [14 C]GABA release from <b>synaptosomes</b> in divalent-free medium where sodium was substituted by equimolar concentrations of choline chloride. Native toxin induces a more rapid stimulation of [14 C]GABA release than the modified one. It was suggested that the difference in the mediator release rates is not accounted for by the inability of modified toxin to form active ion channels in synaptosomal plasmalemma, but most probably by the state of toxin-receptor complexes...|$|R
