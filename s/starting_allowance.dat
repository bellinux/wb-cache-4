30|$|Already in 2002, a {{so-called}} ‘start assistance’ or ‘introduction allowance’ (paid amount is the same) was introduced, {{which was to}} replace the former introduction allowance (equivalent to social assistance) for newly arrived immigrants. This {{new version of the}} introduction allowance was paid the first 3 years after a person has arrived in Denmark, and they obtained a resident permit if they participated in an introduction program. They then became eligible to receive ‘start assistance’ for a 4 -year period. The benefit level was to remain the same for the entire 7 -year period. As in 1999, these benefits were also considerably lower than the ordinary social assistance, but this time around the UNHCR did not raise the same criticism, as it was now also aimed at citizens with Danish roots who had returned after spending 7 years or more outside of Denmark. <b>Start</b> assistance/introduction <b>allowance</b> was some 35 – 50 % lower than ordinary social assistance, depending on the family situation (the reductions being lower for families with children) (Andersen, 2007). While Danish social assistance was comparatively generous, the start assistance and introduction allowance schemes were among the least generous schemes in north-western Europe (Hansen, 2006). Like the first version of the introduction allowance in 1999, the principle of conditionality remained prevalent, meaning that the benefit was reduced correspondingly in the event of absence from the introduction programme (that could not be excused by illness or other compelling reasons). The formal political argument for introducing lower benefits was to reinforce the financial incentive to find employment and, as in 1999, there was greater emphasis on conditionality, meaning that absence from employment-promoting measures would reduce benefits correspondingly. The administrative framework for the introduction <b>allowance</b> (and <b>start</b> assistance) therefore differed little from the administrative framework of the Danish social assistance scheme (standardized rates for payment, where the exact rate depends on factors such as marital status, number of children, property, and the like, as opposed to the discretion of the municipal authority) and institutional spill-over mechanisms from general programmes for unemployed people to programmes for newly arrived immigrants was to some extent still apparent.|$|R

40|$|The federal {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s new quarantining rules won 2 ̆ 7 t {{solve the problem}} they 2 ̆ 7 re designed to address, argues Kemran MestanLIZ is twenty-two. The mother of a six-month old baby, she is neither studying nor working, and she receives the parenting payment (single) from Centrelink. Because Liz lives in a “declared income management area” and is under twenty-five, the {{federal government}}’s new welfare legislation means {{that she will be}} subject to income management because she has been in receipt of the parenting payment for more than thirteen weeks [...] . This case study comes from explanatory memorandum accompanying the federal government’s Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform and Reinstatement of Racial Discrimination Act) Bill, introduced into parliament in late 2009. With this bill the government has kept its promise to reinstate the Racial Discrimination Act, but only at the cost of discriminating against poor people regardless of their indigeneity. “Liz” has not necessarily done anything to suggest she is unable to spend her money prudently for herself or her child, except for living in an area that the minister has deemed to contain “serious disadvantage". Dr John Falzon from the St Vincent de Paul Society describes the policy as “discrimination by postcode", and there are good reasons for questioning its aims and impact. From July 2010 the minister, Jenny Macklin, will be able to demarcate any area within the Northern Territory and quarantine half of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s income support payments and 100 per cent of any lump sum payments. The quarantined income can only be spent using a special card, the Basics Card, at designated stores. Tobacco, alcohol and pornography cannot be purchased using the card. The plan is to apply the same system across Australia by 2011 – 12, again in areas with concentrations of people of low socio-economic status. The categories of people whose welfare can be quarantined (or, as the government prefers to characterise it, “managed”) are described as disengaged youth (which is the category Liz falls into), long-term welfare recipients (excluding pensioners and recipients of disability benefits) and people deemed to require welfare quarantining by a Centrelink social worker or child-protection authority. Although the Northern Territory intervention was initially justified as “saving the children”, many if not most of the people likely to be affected by the new policies do not have children. The government says that a central principle of its welfare reform agenda, of which welfare quarantining is a “key tool”, is based on enhancing individual responsibility. This seems paradoxical: surely people who have less liberty to decide how to spend their money are being entrusted with less responsibility? Moreover, the government is offering incentives to people not included in the mandatory categories to voluntarily relinquish control over half of their income. These measures suggest that when the government speaks of responsibility, what it really means is obligation – that individuals will be required to behave in prescribed ways. The policy doesn’t appear to be intended to demonise marginalised people. With the opposition in disarray, the government has no need to resort to such tactics to secure votes. In fact, releasing the legislation in November, while the media was distracted by an opposition leadership scuffle, suggests that the government does not want to highlight the issue. Although Labor might never have initiated the policy, it has happily embraced the welfare quarantining introduced by the Coalition government. There are two distinct reasons why Labor has so enthusiastically embraced and extended welfare quarantining, one electoral, one ideological. To understand the electoral explanation, we need to recall the context of the introduction of the Northern Territory intervention, when welfare quarantining was established: an election was imminent and John Howard was looking for an issue to “wedge” Labor. Kevin Rudd refused to take the bait, going along with whatever the Coaltion threw at him. Because Mr Rudd has sought to avoid abrupt policy changes – to stick to his promises and convictions – he has shown a reluctance to reverse endorsed policies such as his support for quarantining. On the other hand, though, Mr Rudd and his government are keen to be respected players internationally. Hence, in April last year the government affirmed support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. (Australia was one of only four nations that initially failed to sign the agreement in 2007.) The problem, as the United Nations Human Rights Rapporteur asserted in September 2009, was that the Northern Territory intervention, which suspended the Racial Discrimination Act, was incompatible with Australia’s obligations. One obvious solution was to expand welfare quarantining to non-Indigenous people. This was an easier choice for the Rudd government because welfare quarantining is consistent with an increasingly prevalent ideological trend, implemented by both Labour and the Coalition. This trend has seen a shift from understanding poverty in terms of systemic failures, such as structural unemployment, to viewing it as a result of individual failures, such as incompetent, criminal or immoral behaviour. Hence, policy solutions are largely based on controlling the behaviour of disadvantaged people. Welfare quarantining {{is not the first time}} that Aboriginal people have been used as guinea pigs for implementing policies that were later applied to broader disadvantaged populations. In 1977 the Fraser government introduced a work for the dole scheme for Indigenous people called Community Development Employment Projects. Programs resembling this scheme were then applied to non-indigenous populations by Labor, which mandated activity agreements and introduced a Job Compact scheme that drew on the idea of reciprocal obligation. These policies were then the foundation for the Coalition government’s Mutual Obligation strategy, which intensified the punitive elements attached to activity requirements. Although the government would never describe its policies as paternalistic, its stated justifications for the policy are explicitly so. But paternalistic policies, like even some of the worst social policies, are based on a grain of truth. It would be naive to think that some people receiving income support do not spend their money in imprudent ways. Good social policy comes from considering all the relevant facts and giving them appropriate weight. It is a matter of what is emphasised and what is neglected. Welfare quarantining emphasises individual failures and neglects the causes of poverty, such as poor education resources and a lack of opportunities for fulfilling employment. Furthermore, welfare quarantining is by far the most significant change to welfare policy that the Rudd government has introduced. How is quarantining welfare payments meant to “tackle the destructive, intergenerational cycle of passive welfare”? This is not a rhetorical question, but a request to the policy-makers for further explanation. Not only is welfare quarantining unlikely to achieve its stated goals, it will have adverse effects, making the lives of the worst off even worse. Welfare quarantining will stigmatise the targeted populations; it sends out the message that people who receive welfare are irresponsible. Imagine having to pay for your groceries with a quarantine card: it’s likely you would be anxious that the surrounding people are thinking “this is one of those people that can’t be trusted with money and she probably abuses her kids. ” Thus a trip to the store could become an ordeal. Although people can gain exceptions from quarantining, the burden of proof lies on them, with the assumption of incompetence or untrustworthiness until demonstrated otherwise. Furthermore, gaining the proof could be a humiliating experience, such as requesting your child’s school provide evidence that your child has been attending regularly. The burden of proof should surely be reversed. Only if there is a strong case that an individual could benefit from welfare quarantining should it be considered. For example, in the case of child wellbeing, case by case welfare quarantining could be combined with improved universal services. That is, improved maternal and child health services could involve nurses more regularly visiting homes to provide healthcare for children, and thereby they would be well placed to report risks to child well-being. This would avoid stigmatising whole populations merely based on where they live and if they require welfare support, thus preserving Australian egalitarianism. Under the current arrangement though, to add to the injury of stigmatisation, the government will insultingly offer a one-off matched savings payment, but only on the condition that the person undertakes a money management course. Anyone capable of saving a single cent on an annual income as low as 11, 856, in the case of New <b>Start</b> <b>allowance,</b> surely has no need for such courses. What’s worse, on completing the money management course, the additional payment is itself quarantined; the government obviously doesn’t have much faith in money management courses. Welfare quarantining won’t increase personal responsibility, and it will certainly not break the cycle of intergenerational poverty, but on the other hand it will stigmatise whole populations. The government’s attention to addressing disadvantage is commendable, but policies that largely attribute the causes of disadvantage to individual failings, whilst ignoring the structural issues, are unlikely to have a significant positive effect. • Kemran Mestan is a PhD student in the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University of Technology Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inhaled {{nitric oxide}} (iNO) {{has been used}} in the {{treatment}} of pulmonary hypertension in neonates for many years. iNO was approved by the FDA in 1999 for hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) in term and near term infants, defined as > 34 weeks gestational age (GA). iNO is used for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), secondary pulmonary hypertension caused by congenital heart disease (CHD), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and other pathologies. iNO has its effect locally on the pulmonary vasculature and has been studied extensively regarding its effect on morbidities such as: need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), oxygen requirements, and mechanical ventilatory support. However, protocols for weaning iNO and for the duration of iNO weaning have not been studied extensively. It has been shown that an abrupt discontinuation leads to rebound pulmonary hypertension. Methods: Electronic literature search and review of published articles on the use of iNO in the neonate. Results: Electronic databases including Medline and PubMed were searched from the years 1995 - 2015, using the keywords "iNO", "nitric oxide", "neonate", and "weaning nitric oxide. " This search revealed 2, 124 articles. Articles were determined to be eligible for review if they included a specific protocol for weaning iNO, and were published in English. 16 articles with specific protocols for iNO weaning have been identified and reviewed. The studies had enrolled a total of 1, 735 neonates either at term either preterm and with a mean birth weight of 3. 3 kg (± 2 kg). Main diagnoses included MAS, CHD (total anomalous pulmonary venous return [TAPVR], d-transposition of the great vessels [DTGV], atrial septal defect [ASD], pulmonary atresia [PA], hypoplastic left heart syndrome [HLH]), pneumonia, RDS, hyaline membrane disease (HMD), PPHN, CDH, sepsis, pulmonary hypoplasia, pulmonary hemorrhage, hydrops fetalis, and other congenital anomalies. The average dose of iNO was 20 ppm (range = 2 - 80 ppm). The duration of exposure to iNO was on average 2 ± 2 days (range = 15 min -  7 days). Weaning protocols were highly varied from duration of treatment, duration of time in between iNO decreases, initial dose, adjunctive medications used to wean, and increasing FiO 2 used to wean iNO. The weaning parameters were based on multiple variables including FiO 2, PaO 2, O 2 sats, and pulmonary arterial pressure. Conclusion: There is a limited amount of data specific to weaning protocols for nitric oxide. There is no consensus on an appropriate method for weaning of iNO either on its own, or with adjunct medication. Further research to elucidate a strategy for weaning of iNO needs to be done. We propose that weaning iNO in a stepwise approach from 20 ppm in increments of 5 ppm per decrease until 5 ppm; and stepwise by 1 ppm from 5 ppm to off, while monitoring O 2 saturations and blood gases parameters and allowing transient increases in FiO 2 during adjustment to the transition is a safe approach (both for invansive and non-invasive modes of ventilation). This is not a protocol that is appropriate for every patient pathology, but is a safe <b>starting</b> point with <b>allowance</b> for individual patient and physician variablilty. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} collects three {{essays on}} the economics of global warming and climate policies. The papers, each of whom {{can be read as}} a stand‑alone essay, are arranged in a way that goes from a more radical, more general approach to a more pragmatic, more specific one. The first essay deals with the very essence of global warming: is it a global public bad? Does its nature justify, or even require, international collective action in order to let the external costs be internalized? In order to provide an answer, a Coasian approach is undertaken. The starting point is an original interpretation of the socalled Coase Theorem, which is derived from Forte (2007). Forte argues that the symmetry underlying the theorem can only be held true in the short run. In the long run, however, the symmetry ceases to exist because, among the other reasons, a different return on invested capital may emerge under a different initial allocation of rights. It follows that the initial allocation of rights does matter, even in a transactions costs‑free world. An intuitive consequence of this, is that the long‑term consequences of the initial allocation should be considered. In the case of pollution, this may mean that it is not always efficient to follow the Polluter Pays Principle. In fact, while pollution is a negative externality, the venture that causes it may also generate positive externalities. When this is the case, by imposing to the polluter the cost of getting rid of pollution, the positive externality may be lost together with the negative one. The present paper argues that this is precisely the case of global warming. Greenhouse gases emissions – which are suspected of causing man‑made global warming, as opposed to natural climate change – are, at the present state of technology, an unavoidable byproduct of energy production and economic growth. Cutting emissions – as is requested by many stakeholders as well as by international treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol – might result in curbing economic growth, and by so doing it might impose a social cost that is greater than the avoided cost from global warming. The econometric evidence on the costs of global warming and the costs of climate policies, {{as well as on the}} respective benefits, is still unclear. Hence, the present scenario is characterized by a deep uncertainty on the side of the costs and benefits of collective action (or the lack thereof), and by a lack of cost‑efficient technological alternatives to the current technologies, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. By applying the Forte interpretation of the Coase Theorem, it may be argued that—when this is more efficient—it might well be the case to let the cost of pollution (or the cost of eliminating pollution) bear on the polluted party, instead of the polluter. Since the polluted party, as far as global warming is concerned, is future generations, this means that a case can be made against climate change mitigation. Temperatures might be left free to grow (that is, carbon dioxide might be left free to accumulate in the atmosphere) until cost‑efficient technologies become available. Policies should instead focus on accelerating the process of technological innovation, and on developing adaptation measures in order to better face the effects, rather than addressing the alleged causes, of global warming. The second paper looks at the existing patterns from greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, widely suspected of contributing to global warming. Assuming that some sort of political action is to be taken, and that some result may follow, it is noted that emissions – both in aggregate, on a per capita basis, and in terms of carbon intensity, i. e. the ratio between total emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) – are stabilizing or slightly declining in most developed countries. On the contrary, total emissions, per capita emissions, and carbon intensity are dramatically increasing in the developing world. A higher carbon intensity is interpreted as a proxy of a more obsolete technology. An analogy is then made with the pattern governing other pollutants, that is the so‑called Environmental Kuznets Curve. Empirical evidence shows that as a general rule in most countries pollutants have increased at first, then peaked and decreased as GDP has grown. This phenomenon has been theoretically understood as a consequence of the increased concentrations of pollutants that made them ever more intolerable on the one hand, and the increased availability of wealth to be invested in newer technologies and/or in innovative investments on the other hand. It is unclear, however, whether or not carbon emissions are following such a bell‑shaped curve, too. Further investigations into this pattern have suggested that GDP growth is not the only independent variable. The existence of free market institutions also matter, in that this allows GDP growth and creates a more favourable environment for investments. An empirical measure of the existence of free market institutions has been gleaned by the Index of Economic Freedom, published yearly by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal. A panel dataset has been built with data regarding the Index of Economic Freedom, its subcomponents, total GHGs emissions, and a number of other macroeconomic and environmental indicators. A model has been built that relates GHGs emissions with economic freedom, controlling for one or more of the above‑mentioned variables. A significant, negative correlation has been found, which means that economic freedom – along with other factors – may explain part of the difference in carbon intensity between countries. The correlation is stronger for lower values of economic freedom, consistently with other evidence that correlates economic freedom with economic growth. There are theoretical reasons to believe that the correlation may be a sign of a causal link, even though the empirical evidence is still not enough to support such a claim. If the causal link should be proven true, a policy consequence would be that–all else being equal–increasing economic freedom might lead to a reduced carbon intensity in the developing world, which is expected to account for an increasing share of global emissions in the next few decades. If this is correct, promoting economic freedom could be an effective, no‑regret way to contain future emissions. The third paper focuses on the European Union’s climate policies. A first assessment is made by looking at the stated objectives of the policy, i. e. limiting temperature growth within 2 degrees above the pre‑industrial levels, and the broader context of GHGs emissions. It is shown that the EU is responsible for a relatively small share of world emissions, which is going to decline if the present trends continue. Under this reasonable assumption, the impact that European efforts may or will have on world emissions is negligible, as is their possible consequences on temperatures rise and global warming. This means that EU policies, absent an international cooperation on curbing emissions, can’t hold vis‑à‑vis any cost‑benefit analysis, however low is the “cost” side. The existing policies are not only unlikely to deliver a measurable environmental benefit: they are also working very poorly. The most important European policy is the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), a cap & trade scheme that covers some 12, 000 facilities in all Europe. In the ETS First Phase (2005 ‑ 2007), emissions in the areas covered by the ETS did actually rise. There is evidence that this is at least partly a consequence of an over‑allocation that happened in the initial stage of the process. The Second Phase (2008 ‑ 2012) is expected to deliver more substantial emissions cuts, even though it is not yet clear whether ETS or the economic crisis will be the major driver. As to the Third Phase (2013 ‑ 2020) new rules are to be implemented, under which a growing number of <b>allowances</b> (<b>starting</b> from 30...|$|R
