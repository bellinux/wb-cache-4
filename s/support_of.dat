40|$|Churches and {{the ministers}} who lead them {{play a role}} of {{significance}} in our society. The dynamics {{of the relationship between}} them impact the success of the ministry occupation. This study examined this relationship, specifically the minister 2 ̆ 7 s perception <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the congregation. Focus groups of ministers and laity provided the dialogue from which the following categories emerged: absence <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and absence <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> expectations, identified <b>support,</b> manifestations <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> and recommended solutions. It was determined that both populations have an understanding of the topic and awareness of possible solutions for an absence <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> The availability <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and its absence were examined from the standpoint of whether they were emotional, esteem, tangible or information <b>support.</b> Two <b>of</b> the most frequently cited themes were that of advocacy and peer groups. Based on the data, these themes emerged as vital {{to the creation of a}} supportive environment for the minister. Implications for various populations and future research are suggested...|$|R

5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party of Democrats in <b>support</b> <b>of</b> General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E
