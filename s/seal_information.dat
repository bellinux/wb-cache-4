Shining ultraviolet light on any part of an unpackaged device causes a photocurrent to flow from the floating gate back to the silicon substrate, thereby discharging the gate to its initial, uncharged condition (photoelectric effect). This method of erasure allows complete testing and correction of a complex memory array before the package is finally sealed.

40|$|Reliable {{indexing}} {{of documents}} having seal instances {{can be achieved}} by recognizing <b>seal</b> <b>information.</b> This paper presents a novel approach for detecting and classifying such multi-oriented seals in these documents. First, Hough Transform based methods are applied to extract the seal regions in documents. Next, isolated text characters within these regions are detected. Rotation and size invariant features and a Support Vector Machine based classifier have been used to recognize these detected text characters. Next, for each pair of character, we encode their relative spatial organization using their distance and angular position with respect to the centre of the seal, and enter this code into a hash table. Given an input seal, we recognize the individual text characters and compute the code for pair-wise character based on the relative spatial organization. The code obtained from the input seal helps to retrieve model hypothesis from the hash table. The seal model to which we get maximum hypothesis is selected for the recognition of the input seal. The methodology is tested to index seal in rotation and size invariant environment and we obtained encouraging results. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Soil sealing can {{be defined}} as the {{destruction}} or covering of soil by buildings, constructions and artificial layers completely or partly impermeable (asphalt, concrete, etc.) It is the most intense form of land consumption and is essentially an irreversible process. Soil is sealed when agricultural or other biologically land is taken into the built environment. It is also a continuing process within existing urban areas, especially where urban population and the density of built structures is increasing and residual inner-city green zones are reduced. The paper concerns the methodology for an estimation of the area of sealed soil using GIS technology. Remote sensing data (aerial and satellite images) and cartographic data (city base maps, topographic maps) are used for that purpose. The proposed methodology is used for an estimation of sealed soil in two case studies: city of Warsaw and Lomianki municipality. First case study, city of Warsaw concerns the comparison of accuracy of different cartographic data (city base maps and topographic maps) as a data set for an estimation of sealed soil. Second case study, Lomianki municipality case study concerns a dynamic, multi-temporal approach. The multi-temporal set of aerial and satellite images is used for that purpose. The research results are changes of sealed soil in years 1977 – 2007. Key words: soil <b>sealing,</b> Geographic <b>Information</b> System, remote sensin...|$|R
