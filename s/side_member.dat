Engine and transmission location determination is an important thing that must be considered for a car. Method of locating engine and transmission will be proposed to determine the right position. This method depends to the size and type of engines. The project objective {{is to find a}} location for the engine mounting bracket for a new car. It is important to reduce the vibration from the engine and transmission to the car’s body or chassis. These is also important to fit the engine bay before consider the component of engine clearance with component of body.

The range location of the mounting bracket is at the middle of the <b>side</b> <b>member.</b> This range depends to the packaging of the engine and the clearance between the components of engine with engine bay. Thickness of the <b>side</b> <b>member</b> also important to decrease the weight of the car and to minimize the stress value when load apply.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{the most}} {{important}} objective in designing automobiles {{is to focus on}} environment-friendly and safety performance aspects. For the environment-friendly aspect, the issues relate to the shift towards lightweight automobile production, for improving fuel-efficiency and reducing exhaust fumes. However, in contrast, the issues of the safety performance such as crash safety, comfort level and muti-functional programs demand increase of automobile’s weight. Therefore, the design of automobile should be inclined towards the safety aspects, but at the same time, it also should consider reducing the structural weight of an automobile. In this study, for lightweight design of <b>side</b> <b>member,</b> CFRP <b>side</b> <b>member</b> was manufactured from CFRP unidirectional prepreg sheet. The stacking condition related to the energy absorption of composite materials, is being considered as an issue for the structural efficiency.

This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the <b>side</b> <b>members</b> of commercial vehicle chassis frames under the effects of the previously little studied longitudinal loads which may act on a truck chassis through spring hanger brackets. The structure analysed is a model chassis frame consisting of channel section <b>side</b> <b>members</b> and four cross members with different joint connections.

The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete chassis frame models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged chassis frame model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions.
