5|$|The Supreme Court {{directed}} {{the circuit court}} for the District of New Jersey to grant Jackalow a new trial. The Court held that, while the trial court should determine {{the description of the}} boundaries of New York and Connecticut, the ascertainment of their actual boundaries, and the application of those boundaries to the crime in question, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> question of fact for the jury.

5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{there have}} been 61 {{occasions}} on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. The most recent dismissal of this fashion in first-class cricket occurred during a County Championship contest between Leicestershire and Kent in April 2016, when Kent batsman Sean Dickson was dismissed for the infraction. Brodribb {{suggests that it is}} likely that there <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> significant number more dismissals than {{there have been}} for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|After Italy's {{declaration}} of war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May, Admiral Anton Haus, the fleet commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy sortied his fleet to bombard the Italian coast {{on the night of}} 23/24 May in an attempt to disrupt the Italian mobilization. Of the many targets, Ancona was hardest hit, with disruptions to the town's gas, electric, and telephone service; the city's stockpiles of coal and oil were left in flames. All of the Austrian ships safely returned to port, making it seem that they had been able to attack with impunity, putting political pressure on the Regia Marina from Rome. When the Austrians resumed attacks on the Italian coast in mid-June, Italian Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel responded by sending Amalfi and the other armored cruisers at Brindisi—the navy's newest—to Venice to supplement the older ships already there. Historian Lawrence Sondhaus argues that the arrival of the four fast armored cruisers in Venice <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major deterrent against future Austrian coastal raids, but concedes that they ended up becoming more inviting targets for Austrian U-boats instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
