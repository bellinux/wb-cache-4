40|$|In this report, {{the author}} studied the {{influences}} of heat treatment and forging on the uniform spheroization of cementite in three kinds of commercial carbon steels with carbon 0. 21, 0. 49 and 1. 07 % by means of microscopic observation and hardness measurement. The results obtained are as follows : (1) Uniformalization in form and dispersion of <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in low carbon steel is remarkably improved by forging at the temperature range from 550 ℃ to 650 ℃, but, <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in high carbon steel is coarsened by forging at the same temperature range. (2) When comparing the <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in forged material at the temperature range from 550 ℃ to 650 ℃ with <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in material as quenched, we know the former shortens spheroidizing time by 10 hours to 15 hours under the same heating temperature. (3) In order to make uniform the uniformalization in form and dispersion of <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in low carbon steel, it is advisable to do the forging at {{the first stage of}} tempering below A_ 1 transformation rather than within the austenite range (900 ℃∿ 800 ℃) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{spheroidization}} of cementite {{has been}} used as one method for improving steel characteristics. In this study the <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> grain was examined, and an experiment was performed with regard to the effect of the grain size on the grinding characteristics.

40|$|The {{influence}} of bands rich in phosphorus on the microstructure of hypereutectoid Wootz steel implement is described. Electron probe micro-analysis {{is combined with}} optical microscopy. Phosphorus-rich bands are seen to correspond to regions of internal cracking, carbon depletion, and enhanced frequency of <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in place of pearlite. A rationale for the findings is presented {{in terms of the}} {{influence of}} phosphorus on the Fe–C phase diagram and on the rate of the eutectoid reaction. <br /...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stage}} of {{tempering}} occurs between room-temperature and 200 C. In the first stage, carbon precipitates into ε-carbon (Fe24C). In the second stage, occurring between 150 C and 300 C, the retained austenite transforms into a form of lower-bainite containing ε-carbon rather than cementite (archaically referred to as [...] "troostite"). The third stage occurs at 200 C and higher. In the third stage, ε-carbon precipitates into cementite, and the carbon content in the martensite decreases. If tempered at higher temperatures, between 650 C and 700 C, or for longer amounts of time, the martensite may become fully ferritic and the cementite may become coarser or spheroidize. In <b>spheroidized</b> steel, the <b>cementite</b> network breaks apart and recedes into rods or spherical shaped globules, and the steel becomes softer than annealed steel; nearly as soft as pure iron, making it very easy to form or machine.|$|R
40|$|The {{cementite}} spheroidization {{process is}} investigated in hypereutectoid steels with different chromium (Cr) contents. A spheroidized structure in high-carbon steel is usually obtained by a divorced eutectoid transformation (DET) reaction, which occurs during slow cooling of austenite with fine cementite particles. A bimodal distribution of <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> particles is experimentally observed. It is shown that Cr addition {{allows one to}} obtain the spheroidized structure after austenitization at a higher temperature and a longer annealing time as compared with low-Cr steel. It is found that the DET reaction takes place at low undercoolings compared with the pearlitic reaction. The occurrence of the DET reaction also depends strongly on the spacing between cementite particles during the austenitization process, i. e., on austenitization temperature and time.

The diameter of the cementite, the ferrite grain size and the cementite quantity were determined by micrographs, and multi-regression analysis {{was conducted on the}} relation of these factors to the grinding force.

40|$|Thermomechanical {{processing}} {{allows the}} attainment of spheroidized microstructures that show improved mechanical properties. In this work, a thermomechanical processing route consisting of two steps was developed for two ultrahigh carbon steels (UHCS) containing 1. 3 and 1. 5 %C. This route develops structures of fine <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> particles in a fine-grained ferrite matrix. Spheroidized microstructures are formed by eutectoid carbide particles in the UHCS- 1. 3 C and by proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide particles in the UHCS- 1. 5 C. In the latter steel, the proeutectoid carbide particle size {{is larger than the}} eutectoid carbide particle size. The carbide size distribution remains basically constant with austenitizing temperature for both steels. Plane-strain fracture toughness of spheroidized UHCS- 1. 3 C is higher than for UHCS- 1. 5 C, about 80 vs 40 MPa m 1 / 2. These values do not vary significantly with austenitizing temperature which is attributed to the constancy of the mean proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide size. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{noise and}} high {{vibration}} are inherently associated with equipment {{used in the}} mining, extraction, and processing of mineral resources. High vibration degrades structural components, often leading to catastrophic failure and loss of productivity, and excessive noise can result in permanent hearing loss. In order to foster efficient utilization of the Nation's mineral resources and minimize occupational hazards associated with mineral processing, the Bureau of Mines investigated {{the relationship between the}} microstructures of carbon and alloy steels and cast irons and their damping capacities (ability to absorb vibration). Researchers measured damping capacity and other properties and investigated the effects of carburizing, spheroidizing, and annealing. The investigators found that in carbon and alloy steels, rounded colonies of fine-grained pearlite in a ferrite matrix correlate well with low damping capacity. Steel microstructures that exhibit sharp-faceted pearlite in ferrite matrix and partially or fully <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> in ferrite show considerably higher damping. In cast irons, the lowest damping capacity is associated with nodular graphite microstructure, and the specific damping capacity (SDC) increases as the graphite micro-structure progresses from nodular to compacted to flake. Predominant ferrite in cast irons is also associated with good damping. SDC data are presented for selected carbon and alloy steels and cast irons...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of duplex microstructures consisting of very fine ferrite grains and <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> particles during concurrent hot deformation {{has been investigated}} by hot torsion in a eutectoid steel. It is shown that the hot deformation of the undercooled austenite at temperatures close to Ar 1 induces and accelerates significantly the γ-to-pearlite transformation. Further deformation of the transforming pearlite does not lead only to the instantaneous spheroidization of the cementite lamellae but also refines the ferrite orientations units from 15 to 3 μm. Microstructures consisting of very fine ferrite grains (3 μm) and submicron cementite particles are produced at strain levels larger than ε = 1. 5. The initial grains undergo progressive fragmentation by the generation of low angle boundaries (LABs) by dynamic recovery that progressively transform into high angle boundaries (HABs). The progressive increase of LABs misorientation is attributed {{to the presence of}} cementite particles and is referred to as continuous dynamic recrystallization (cDRX). Fine prior austenite grain size and moderate strain rates are found to promote the occurrence of cDRX. The resulting torsion textures consist of a strong 〈 111 〉 fiber dominated by the D { 112 } 〈 111 〉 component. During the subsequent annealing step, cementite particles coarsen preferentially at the triple junctions whereas the very fine ferrite grain are stable due to the strong pinning effect exerted by the cementite particles.

40|$|Eutectoid steel strips are {{designed}} {{for the production of}} parts for intensive use such as clutches, seat slides, and springs as they exhibit excellent strength levels and wear resistance. These properties arise from the unique morphology of lamellar pearlite which can be considered as a self-laminated nanoscale composite. However, a spheroidization annealing step is nowadays necessary to improve the cold forming properties before further cold rolling steps. This thesis is aimed at improving the tensile ductility of the hot rolled products of eutectoid composition in order to eliminate the intermediate annealing step. Two strategies are proposed. The first is to transpose the concept of controlled rolling developed for HSLA to eutectoid steels. Through a strict adjustment of the austenite processing and of the cooling strategy, it is possible to improve the ductility of the final lamellar microstructure. The way the processing parameters influence the hot deformation of austenite, the eutectoid transformation and of the subsequent spheroidization annealing is deeply investigated. It is found that refinement and pancaking of austenite is beneficial as it reduces the pearlite block size improving the total tensile elongation. Accelerated cooling is of paramount importance to achieve fine Interlamellar spacing (ILS), which lead to high strength levels and accelerate spheroidization during subsequent annealing. The second approach involves intercritical or warm deformation. Warm processing of eutectoid steels is first explored by torsion testing and then up-scaled to a pilot rolling-line. The interactions between thermomechanical parameters, rolling forces generated and microstructural evolution are carefully scrutinized. During concurrent hot deformation, spheroidization of cementite takes place almost instantaneously in both torsion and rolling. The restoration processes occurring in the ferrite matrix depends on the strain path and the strain rates. Low strain rates (0, 1 s− 1) and simple shear promotes the formation of a recrystallized-like HABs network of about 3 μm in size. Plane strain compression and high strain rates (10 s− 1) leads to the formation of a typical recovered dislocation substructure (LABs) of 1 μm in size. During annealing, no recrystallization occurs and the LABs substructure remains stable. This substructure influences drammatically the mechanical properties: the strength is very high and the work-hardening behavior is poor due to high recovery rate in the region close to the LABs. However, due to the presence of <b>spheroidized</b> <b>cementite</b> particles the ductility of warm rolled eutectoid steels is higher than that of ultra fine grained low carbon steels.
