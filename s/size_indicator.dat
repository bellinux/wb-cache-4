They have gotten rid of the useful disc capacity meter {{at the bottom and}} replaced it with a <b>size</b> <b>indicator</b> element that is displayed next to each item in the file list.They have also added a file filtering mechanism of some kind {{at the bottom of the}} window. It isn't entirely clear to me what purpose it is supposed to serve, but it seems like unnecessary clutter. I also strongly dislike the superfluous file preview feature which wastes a lot of screen space in order to display a playable video thumbnail. The preview feature is fortunately easy to disable.The whole programs feels uncharacteristically clunky by GNOME standards, but it's a lot more functional than the stale and unambitious CD burning component that was included in previous versions of GNOME. I think that Brasero is the right way forward in the long term, but the user interface really doesn't please me.My biggest complaint with the old Nautilus CD burner is that it didn't give you clear visual hints about how much space you have left when you are putting in files to burn. The fact that Brasero dropped that feature is a bit of a disappointment. It seems like the task of building a good disc burning UI with GTK+ is not trivial and it's something that I suspect will take a skilled designer rather than a developer.Despite the problems with Brasero's interface, it's really a very capable program with a rich feature set, which leaves me hopeful that it will be able to really shine someday..|$|E

Since the direct measurements are either lethal or unreliable, a wide range of non-lethal body condition indices has been proposed.

The condition index should be independent of body <b>size</b> <b>indicator,</b> in this case snout vent length (SVL). Therefore we tested all three indices for the statistical independence of SVL and for the normality of distribution. Fulton's index violated the independence assumption, whereas the relative body condition mass index did not have a normal distribution.

When mean temperatures became warmer, tooth areas tended to become smaller. During colder times, larger species predominated; these generally became larger or remained the same size. Paleotemperature trends also markedly affected patterns of local (and, perhaps, regional) extinction and immigration. New species appeared as immigrants during or near the hottest (smaller forms) and coldest (larger forms) intervals. Paleotemperature trend reversals commonly resulted in the ultimate extinction of both small forms (during cooling intervals) and larger forms (during warming intervals). These immigrations and extinctions mark faunal turnovers that were also modulated by sharp increases in sediment accumulation rate...|$|E

The design of this tool is based on the direct mapping between COSMIC-FFP and UML concepts and notation, a foundation from which the required Rational Rose artifacts can be extracted to proceed to the software project measurement operation.

From mammals, evidence of visual status badges remains rare with most examples to date found in birds. Here we report that drastic fluctuations in the facial ornamentation of male eland antelope, Tragelaphus oryx, reliably indicated two aspects of social status: dominance in all-male herds and access to mates as the master bull in mixed-sex herds. The finding suggests that visual status badges may be more widespread in mammals than hitherto recognized, especially in taxa with complex social systems. The peak frequency of loud knee-clicks explained additional variation in male social status. Supporting a function as a body <b>size</b> <b>indicator,</b> the peak click frequency was in turn dependent on body depth and facemask darkness, the latter possibly related to testosterone levels and hence muscle development.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a considerable diversity of quantitative measures available for summarizing the results in single-case studies. Given that the interpretation of some of them is difficult {{due to the lack}} of established benchmarks, the current paper proposes an approach for obtaining further numerical evidence on the importance of the results, complementing the substantive criteria, visual analysis, and primary summary measures. This additional evidence consists of obtaining the statistical significance of the outcome when referred to the corresponding sampling distribution. This sampling distribution is formed by the values of the outcomes (expressed as data nonoverlap, R-squared, etc.) in case the intervention is ineffective. The approach proposed here is intended to offer the outcome"s probability of being as extreme when there is no treatment effect without the need for some assumptions that cannot be checked with guarantees. Following this approach, researchers would compare their outcomes to reference values rather than constructing the sampling distributions themselves.
