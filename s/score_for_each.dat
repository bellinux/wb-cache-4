5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{the sequel}} to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 was {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames, published by Activision and released worldwide in October 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles. Like its predecessor, DJ Hero 2 simulates turntablism, the playing of two songs in mix, using a special turntable-based controller that includes the ability to crossfade between the two songs, and scratching the recording. Players are challenged to match these actions, shown through on-screen scrolling indicators in synchronization with the mix; correct actions boost the player's score, while correctly performing several consecutive actions can increase the player's scoring multiplier. Specifically marked sections of songs allow the player to freestyle through crossfading, scratching, or inserting music samples into the mix. The player is not penalized for failing to perform actions. The goal is to obtain a high <b>score</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> mix, earning the player a star rating from one to five, which helps to advance the player's progress through the game.|$|E

For example, {{if a player}} has (in order) a win, loss, win, draw, and a loss; his round-by-round score will be 1, 1, 2, 2½, 2½. The sum of these numbers is 9. Additionally, one point is subtracted from the sum for each unplayed win, and ½ point is subtracted for each unplayed draw. In the previous example, if the fourth-round draw was instead a ½ point bye, then ½ point would be subtracted and the final sum would be 8½.|$|E

25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate <b>score</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E
25|$|The EBU {{announced}} on 18 February 2016 {{that a new}} voting system would be implemented at the contest {{for the first time}} since 1975. The new system, inspired by the voting system of Melodifestivalen, involves each country now awarding two sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Televoting votes from all the countries are pooled. After viewers have cast their votes, the results of each professional jury are presented, with countries receiving 1-8 and 10 points being displayed on-screen instead of 1-7, which had been the case since , and the national spokesperson announcing only the country to which they award 12 points. After the results of the professional juries are presented, the televoting points from all participating countries are combined, providing one <b>score</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> song. The results of countries finishing between 11th and 26th in the public vote are automatically added to the scoreboard, with only the results of the top ten countries being announced by the hosts. The new voting system is also used to determine the qualifiers from each semi-final, but as before the qualifiers are announced in a random order.|$|E

Popular songs are used sparingly in the series, mainly because of budget constraints. Usually, music supervisor Jody Colero selects songs from little-known, unsigned Canadian artists. When these songs are included, they originate from a diegetic source. Examples {{of this can be}} seen in the first-season episode [...] "Jagged Little Pill", when well-known songs are played during Ashley's house party, at the wedding reception in the fifth-season episode [...] "Weddings, Parties, Anything", and during the party scene in the seventh-season episode [...] "Everything She Wants".|$|E

2500|$|Historically in China a {{scoring system}} was used that penalized {{the player who}} had the {{greatest}} number of unconnected live groups of stones. On the basis that every group needs two eyes to be alive, and that the two eyes could not be filled in, two points were deducted from the <b>score</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> live group {{at the end of the}} game.

[...] In order to officially complete the race, a vehicle's adjusted time for the three missions must be under six hours.|$|E

Even though EPA rates air pollution scores for both California and federal standards, the Hybrid Scorecard ratings use only the California emissions certification level in order to introduce the maximum potential to reduce tailpipe emissions [...] [...] The score is measured in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best rating and 0 is the worst. Then, using the legal definitions established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), a zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) is assigned a 10, a partial zero emissions vehicle (PZEV) a 9, a super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV II) an 8, and so forth.|$|E
2500|$|Uncritical use of {{standardized}} test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate intelligence. The school only has control over one of these three factors. Value-added modeling has been proposed {{to cope with this}} criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors. In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected <b>score</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status. [...] The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.|$|E

The cutoff scores vary greatly from subject to subject and from year to year. To give a clearer picture, for Chinese, A-grades are sometimes given for candidates having scored 70 or above, while for Mathematics, an A invariably translates to a score in excess of 90. The cutoff scores are not released by the HKEAA publicly; the information is only available to teachers.|$|E
