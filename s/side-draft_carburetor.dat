50|$|The 240Z used twin SU one-barrel <b>side-draft</b> <b>Carburetors.</b> These were {{replaced}} on the 260Z with Hitachi one barrel side draft carburetors beginning with model year 1973 {{to comply with}} emissions regulations, resulting in diminished overall performance.

2500|$|The Corvette Grand Sports were raced {{with several}} {{different}} engines, {{but the most}} serious factory engine actually used was a 377 cubic inch displacement, all-aluminum, small block with four Weber <b>side-draft</b> <b>carburetors</b> and a cross-ram intake, rated [...] at 6400rpm. Body panels were made of thinner fiberglass to reduce weight and the inner body structure 'birdcage' was aluminum rather than steel. The ladder-type frame utilized large seamless steel tubular side members connected front and rear with crossmembers of about the same diameter tubes. Another crossmember was just aft of the transmission and a fourth one at the rear kick-up anchored the integral roll cage. The frame was slightly stiffer than the 1963 Corvette production frame and was 94 pounds lighter. A number of other lightweight components were utilized to reduce overall weight to about 800 pounds less than the production coupe.

50|$|The Datsun 510 {{released}} to the U.S. market came originally with the Hitachi downdraft carbureted 1.6L L-series I4 engine, with an advertised gross power of 96 hp (72 kW), a claimed top speed of 100 mph, front disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension (MacPherson strut front and semi trailing arm rear- wagons had a solid rear live axle and leaf springs in back), rear-wheel drive, and either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission. Two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door station wagon variants were available. It achieved 20 to 30 mpg in factory trim (U.S.). Japanese-domestic-market (JDM) models were also available in a two-door coupe body style in either a 1.6L or a 1.8L (1973) L-Series engine. 510s, in some markets, offered twin Hitachi <b>side-draft</b> <b>carburetors,</b> which were a smaller version of the British SU (Skinner's Union) design used on Jaguars and MGs. These engines also used enhanced compression and camshaft profiles to produce more power. SSS models (not available for the U.S. 510) offered upgraded instrumentation and interior trim, as well as appropriate exterior badges. All U.S. model 510s received anti-sun glass from 1970 on.|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, {{development}} on the engine was abandoned in favour of focusing on the FPF engine, which was already proven competitive in 1.5L form with <b>side-draft</b> Weber <b>carburetors</b> in the F2 races, and the entire stock of parts were sold to Andrew Getley in the mid-1960s. When the Formula One regulation changed to 3 Litres for 1966, Mr. Getley permitted Paul Emery to rebuild one FPE to 3 Litre format, and fit it to a one-off Shannon steel monocoque chassis to make the Shannon F1 car named SH1 driven by Trevor Taylor at 1966 British Grand Prix. Bored out to 3 Litres and Tecalemit Jackson fuel injection installed, this Emery-built FPE produced 312 bhp on the dynamometer at Chrysler's Kew facility.|$|R

The R1134 Gordini was originally available only in blue, with two stick-on white stripes. It was also distinguishable from the 8 Major by the bigger 200mm headlamp units. In 1965, the Renault 10 Major, a more luxurious version of the 8 with different front and rear styling, was released, replacing the 8 Major.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a Tipo F 101 AC 000 Colombo V12, {{displacing}} [...] Engine block and cylinder heads were aluminium alloy, with cast iron pressed-in sleeves; chain-driven two overhead camshafts per bank (four in total, as noter by the [...] "4" [...] {{in the model}} designation) commanded two valves per cylinder. The V12 was detuned to [...] from the Daytona, {{to provide a more}} tractable response suited to a GT-oriented Ferrari. In place of the Daytona's downdraft setup, six twin-choke <b>side-draft</b> Weber <b>carburetors</b> were used, whose lower profile made possible the car's lower and sloping hood line.The 5-speed all-synchronised manual transmission was bolted to the engine, another difference from the Daytona which used a transaxle. The gearbox was rigidly connected to the alloy housing of the rear differential through a torque tube.|$|R
5000|$|With alloy {{cylinder}} head, hemi-spherical combustion chambers, inclined valves [...] and twin <b>side-draft</b> SU <b>carburetors,</b> {{the dual}} overhead-cam 3.4 L straight-6 XK engine was comparatively advanced for a mass-produced {{unit of the}} time. With standard 8:1 compression ratio it developed , using 80 octane fuel. Most of the early cars were exported; a 7:1 low-compression version, with consequently reduced performance, was reserved for the UK market, where the post-war austerity measures then in force restricted buyers to 70 octane [...] "Pool petrol". The Jaguar factory, with access to 80 octane fuel, provided roadsters with the higher compression ratio to the press. Journalists could then test the model's optimum performance in Belgium, on a long, straight stretch of road between Jabbeke and Ostend. The XK engine's basic design, later modified into 3.8 and 4.2 litre versions, survived into the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing crankshaft assembly and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel <b>side-draft</b> Weber <b>carburetors.</b> All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their toothed belts to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time toothed belts were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|R
