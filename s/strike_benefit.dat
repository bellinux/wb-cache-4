5000|$|In theory, the {{international}} union existed to balance strong and weak local unions: Per capita taxes would defray organizing costs, general assessments would finance <b>strike</b> <b>benefit</b> payments, and {{urban and rural}} “brothers” would share the wealth. Yet reality proved quite different. General vice presidents might be elected to organize their territories, but opportunities were limited since they worked full-time with the tools. Strike benefits might keep a local union afloat, but they were limited, too, since the IA lacked the power to enforce assessments. The {{fact that some of}} the best organized, big city local unions saw no reason to join the IA also complicated matters. In fact when the IA chartered a local union in New York City to compete with the independent union there, a war erupted that almost destroyed the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers How to resolve these differences and establish the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers in fact as well as in name was a major question in the late 1890s - one that would eventually led to secession (when big city locals decided to “go it alone”), civil war (when those locals organized a rival IA), and reconstruction (when both groups formed the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers International Alliance in 1903). The peace treaty that saved the union was based on the concept of local autonomy: Big-city locals would maintain their right to set policies and membership fees “to suit their surroundings,” a compromise that reflected economic reality at the time. The fact was the IA needed big-city locals more than those locals needed the IA. And {{as long as they were}} able to control their work, they expected the IA to stay out of their way.|$|E
5000|$|The unions {{ended their}} strike on February 14, 1997. The strike was costly for the labor unions, {{such as the}} Teamsters paying about [...] toward legal fees and <b>strike</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|R
25|$|One Pinkerton spy was {{assigned}} to sabotage the union's relief program during a strike. According to Bill Haywood, Secretary-Treasurer of the WFM, the man at first overpaid <b>strike</b> <b>benefits,</b> and then distributed insufficient food for the miners' families.|$|R
5000|$|As {{replacement}} workers {{became more}} proficient, {{public awareness of}} the strike waned. The A.F.L. discontinued <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> at the end of October 1914, and quietly called an end to the strike eight months later. The shopmen would strike again in 1922.|$|R
25|$|While International Harvester {{was forced}} to cut costs, the United Auto Workers {{improved}} its financial position. On January 30, 1980, the union gave striking workers a $15-a-week across-the-board increase in <b>strike</b> <b>benefits,</b> raising the benefit to $55 {{a week for a}} single worker and $65 a week for married workers with dependents.|$|R
50|$|By 2007 {{the airline}} {{was one of}} Norway's most {{prominent}} companies, {{but the lack of}} reliability caused by the number of cancelled and delayed flights has put the airline at the bottom of 140 Norwegian companies ranked by consumer confidence.

50|$|During {{its first}} years, the United Association was {{essentially}} a federation of local Unions, rather than a truly national Union of the pipe trades. The major breakthrough toward a unified national organization came at the 1902 national convention in Omaha, when delegates approved a Nationalization Committee proposal establishing a comprehensive system of sick, death and <b>strike</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Phenobarbital is used {{to treat}} {{neonatal}} jaundice by increasing liver metabolism and thus lowering bilirubin levels. In the 1950s, phototherapy was discovered, and became the standard treatment, however phenobarbital therapy is still in common use when access to phototherapy is inconvenient or impractical. One <b>striking</b> <b>benefit</b> of successful phenobarbital therapy is the rapid onset of recovery.|$|R
40|$|The <b>striking</b> <b>benefits</b> of {{iterative}} detection {{have generated}} {{strong interest in}} the disk drive signal processing area, but thus far application of this technology has been rather limited. We review the benefits that the most interesting iterative detectors have over the industry-standard partial-response maximum-likelihood (PRML) detectors, and examine the hardware complexity issues that have so far {{stood in the way}} of practical implementations...|$|R
25|$|The KCLC {{strengthened}} their {{stance on}} pro-labor rights when they actively supported the Hotel and Restaurant Employees strike of 1981. Twenty-one {{restaurants and hotels}} were affected around the greater Seattle area. The Council urged all of its members to honor picket lines, while offering <b>strike</b> <b>benefits,</b> as well. An estimated 2000–3000 restaurant employees and 5000 hotel employees walked out in a demand for higher wages.|$|R
50|$|The FREEDOM trial, {{involving}} 150 institutions {{around the}} world, {{is the largest}} funded study (NIH) in diabetes and is led by Fuster. It aimed at defining the optimal revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease.

25|$|Boyce led the WFM to {{join the}} American Federation of Labor the year he became WFM president. The {{affiliation}} lasted only until the spring of 1898. Samuel Gompers had refused to give striking Colorado miners <b>strike</b> <b>benefits,</b> and Boyce heatedly debated the issue with Gompers. But, convinced that the conservative and craft unionism policies of the AFL were inadequate {{to the task of}} organizing workers, Boyce led the WFM out of the AFL.|$|R
50|$|In {{his book}} Art-Based Group Therapy and Practice, Moon (2010) {{describes}} the therapeutic qualities that {{are presented in}} art-based group therapy, and suggests that are 12 essentials. Of these some very important and <b>striking</b> <b>benefits</b> or art-based group therapy include: “Making art {{in the presence of}} others reduces isolation and creates a sense of community”, and “making art in a group setting promotes positive regard for {{the other members of the}} group” (p. 4).|$|R
50|$|The {{elections}} {{occurred during}} an economic crisis, the Great Depression. The Catholic-Liberal government led by Jules Renkin faced rising unemployment, derailing public finances and <b>strikes</b> <b>benefiting</b> the Communist Party. Parliamentary elections were due in May 1933 at the latest. On 18 October 1932, Prime Minister Renkin resigned {{under pressure from}} King Albert I, allowing the more experienced Charles de Broqueville to take charge. He immediately dissolved parliament and scheduled parliamentary elections for 27 November 1932.|$|R
2500|$|Carey also {{significantly}} restructured the union's finances. He undertook two initiatives in this area. [...] The first was {{to close the}} international union's four regional headquarters in the U.S. Carey depicted the regional headquarters {{as little more than}} a mechanism for union officers to engage in corruption and receive multiple salaries, but his opponents claimed that the move was retaliation against Carey's political opponents (who were officers in and drew income from the regional headquarters). The fight to close the offices was a bitter one, and Carey eventually sought a federal preliminary injunction to enforce his right to physically enter and take charge of the offices. The Teamsters' executive board gave him permission to close the offices by a vote of 14 to 3, and the regional headquarters were shuttered in June 1994—saving the international union $15 million in salaries and expenses. His second major initiative was to seek a 25 percent dues increase. [...] Carey proposed the dues hike in February 1994. The union's executive board had voted to raise <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> from $55 a week to $200, but made no provision for funding the higher benefits. A dues hike was essential, Carey said, because the strike fund anticipated running out of money in mid-1994 (and did just that during the national trucking strike in June 1994). Carey also said that the union's budget was significantly out of balance. The union had lost 500,000 members since 1979 and assets had fallen to $45 million from almost $200 million in 1990. But Teamsters members turned down the dues hike proposal by a 3-to-1 majority in March 1994, and as Carey predicted the union was forced to borrow money from other unions to continue operating. Carey balanced the union's budget in 1996, but did so (in part) by reducing <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> back to $55 a week and warned that the union would have to use its general fund to pay <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> in the future.|$|R
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} demand for coal, {{resulting}} {{from an economic}} downturn, many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|R

5000|$|Under Wills' leadership, the NUCW was {{supportive}} of the UK general strike; although most of its members were not asked to join the strike, those working in relevant industries were called out and given <b>strike</b> <b>benefits.</b> Unlike many other unions, NUCW membership remained steady at around 12,000 workers, and in 1928 it was renamed as the [...] "National Union of Public Employees" [...] (NUPE). [...] Wills succeeded in affiliating the union to the Trades Union Congress and consequently increased its profile. He died in 1933, while still in office.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the beneficial effects of Remote Plasma Hydrogen passivation (RPHP) on Recrystallized Wafer-Equivalent (RexWE) solar cells. We varied the dominating {{parameters of the}} RPHP process and analysed their effect on the RexWE solar cell parameters. A low and a high temperature regime were investigated for the RPHP. Both showed remarkable results in terms of Voc, FF, Jsc and boosts. The <b>striking</b> <b>benefit</b> of a newly optimised hydrogenation process increased the Voc from 454 to 54 mV and the efficiency from 4. 0 to 6. 0 % {{by means of a}} 45 min process at 450 °C...|$|R

2500|$|After a mere 22 days, {{the strike}} was over. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had {{established}} a mediation board {{in the first week}} of the strike. The board recommended further study, that workers return to work, and that employers rehire workers without discriminating against strikers. With the UTW able to provide staff, financial resources and <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> in only a few places and for a small number of workers, the strike collapsed. Employees attempted to return to work, but mill owners refused to rehire the strikers. [...] Although the 1934 textile strike was a major defeat for Rieve and the UTW, the union did sign up thousands of new members and declared victory nonetheless.|$|R

50|$|On Thursday, August 14, 1913, two {{striking}} miners of Croatian descent, Ivan Kalan and Ivan Stimac, went to South Range, Michigan, {{along with}} a group of other strikers to collect <b>strike</b> <b>benefits.</b> There they discovered that there were no benefits for them as the Western Federation of Miners could not fully fund a strike of this size. After having a drink, they headed back to their homes in Seeberville. As they passed through Painesdale, Kalan and Stimac went into a store to buy some soda pop; {{the rest of the group}} continued on without them. After finishing their pop, Kalan and Stimac continued on towards Seeberville. They decided to take a shortcut to Seeberville from Painesdale that cut across mining company property.|$|R

40|$|Under the {{guidance}} of the general theory developed for classical partial differential equations (PDEs), we investigate the Riesz bases of wavelets in the spaces where fractional PDEs usually work, and their applications in numerically solving fractional elliptic differential equations (FEDEs). The technique issues are solved and the detailed algorithm descriptions are provided. Compared with the ordinary Galerkin methods, the wavelet Galerkin method we propose for FEDEs has the <b>striking</b> <b>benefit</b> of efficiency, since the condition numbers of the corresponding stiffness matrixes are small and uniformly bounded; and the Toeplitz structure of the matrix still can be used to reduce cost. Numerical results and comparison with the ordinary Galerkin methods are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the wavelet Galerkin method we provide. Comment: 20 pages, 0 figure...|$|R

40|$|Combining the {{characteristic}} method {{and the local}} discontinuous Galerkin method with carefully constructing numerical fluxes, we design the variational formulations for the time-dependent convection-dominated Navier-Stokes equations in R^ 2. The proposed symmetric variational formulation is strictly proved to be unconditionally stable; and the scheme has the <b>striking</b> <b>benefit</b> that the conditional number of the matrix of the corresponding matrix equation does not increase with the refining of the meshes. The presented scheme works well {{for a wide range}} of Reynolds numbers, e. g., the scheme still has good error convergence when Re= 0. 5 e+ 005 or 1. 0 e+ 008. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to show the optimal convergence orders and the contours of the solutions of the equation with given initial and boundary conditions.

The provisions of the International Constitution that required a two thirds vote of the membership to authorize any strike action and that gave the International President the power to withhold <b>strike</b> <b>benefits</b> if he believed that a local union had struck prematurely, It also divided its members into separate unions along craft or industry lines: ice wagon drivers in one local, produce drivers in another, milk drivers in a third, and so forth.|$|R
40|$|With the {{reporting}} of five studies with different and complementary designs, but all demonstrating a similar and <b>striking</b> <b>benefit</b> from the targeted drug trastuzumab in HER 2 -overexpressing breast cancer, the year 2005 has profoundly marked the history of randomised adjuvant breast cancer trials. In view of the halving in recurrence risk, obtained at the real but small risk of cardiotoxicity, these results are generating hope in women affected with this aggressive form of the disease. But {{at the same time}} these results pose real challenges to healthcare authorities faced with the high cost of the anti-HER 2 monoclonal antibody. These results also leave oncologists and patients to deal with a complex treatment tailoring process that needs to take into account risk of an early relapse as well as the benefit versus risk of trastuzumab according to the different patterns of administration used in the clinical trials.
