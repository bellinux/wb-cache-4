40|$|A popular idea in {{cognitive}} neuroscience {{is that to}} predict others’ actions, observers need to map those actions onto their own motor repertoire. If this is true, infants with a relatively limited motor repertoire should be unable to predict actions with which they have no previous motor experience. We investigated this idea by presenting pre-walking infants with videos of upright and inverted <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> that were briefly occluded from view, followed by either a correct (time-coherent) or an incorrect (time- incoherent) continuation of the action (Experiment 1). Pre-walking infants looked significantly longer to the still frame after the incorrect compared to the correct continuations of the upright, but not the inverted <b>stepping</b> <b>actions.</b> This demonstrates that motor experience is not necessary for predictive track- ing of action kinematics. In a follow-up study (Experiment 2), we investigated sensorimotor cortex acti- vation as a neural indication of predictive action tracking in another group of pre-walking infants. Infants showed significantly more sensorimotor cortex activation during {{the occlusion of the}} upright <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> that the infants in Experiment 1 could predictively track, than during the occlusion of the inverted <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> that the infants in Experiment 1 could not predictively track. Taken together, these find- ings are inconsistent with the idea that motor experience is necessary for the predictive tracking of action kinematics, and suggest that infants may be able to use their extensive experience with observing others’ actions to generate real-time action predictions...|$|R

5000|$|The action trigger {{account was}} {{developed}} by Wilfried Kunde, Andrea Kiesel, and Joachim Hoffmann at the University of Würzburg, Germany. This account assumes that responses to unconscious primes are neither elicited by semantic analysis of the primes nor by pre-established stimulus-response mappings. Instead, {{it is assumed that}} the prime fits a pre-existing action release condition, eliciting the assigned response like a key opening a lock. This happens in two consecutive steps. In the first <b>step,</b> <b>action</b> triggers are held active in working memory that fit the respective task and are able to elicit a specific motor response. Action triggers are established in the instruction and practice phase of the experiment. In the second step, called online stimulus processing, an upcoming stimulus is compared to the action release conditions. If the stimulus fits the trigger conditions, the action triggers automatically execute the response. As an example, the participant's task might be to indicate whether a visually presented number is smaller or larger than five, such that the left-hand key is pressed for numbers [...] "1" [...] to [...] "4" [...] and the right-hand key is pressed for numbers [...] "6" [...] to [...] "9". Based on the instruction, action triggers are set up that automatically elicit the response assigned to the prime or target number. One important prediction of this theory is that responses can be elicited by primes that meet the trigger conditions but never actually occur as targets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Step {{planning}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important research topic for humanoid robots. Most cost functions for step planning in the literature are designed based on terrain information. The energy cost to perform each <b>step</b> <b>action</b> is usually ignored. In walking, energy consumption depends on gait features such as step length and width. In this paper, we use three simple and intuitive energy cost functions for different step lengths, widths, and the turning angle. These functions are inspired by literature on human walking energy analysis, and the function parameters are tuned to match computed costs for optimal humanoid walking motions obtained by simulation. The energy cost and the terrain cost are combined to obtain an optimal step planning sequence using A * search. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research explored {{end of life}} care provided to people dying with a non malignant disease in two Australian rural, residential aged care facilities. Residential aged care facilities provide {{end of life care}} for many people dying from non malignant diseases. The illness trajectory in non malignant diseases can be difficult to predict and symptom management can be challenging. Further, as the Australian population ages, the demand for optimal end of life care for frail, older people is anticipated to increase. Therefore, this study aimed to explore issues as identified by nurses and relatives of residents dying from a non malignant disease in order to examine ways in which nurses can provide nursing care that maximises the likelihood of a good death, identify the barriers nurses perceive to prevent optimal end of life care to dying residents, and explore the relationships between nurses and relatives of the dying resident, with the intention of improving care. Following ethical clearance, 14 aged care staff overall within both facilities were recruited to the project. Participants included Registered Nurses, Enrolled Nurses, Assistants in Nursing and other aged care staff personnel, all of whom were in a carer relationship with a dying resident. In addition, eight relatives of dying residents were interviewed, using individual, face to face, semi structured interviews. Taylor’s (2006) 13 <b>step</b> <b>action</b> research and reflection method was incorporated into five main phases, including foundation building, reflection on practice stories, identifying thematic concerns, action plan creation, implementation and critical reflection. In both facilities, group meetings were held weekly for up to 19 weeks. Data were gathered using combinations of reflective drawing, practice stories, interviews and surveys. Relatives’ interview transcripts were incorporated into the nurses’ group meetings, so that end of life care issues of importance to relatives were shared, with the intention of assisting the nurses to examine the nature of aged care nursing and relationships that occur with relatives of the dying resident. Thematic analysis was conducted and through group consensus, themes and subthemes emerged from the practice stories indicating aspects of end of life care requiring further improvement. Major thematic concerns were prioritised for action, which included considering the possibility of addressing staff debriefing and better pain management. Through collaborative processes, action plans were created, implemented and evaluated, with participants reporting varying degrees of success in attempting to improve these aspects of care. This project demonstrated that the delivery of end of life care to residents in these rural, residential aged care facilities was inconsistent and of varying quality. Grief and loss permeated aged care work and affected both staff and relatives of the dying resident. Some of the barriers identified in delivering effective end of life care included hierarchical structures, poor staff attitudes, doctors’ prescribing practices, lack of communication within the team and limited palliative care knowledge and services. Poor pain management practices at end of life were related to numerous issues, including the demands of managing more complex conditions, a lack of implementation of evidence based recommendations, and staff knowledge deficits. Although this project highlighted care deficits within two specified Australian aged care facilities, literature supports the contention that issues exist nationally and internationally within other aged care facilities and systems, in relation to caring for people dying from non malignant causes. The failure to adequately address dying in older people is reflective of aged care industries, which are challenged to meet the increased complexity of delivering optimal end of life care. Further, when end of life care guidelines are available, they are not being enacted effectively. This action research and reflection project suggests that the enormity of these problems requires sustainable practice changes, which will embed and facilitate effective palliative care within aged care institutions. This project demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} establish a working relationship with aged care nurses, with no prior knowledge of action research or reflective processes, to influence end of life care nursing practices. The gains achieved in this action research and reflection project can be sustained in practice, if these specific aged care facilities continue to prioritise grief and loss issues, and implement a range of strategies to address pain management, such as standardised assessment tools, end of life clinical pathways, and ongoing audits and case reviews. Critical to the success of these initiatives is the support for staff, who deliver end of life care, to believe they have a voice and feel supported by their facilities, to constantly examine clinical practices and plan and implement strategies to improve care. The practical strategies generated and used in this project can be utilised in other aged care facilities by nurses, educators, managers and other health professionals, with whom they resonate...|$|E
40|$|Gait {{analysis}} {{plays an}} important role in characterizing individuals and each condition and gait analysis systems have been developed using various devices or instruments. However, most systems do not catch synchronous <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> between right foot and left foot. For obtaining a precise gait pattern, a synchronous walking sensing system is developed, in which a pair of acceleration and angular velocity sensors are attached to left and right shoes of a walking person and their data are transmitted to a PC through a wireless channel. Walking data from 19 persons of the age of 14 to 20 are acquired for walking analysis. Stepping time diagrams are extracted from the acquired data of right and left foot actions of stepping-off and-on the ground, and the time diagrams distinguish between an ordinary person and a person injured on left leg, and a stepping recovery process of the injured person is shown.

40|$|Cut 7, {{the only}} kinesin- 5 in S. pombe, is {{essential}} for mitosis. Like other yeast kinesin- 5 motors, Cut 7 can reverse its stepping direction, by mechanisms that are currently unclear. Here we show that for full-length Cut 7, the key determinant of stepping direction is the degree of motor crowding on the microtubule lattice, with greater crowding converting the motor from minus end-directed to plus end-directed stepping. To explain how high Cut 7 occupancy causes this reversal, we postulate a simple proximity sensing mechanism that operates via steric blocking. We propose that the minus end directed <b>stepping</b> <b>action</b> of Cut 7 is selectively inhibited by collisions with neighbours under crowded conditions, whilst its plus end directed action, being less space-hungry, is not. In support, we show that the direction of Cut 7 -driven microtubule sliding can be reversed by crowding it with non-Cut 7 proteins. Thus, crowding by either dynein microtubule binding domain or Klp 2, a kinesin- 14, converts Cut 7 from net minus end-directed to net plus end-directed stepping. Biochemical assays confirm that the Cut 7 N-terminus increases Cut 7 occupancy by binding directly to microtubules. Direct observation by CryoEM reveals that this occupancy-enhancing N-terminal domain is partially ordered. Overall, our data point to a steric blocking mechanism for directional reversal by which collisions of Cut 7 motor domains with their neighbours inhibit their minus end directed <b>stepping</b> <b>action,</b> but not their plus end directed <b>stepping</b> <b>action.</b> Our model can potentially reconcile a number of previous, apparently conflicting, observations and proposals for the reversal mechanism of yeast kinesins- 5...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In adults, the {{selection}} and the planning of actions {{are influenced by the}} anticipation of desired action effects. However, the role of action effects for action control in infants is still an unresolved issue. One important prerequisite for infants action control is that infants are able to relate certain movements to certain effects. To test this assumption, it was investigated how infants action control is affected by action effects. By applying an imitation paradigm, we studied 12 - and 18 -month-old infants who first observed an adult experi-menter demonstrating a three-step action sequence on a toy bear. In three experimental groups, the second ac-tion <b>step,</b> the third <b>action</b> <b>step,</b> or no <b>action</b> <b>step</b> elicited an arbitrary sound as an additional acoustic action ef-fect. It was coded how often each of the target actions was performed by the infant in a subsequent 90 -s test phase. As predicted, the frequency of the infants target action varied depending on which <b>action</b> <b>step</b> elicited the <b>action</b> effect. In both age groups, the target action that was combined with an acoustical effect was not only produced more often but also occurred with lower la-tency and was in most cases the first target action shown by the infants. These results are interpreted as evidence of the important role of action effects in infants action control...|$|R
