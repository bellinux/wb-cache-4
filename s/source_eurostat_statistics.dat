40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the structure}} of air traffic and its distribution among the different countries in the European Union, as well as traffic with an origin or destination in non-EU countries. Data <b>sources</b> are <b>Eurostat</b> <b>statistics</b> and actual flight information from EUROCONTROL. Relevant variables such {{as the number of}} flights, passengers or cargo tonnes and production indicators (RPKs) are used together with fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions data. The segmentation of air traffic in terms of distance permits an assessment of air transport competition with surface transport modes. The results show a clear concentration of traffic in the five larger countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), in terms of RPKs. In terms of distance the segment between 500 and 1000 km in the EU, has more flights, passengers, RTKs and CO 2 emissions than larger distances. On the environmental side, the distribution of CO 2 emissions within the EU Member States is presented, together with fuel efficiency parameters. In general, a direct relationship between RPKs and CO 2 emissions is observed for all countries and all distance bands. Consideration is given to the uptake of alternative fuels. Segmenting CO 2 emissions per distance band and aircraft type reveals which flights contribute the most the overall EU CO 2 emissions. Finally, projections for future CO 2 emissions are estimated, according to three different air traffic growth and biofuel introduction scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a scenario-based study carried out at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre aimed at analyzing the future growth of aviation, the resulting fuel demand and the deployment of biofuels in the aviation sector in Europe. Three scenarios have been produced based on different input assumptions and leading to different underlying patterns of growth and resulting volumes of traffic. Data for aviation growth and hence fuel demand have been projected on a year by year basis up to 2030, using 2010 as the baseline. Data <b>sources</b> are <b>Eurostat</b> <b>statistics</b> and actual flight information from EUROCONTROL. Relevant variables such as the number of flights, the type of aircrafts, passengers or cargo tonnes and production indicators (RPKs) are used together with fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions data. The target of the European Advanced Biofuels Flightpath to ensure the commercialization and consumption of 2 million tons of sustainably produced paraffinic biofuels in the aviation sector by 2020, has also been taken into account. Results regarding CO 2 emission projections to 2030, reveal a steady annual increase in the order of 3 %, 1 % and 4 % on average, for the three different scenarios, providing also a good correlation compared to the annual traffic growth rates that are indicated in the three corresponding scenarios. In absolute values, these ratios correspond to the central, the pessimistic and the optimistic scenarios respectively, corresponding to 360 million tonnes CO 2 emissions in 2030, ranging from 271 to 401 million tonnes for the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, respectively. This article also reports on the supply potential of aviation biofuels (clustered in HEFA/HVOs and biojet) based on the production capacity of facilities around the world and provides an insight on the current and future trends in aviation based on the European and national policies, innovations and state-of-the art technologies that will influence the future of sustainable fuels in aviation.

According to the Population and Housing Census 2016 (Statistics Korea 2016), approximately 45 % of the population of South Korea reside in apartment housing. Moreover, <b>Eurostat</b> (<b>EUROSTAT</b> <b>Statistics</b> Explained 2017) indicates that the proportion of people living in flats account for the highest proportion of housing occupants among the EU member states. The data showed that in the EU member states, more than 4 out of every 10 persons lived in flats. Such multi-unit dwellings are therefore considered as an effective means to overcome the housing problems in high-population density urban areas, owing to their high efficiency of land utilisation.|$|R

40|$|In 2004, Eurostat starts {{publishing}} new {{figures on}} hourly wage costs for all European countries. These figures are new in several respects: It {{is the first}} time that internationally comparable hourly figures on wage costs are available covering a quite important time period (1995 - 2005), so that not only cross-country comparisons but also dynamic analyzes are possible. Furthermore, these figures are fairly detailed at the sectoral level, therefore allowing for inter-sectoral comparisons. Concerning Germany, the <b>Eurostat</b> <b>statistics</b> provide quite unexpected insights; the gap between wage costs in the manufacturing sector and the (private and business) services sector is much larger than in other countries. This study aims at giving some explanations. According to theory, various explanations are possible. First, the neo-classical theory emphasizes factors affecting or indicating the level of individual productivity, as well as firm or sectoral productivity; indicators corresponding to this approach are tested. Second, dropping the assumption of perfect competition on both labor and goods markets allows for other factors (mark-up, market power) to influence the wage costs levels; these potential determinants are also tested. Finally, we think that the structure of demand (driven by domestic or foreign demand) could also have a major impact on wages in the industry and the services sector and indeed this factor seems to play an important role. This paper is structured as follows: First, the new <b>Eurostat</b> <b>statistics</b> is presented focussing on some interesting descriptive results. In the second section, we present a list of potential determinants of wage differentials between the industry and the services sector derived from theory and literature. A bivariate analysis (correlation) is then performed and conclusions are drawn. In a third step, a multivariate analysis (panel estimation) is performed. The final section concludes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} 2003 - 2014, Romania became an {{important}} source for the export of live animals (bovines and sheep), both for the intra-Community trade and for third countries.

The method used in the paper was the comparative analysis of trade-specific set of indicators, the main information sources being international information, reports and studies, FAOSTAT and <b>EUROSTAT</b> <b>statistics.</b> From our analysis, it results that that Romania practiced a conjuncture export, as the herds specialized in meat production, both in the case of bovines and sheep, have a significant share in total livestock herds. The reason why Romania is agreed as supplier of live animals is rather represented by the raising of animals under extensive system, where feeding is mainly based on grazing...|$|R

Indeed, half of the European workforce is working in small and micro enterprises (with great variations between sectors). It is therefore very important that small and micro enterprises manage occupational safety and health (OSH) adequately. This implies serious challenges. In this paper the characteristics of OSH Management in small and micro enterprises is central to the discussion. Attention is paid to the specific characteristics of small and micro enterprises, as they cut across sector and industry; the OSH performance for this broad group of firms; the consequences for OSH management strategies; and the importance and possibilities of OSH supporting structures...|$|R

40|$|Very low work {{intensity}} and at-risk-of-poverty {{are two of}} the three indicators used for monitoring progress towards the Europe 2020 poverty and social exclusion reduction target.

This paper presents a method of estimating ('nowcasting') very low {{work intensity}} and poverty risk using the tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD based on EU-SILC data and combined with up-to-date macro-level statistics from the Labour Force Survey. The method is applied to 12 EU Member States for the period 2009 - 2013.
