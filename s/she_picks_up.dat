500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank".

[...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
