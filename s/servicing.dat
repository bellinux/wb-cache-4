5|$|Past <b>servicing</b> {{missions}} have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without <b>servicing</b> missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but {{the first set of}} electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during <b>Servicing</b> Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, some of {{the science}} {{instruments}} and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems. The MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, utilize Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors. The Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor (or possibly the older 1801 version). The WFPC-1 {{was replaced by the}} WFPC-2 during <b>Servicing</b> Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during <b>Servicing</b> Mission 4 in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for <b>servicing</b> Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble <b>servicing</b> missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and was very disappointed when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding <b>servicing</b> Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's <b>servicing</b> mission to be reinstated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the factors behind the recent growth of India''s <b>services</b> sector. The high growth of <b>services</b> output in the 1990 s was mostly {{due to the}} rapid expansion of communication, banking, business <b>services</b> (including the IT sector) and community <b>services.</b> While factors such as a high income elasticity of demand for <b>services,</b> increasing input usage of <b>services</b> by other sectors, and rising exports, were important in boosting <b>services</b> growth in the 1990 s, supply side factors including reforms and technological advances also played significant roles. Going forward, the growth potential of Indian <b>services</b> exports is well known, but the paper also finds considerable scope for growth in the Indian <b>service</b> economy provided that deregulation continues. In addition, the paper shows that employment growth in the Indian <b>services</b> sector has been quite modest, thus underscoring the need for industry and agriculture to also grow rapidly.

5|$|<b>Servicing</b> Mission 3A, {{flown by}} Discovery, {{took place in}} December 1999, and was a {{split-off}} from <b>Servicing</b> Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed {{a few weeks before}} the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E

No. 32 Squadron celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 1991, {{at a time when}} personnel became involved in operations during the Gulf War. No. 38 Group RAF assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF.

40|$|Abstract: In Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) environments, <b>service</b> clients {{interact}} with <b>service</b> providers for consuming <b>services.</b> From {{the viewpoint of}} <b>service</b> clients, the trust level of a <b>service</b> or a <b>service</b> provider is a critical factor to consider in <b>service</b> selection, particularly when a client {{is looking for a}} <b>service</b> from a large set of <b>services</b> or <b>service</b> providers. However, a invoked <b>service</b> may be composed of other <b>services.</b> The complex invocations in composite <b>services</b> greatly increase the complexity of trust-oriented <b>service</b> selection. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for composite <b>service</b> representation, trust evaluation and trust-oriented composite <b>service</b> selection (with QoS constraints). Our experimental results illustrate that compared with the existing approaches our proposed trust-oriented (QoS constrained) composite <b>service</b> selection algorithms are realistic and enjoy better efficiency.
