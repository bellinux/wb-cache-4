One of these models, the HM-2, was used by Red Funnel between Southampton (near the Woolston Floating Bridge) and Cowes.|$|E
5000|$|A Surface Effect Ship (SES) or <b>Sidewall</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> is a {{watercraft}} {{that has}} both an air cushion, like a hovercraft, and twin hulls, like a catamaran. When the air cushion is in use, {{a small portion}} of the twin hulls remain in the water. When the air cushion is turned off ("off-cushion" [...] or [...] "hull borne"), the full weight of the vessel is supported by the buoyancy of the twin hulls.|$|E

Due to the {{unreliability}} of the craft it never entered passenger service. In 1981 Red Funnel acquired a pair of HM2 MkIIIs, GH2019 & GH2024, which were primarily used on the charter service for Vosper Thorneycroft transporting workers from the Isle of Wight to the Woolston yard and back each day. These two craft were disposed of in June 1982 and the charter subsequently operated by the augmented hydrofoil fleet.|$|E
