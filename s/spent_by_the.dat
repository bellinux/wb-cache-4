5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for Democrats to win.|$|E

The club's highest attendance in the Premier League is 52,389, in a match against Manchester City on 6 May 2012. Newcastle lost the game 2–0. The highest transfer fee received for a Newcastle player is £35million, from Liverpool for Andy Carroll in January 2011, while the most <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> club on a player was £16million for striker Michael Owen from Real Madrid in August 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top of}} the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for the Townsville area, making an initial $7,000 in emergency aid available for distribution among 84 individuals left homeless. Immediately after the storm, the Salvation Army began collecting and distributing donated clothing, while providing hot meals to hundreds of destitute storm victims. Australian Prime Minister William McMahon soon traveled to Townsville to assess the damage and authorise the distribution of emergency grants for affected residents. At the end of December, officials announced that {{the state and federal}} governments would jointly issue individual rebuilding grants, ranging from $1,000 to as high as $4,000 for pensioners; for the latter, higher allocations to cover the full cost of rebuilding homes were soon considered. The Townsville City Council received a special $25,000 grant with the goal of repairing schools {{for the start of the}} new academic year. By 27 December, $150,000 in private donations had arrived as organisations and radio stations throughout Queensland sought assistance for the disaster area. Western Australia provided $72,000 of relief funding, while Tasmania contributed $2,000. The Australian federal government reimbursed Queensland for an estimated $5.5–6 million <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state on recovery.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the demand}} for {{education}} rose, especially for high school education. There was also a rising need to cater to {{students enrolled in the}} elementary schools affiliated to the Hokkien Hway Kuan. Thus, Nan Chiau Teachers' Training College was converted into a girls' high school, featuring a primary school section. Mr Yang Zhen Li was the first Principal of the institution, which had an initial student enrollment of 900. A female hostel was also built in the 1950s. By the 1960s, Nan Chiau Girls' High had gained {{reputation as one of the}} state's top high schools. In 1965, 2 million dollars was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan to rebuild Nan Chiau Girl's High School to meet the needs of an increased student enrollment. During the re-construction, the high school section conducted lessons at a temporary campus at Guillemard Road, whilst the primary school section continued lessons at the unaffected classroom blocks of the Kim Yam Road campus. The new campus was officially opened by then Minister for Education Mr. Ong Pang Boon, on 8 March 1969.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{and loan}} {{guarantees}} from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department {{authorized by the}} Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of November 2009. Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending {{by as much as}} $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} reasons incumbents seem to have such a {{complete}} advantage over challengers is because of their significantly better financed campaigns.
