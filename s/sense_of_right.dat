25|$|The term is used {{in various}} {{different}} ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book entitled Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, {{but in some cases}} the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors. Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> and wrong from the average person.|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E

The obvious {{desirability}} of such events to one of motherly type defrauded by fate of children was terribly impinged on by that old memory, and a solicitude for her [...] "pretty" [...] far exceeding what {{she would have had}} for a daughter of her own. What a peony regards as a natural happening to a peony, she watches with awe when it happens to the lily. That other single lady of a certain age, Aunt Rosamund, the very antithesis to Betty--a long, thin nose and a mere button, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> divine <b>rights</b> and no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> at all, a drawl and a comforting wheeze, length and circumference, decision and the curtsey to providence, humour and none, dyspepsia, and the digestion of an ostrich, with other oppositions--Aunt Rosamund was also uneasy, as only one could be who disapproved heartily of uneasiness, and habitually joked and drawled it into retirement.|$|R

25|$|By 1998, Lawler rarely {{wrestled}} in the WWF {{and focused}} on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF {{for the first time}} and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon's name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon's departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler's character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, and would condemn actions of heels when they went too far. He would become a full-time face by 2007. This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when he started bullying Ross. At SummerSlam, The King wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross. With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that he never wanted to announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.|$|E

The author of the above article challenges this theory and maintains that {{at the level of}} individual psychology evil is not necessary to personal self-realization.

40|$|The essay {{describes}} {{the study of}} the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> (understanding) and the practice (activities, participation) of citizenship among Croatian secondary school students (the first new generation of full-age citizens). The study was conducted in line with the similar models in relevant international studies, which enabled a comparative analysis. The analysis of the concept of citizenship was followed by a comparative analysis of the development and the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> citizenship and the measures of the practice of citizenship among Croatian secondary school students. A number of indicators <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> citizenship (civic identity, the model and the type of citizenship, the concept of a “good citizen”, and the concept <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> and duties <b>of</b> citizens in democracy), and several measures of the practice of citizenship (interest in politics, discussing politics, following news in the media, the anticipated conventional and protest political engagement, political tolerance) have been used. The comparative analysis has shown that the Croatian students are in some aspect of citizenship {{at the level of the}} students in many of the compared countries, but that in others there are significant differences. For example, their level of interest in politics is significantly lower. The analysis has shown that there is a high <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rights,</b> but a relatively low <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the duties. Perhaps this discrepancy between the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the duties is the main problem in the development of the political culture of Croatian students and citizens. The anticipated conventional and protest participation of the Croatian students is significantly lower than among the students from the other countries. The research also shows that among the Croatian students (this has been noticed in the other countries as well) there is a significant discrepancy between, for example, the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> and the duties of citizens in democracy and the level of political tolerance: the high <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> one’s <b>rights</b> (freedom <b>of</b> speech, association, etc.) coexists with a relatively low level of tolerance. Thus, it can be said that various inconsistencies tag and “burden” the development of citizenship among Croatian secondary school students...|$|R

Cox based his portrayal on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel, who (he said) [...] "didn't have a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> and wrong". Cox has also suggested that his selection was due to his nationality, claiming that characters who are [...] "a little bit nasty" [...] are best played by Europeans. Mann kept the role of Lecktor very short, believing that it was [...] "such a charismatic character that [...] wanted the audience almost not to get enough of him". For the role of Will Graham, De Laurentiis had expressed interest in Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman, but Mann, having seen footage of William Petersen's role in To Live and Die in L.A., championed Petersen for the part.|$|E

The policy undermined the time, energy and resources invested in building the border structures, and also ignored the value of these structures in contributing to harmonizing Brokpa society. However, the government intends to lease the same tsamdro to the previous rights holders (NLC 2007), which may potentially boost a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> over their structures. Through such entrustment, the existing tsamdro border structures may continue to serve their purpose and shore-up the Brokpas’ flagging economy.|$|R
