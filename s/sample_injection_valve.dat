40|$|INTRODUCTION Elimination of {{flatulence}} is {{a challenging}} practical problem associated with consumption of legumes. The problem {{is compounded by}} the variability in susceptibility among individuals. Rackis (1981) established that the oligosaccharides-verbascose, stachyose and raffinose are major causes of flatulence. They escape digestion and are fermented by intestinal micro floral to form excessive amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Little has been done to develop bean varieties that combine agronomic superiority with nutritional quality, fast cooking and low flatulence levels in eastern Africa. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine if there is genotypic variation in concentration of oligosaccharides associated with flatulence in commercial bean varieties, recently released biofortified bean and advanced breeding lines, and (ii) the effect of cooking on oligosaccharide concentration. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study materials were 10 commercial dry bean varieties and seven recently released biofortified cultivars representing the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools and the major market classes grown in east, central and southern Africa. Verbascose, stachyose and raffinose were extracted twice from ground raw and cooked bean milks using a 3 : 7 v/v methanol-water mixture and quantified on a high performance chromatography system using analytical grade standard reagents. The oligosaccharides sugars were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography (Chromatography Systems model 750, Shimadzu, USA) with a differential refractometer. The precipitated material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant filtered prior to analysis. The column used (250 mm* 4. 6 mm i. d) was packed with spherisorb- 5 - amino, as a slurry in propan- 2 -ol. <b>Sample</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve,</b> model 7120 was used.

40|$|A new on-line gas-permeation {{system was}} {{developed}} to enhance the efficiency and stability of gas permeation for a long time, and {{was applied to the}} determination of ammonium ion in river-water samples by the flow- injection method. The proposed gas-permeation system consists of a newly designed gas-permeation unit, a <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve,</b> a reaction coil and two six-way rotary valves in a constant-temperature oven. The gas- permeation unit was assembled using an inner micro porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane tubing and an outer glass tube, which could be easily connected with one another using connectors with ferrules and o-rings. A sample solution was injected into a carrier containing 0. 02 M sodium hydroxide, in which ammonium ion was converted to gaseous ammonia. The gaseous ammonia generated in the carrier passed through the micro porous PTFE membrane, was absorbed in a reagent solution and changed the pH of the reagent solution, which resulted in a color change to cresol red. The absorbance change of cresol red at 550 nm was measured using a visible detector with a flow cell (8 μl, 10 mm path). After the measurement, two six-way rotary valves were switched over from the flowing state to the drain state of the gas-permeation unit, and the residual solutions in the gas-permeation unit were removed and the PTFE membrane tubing was dried. By keeping the temperature of the oven at 40 ℃, the sensitivity and the reproducibility for the determination of ammonium ion was improved. Furthermore, the efficiency of gas permeation through the inner tubing could be kept high and constant for a long period without any procedure for reactivating the porous PTFE membrane tubing. Calibration graphs for ammonium ion were liner over ranges of 0 to 10 ppm and 0 to 1. 0 ppm of N-NH(4) (+), and the sampling rate was 30 samples per hour. The detection limit for N-NH(4) (+) was about 0. 01 ppm when the effective length of the membrane tubing was 5 cm. By using the proposed FIA system, ammonium ion in river-water samples was determined. The analytical results obtained by the proposed method showed a good correlation with those obtained using the indophenol derivatization/FIA method. The relative standard deviations of ten injections were 0. 51 % and 0. 83 % with concentrations of 2. 73 ppm and 4. 11 ppm, respectively. The recoveries of ammonium ion were found to be 97 ～ 98 %. ガス透過分離におけるガス透過の長期間の安定性と高効率化,更にガス透過効率の長期間の再現性を向上させた,新しいオンラインガス透過システムを構築した. このシステムでは新しく設計・製作したガス透過ユニットを組み込み,ユニット中を溶液が下方から上方に流れるようにし,気泡の発生を防ぐ工夫がほどこされ,更に測定後にガス透過ユニット内に滞留する溶液を排除するために 2 個の六方切り替えバルブを内蔵させている. ガスの安定的透過のために温度制御できる小型恒温槽を装着した. この装置中にガス透過ユニット,アンモニウムイオン定量用の反応コイルなどを組み入れ,精密測定の向上を目指した. ガス透過ユニットは,多孔質ポリテトラフルオロエチレン(PTFE) チューブとガラス管からなり,接続には樹脂製フェラル及びO-リングを用い,組み立てを容易にし,デッドボリュームも小さくした. ガス透過ユニット,反応コイル及び試料注入器などを恒温槽の中で一定温度に保つことにより,安定した再現性の良い測定が可能となった. ガス透過ユニット内に滞留する溶液を簡単かつ迅速に強制排除する機能も備えており,測定後はガス透過ユニット中の溶液を除いておくことにより,多孔質チューブの透過性能が長期間維持され,再活性化の操作をすることなく,高いガス透過効率を維持することができた. 本システムを用いると,検量線は 0 ～ 10, 0 ～ 1. 0 ppmの範囲で良好な直線性を示し, 1 時間当たり 30 試料の分析が可能となった. 実際に,河川水中のアンモニウムイオンの定量を行ったところ,インドフェノール誘導体/FIA/吸光光度法による定量値と良く一致し,試料に対する相対標準偏差は 0. 51, 0. 83 %で,回収率は 97 ～ 98 %と良好であった...|$|E

The initial pressure in the injection-valve tube controlled the reproducibility of spray penetrations. An increase in the initial pressure or in the length of the injection-valve tube slightly increased the spray penetration within the limits of this investigation.

The variation of the coefficient of discharge with the length-diameter ratio of the orifice was determined for nozzles having single orifices 0. 008 and 0. 020 inch in diameter. Ratios from 0. 5 to 10 were investigated at injection pressures from 500 to 5, 000 pounds per square inch. NACA TN no. 369. "March, 1931. "Includes bibliographical references. The {{coefficients of}} the nozzles when assembled in an <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> having a helically-grooved stem were lower than when assembled with a plain stem. There was but little variation {{in the value of the}} coefficient with the ratio for the 0. 20 -inch orifice. The coefficient for the 0. 008 -inch orifice, however, varied considerably with the ratio, showing some irregularities between the ratios of 0. 5 and 4.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems, a quantitative understanding of primary production and the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrients is necessary. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} submersible FI based nutrient sensor for the in situ determination of nitrate in estuarine and coastal waters. Chapter One describes the role of nitrogen in the global and marine nitrogen cycles and provides an overview of laboratory and in situ methods for its determination. Chapter Two describes the key parameters for a field instrument and culminates with the overall design specification for the system. Chapter Three describes in detail the design, build and optimisation of the key individual components of the system, e. g. <b>sample</b> delivery system, <b>injection</b> <b>valve,</b> reduction column, reaction column, flowcell, on-board control system and the housing of the complete integrated system. Chapter Four describes the optimisation and analytical performance of the FI instalment prior to field trials. The key operational parameters such as flowcell path length, injection volume and detector response were investigated. LOD, reproducibility and linear range were determined and the control programme for the onboard computer is reported. For example, a LOD of 0. 01 Nitrate-N, a linear range of 0 - 140 | iM Nitrate-N and a reproducibility of ± 5 % were achieved. Chapter Five describes the field experiments where the FI system was initially used as a bench instrument and compared to a laboratory FI method which had been validated by participation in two interlaboratory exercises and for nitrate in river and sea water. The first submersed deployments involved the optimisation of the system operational characteristics and developing the field techniques. The final part of this chapter describes the weekly field studies of Barn Pool in Plymouth Sound using the submersed nutrient sensor for a period of two months. The operation and performance of the submersed sensor was assessed against an air segmented continuous flow analyser during a Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) North Sea cruise aboard the RVS Challenger. The results from this exercise and the relevant salinity and turbidity measurements are presented in Chapter Six. The Plymouth Marine Laborator...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} flow {{injection system}} for the determination of dissolved silver at ultratrace concentrations in seawater, and controlled under Lab VIEW™, is described. The flow injection system allows online processing of seawater samples before their analysis using a magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MS-ICP-MS) instrument. Samples were analysed with a minimum amount of manipulation, thereby {{reducing the risk of}} contamination. In addition, the flow injection approach with incorporation of an anion exchange minicolumn allowed ready removal of analytical interferences caused by the saline matrix. The software allowed full control of all flow <b>injection</b> components (<b>valves</b> and pumps) and removed manual time control and, therefore, operator errors. The optimized system was capable of five <b>sample</b> <b>injections</b> per h, including preconcentration and wash steps. The limit of detection was 0. 5 pM for a 240 -s sample load time, which allowed the determination of dissolved silver in open ocean waters, where picomolar concentration levels are typically encountered...|$|R
