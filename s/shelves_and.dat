5|$|The shock {{occurred}} near Nagoya, and {{was felt}} throughout the country, but {{was the strongest}} in central Japan. The cities of Gifu and Ogaki experienced heavy damage, due largely to fire, but Osaka and Nagoya were also significantly affected. The earthquake was strong in Tokyo, lasting for many minutes, and knocked items off <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> stopped clocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the night shark extends along the outer continental <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> upper continental slopes of the Atlantic Ocean, from the U.S. state of Massachusetts to Argentina in the west, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and from Senegal to northern Namibia in the east. In United States waters, it is relatively common off North Carolina and Florida (particularly the Florida Straits) and rarer elsewhere. There are questionable reports of this species off the Pacific coast of Panama.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} contains three sandstone fireplaces, and the countertops {{are finished}} with hand-painted tiles from Mexico. Myrtlewood is used inside as trim and for doors. Bedroom closets were constructed with drawers, <b>shelves,</b> <b>and</b> ironing boards built-in. Inside the two-level building are amenities such as dumbwaiters and a sewing room. On the outside raked cedar was {{used on the}} eaves of the low-pitched roof-line building. The exterior sandstone is tan, rose, and blue in color.|$|E

40|$|Biogeographic {{distributional}} {{patterns of}} gastropods are proposed {{based on the}} species' geo-graphic and bathymetric distribution. Samples were collected along the Brazilian continental margin between 18 ° S and 23 ° S, at 37 stations with depths from 20 m to 1, 330 m. The analysis of the biogeographic distribution patterns confirmed {{the existence of a}} transitional zone from tropical to subtropical waters in the area of both the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> slope, suggesting a relationship with water mass circulation. We observed a high species turnover rate between the <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> slope. The analysis of gastropod species distribution revealed a similar pattern on the <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> slope and a large difference between shallow and deep-water faunas...|$|R

5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} <b>shelves,</b> <b>and</b> pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E
5|$|Following minor {{events in}} 1917, 1927, 1931, and 1939, {{threatening}} activity resumed {{in the late}} 1950s, when, in 1957, an earthquake near Birmingham extended from northern Alabama to Georgia and Tennessee, cracking and displacing small objects. A 1959 event in Huntsville, although smaller, damaged chimneys, wrecked plaster, and threw objects from <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> tables. More recently, events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne, registering magnitudes of 4.9 and spawning shaking. The Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Briarcliff {{resident}} and artist Myril Adler proposed {{a series of}} exhibits of graphic art; the first showing was in October of that year and recurred each month thereafter, each with Sunday opening receptions. Exhibitors included Adler, Michael Ponce de Leon, Seong Moy, Rodolfo Abularach, Fritz Eichenberg, Jacob Landau, George Earl Ortman, Minna Citron, and Alfredo Da Silva. Exhibited works included etchings and engravings, woodcuts, cellocuts, lithographs, collage intaglios, and serigraphs. As {{a result of these}} exhibits, the library began a collection of prints donated by the exhibiting artists. In the library's small space, Adler displayed prints between <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> in the youth and children's reading rooms.|$|E

5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2003, {{the band}} played their first concert in Hong Kong {{as part of the}} Harbour Fest celebration, also in support of the SARS-affected economy. The same month, the band {{exclusively}} licensed the right to sell their new four-DVD boxed set, Four Flicks, recorded on the band's most recent world tour, to the US Best Buy chain of stores. In response, some Canadian and US music retail chains (including HMV Canada and Circuit City) pulled Rolling Stones CDs and related merchandise from their <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> replaced them with signs explaining the situation. In 2004, a double live album of the Licks Tour, Live Licks (UK 38; US 50), was released, going gold in the US. In November 2004, the Rolling Stones were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
40|$|The {{mounting}} {{interest in}} extracting oil {{and other resources}} from the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> continuing use of <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> estuarine waters for waste disposal is creating a need for synoptic means of determining currents and monitoring pollutants in this area. A satellite-aircraft-drogue approach is described which employs remotely tracked expendable drogues together with satellite and aircraft observations of waste plumes and current tracers such as dyes or suspended sediment. Tests conducted on the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> in Delaware Bay indicate that the approach provides a cost-effective means of studying current circulation, oil-slick movement, and ocean waste dispersion under {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions...|$|R

Trawl fishing, especially around the Patagonian <b>Shelf</b> <b>and</b> near South Africa, is also a large cause of deaths.|$|R
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I. Joe: Retaliation Movie Prequel was published by IDW Publishing from February 2012 to April 2012. Written by John Barber, it acted as a prequel to the 2013 movie.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> the consequent {{release of a}} prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E

25|$|Generally, seamounts {{are found}} in the high seas, outside the {{continental}} <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> outside the jurisdiction of any nation's EEZ. However, the U.S. Pacific Coast region has an unusually small continental shelf, while the Western Coast region contains islands with no continental shelf. As a result, there are some seamounts within U.S. jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, {{temazepam}} is {{more tightly}} controlled than other benzodiazepines.
