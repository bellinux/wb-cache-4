40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to examine Finnish university students' attitudes towards debt and <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> taking. The study also tries to find out the ways to improve Finland's <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> system. In addition to investigating the determinants of <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> taking and ways to improve Finland's <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> system, the thesis gives an overview of Finnish university students' <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> behaviour. In the thesis, students' attitudes towards debt are measured using the concepts of Fear of Debt and Debt Utility. The data of the study is gathered with tailored questionnaire. The questionnaire includes questions about demographics, characteristics, debt attitudes, <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> behaviour and working during the studies. It also includes statements that present six possible improvements to <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> system. The sample consists of 3 448 respondents of which 1 516 have taken a <b>student</b> <b>loan.</b> The survey was targeted to students at the universities of Helsinki, Oulu and Tampere. The results of the study show that generally Finnish university students are concerned about their future employment prospects but they also tend to underestimate their probability to get a job after graduation. Students appreciate more the improvements to <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> system that will guarantee their livelihood in the case of unemployment after graduation than the improvements that will reward them if they are able to graduate within targeted time. The investigation of the determinants of <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> taking show that <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> takers have positive attitudes towards debt {{but at the same time}} they fear the <b>loan</b> taking. Furthermore, <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> takers are surer about their future employment prospects, more willing to take financial risks, poorer money managers and have more internal Locus of Control than the students who have not taken a <b>student</b> <b>loan.</b> Moreover, <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> takers have been at the university longer and are more often worried about their financial situation than the students without a <b>student</b> <b>loan.</b> Concerning the students' debt attitudes, the results indicate that students who have been longer at the university have greater tolerance of debt and that male students tend to have more positive attitudes towards debt than female students...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the influence of <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt on the life choices of African-American Bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s Degree graduates of a Midwest, Research I University. Phenomenological in nature, the study addressed a grand tour question—what is the influence of <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt burden on the life choices of African American bachelor degree graduates? The study also examined eight research sub-questions and topical questions designed to assess the influence of <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt on life choices and how <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt burden was best explained for the participants. ^ Data were obtained by conducting structured, face-to-face interviews. The criteria to participate were: (a) identify as African-American, (b) received a baccalaureate degree from the University, and (c) used a federal <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> (Perkins and/or Stafford). Participants were acquired by using a snowballing technique. ^ The findings were: <b>Student</b> <b>loan</b> debt influenced life choices on a daily basis for some graduates. <b>Student</b> <b>loan</b> debt had little influence on when the participants would marry; however, it dissuaded participants from having children. <b>Student</b> <b>loan</b> debt had little influence on automobile purchases, but it significantly impeded home purchases. <b>Student</b> <b>loan</b> debt had no influence on career choice, but it dissuaded participants from acquiring more debt to attend graduate school. <b>Student</b> <b>loan</b> debt significantly reduced some graduates 2 ̆ 7 ability to save. <b>Student</b> <b>loan</b> debt was a burden for the graduates because (a) the graduates believe they were naive and young when they acquired their <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt, (b) it was difficult to find employment quickly after graduation and the compensation was low when employment was found, (c) the length of repayment was too long, (d) the graduates believed they were allowed to borrow too much, and (e) the graduates believe they did not receive “true” counseling and guidance on <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt and viable alternatives to paying for college. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is conducted {{in order to}} analyze how the <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> can affect seeking jobs and accomplishment of college students.
