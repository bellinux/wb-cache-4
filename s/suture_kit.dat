50|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the removal of}} a tooth, bleeding or just oozing very commonly occurs. Pressure is applied by biting on a gauze swab, and a thrombus (blood clot) forms in the socket (hemostatic response). Common haemostatic measures include local pressure application with gauze and the used of oxidized cellulose (gelfoam) and fibrin sealant. Dental practitioners usually have absorbent gauze, haemostatic packing material (oxidised cellulose, collagen sponge) and <b>suture</b> <b>kit</b> available. Sometimes 30 minutes of continuous pressure is required to fully arrest bleeding. Talking, which moves the mandible and hence removes the pressure applied on the socket, instead of keeping constant pressure, is a very common reason that bleeding might not stop. This is likened to someone with a bleeding wound on their arm, when being instructed to apply pressure, instead holds the wound intermittently every few moments. Coagulopathies (clotting disorders, e.g. hemophilia) are sometimes discovered {{for the first time}} if a person has had no other surgical procedure in their life, but this is rare. Sometimes the blood clot can be dislodged, triggering more bleeding and formation of a new blood clot, or leading to a dry socket (see complications). Some oral surgeons routinely scrape the walls of a socket to encourage bleeding in the belief that this will reduce the chance of dry socket, but {{there is no evidence that}} this practice works.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditionally, {{intraperitoneal}} bladder perforations {{caused by}} trauma or iatrogenic interventions {{have been treated}} by open or laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, transvesical access to the peritoneal cavity {{has been reported to}} be feasible and useful for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) but would be enhanced by a reliable method of closing the vesicotomy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and safety of an endoscopic closure method for vesical perforations using a flexible, small-diameter endoscopic <b>suturing</b> <b>kit</b> in a survival porcine model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot study was performed at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, using six anesthetized female pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Closure of a full-thickness longitudinal incision in the bladder dome (up to 10 mm in four animals and up to 20 mm in two animals) with the endoscopic <b>suturing</b> <b>kit</b> using one to three absorbable stitches. MEASUREMENTS: The acute quality of sealing was immediately tested by distending the bladder with methylene-blue dye under laparoscopic control (in two animals). Without a bladder catheter, the animals were monitored daily for 2 wk, and a necropsy examination was performed to check for the signs of peritonitis, wound dehiscence, and quality of healing. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Endoscopic closure of bladder perforation was carried out easily and quickly in all animals. The laparoscopic view revealed no acute leak of methylene-blue dye after distension of the bladder. After recovery from anaesthesia, the pigs began to void normally, and no adverse event occurred. Postmortem examination revealed complete healing of vesical incision with no signs of infection or adhesions in the peritoneal cavity. No limitations have yet been studied clinically. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and the safety of endoscopic closure of vesical perforations with an endoscopic <b>suturing</b> <b>kit</b> in a survival porcine model. This study provides support for further studies using endoscopic closure of the bladder which may lead to a new era in management of bladder rupture and adoption of the transvesical port in NOTES procedures...|$|R
