40|$|Suppliers are an {{important}} part of business because they supply the company with sources for production. If a company relies solely on one supplier, it may interrupt the flow of production due to failure to deliver material.

Highest bargaining power is currently available to <b>suppliers</b> <b>of</b> energy, because energy is an essential resource for the industry and there are few <b>suppliers</b> <b>of</b> this product.
