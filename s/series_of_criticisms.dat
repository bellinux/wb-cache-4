2500|$|Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] in New Hampshire and {{surprise}} victory there the following day, discussion of gender's {{role in the}} campaign moved front and center. Clinton's win in New Hampshire {{was the first time}} a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. (Shirley Chisholm's prior [...] "win" [...] in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern.) Women following the campaign recalled a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> of Clinton, such as the pitch of her voice, a debate moderator's question of whether she was [...] "likeable" [...] (and Obama's reply that she was [...] "likeable enough", felt by some to be condescending), and hecklers' demands that she [...] "iron their shirt", as motivations for re-examining who they would support in the contest.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 September 1996, Hanson {{gave her}} maiden {{speech to the}} House of Representatives, which was widely {{reported}} in the media. In her opening lines, Hanson said that [...] "I won the seat of Oxley largely {{on an issue that}} has resulted in me being called a racist. That issue related to my comment that Aboriginals received more benefits than non-Aboriginals". Hanson then asserted that Australia was in danger of being [...] "swamped by Asians", and that these immigrants [...] "have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate". Hanson argued that [...] "mainstream Australians" [...] were instead subject to [...] "a type of reverse racism ... by those who promote political correctness and those who control the various taxpayer funded 'industries' that flourish in our society servicing Aboriginals, multiculturalists {{and a host of other}} minority groups". This theme continued with the assertion that [...] "present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals". Among a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> of Aboriginal land rights, access to welfare and reconciliation, Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), saying [...] "Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold a position with ATSIC". There then followed a short series of statements on family breakdown, youth unemployment, international debt, the Family Law Act, child support, and the privatisation of Qantas and other national enterprises. The speech also included an attack on immigration and multiculturalism, a call for the return of high-tariff protectionism, and criticism of economic rationalism. Her speech was delivered uninterrupted by her fellow parliamentarians as it was the courtesy given to MPs delivering their maiden speeches.|$|E

40|$|The {{policy of}} {{deinstitutionalisation}} i. e. {{the closure of}} large psychiatric hospitals and a move towards community-based mental health services has been a feature of services developments in liberal democracies. This policy was the result <b>of</b> a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> the abusive nature of institutional psychiatry. Though the policy {{has its roots in}} a body of essentially, progressive ideas, the policy was pursued at a time when neo-liberal governments were in power – this is particularly the case in the USA and UK. The anti-statist, individualist themes of the critics of chimed with several tenets of neo-liberal ideas. The results of deinstitutionalization have been largely very poor. Community mental health services were largely underfunded, poorly organized and unable to cope with the demands placed upon them. In addition, other social problems such as mass unemployment, the destructive impact of increased substance misuse combined with the reduction in other aspects of welfare state provision meant that the institution was replaced, for many, by a bleak existence for the margins of urban society. More people with mental health problems were drawn into the Criminal Justice system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis project {{emphasizes}} {{the element of}} history as {{an important factor in}} the concepts of politics and aesthetics that are suggested by Jacques Rancière. Rancière has received a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> that his work operates at too great a remove from the actual materials of experience, and so this discussion acts as an answer to that criticism through a re-examination of his concept of the distribution of the sensible and his writing on politics and aesthetics. The focus of this discussion oscillates between the broader aspects of the aesthetics of politics and the politics of aesthetics, though its primary focus is on literature. By including a recognition for the historical as a material for the political, this discussion is then offered as a helpful suggestion to reposition both Rancière 2 ̆ 7 s own thoughts and the criticisms that have been raised towards him...|$|R

40|$|The {{psychological}} contract {{became known}} as a research paradigm within corporate research, providing a broad framework which explains the employee-company relations. Despite all this, {{there are still many}} debates on the concept and a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> were expressed that led to the necessity of some more rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis. The psychological contract refers to the unwritten, implicit expectations that employees have from the company and vice versa; it is that which defines the things the employee expects from the employer. Consequently, each of the parties involved in the contract may have different perceptions on these commitments and obligations. Thus the psychological contract may be regarded as an exchange relation between the employer and the employee. Breaking the psychological contract affects the performance, the morale, and the motivation of the staff in a negative manner. The information presented in this paper is intended to contribute to the theoretical and methodological development of the concept...|$|R

2500|$|George Watson follows George Saintsbury in {{dividing}} Arnold's {{career as}} a prose writer into three phases: 1) early literary criticism that begins with his preface to the 1853 edition of his poems and ends with the first <b>series</b> <b>of</b> Essays in <b>Criticism</b> (1865); 2) a prolonged middle period (overlapping {{the first and third}} phases) characterised by social, political and religious writing (roughly 1860–1875); 3) a return to literary criticism with the selecting and editing of collections of Wordsworth's and Byron's poetry and the second <b>series</b> <b>of</b> Essays in <b>Criticism.</b> [...] Both Watson and Saintsbury declare their preference for Arnold's literary criticism over his social or religious criticism. [...] More recent writers, such as Collini, have shown a greater interest in his social writing, while over the years a significant second tier <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> has focused on Arnold's religious writing.

40|$|The main {{intention}} {{of this book}} is to instil {{a sense of responsibility}} to the developers and policymakers as well as create an important awareness to the public about the conditions of our housing estates. We are living in a time bomb or a volcano that has shown ripples of signs of eruption. From issues of children dying of accidents and falling from buildings to health hazards for adults as well as the effects air conditioning might have on community interaction and cultural violations which increase inter–racial tensions, we must re–look at our attitude towards our billion ringgit investment. Malaysia is a country that no longer has a third world infrastructure but can be considered as a modern and up–to–date first world infrastructure. But our housing is still left in the throes of this third world mindset of ‘basic shelter’. We have evolved so far as a nation ironically, our housing attitude has not gone a far. The book presents a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> and thoughts on our housing and community architecture based on a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> articles and seminar papers presented.
