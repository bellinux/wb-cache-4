5|$|In March 1948 {{he set a}} world flight {{altitude}} record of 59,430 feet (18,114 metres) in a Ghost-powered Vampire. The flight lasted for 45 minutes, reaching 50,000 feet in 13.5 minutes. The following year {{he went on to}} test the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner which first flew in 1949. On 23 May 1952 he flew the Comet—now a highly successful export—carrying the recently widowed Queen Mother and Princess Margaret on a four-hour tour around the Alps. At one point he supervised the Queen Mother as she took the controls. She was to dine with members of the No. 600 Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron later that night and was anxious to <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> piloted an aircraft. Cunningham continued to test-fly prototypes such as the re-built Comet 3 and 4 in the late 1950s. On 23 October 1956 he travelled to the United States and received the Harmon Trophy from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was the most prestigious American trophy for services of civil aviation.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{established}} the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, {{with the aim}} of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich's associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children's [...] "blockages." [...] Reich's daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

On April 29, 2008, the New York Post reported that Clemens had relationships with at least two other women. One, a former bartender in Manhattan, refused comment on the story while the other, a woman from Tampa, could not be found. [...] On May 2 of the same year, the Daily News reported a stripper in Detroit called a local radio station to <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an affair with Clemens.

2500|$|They have an easy, {{non-binding}} relationship, as Templar {{is shown}} flirting {{with other women}} from time to time. However, his heart remains true to Holm in the early books, culminating in his considering marriage in the novella The Melancholy Journey of Mr. Teal, only to have Holm <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no interest in marrying. Holm disappeared in the late 1940s, and according to Barer's history of The Saint, Charteris refused to allow Templar a steady girlfriend, or Holm to return (although according to the Saintly Bible website, Charteris did write a film story that would have seen Templar encountering a son he had with Holm). Holm's final appearance as a character was in the short stories [...] "Iris", [...] "Lida," [...] and [...] "Luella," [...] contained within the 1948 collection Saint Errant; the next direct reference to her {{does not appear in}} print until the 1983 novel Salvage for the Saint.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 June Palmerston {{gave his}} {{statement}} to the Commons and said Britain would not {{go to war with}} the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or that her capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a vote of censure in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP General Peel said: [...] "It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England, uttered in the Parliament of England, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers?" [...] Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: [...] "I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided".|$|E

[...] Others claimed that she [...] "could call up {{the wind and the}} rain and could make animals do her bidding." [...] In 1969, organizers of the Merrie Monarch Festival were about to cancel their parade because of heavy rain, but Luahine said the rain would stop for two hours starting at 1 p.m. [...] Even organizer Dorothy Thompson recalled: [...] "She told me the parade had to start on time, at 1 o'clock, because the rain would stop for only two hours. [...] It poured cats and dogs. At 1 o'clock on the nose the rain stopped, and at 3 o'clock the rain came down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ashanti {{was first}} noticed by Irv Gotti {{because of her}} vocal skills. Ashanti {{initially}} asked him to produce a few demo songs for her to record so she could <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> some strong tracks by the big time producer but Gotti had a different idea. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song [...] "How We Roll". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles [...] "Pov City Anthem" [...] and [...] "Just Like a Thug". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and on the solo track [...] "When a Man Does Wrong". She was featured on Fat Joe's [...] "What's Luv?" [...] and Ja Rule's [...] "Always on Time". [...] "What's Luv?" [...] and [...] "Always on Time" [...] were released simultaneously and became {{two of the biggest}} hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously when [...] "Always on Time" [...] and [...] "What's Luv?" [...] were at numbers one and two, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Future Spice Girl Emma Bunton {{auditioned for}} the role of Bianca, however, it was actress Patsy Palmer who was {{eventually}} cast. Hester Lacey of The Independent has described Palmer's casting as an [...] "accident", as she did not formally audition {{for the role}}. EastEnders casting director Jane Deitch and writer–director McHale visited her drama class at the Anna Scher Theatre looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as she was older, but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line [...] "I can't believe you just said that." [...] The next day Scher contacted Palmer to <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day. In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: [...] "I've been a lucky girl. I always used to say I'd love to get in EastEnders, because I used to think 'God, I'll never get a part where I have to speak really posh', – I'm not very good at accents." [...] Palmer was 21 when she first appeared on-screen as 16-year-old Bianca.|$|E
