2500|$|On {{the superb}} Kirribilli Point location, Gibbes erected, between 1842 and 1843, a graceful <b>single-storey</b> <b>house</b> with wide verandahs and elegant French doors. Gibbes {{designed}} the house, {{which he called}} [...] "Wotonga" [...] (or [...] "Woottonga"), himself. The stone for the house's walls was quarried locally and the hardwood and cedar joinery came from George Coleson's timber-yard in George Street, Sydney. Gibbes engaged James Hume, a well-known builder who dabbled in ecclesiastical architecture, to supervise {{the construction of the}} building and its stables. Gibbes, however, hired his own masons, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and ironmongers to work on the project, paying each of them separately as work progressed. Gibbes used the Custom Department's cutter to commute to and from the building site. Once completed, Gibbes' L-shaped residence featured a plain, yet stylish, double façade to maximise the building's magnificent, sweeping views across Sydney Harbour. These views enabled Gibbes to monitor shipping traffic in and out of Darling Harbour and, more importantly, Circular Quay, where the Sydney Customs House was situated.|$|E

The practical part includes the study of family houses, itemized budgets and price offers that are contained in the annexes. The outcome of this work is to compare prices of all three houses depending on the enclosed area based on defined prices of itemized budgets. Other price comparison of the houses is done with the indicative price index for the <b>single-storey</b> <b>houses,</b> which is especially used in pricing of catalog houses...|$|R
