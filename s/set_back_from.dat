5|$|Euston Station is <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Euston Square and Euston Road on the London Inner Ring Road, between Cardington Street and Eversholt Street in the London Borough of Camden. It {{is one of}} 19 {{stations}} {{in the country that}} are managed by Network Rail. As of 2016, it is the fifth-busiest station in Britain and the busiest inter-city passenger terminal in the country. It is the sixth-busiest terminus in London by entries and exits.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{half a mile}} to {{the north}} of the {{southbound}} services, the northbound services are <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the motorway. The main building is an unusual design based on curves and circles. Unlike the southbound site, the cash machines are located outside and both the car and lorry parking is to the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E

5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{proposed}} in 1980 and constructed from 1987 to 1993. When the station opened in 1993, it spurred commercial {{development in the}} surrounding area {{and led to a}} parking controversy on nearby residential streets. Pulaski consists of an elevated island platform above a station house which is <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Pulaski Road. The station also includes a bus terminal and a park and ride lot. Nearly 1.4 million passengers boarded Orange Line trains at Pulaski in 2010. Trains serve Pulaski approximately every ten minutes during rush hour but are less frequent at other times. In addition to offering train service, Pulaski also connects to several CTA bus routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly {{rather than}} {{placed in a}} continuous line. The open areas between the buildings accommodate different types of public areas, while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond the avenue, such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate. The buildings lining the avenue range in height from three to six stories, with the higher stories <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the street line. There is also a two-story, domed atrium housing shops and restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Muxloe Castle is {{positioned}} <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> {{the village of}} Kirby Muxloe on low-lying land; the castle's gardens and orchard probably stood {{to the north and}} west of the current site. John Goodall suggests that the earlier residence on the site was built around two courts, one of which survives within the later castle, with the other on the north-west side of the site. The historian Anthony Emery, however, argues that the earlier manor was similar in size and shape to the current castle: he suggests that it was fortified and was protected by a moat similar to that seen today. The foundations of the first residence discovered between 1912 and 1913 were left uncovered after the excavations and remain visible in the castle lawns.|$|E
50|$|Located in Shinagawa-ku {{district}} of Tokyo, the House Tower, <b>setting</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> {{the street and}} rising over 11 metres in height, occupies only an 18.5m2 building area of its constrained 42m2 site. With its unique ‘tallness’ and seemingly irrational openings, this re-enforced concrete building somehow resembles a ‘one-eyed monster’, hiding awkwardly in the neighbourhood, sneaking around behind obviously ‘shorter’ counterparts, {{as if trying to}} find a chance to escape.|$|R

50|$|The House at 197 Morrison Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts is the city's finest {{example of}} vernacular Gothic Revival architecture. The two story brick {{building}} was built c. 1860, {{and is now}} <b>set</b> well <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the street behind a later house. Its notable features include bargeboard decoration in the front gable, which also has a Gothic lancet window, and its elaborate front porch decorations. The house is unusual for its position <b>set</b> well <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the street, since it predates the major development that took place on Morrison Avenue in the 1870s.|$|R
5|$|Milnrow War Memorial {{is located}} in Memorial Park at Newhey, and is a Grade II listed structure. The war {{memorial}} was originally sited in central Milnrow, <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the road near Milnrow Bridge, and was unveiled on 3 August 1924 by Major General A. Solly-Flood, a former commander of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The memorial is constructed of sandstone surmounted by a bronze statue of a First World War infantryman with rifle and fixed bayonet symbolic of the young manhood of the district {{in the early days}} of the First World War. In selecting the design the Milnrow War Memorial Committee was influenced by the statue unveiled at Waterhead in Oldham; the work of George Thomas. Thomas sculpted Milnrow's memorial in 1923. The plinth holds bronze and slate panels recording the names of those who died in the two World Wars.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E
5|$|Starting from George M. Ewing's {{original}} design {{of an office}} tower, Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. turned the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters into a , nine-story low horizontal block. At the corner of 6th Street and Market Street, two blocks away from Independence Hall, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters front facade runs parallel along 6th Street looking towards the Independence Mall. The reinforced concrete framed building sits on flaring concrete columns and is <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the street by a raised plaza. The landscaped plaza cuts {{through the middle of}} the ground level of the building, opening up to a larger plaza with a fountain and small pool. The plaza behind the building allows public access to an alley that leads to Seventh Street.|$|E
50|$|Grassendale is {{an almost}} entirely {{residential}} suburb, which consists of large, detached 19th century villas. The area is particularly green, and houses are commonly <b>set</b> well <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the road. This district retains classic-style streetlamps.|$|R
50|$|<b>Set</b> <b>back</b> {{slightly}} <b>from</b> the riverfront is {{the main}} square, called Plaza Zaragoza. It is laid out in white marble and dotted with palm trees. In the center, there is a 19th-century kiosk designed by local sculptor Francisco Sanchez Terán.|$|R

5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{designed}} by the City of Chicago. The station house is at ground level and is <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the street. It has a glass and steel façade, and most features within the station house are either made of stainless steel or painted white. The station's island platform is accessible from the station house via stairs, escalators, and an elevator. The platform serves the Orange Line's two tracks; the track to the Loop is located to the south, and the track to Midway located to the north. A canopy covers the entire platform. A bus terminal is located {{to the north of}} the station. To the west of the bus terminal and north of the railroad tracks is the Pulaski park and ride lot. The park and ride lot has 390 spaces which cost $4 for 12 hours and is operated by Standard Parking.|$|E
5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and each has a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly <b>set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the jet intake.|$|E
50|$|The {{school is}} {{situated}} on 32 acre of land. However, {{the school is}} split between two sites, <b>set</b> well <b>back</b> <b>from</b> any main road, and this encourages vandalism which by March 2005 had cost thousands of pounds.|$|R

5|$|Julian drew up his {{infantry}} in two lines, widely spaced apart, each several ranks deep. This was {{a standard}} Roman line-up: the rear line troops were reserves {{who would be}} able to intervene if the enemy threatened to break through at any point, and to exploit opportunities as they arose. During the battle, the foot archers (sagittarii) would have formed the rear rank of the front line, to shoot over the heads of their own infantry. But at the start, archers were sometimes stationed in front of the main line, so that they could disrupt the enemy ranks with their missiles. This was especially likely if the Romans' archer forces were much stronger than Chnodomar's, giving them a competitive advantage in a long-range missile exchange. But Ammianus does not state if this happened on this occasion. On the right wing was posted the entire cavalry. Most likely, the light cavalry would have been stationed in front, to harass the enemy before the heavy cavalry launched their shock charge. <b>Set</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the left flank of the front line, Julian posted a separate division under Severus to face the woods beyond the highway, apparently with orders to advance into them, presumably to launch a surprise attack on the German right wing. Julian himself, with his escort of 200 scholares, probably took up position in the gap between the Roman lines, giving him a close, but relatively protected, view of the action.|$|E
