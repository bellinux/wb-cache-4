25|$|Little {{vegetation}} {{grows on}} these islands, which {{are subject to}} intense monsoons. Larger islands are capable of supporting tropical forest, <b>scrub</b> <b>forest,</b> coastal scrub and grasses. It {{is difficult to determine}} which species have been introduced or cultivated by humans. Taiping Island (Itu Aba) was reportedly covered with shrubs, coconut, and mangroves in 1938; pineapple was also cultivated there when it was profitable. Other accounts mention papaya, banana, palm, and even white peach trees growing on one island. A few islands that have been developed as small tourist resorts had soil and trees brought in and planted where there was none.|$|E

25|$|Orona, or Hull Island, {{measures}} approximately , {{and like}} Kanton, is a narrow ribbon of land surrounding a sizable lagoon with depths of 15–20 meters. Like Manra, it {{is covered with}} coconut palms, <b>scrub</b> <b>forest,</b> and grasses; it also contains evidence of prehistoric Polynesian inhabitation. An ancient stone marae stands on the eastern tip of the island, together with ruins of shelters, graves and other platforms. Unlike Manra, Orona {{does not seem to}} have been worked for guano, but became a coconut plantation and a part of the British Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme. Residents were evacuated in 1963, due to drought and the declining copra market.|$|E
25|$|Manra, or Sydney Island, {{measures}} approximately , with a large, salty lagoon with depths reportedly varying {{from five}} to six meters. The island is covered with coconut palms, <b>scrub</b> <b>forest,</b> herbs and grasses, including the species Tournefortia, Pisonia, Morinda, Cordia, Guettarda, and Scaevola. Manra contains definite evidence of prehistoric inhabitation, {{in the form of}} at least a dozen platforms and remains of enclosures in the northeast and northwest portions of the island. K.P. Emory, ethnologist at Honolulu's Bishop Museum, estimated that two groups of people were present on Manra, one from eastern Polynesia, the other from Micronesia. Wells and pits from these early inhabitants were also found.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} Europe, {{mixed forest}} with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species {{in central and}} western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much <b>scrub</b> <b>forest.</b> A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.|$|E

25|$|The grey-breasted prinia or Franklin's prinia (Prinia hodgsonii) is a wren-warbler {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} small passerine birds found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. This prinia is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. Like other prinias, it often holds the tail upright but it is easily told by a smoky grey band across the breast which contrasts with a white throat. The beak is all black while the legs are pink. The tail is graduated as in other prinias and the grey feathers are tipped in white. In the breeding plumage the upperparts are grey while non-breeding birds are pale above with rufous wings and a weak supercilium. It is found in <b>scrub,</b> <b>forest</b> clearings and other open but well vegetated habitats. It can be confused with the rufescent prinia.|$|E
25|$|The northwestern {{portion of}} Rajasthan is {{generally}} sandy and dry. Most {{of this region}} are covered by the Thar Desert which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, as it lies in a direction parallel {{to that of the}} coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a rain shadow. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of Jodhpur is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is Indias largest airbase and military, BSF bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. The Northwestern thorn scrub forests lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400mm of rain in an average year. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54°C in the summer months or 129 degrees Fahrenheit and drop below freezing in the winter. The Godwar, Marwar, and Shekhawati regions lie in the thorn <b>scrub</b> <b>forest</b> zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The Luni River and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great Rann of Kutch wetland in neighbouring Gujarat. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The Ghaggar River, which originates in Haryana, is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive Sarasvati river.|$|E

40|$|There are few {{detailed}} carbon (C) {{budgets of}} mangrove forests, yet {{these are important}} for understanding C sequestration in mangrove forests, how they support the productivity of the coast and their vulnerability to environmental change. Here, we develop C budgets for mangroves on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We consider seaward fringing <b>forests</b> and interior <b>scrub</b> <b>forests</b> that have been fertilized with phosphorus (P), which severely limits growth of trees in the <b>scrub</b> <b>forests.</b> We found that respiration of the aboveground biomass accounted for 60 %– 80 % of the fixed C and that respiration of the canopy and aboveground roots were important components of respiration. Soil respiration accounted for only 7 %– 11 % of total gross primary production (GPP) while burial of C in soils was ~ 4 % of GPP. Respiration by roots can account {{for the majority of}} soil respiration in fringing forests, while microbial processes may account 80 % of respiration in <b>scrub</b> <b>forests.</b> Fertilization of <b>scrub</b> <b>forests</b> with P enhanced GPP but the proportion of C buried declined to ~ 2 % of GPP. Net ecosystem production was 17 %– 27 % of GPP similar to that reported for other mangrove forests. Carbon isotope signatures of adjacent seagrass suggest that dissolved C from mangroves is exported into the adjacent ecosystems. Our data indicate that C budgets can vary among mangrove forest types and with nutrient enrichment and that low productivity mangroves provide a disproportionate share of exported C...|$|R
