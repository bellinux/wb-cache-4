50|$|A {{quick change}} of {{fortunes}} {{in the late}} summer and autumn of 1918 saw the defeat of Germany in World War I. The most important factors that led to the surrender of Germany were its exhaustion after four years of fighting and the arrival of large numbers of troops from the United States beginning in the summer of 1918. Peace terms were imposed on Germany by the Big Four: Great Britain, France, the United States, and Italy. Clemenceau demanded the harshest terms and won most of them in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Germany was largely disarmed and forced to take full responsibility for the war, meaning that it was expected to pay huge war reparations.

40|$|Local {{and overall}} instabilities {{of the steel}} beam occur in the hogging-moment region in a {{continuous}} composite beam (Figure 1) and these forms of buckling have been recognised to be highly interactive. The overall mode of buckl ing in composite steel-concrete tee-beams in regions of negative bending is what is herein te rmed restrained-distortio nal buckling (RDB). In negative bending the slab restrains the tension re gion of the steel and the neutral axis is not located at the mid-height of the web. The neutra l axis is shifted towards the top/tension flange, and in negative bending the <b>steel</b> <b>region</b> is subjected to predominantly compressive loading. In addition, the web usually carries proportionally higher shear loads than in ordinary steel beams. The lateral-distortional buckling resistance of th e steel portion in continuous composite beams is therefore dependent {{on the extent to}} which the web can provide a restraining action to the unstable compression flange. Although buckling of plain steel beams in both the elastic and inelastic ranges of structural response has been studied extensively and a great deal of research work has been devoted to the understanding of their buckling modes, and codes of practice for the design of structural steelwork contain relevant clauses that presently are considered to be quite accurate, buckling of the steel component in composite beams still repr esents a grey area in structural engineering research and is much less well documented. The bubble augmented spline finite strip method of analysis, developed by the authors, is thus employed herein to study extensively the issue of RDB in composite tee-beams in hogging bending regions...|$|E
40|$|Many {{concrete}} structures {{over the}} world have deteriorated through the corrosion of steel reinforcement. In concrete columns, corrosion often occurs preferentially {{on one side of}} the member, leading to unsymmetrical loss of steel area. For slabs, corrosion of bottom steel also results in reduction in steel reinforcement ratio. The objective of this research is to study the effectiveness of repairing deteriorated concrete columns and slabs with fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite sheets. Using steel reinforcements with reduced cross sections, concrete columns and slabs are cast to represent members with corroded steel bars. This research focuses on the repair of columns (circular and rectangular) and slabs (one way and two way) with different FRP configurations. Circular and rectangular columns are retrofitted with horizontal and vertical FRP’s to study the strengthening effect. The columns are tested under uniaxial compression load. The failure mechanisms are reported. A simple analytical model to compute the failure load is also proposed. For circular columns, horizontal wrapping is found to be the most effective approach. For rectangular columns, one can either employ horizontal FRP alone or vertical FRP confined by external horizontal FRP. Slabs with reduced steel area are tested in both one way and two way bending. Various repair configurations are studied, and the cracking and failure mechanisms are reported. For one-way slab, the H-type configuration, with two FRP strips bonded on the two sides of the region with reduced steel area, is found to be the most effective. To predict the failure load of the strengthened member, a simple analytical approach based on existing debonding models has been developed. Predictions are found to be in good agreement with test results. For two-way slab, two sheets of FRP with bond length 300 mm bonded crossing each other at the centre of the slab is found to be more effective than the grid type with composite strips placed around the reduced <b>steel</b> <b>region.</b> In predicting the peak load of the retrofitted member, a simple analytical approach with assumed yield line pattern is also proposed...|$|E

40|$|Ni-based {{superalloy}} weld overlays {{are widely}} used in electricity generating plants to significantly reduce high temperature corrosion problems of ferritic steel components under service conditions. Welding a nickel alloy similar to IN 625 onto the outer bore of a 2. 25 Cr 1 Mo steel tube enhances its service life as a superheater tube in the highly corrosive environment of a Waste-to-Energy boiler. For the purposes of studying the effects of high temperature service on the microstructure of this laid tube with a weld overly, a series of thermal exposure tests at 650 ˚C was performed for different times from 1 day up to 128 days. The microstructural evolution was studied {{using a combination of}} analytical techniques along with changes in hardness profile across the interface. Changes in the microstructure were examined using OM, SEM, EPMA, EBSD and FIB-STEM. Hardness survey results indicate significant changes in the interfacial region during ageing. Formation of a soft zone ~ 300 μm wide and its subsequent re-hardening was observed in the steel side while the hardness of the bulk steel remained unchanged. Development of a hard band ~ 30 μm wide adjacent to the interface in the weld overlay region and hardening of the bulk overlay material occurs {{in the early stages of}} ageing and remained unchanged with ageing time. Thermodynamic calculations were performed using Thermo-Calc software and TCFE 6 and TTNI 7 databases to aid interpretation of experimental data. Microstructural evolution in the <b>steel</b> <b>region</b> is related to the carbide transformation process and carbon migration. In the bulk of the steel tube, the bimodal microstructure is stable and in the tempered martensite/bainite areas, the initial M 3 C transform to M 23 C 6 through a series of metastable carbides while in the ferrite grains, M 2 C carbide precipitates and transforms directly to the equilibrium carbide. The main process for supply of carbon atoms is transformation of carbides and the rates of transformation are related to the as-welded microstructure. On the steel side of interfacial region where bainite was formed after welding, the stability of metastable carbides is related to the carbon content. Long term ageing causes Mo replenishment in the coexisting ferrite and fine grains have formed in this region following long term ageing. Experimental observations confirmed that a network of alloyed M 23 C 6 carbide precipitates was formed at the interface in the steel side which are believed to interrupt the carbon migration across the interface. Moreover, there is a carbide precipitation region within ~ 100 μm from the interface in the weld overlay. Beyond this region intermetallic phases like Mo-rich μ and Nb-rich δ were formed in the interdendritic regions and along the grain boundaries. Hard band formation is related to precipitation of the σ phase. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} "maintenance of {{industrial}} cores" established {{in connection with}} German reunification creates considerable difficulties especially in monostructure regions. That is why the privatisation of the ironworks "Eisenhüttenkombinat Ost" (German abbr. EKO) in Brandenburg {{turned out to be}} one of the most difficult cases of privatisation after reunification. It took more than four years until finally at the beginning of 1995, the Belgium steel concern Cokkerill-Sambre took over the former nationally owned model combine from the trust agency "Treuhand" (at first 60 % of the shares, the remaining 40 % not later than 1999). The privatisation process and the future development of the plant location were especially complicated by three aspects in the transition of the <b>steel</b> <b>region</b> from the planned economy to the market economy: At first, the formely favourable geographic situation towards the former trading partners of the Council of Mutual Economic Aid became a doubly peripheral location, namely both with respect to the new Federal Republic and to the common market of the European Union. Although the region has a monostructural orientation towards iron and steel production, it lags technologically far behind the West-German level. There is especially a lack of a hot-rolling mill which is needed in order to become an integrated, competitive location. The construction of a hot-rolling mill had to be twice stopped by the GDR for financial reasons. Overemployment and low productivity forced mass redundancies to be carried out after reunification and their consequences have not yet been overcome in the region. That is why privatisation and the beginning of renovation by the trust agency "Treuhand" have been difficult. These measures considerably changed the structure of the whole economic region and concentrated on the following four sectors: the regional and organisatory decentralisation of the combine structure, the reduction of labour force, the beginning of renovation measures in the EKO plant as well as the search for purchasers. Due to the great number and variety of interests of the different parties both on the local and the international level, an investor was only found in 1994. The Belgium concern Cockerill-Sambre developed a concept which in contrast to the other offers preserves relatively many working places (2300 from 12 346 in the past). Above all, the Belgium concern will close the "technological gap" by means of the construction of a hot-rolling mill and thus make the steel location of Eisenhüttenstadt internationally competitive. For this purpose, the steel plant "EKOStahl" will be given additional grants of more than one thousand million marks and will be the second most expensive privatisation project of the reunification. It is true that the direction has been decisively set, but nevertheless the plant and the region will continue to face considerable problems which, in the medium term, will be decisive in the economic development of the region; this is due to the fact that the grants are bound to a limitation in production up to the year 2000. Although the technological gap has been closed by means of the new rolling mill, innovations in steel production might quickly eliminate the advance obtained. Also owing to the steel industry's general susceptibility to crises it is necessary for the region of Eisenhüttenstadt to diversify into the settlement of other industrial and commercial enterprises. For this purpose however, the region especially needs the extension of its insufficient communications infrastructure. This is true both for the inland waterways (river of Oder, Oder-Spree-canal) as well as for the railway tracks and the fast nationwide road communications...|$|E

40|$|Creating {{reproducible}} {{signals from}} defects {{is of great}} importance for quantitative studies of acoustic emission (AE).

In many cases the signals were reproducible over an appreciable range and appeared to be the same for epicenter measurements as those produced by sudden unloading. However, monitoring on the same surface as the crack in some cases produced sets of two different but reproducible signals which gradually evolved with repeated loading which could be due to crack branching or zigzag motion. <b>Regions</b> in the <b>steels</b> with a hardness less than about 40 on the Rockwell C scale produced no detectable AE, even with appreciable plastic deformation. Examination with scanning electron microscopy indicated that the AE signals were produced by the nucleation and incremental growth of subsurface cracks, generally penny-shaped, less than a millimeter in size. A typical fracture toughness value for such cracks in an embrittled 02 tool steel was calculated to be about 19 MNm- 3 / 2. AE was also produced in as-received A 533 B steel by indentation fatique.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores catalysts {{to divorce}} {{and the effects}} of different shocks to marital stability. In order to determine how marriage market participation and job opportunities affect marital stability, a panel data set was constructed of all marriages and divorces (or annulments) granted in each county in the United States from 1965 to 1988. The divorce records are merged with county- level employment and population levels to estimate the employment and divorce rates. Using county level data this dissertation is able to exploit a number of labor-market geographical observation levels, such as state border regions, Statistical Metropolitan Areas (SMA), and Labor Market Areas (LMA). The first chapter analyzes how changes in the number of available marriage-market participants in a community affect the marital stability of existing couples in the area. The analysis focuses on border regions of neighboring states and assesses the impact of fluctuations in divorcee population in one state on the divorce rates in the neighboring states’ border region. Large and statistically significant effects are identified in border regions where the neighboring state 2 ̆ 7 s border population is larger than one 2 ̆ 7 s own border population, which is consistent with the theoretical models on the subject. In the second and third chapters, attention is turned to how employment opportunities affect marital stability. In chapter two, I use my unique data to more precisely determine the relationship between employment rates and divorce. Using a fixed-effect panel-data model at the LMA level, the results indicate a strong a pro-cyclical relationship between divorce and the business cycle. Finally, in chapter three, the focus of the research transitions, from temporary employment fluctuations, to how permanent changes in the labor market affect marriage. Exploiting structural changes to the labor markets of steel and coal mining, an instrumental variable approach is used that interacts county-level steel and coal industry-concentrations with a national-level demand measure. The model estimates a strong positive relationship between the real-earnings of low-skilled male workers in the county and the county-level divorce rate in <b>steel</b> <b>regions</b> but finds minimal effects on divorce rates in coal regions...|$|R

Traditionally, weld overlays are produced using cold or hot wire gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Potential advantages of cold metal transfer (CMT) welding, a low heat input gas metal arc welding process, over the conventional GTAW in production of weld overlays were evaluated. Metallurgical characterization was performed on CMT overlays of Alloy 625 filler metal on Grade 11 and Grade 22 steels. Significant grain refinement was found in the high temperature HAZ compared to the traditional coarse-grained HAZ in arc welding. Evidences of incomplete carbide dissolution, limited carbon diffusion, and incomplete transformation to austenite were also found.

The model employed consists of a planar band with a square array of equally sized cells, with a spherical void located in the centre of each cell. The periodic arrangement of the cells allows the study of a single unit cell for which fully periodic boundary conditions are applied. The micromechanics model is applied to analyze failure by ductile rupture in experiments on double notched tube specimens subjected to combined tension and torsion carried out by the present authors. The stress state is characterized in terms of the stress triaxiality and the Lode parameter. Two rupture mechanisms can be identified, void coalescence by internal necking at high triaxiality and void coalescence by internal shearing at low triaxiality. For the internal necking mechanism, failure is assumed to occur when the deformation localizes into a planar band and is closely associated with extensive void growth. For the internal shearing mechanism, a simple criterion based on the attainment of a critical value of shear deformation is utilized. The two failure criteria capture the transition between the two rupture mechanisms successfully and are in good agreement with the experimental result. QC 20101109 </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{potential}} {{importance of the}} link between peak oil and the geography of world trade, so far remarkably little research has been conducted for that matter. Particularly, there is a gap in the literature regarding the impact of peak oil on international trade patterns at the industry level. The dissertation contributes to filling that gap. The study uses the VEC model approach to analyse the influence of peak oil on the geography of international trade, thereby using the example of steel exports to the United States between 1998 and 2008. The hypothesis tested is that peak oil, which involves high oil prices and rising international transport costs, leads to an increasing regionalisation of international trade flows at the cost of long-distance trade. Steel exports to the U. S. are analysed by steel export category, country and <b>region.</b> <b>Steel</b> exports per steel product category are analysed for 18 countries, total steel exports are analysed for 64 countries, and <b>steel</b> exports per <b>region</b> are analysed for 8 regions. The findings suggest that following an oil price shock, steel export volumes decrease for countries/regions geographically distant to the U. S. and increase for countries/regions geographically close to the U. S. The evidence also reveals the significant explanatory power oil prices have for steel exports to the United States and that price patterns {{play a role in the}} realignment process of international trade flows in the global steel industry. The findings are in line with economic trade theory with regard to the importance of the distance of trade and indicate that due to peak oil, trade globalisation, at least in the steel industry, may be at risk...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} strategies {{aimed at}} regional-economic structural {{change in the}} German Ruhrgebiet. The Ruhrgebiet {{used to be the}} largest industrial area in Western-Europe. After the crisis in the coal and <b>steel</b> industry the <b>region</b> pursued re-industrialisation policies in the 1960 s and 1970 s. These attempts were largely unsuccesful. Therefore, since the 1980 s the involved actors gradually adopted regional innovation strategies. Thus, they were able to break out from the region’s lock-in situation. The re-orientation of the Ruhrgebiet towards innovation based on the industries’ expertise and past (e. g. environmental technology, energy and industrial tourism) is more successful than its earlier re-industrialisation attempts. Also for other old industrial areas in Europe this kind of place-based renewal might be the future...|$|R
40|$|Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) is a {{promising}} material for automotive applications clue to its high strength-to-weight ratio {{compared to other}} steels. Recently third generation steels have been developed which show intermediate properties between first and second generation AHSS. Formability analysis was performed between first generation Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) and second generation Quenched and Partitioned (Q&P) AHSS. The main objective of the study is to perform formability analysis of TRIP and (28. 21) AHSS. The chemical compositions of both the steels are almost similar but different processing conditions lead to microstructural variations. Experimental and simulated strain-path diagram (SPD) was plotted from drawing to stretching regions using Limit Dome Height (LDH) test and Finite Element Method (ELM) respectively. The formability of TRIP steel is higher when compared to Q&P <b>steels.</b> Stretching <b>regions</b> show large deviation between experimental and simulated SPD for both the steels. A new strain localization criterion is proposed to construct a forming limit curve (FLC) for both experimental and simulated SPD. The proposed failure criterion is compared with other failure criteria for ELC prediction. The FLC based on new strain localization criterion shows better agreement with experimental FLC compared to other failure criteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
