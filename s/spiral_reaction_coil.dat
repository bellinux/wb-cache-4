40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{determination}} of barbituric acid using two methods of flow analysis: flow injection analysis and sequential injection analysis, with spectrophotometric detection. Two reactions were selected for the determination of barbituric acid and different experimental conditions were optimized conditions for its determination. In the case of flow injection analysis, the concentration and flow rates of many reagents, the sample volume and the volume of the <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> were optimized. In the case of sequential injection analysis the same parameters except the optimum volume of the <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> were optimized. The optimal volume of the <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> was replaced by the optimum retention time in the mixing coil. Determination of barbituric acid by reaction with a nitroaniline mixture achieved a calibration range from 2, 0. 10 - 6 to 1, 2. 10 - 4 mol dm- 3 and from 3, 9. 10 - 6 to 6, 2. 10 - 5 mol dm- 3 using using FIA and SIA method, respectively, under the optimal conditions.

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{for the analysis}} of chlortetracycline (CTC) using postcolumn fluorescence detection has been developed. After chromatographic separation of CTC on a polystyrenedivinylbenzene copolymer column, a highly fluorescent derivative isochlortetracycline (iso-CTC) was formed postcolumn in an on-line <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> with the addition of 25 % NaOH (w/v). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a PRP- 1 column, 15 cm × 4. 6 mm, with 27 : 73 acetonitrile: 0. 2 % perchloric acid (v/v), at 1. 0 mL/min. Fluorescence derivatization was achieved by the on-line addition of 25 % NaOH (w/v), at a flow rate of 0. 2 mL/min, into the column eluant in a post-column <b>reaction</b> <b>coil.</b> The <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> was 9 m of teflon (1 / 16 in o. d., 0. 3 mm i. d.) knitted into a six-sided coil. The fluorescent derivative was detected at λex 355 nm and λem > 389 nm. Using this method after a simple sample cleanup, CTC can be detected in milk at 0. 04 μg/mL, which is comparable to that obtained by microbiological assays. The detection method was linear between 0. 02 μg/mL and 4 μg/mL. Because of the chromatographic separation, the method is more selective than microbiological assays and more sensitive than ultraviolet detection. With the chromatographic system described, the keto tautomeric forms of CTC and 4 -epi-CTC are separated in a system which minimizes their formation on-column. In acidic aqueous organic solutions, the keto tautomer of CTC is the only product formed to any significant amount. PublishedN/...|$|R

This method {{is based on the}} reduction of Tl(III) with cysteine in acidic media, producing a fluorescence reagent, TlCl 3 (2 -) (&# 955;ex = 227 nm, &# 955;em = 419 nm). Before injection, the sample solution was divided into two streams. The first stream was treated with Cd reduction column and then joined with the carrier to react with Tl(III) at pH 5. 0 and then passed through a 100 cm <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> to the flow cell of the spectrofluorimeter, where the fluorescence intensity was measured (&# 955;ex = 227 nm, &# 955;em = 419 nm). This signal is related to cystine and cysteine concentrations. The second stream of sample solution was injected directly into the carrier stream to react with the reagents and then passed through the <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> and detector for measuring the fluorescence intensity. The signal in this step is related only to cysteine. Thus, the cystine content was determined directly from difference of the two signals.

40|$|Chromatographic {{detection}} {{responses are}} recorded digitally. A peak is represented ideally by a Guassian distribution. Raising a Guassian distribution {{to the power}} ‘n’ increases {{the height of the}} peak to that power, but decreases the standard deviation by √n.

The ramifications of these factors are that poor resolution in complex chromatographic data can be improved, and low signal responses embedded at near noise levels can be enhanced.

Quantification of the microperoxidases is performed using a fluorescence detector at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm and an emission wavelength of 545 nm, respectively. For this LC-based detection system, limits of detection are 3 × 10 − 8 mol/L, limits of quantification are 9 × 10 − 8 mol/L, and a linear range from 9 × 10 − 8 mol/L to 3 × 10 − 6 mol/L is obtained for the microperoxidases MP- 9 and MP- 11. A highly active microperoxidase MP- 6 {{was found in the}} reaction of cytochrome c from bovine heart with protease from streptomyces griseus...|$|R
40|$|A {{sequential}} injection analysis (SIA) methodology {{was developed for}} fluorimetric determination of quinine in soft drinks. Minimum dispersion and efficient mixing were achieved by aspirating 200 mL of sample between two 100 mL reagent zones (0. 10 mol L- 1 H 2 SO 4) at flow rate of 250 mL s- 1 and using a <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> length of 50 cm (0. 8 mm internal diameter). Linear response for quinine concentrations (C) between 0. 050 and 100. 0 mg L- 1 was described by: I = (532 ± 40) + (2. 36 ± 0. 04) C, with r = 0. 999, where I is the relative fluorescence intensity. The coefficient of variation and limits of detection and quantification were 1. 9 % (0. 50 mg L- 1 n = 10), 2. 3 and 4. 5 mg L- 1, respectively. The sampling throughput was 60 analyses per hour, consuming 2. 2 mL of concentrated H 2 SO 4 and producing 4 mL of wastes per analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed between the results obtained by the proposed SIA methodology and the ones obtained by the batch procedure...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple system}} was {{developed}} for the fully automatic and continuous measurement of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater samples based on colorimetry of dichromate. A sample and a solution of sulfuric acid (1 + 1) containing 2 mM potassium dichromate are continuously pumped with a double-reciprocating micro-pump at each flow rate of 0. 3 ml/min. The wastewater sample is filtered at first with a 100 -mesh stainless filter and then mixed with the dichromate solution in the mixing joint. The mixture is introduced into a <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> made of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) tubing (1 mm i. d., 3 mm o. d., and 20 m length), being placed in an oil bath (120 ℃). After reaction, the mixture passes into a quartz tubular flow-through cell (10 mm path length, 18 μl volume) in a spectrophotometer, and the absorbance is measured at 445 nm. The COD value of the sample is automatically estimated from the amount of decreased absorbance. The system was successfully applied to COD measurement of some waters, and to continuous monitoring of COD in wastewater of university laboratories. The system was also evaluated by comparing with the flow injection analyzer system previously developed by the authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{modified}} {{simplex method}} {{was applied to}} the selection of the proper experimental conditions for the flow injection spectrophotometric determination of tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and demeclocycline. In the method a 157 mm 3 sample volume was injected, for all the compounds, into the carrier stream of iron(III) of concentrations 554, 626, 701 and 447 ppm flowing at rates of 3. 72, 4. 37, 3. 72 and 3. 72 cm 3 min- 1, thus passing through a <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> of length 55, 85, 45 and 45 cm for the respective compounds, all in 0. 001 mol dm- 3 sulfuric acid as an over-all reaction medium. A high sampling frequency of the order of at least 170 h- 1 was attained for all the compounds. A high precision with a relative standard deviation of less than 0. 9 % (n = 5) was also obtained. The accuracy was found to be high as the Student tvalues were calculated to be less than the theoretical values when the results were compared with those obtained by the conventional spectrophotometric method. There were no interferences from excipients in dosage forms when the method was applied to pharmaceutical preparations...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method is {{developed for the}} determination of asparagine (Asn) and histidine (His) based on their inhibition effect on diperiodatocuperate (DPC) absorption intensity at 415 nm in micellar alkaline medium using a double beam spectrophotometer. The effect of different experimental parameters such as concentration of DPC, potassium hydroxide and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, flow rate, sample loop volume and <b>reaction</b> <b>coil</b> length was examined. The method presented a linear range of 0. 2 – 10 μg mL– 1 for Asn and 0. 35 – 10 μg mL– 1 for His under the optimized conditions. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0. 06 μg mL– 1 for Asn and 0. 1 μg mL– 1 for His with injection throughput of 120 h – 1. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0. 2 μg mL– 1 for Asn and 0. 33 μg mL– 1 for His. The relative standard deviations (RSDs, n = 10) of the method were 2. 9 % and 3. 4 % for Asn and His at 0. 1 μg mL- 1 concentrations level. The method was applied for the determination of Asn and His amino acid supplements.
