Language identification is in fact a key task within Cross Language Information Retrieval systems and the challenge is particularly difficult in the case of search queries where the contextual information available is scarce; function words (grammar particles highly connotative of a specific language like prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc) are usually missing and the relevant presence of Named Entities can be misleading for the correct identification of the language used in the query. In order to face this challenge with acceptable performances the techniques applied should be different form the ones adopted for language guessing with more extensive and syntactically richer text fragments, like metadata or textual documents. In particular we experimented combining together different strategies: corpus based, character model based and a priori hypothesis. Since no official evaluation of the task is available we manually evaluated a sample of 100 queries and the results obtained are quite promising.

The Eutaw Formation comprises 7 major flow units and is dominated by low-resistivity, low-contrast play {{that is difficult to}} characterize quantitatively. Selma chalk produces strictly from fault-related fractures that were mineralized as warm fluid migrated from deep sources. Resistivity, dipmeter, and fracture <b>identification</b> <b>logs</b> corroborate that deformation is concentrated in the hanging-wall drag zones. New area balancing techniques were developed to characterize growth strata and confirm that strain is concentrated in hanging-wall drag zones. Curvature analysis indicates that the faults contain numerous fault bends that influence fracture distribution. Eutaw oil is produced strictly from footwall uplifts, whereas Selma oil is produced from fault-related fractures. Clay smear and mineralization may be significant trapping mechanisms in the Eutaw Formation. The critical seal for Selma reservoirs, by contrast, is where Tertiary clay in the hanging wall is juxtaposed with poorly fractured Selma chalk in the footwall. Gilbertown Field can be revitalized by infill drilling and recompletion of existing wells. Directional drilling may be a viable technique for recovering untapped oil from Selma chalk.

We then evaluated the impact that (i) the isolation medium and (ii) lowering the <b>identification</b> <b>log</b> score (LS) threshold value have on yeast identification performance in the routine laboratory. Among 15, 661 clinical samples analyzed, 5, 671 tested positive and 6, 192 yeasts of 42 distinct species were identified. Overall, 6, 117 isolates (98. 79 %) were identified on the first or second MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (MS) attempt, yielding an average yeast species identification turnaround time of 0. 346 days (95 % CI [0. 326 to 0. 364]). The 75 remaining isolates were identified via nucleotide sequencing. Mixed infections accounted for 498 (8. 78 %) of the positive samples. The MALDI-TOF MS identification procedure performed well, regardless of the culture media tested. Lowering the recommended 2. 0 LS threshold value to 1. 8 would reduce the number of required (i) second MALDI-TOF MS identification attempts (178 vs. 490) and (ii) ITS 2 and D 1 -D 2 sequence-based identifications (17 vs. 75), while achieving an adequate identification rate (6, 183 / 6, 192, 99. 85 %).

In this paper, statistical analysis was carried out on the data of Upper Paleozoic formation water in this zone, e. g. salinity, pH value and ion concentration. It is shown that the formation water in this zone is of CaCl 2 type. Then, the origin, types, controlling factors and spatial distribution characteristics of formation water were figured out by using core, mud logging, well logging and testing data, combined with the classification and evaluation results of geochemical characteristics of formation water. Besides, the <b>logging</b> <b>identification</b> chart of gas, water and dry layers in this zone was established. Finally, the occurrence and distribution laws of reservoir fluids were defined.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified framework for analyzing {{local and global}} <b>identification</b> in <b>log</b> linearized DSGE models that encompasses both determinacy and indeterminacy. The analysis is conducted from a frequency domain perspective. First, for local identififiation, it presents necessary and sufficient conditions for {{the identification of the}} structural parameters along with the sunspot parameters, the identification of the former irrespective of the latter and the identification of the former conditional on the latter. The conditions apply to both singular and nonsingular systems and permit analysis using a subset of frequencies. Second, for global identification, the paper utilizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between two stationary vector linear processes and shows that global identification fails if and only if the minimized distance equals zero. Consequently, it delivers a set of parameter values that yield observational equivalence under identification failure. The global identification condition requires a nonsingular system but can be applied across models with different structures. Third, to understand the strength of identification, the paper proposes a measure of the empirical distance between two DSGE models. It gauges the possibility of distinguishing one model from another using likelihood ratio tests based on a finite number of observations generated by the models. Finally, although the theory is developed under a DSGE setup, it is applicable to other dynamic linear models with well defined spectra such as structural (factor augmented) vector autoregressive moving average models...|$|R

All seismic models to date, however, assume that a subdwarf B star is a post-helium-flash-core surrounded by a thin inert layer of hydrogen. Aims: We examine an alternative formation channel, in which the subdwarf B star originates from a massive (>~ 2 M[SUB]o[/SUB]) red giant with a non-degenerate helium-core. Although these subdwarfs may evolve through the same region of the log g-T_eff diagram as the canonical post-flash subdwarfs, their interior structure is rather different. We examine how this difference affects their pulsation modes and whether it can be observed. Methods: Using detailed stellar evolution calculations we construct subdwarf B models from both formation channels. The iron accumulation in the driving region due to diffusion, which causes the excitation of the modes, is approximated by a Gaussian function. The pulsation modes and frequencies are calculated with a non-adiabatic pulsation code. Results: A detailed comparison of two subdwarf B models from different channels, but with the same log g and T_eff, shows that their mode excitation is different. The excited frequencies are lower for the post-flash than for the post-non-degenerate subdwarf B star. This is mainly due to the differing chemical composition of the stellar envelope.

The west and northwest zones, which are in the deep-sea slope and shelf sedimentary environments, respectively, are the favorable areas for shale gas accumulation. The favorable sedimentary environment formed thick black shale that is rich in organic matter.

Therefore, through {{a comparison of the}} logging curves of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi marine shale in the Jiaoshiba area, Sichuan Basin, it is found that the mud shale on conventional log curves generally features high gamma ray, high uranium, low thorium, low kalium, relative high resistivity, high interval transit time, low neutron, low density and low photoelectric absorption cross section index, while on elements logging curves, it features an increase of silicon content and a decrease of aluminum and iron content. Based on the logging response characteristics of mud shale, the logging curves most sensitive to shale, gamma ray, neutron and density logging were selected and overlaid to identify mud shale effectively. On the basis of qualitative <b>identification,</b> the density <b>logging</b> value can identify the non-organic-rich mud shale from organic-rich mud shale, because the former has a density of 2. 61 – 2. 70  g/cm 3, while the latter has a density of less than 2. 61  g/cm 3. The identification results agree well with the results of field gas content test, TOC experiment, and gas logging, so this study can provide reference for the logging interpretation...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{interpretation}} of production log data on gas-water elongated bubble (EB) flow in horizontal wells, a multi-phase flow simulation device {{was set up to}} conduct a series of measurement experiments using air and tap water as test media, which were measured using a real production logging tool (PLT) string at different deviations and in different mixed flow state s. By understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of gas-water EB flow in transparent experimental boreholes during production logging, combined with an analysis of the production log response characteristics and experimental production logging flow pattern maps, a method for flow pattern <b>identification</b> relying on <b>log</b> responses and a drift-flux model wer e proposed for gas-water EB flow. This m odel, built upon experimental data of EB flow, reveals physical mechanisms of gas-water EB flow during measurement processing. Th e coefficients it contains are the specific values under experimental conditions and with the PLT string used in our experiments. These coefficients also reveal the interference with original downhole flow patterns by the PLT string. Due to the representativeness that our simulated flow experiments and PLT string possess, the model coefficients can be applied as empirical values of logging interpretation model parameters directly to real production logging data interpretation, when the measurement circumstances and PLT strings are similar.|$|R
