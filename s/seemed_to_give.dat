5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
25|$|Facing a {{difficult}} task to progress to the final, Australia seemed on target to reach India's total after Matthew Hayden once again top scored for the Australians with 62 off 47 balls. It was in the later overs that Australia's chase was dismantled, as the wicket of Andrew Symonds <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Indians momentum. Australia managed 173 off their 20 overs, and thus India won by 15 runs and knocked Australia out of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Third {{generation}} {{air system}} was the three level air. In Europe {{the use of}} three levels of air feeding with primary and secondary below the liquor guns started about 1980. At the same time stationary firing gained ground. Use of about 50% secondary <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> hot and stable lower furnace. Higher black liquor solids 65 – 70% started to be in use. Hotter lower furnace and improved reduction were reported. With three level air and higher dry solids the sulfur emissions could be kept in place.|$|E

25|$|The first Conservative {{majority}} {{government in}} 26 years—and {{only the second}} in 54 years—initially <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Mulroney a very formidable position. The Tories had won just over half the popular vote, and no other party crossed the 50-seat mark. On paper, {{he was free to}} take Canada in any direction he wanted. However, his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest. His support was based on a 'grand coalition' of socially conservative populists from the West, Quebec nationalists, and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Such diverse interests became difficult for Mulroney to juggle.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 patent by Haisch and Moddel details {{a device}} that is able to extract power from zero-point {{fluctuations}} using a gas that circulates through a Casimir cavity. As gas atoms circulate around the system they enter the cavity. Upon entering the electrons spin down to release energy via electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is then extracted by an absorber. On exiting the cavity the ambient vacuum fluctuations (i.e. the zero-point field) impart energy on the electrons to return the orbitals to previous energy levels, as predicted by Senitzky (1960). The gas then goes through a pump and flows through the system again. A published test of this concept by Moddel was performed in 2012 and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> excess energy {{that could not be}} attributed to another source. However it has not been conclusively shown to be from zero-point energy and the theory requires further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Both teams {{went into}} the semi-final first leg with {{identical}} records in this season's Champions League, each having won eight games and drawn two, while scoring 18 goals and conceding five. United were awarded a penalty three minutes into the game, after Gabriel Milito handled Cristiano Ronaldo's header from a corner. Ronaldo himself stepped up to take the kick, but, despite sending Víctor Valdés the wrong way, smacked his shot against the post. The missed penalty <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Barcelona the extra impetus they needed, {{and they began to}} take control of the game. Just before the half-hour, Ronaldo made a break into the Barça penalty area, only to be bodychecked by Rafael Márquez, who made no attempt to get to the ball. Rightfully expecting another penalty to be awarded, the look of dismay on Ronaldo's face was justified when he saw referee Massimo Busacca wave play on. Márquez fouled Ronaldo again just before half time, this time about 25yards from goal. Márquez was shown a yellow card for his trouble, which meant he was ineligible for the second leg on 29 April, but Ronaldo saw his resulting free kick go just a yard wide of the far post. A number of saves from Van der Sar and a Michael Carrick block kept Barcelona at bay, while Carrick himself came close to scoring at the other end, rippling the side-netting after making space for himself on the left side of the penalty area. The match finished as a scoreless draw, with Barcelona having had the better of the possession, but with the second leg being played at Old Trafford, United had every reason to be confident.|$|E

500|$|Both Chavez and American {{composer}} David Diamond {{were confused}} initially about what musical form Connotations would take. The work's title <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> no clear indication, they said, and Chavez told Copland {{that he found}} Connotations too abstract. As Copland explained to both men and later wrote, in selecting the title, he took the dictionary {{meaning of the word}} [...] "connote" [...] to imply or signify meanings in addition to the primary one as an impetus for musical exploration.|$|E

Dickinson hired producer Jack Endino, most noted for producing the first Nirvana album. The [...] "Skunkworks" [...] entity ceased to be when the tour ended.

500|$|The {{publication}} of the [...] "X" [...] article soon began {{one of the more}} intense debates of the Cold War. Walter Lippmann, a leading American commentator on international affairs, strongly criticized the [...] "X" [...] article. Lippmann argued that Kennan's strategy of containment was [...] "a strategic monstrosity" [...] that could [...] "be implemented only by recruiting, subsidizing and supporting a heterogeneous array of satellites, clients, dependents, and puppets". Lippmann argued that diplomacy should be the basis of relations with the Soviets; he suggested that the U.S. withdraw its forces from Europe and reunify and demilitarize Germany. Meanwhile, it was soon revealed informally that [...] "X" [...] was indeed Kennan. This information <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the [...] "X" [...] article the status of an official document expressing the Truman administration's new policy toward Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{said that}} the lack of the writing staff in the second season was [...] "disappointing". He [...] "love how this show is about NBC and really set at NBC", but was worried about the misuse of guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN said that for the first time, Jenna's storyline was the [...] "most {{entertaining}} of the night". He felt that first half of the episode was [...] "tightly written and very funny", but the second half [...] "waned a bit, with less than stellar conclusions to the stories and far less funny bits". Canning said that Jack's storyline was the [...] "most disappointing", and hoped that future guest stars were used properly, rather than for the sake of having a name guest star. George Freitag of BuddyTV said that although Tracy was [...] "not as strong as the previous two episodes", he was [...] "still terrific and the nod to his old SNL skit was a nice touch". He felt {{that the lack of}} focus on the personal life of Liz <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the series [...] "a lack of focus". Freitag hoped that her private issues would be further explored, as [...] "her approachable yet successful persona {{was one of the main}} draws to the series in the first place". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that the episode [...] "fell a bit flat", and that the season lacked the other TGSers, Lonny, Frank, Twofer and [...] "director guy". He did not enjoy Jack's storyline, but said that Jenna's storyline [...] "ultimately won a thumbs-up from me for her getting turned on by Kenneth's rudeness".|$|E
2500|$|For six months, LaRouche {{worked with}} American Healyite leader Tim Wohlforth, who later wrote that LaRouche had a [...] "gargantuan ego", and [...] "a {{marvelous}} ability to place any world happening {{in a larger}} context, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the event additional meaning, but his thinking was schematic, lacking factual detail and depth."

2500|$|In 1992 Kilkenny {{bounced back}} from the All-Ireland defeat. That year's {{championship}} decider saw ‘the Cats’ take on Cork {{for the first time}} in nearly a decade. [...] The game was well balanced for the first-half; however, new sensation D.J. Carey scored a goal four minutes before the break. [...] This <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Kilkenny the impetus to go on and win the game. [...] Two more goals by John Power and Michael Phelan in the second-half secured a win for Kilkenny and a first All-Ireland title since 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Schein further {{added that}} the film <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> little {{prominence}} {{to the history of}} the Hmong, and that only two male Hmong, Thao and a gang member, were given depth in the story. Schein said [...] "I feel a lot of the plot about the Eastwood character is driven {{by the fact that he}} is a veteran. Yet there is no possibility for representing the fact that the Hmong were veterans too." [...] An individual established a blog, eastwoodmovie-hmong.com, documenting what the author believed to be cultural inaccuracies of the film's depiction of the Hmong.|$|E

Later, during his junior year at Wayne State University in Detroit, he joined a State Department-sponsored acting troupe that toured India. [...] "I went into acting because I'm easily bored", Everett once said. [...] "Acting <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> vent to a lot of different feelings."

2500|$|The {{concept and}} general belief persisted {{for a further}} 250 years, and was to be sensationally re-ignited in 1767 when an [...] "official" [...] (but anonymous) account was {{published}} of Commodore John Byron's recent voyage of global circumnavigation in HMS Dolphin. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin) <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight best-seller, thousands of extra copies were {{to be sold to}} a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily re-published (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).|$|E
2500|$|Direct, or dynamical, {{measurements}} {{based on}} the motion of stars or gas near the black hole <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> masses that averaged ~1% of the bulge mass (the [...] "Magorrian relation"). Two other techniques—reverberation mapping in active galactic nuclei, and the Soltan argument, which computes the cosmological density in black holes needed to explain the quasar light—both gave a mean value of M/Mbulge that was a factor ~10 smaller than implied by the Magorrian relation. The M–σ relation resolved this discrepancy by showing {{that most of the}} direct black hole masses published prior to 2000 were significantly in error, presumably because the data on which they were based were of insufficient quality to resolve the black hole's dynamical sphere of influence. The mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass is now believed to be approximately 1:1000.|$|E
