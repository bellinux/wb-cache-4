25|$|Forest land {{is one of}} the state’s {{two main}} natural resources. These forests contain {{commercial}} species such as pine, oak, cedar, juniper, mesquite and more. Most of these are found in and around the Sierra Gorda area. There is about 70,000 hectares of possible productive land but only 17,000 have been studied for management. Land actively involved in forestry operations equals 9,358m2, most of which is in the municipalities of Landa de Matamoros and Amealco de Bonfil. 20.7% is used for grazing. 24.22% is forest; 3.95% is rainforest and 40.62 is arid <b>scrub</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vegetation on the {{limestone}} and other sedimentary soils ranges from lowland rainforest to grasslands to <b>scrub</b> <b>brush</b> in more arid areas. In forested areas, the trees include oaks, pines, white cedar, strawberry trees and oyamels. In the drier areas, {{there are also}} mesquite trees with some other desert plants including cactus. In the lowest elevations there are tropical hardwoods such as red cedar, Montezuma cypress and a tree called the “parota.” Wildlife mostly consists of birds and mammals such as doves, quails, chachalacas, eagles, roadrunners, and some waterfowl. Mammals include squirrels, rabbits, armadillos, white-tailed deer, foxes, coyotes, wild boar, pumas, raccoons, skunks, and opossums. There are some reptiles such as rattlesnakes and coral snakes.|$|E

Lee, displaying the audacity that characterized his generalship, moved out as Grant desired, but more quickly than Grant anticipated; Union forces had insufficient time to clear the area known as the Wilderness, a tangle of <b>scrub</b> <b>brush</b> and undergrowth in which part of the Battle of Chancellorsville had been fought the previous year.

25|$|The {{region is}} {{on a branch}} of the Sierra Madre Oriental {{mountain}} range and consists of a series of mountain chains that run northwest to southeast, formed 240 million years ago. Most are made of limestone, formed by sea beds from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Later there were intrusions of volcanic rock, especially in the eastern portion in Hidalgo state, from which come the mineral deposits of the area. The limestone has been affected by erosion to form the Huasteca Karst, and the area contains a large number of caverns, and pit caves (sótanos), some of which extend for hundreds of meters in depth. All of the Sierra Gorda is marked by very rugged terrain, which includes canyons and steep mountains. Altitudes range from just 300 meters above sea level in the Río Santa María Canyon in Jalpan to 3,100 m asl at the Cerro de la Pingüica in Pinal de Amoles. The most important elevation in the Hidalgo area is the Cerro Cangandhó which has an altitude of 2,820 m asl. Rainfall also varies greatly from 350mm to 2,000mm per year. The micro-environments of the region range from conifer forests, oak forests, mostly found on mountain peaks, banana and sugar cane fields in the deeper canyons. On the east side, there are deciduous forests. On the west side, bordering the Mexican Plateau, there are desert and semi desert conditions, with a variety of cacti and arid <b>scrub</b> <b>brush.</b> Among its mountains are the peaks associated with the Sierra Alta de Hidalgo, the pine forests of Zamoarano, the Extoraz Canyon and the slopes of the Huazmazonta, the inter-mountain valleys where the five missions are found and the rolling hills leading into La Huasteca. The wide variations of altitude and rainfall favor a wide variety of flora and wildlife.|$|E

2500|$|The Sierra Gorda is an {{ecological}} region {{centered on the}} northern third of the Mexican state of Querétaro and extending into the neighboring states of Guanajuato, Hidalgo and San Luis Potosí.

The area is extremely rugged with high steep mountains and [...] deep canyons. As part of the Huasteca Karst, it also contains many formations due to erosion of limestone, especially pit caves known locally as sótanos. The area is valued for its very wide diversity of plant and animal life, which is due to the various microenvironments created by the ruggedness of the terrain and wide variation in rainfall. This is due to the mountains’ blocking of moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico, which generally makes the east side fairly moist and the west semiarid <b>scrub</b> <b>brush.</b> Most of the region has been protected in two biosphere reserves, with the one centered in Querétaro established in 1997 and the one centered in Guanajuato established in 2007.

40|$|Introduction: Dental {{and oral}} hygiene {{is one of}} the most {{important}} indicators of general healthcare. Promotion of oral health in elementary school students is very important due to lack of adequate dexterity in carrying out correct brushing movements and education is needed in this age group. The aim of this study was to compare roll and <b>scrub</b> <b>brushing</b> techniques in controlling dental plaque in 8 - 11 year-old students referring to the Department of Community Dentistry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial 215 elementary school students were divided into 8 - 9 and 10 - 11 age groups based on age and gender. Half of the subjects in each group were instructed the roll technique and the other half the scrub technique. The subjects brushed their teeth using the techniques instructed. O’Leary’s index was used to register the amount of plaque in each stage and compare the results. Data were analyzed with t-test and co-variance analysis. Results: The <b>scrub</b> <b>brushing</b> technique was significantly more effective in decreasing dental plaque compared to the roll technique (p value < 0. 001). Conclusion: Under the limitations of the present study, the <b>scrub</b> <b>brushing</b> technique was significantly more effective in decreasing dental plaque compared to the roll technique in the two age groups evaluated. Older children were more efficient in removing dental plaque. In addition, boys were more efficient than girls in removing plaque. Key words: Dental plaque, Students, Toothbrushing...|$|R

I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
