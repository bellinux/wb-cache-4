6000|$|... "At any rate, I will {{accompany}} him. After that thrashing we gave Balloba's horsemen, my {{head would}} not be <b>safe</b> <b>here</b> an hour, after his arrival." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{will tell}} you by and by, Chief," [...] she answered. [...] "Come to the cave, {{it is no longer}} <b>safe</b> <b>here,</b> the {{hurricane}} breaks." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is all he}} wants," [...] {{the other}} said carelessly; [...] "and he is <b>safer</b> <b>here</b> than {{he would be in}} the richer quarters.

2500|$|In {{his letter}} to his daughter-in-law, Madoff {{said that he was}} being treated in prison like a [...] "Mafia don". They call me either Uncle Bernie or Mr. Madoff.

My hasty departure {{at this moment}} would bring disaster on us both." ...|$|R
