5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, <b>smoked</b> <b>glass,</b> etc. must be avoided.|$|E
25|$|As Professor of Vocal Physiology at Boston University, Bell {{was engaged}} in {{training}} teachers {{in the art of}} instructing deaf mutes how to speak and experimented with the Leon Scott phonautograph in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line on a plate of <b>smoked</b> <b>glass.</b> The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} test call on August 3, 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke {{to him from the}} Brantford {{telegraph}} office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet ("To be or not to be...."). The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the neighboring community of Mount Pleasant, received and may possibly have transferred his uncle's voice onto a phonautogram, a drawing made on a pen-like recording device that could produce the shapes of sound waves as waveforms onto <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> or other media by tracing their vibrations.|$|E

6000|$|... “Say, you’re that fourth man!” gasped Captain Hunker. “But {{that other}} chap,—the fellow with <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> {{who had his}} face tied up——” He {{did not know how}} to go on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you've got {{handkerchiefs}} {{and such}} extras," [...] said Mr. Portney. [...] "So now all you want, {{so far as}} wearing is concerned, is a few pairs of <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> to prevent snow-blindness." ...|$|R
500|$|The Waterfront complex, {{which was}} {{intended}} to hold an IMAX cinema, was constructed on the seafront in 1998. The [...] concrete and <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> building featured a wavy roof design, but was despised by residents and visitors alike because it blocked views of the bay and the Isle of Purbeck. In 2005 it was voted the most hated building in England in a 10,000-person poll conducted by the Channel 4 programme Demolition, and was pulled down in spring 2013. The site {{is to be used}} as an outdoor event arena. The council still plan a larger redevelopment of the site and adjoining council land in the long term.|$|E
500|$|The Sentinels had two {{separate}} versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s {{evolved into the}} adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future. Singer described the 1973 version as [...] "a little fun and stylish but also a little retro", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period, and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and [...] "those wonderful TV sets that were round with <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> panels". The overall style was bulky to fit [...] "the traditional idea of a robot looks like", and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design. The robots' ability to fly was compared to a Harrier Jump Jet, as the Sentinels had vertical takeoff and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by Legacy Effects to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding woof effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of an atmosphere on Venus was concluded by Mikhail Lomonosov {{on the basis of}} his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 from the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. He used a two-lens achromat refractor and a weak solar filter (<b>smoked</b> <b>glass)</b> and [...] reported seeing a bump or bulge of light ("Lomonosov's arc") off the solar disc as Venus began to exit the Sun. Lomonosov attributed that effect to refraction of solar rays through an atmosphere; he also reported the appearance of a sliver around the part of Venus that had just entered the Sun's disk during the initial phase of transit. [...] In 2012, Pasachoff and Sheehan reported, based on knowing what Venus's atmosphere would look like because of Pasachoff and Schneider's observations of the 2004 transit of Venus, that what Lomonosov reported was not Venus's atmosphere. To make a decisive test, a group of researchers carried out experimental reconstruction of Lomonosov's discovery of Venusian atmosphere with antique refractors during the transit of Venus on [...] 5–6 June 2012. They observed the [...] "Lomonosov's arc" [...] and other aureole effects due to Venus's atmosphere and concluded that Lomonosov's telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around Venus off the Sun's disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by Lomonosov in his 1761 paper are employed.|$|E
6000|$|The king made no {{difficulties}} about it, {{and even}} gave his finest rubies and diamonds to ornament the dress, {{which was so}} dazzling, when finished, {{that it could not}} be looked at save through <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went down}} on the beach to the United States consul's shack. He was a grizzly man, eighty-two pounds, <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> five foot eleven, pickled. He was playing chess with an india-rubber man in white clothes.|$|R
60|$|He wore {{spectacles}} with <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> a tall silk hat {{stood on}} the floor by the side of his chair. Flourishing slightly a big soft hand he went on with his discourse, precipitating his delivery a little more.|$|R
2500|$|All {{the offices}} {{on the upper}} floors were removed, and new, larger offices installed. These ranged in size from [...] to [...] in size. The {{flooring}} and arched supports on the upper levels were removed, and replaced with [...] Styrofoam blocks which were covered with {{a thin layer of}} concrete. The women's parlor and the tellers' cages were removed, but the tellers' cage bronze grilles were salvaged and reused for the new tellers' counters. The marble floor was retained, as were the embossed bronze brackets, and all gold leaf and gilt inside the rotunda repaired and cleaned. The clear glass of the large windows on Euclid Avenue and E. 9th Street were replaced with <b>smoked</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By 1874, Bell's initial {{work on the}} {{harmonic}} telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston [...] "laboratory" [...] (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success. While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a [...] "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> by tracing their vibrations. Bell {{thought it might be}} possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Early seismometers had an {{arrangement}} of levers on jeweled bearings, to scratch <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> or paper. [...] Later, mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of photographic paper. [...] Briefly, some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money. [...] In mid-twentieth-century systems, the light was reflected {{to a pair of}} differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier. [...] The voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis. [...] The moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum, which was covered with photo-sensitive paper. [...] The expense of developing photo sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper.|$|E
50|$|Tin oxide with {{antimony}} and arsenic oxides {{produce an}} opaque white glass (milk glass), first used in Venice {{to produce an}} imitation porcelain. Similarly, some <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses</b> may be based on dark-colored inclusions, but with ionic coloring {{it is also possible}} to produce dark colors (see above).|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite a compliment! Quite a compliment, I declare," [...] exclaimed the donkey, {{turning to}} look at Scraps. [...] "You are {{certainly}} a wonder, my dear, and I fancy you'd make a splendid pincushion. If you belonged to me, I'd wear <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses</b> when I looked at you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, the rascals {{planned to}} have Jasniff {{impersonate}} Mr. Borden. One of them, Geswick, exchanged coats and caps with him, and lent him a pair of <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> and he was to tie up his cheeks and pretend to be suffering from toothache, and keep to his stateroom {{as much as possible}} during the trip.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{principle}} can {{be shown}} by an early special purpose seismometer. This consisted of a large stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom. [...] As the earth starts to move, the heavy mass of the pendulum has the inertia to stay still in the non-earth frame of reference. [...] The {{result is that the}} stylus scratches a pattern corresponding with the Earth's movement. This type of strong motion seismometer recorded upon a <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> (glass with carbon soot). While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local earthquake – such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further re-analysis was performed in the 1980s using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the ship}} was {{purchased}} by Kloster in 1979 many of the original 1960s interiors were lost as rooms were either demolished within larger renovations, or redecorated to suit Caribbean cruising, {{under the direction of}} maritime architect Tage Wandborg and New York interior designer Angelo Donghia. [...] Areas that were completely remodelled included all of the Tourist Class public rooms, and their indoor promenade areas were filled with prefabricated [...] "junior suite" [...] cabins. The former Versailles dining room, now the Leeward, , the wall finish and etched glass mural remaining; however, carpeting and furniture was replaced, the open well was lined with <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> and aluminium handrails, an aluminium chandelier was placed over the two-storey space, and a spiral staircase was installed to connect the two levels. The former Salon Saint Tropez became the Norway's North Cape Lounge for cabaret and other shows; the décor more dark and muted. Further forward on the same deck, the old Café Rive Gauche was transformed into the ship's Monte Carlo casino. With the promenade windows now within cabins, no daylight penetrated to the casino, and so all windows were filled in. The Tourist Class swimming pool, its glass dome gone after the construction of the open pool deck above, was filled with neon lights and covered with a glass dance floor as part of the remodelling of the entire space into the ship's Dazzles disco.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, so {{much the}} better: it did not hurt him," [...] she said serenely. Wildeve had at present the rayless outline of the sun through <b>smoked</b> <b>glass,</b> and she could say such things as that with the {{greatest}} facility.|$|E
2500|$|The Dakin {{building}} has been nicknamed the 'Luke Skywalker' building, {{due to its}} bold appearance of bright white porcelain panels and futuristic design, seeming to embody the concept of good. To complete the metaphor a nearby, ominous looking, high-tech building is dubbed the 'Darth Vader' building, replete with its full reflective exterior of black <b>smoke</b> <b>glass,</b> emulating the impenetrable visage of the evil counterpart.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't brown now. It's bright scarlet. Good gracious, I {{ought to}} know. I've {{been looking at}} it all the afternoon. It dazzled me. If I've got to meet her again, I mean {{to go to the}} oculist's and get a pair of those <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses</b> you wear at Palm Beach." [...] Lucille brooded silently for a while over the tragedy. [...] "I don't want to say {{anything}} against her, of course." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{blinding}} {{glare of}} the sun had caused all to put on their <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> or goggles, but now, as the great orb of day was lost to sight behind the mountain tops, these protectors for the eyes were removed, that they might see their way clearer. The Alaskan twilight was creeping on them, causing all their surroundings to turn to a pale blue color. The mists of the mountains were also rising, and on every hand were weird, ghostlike shadows which enhanced this scene of wild desolation.|$|R
6000|$|... "This Perry Chumly," [...] resumed William, [...] "believed {{himself a}} born astronomer, and always kept {{a bit of}} <b>smoked</b> <b>glass.</b> He was {{particularly}} great on solar eclipses. I have known him to sit up all night looking out for one." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{soldiers}} were tramping silently up the glaring hillside. Gradually his head began to revolve, slowly, rhythmically.

6000|$|... "Yes; but there's this {{difference}} between love and smallpox, or bewitchment either--that if you detect the disease {{at an early}} stage and try change of air, there is every chance of complete escape without any further development of symptoms. And there are certain alternative doses which a man may administer to himself by keeping unpleasant consequences before his mind: this gives you a sort of <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> through which you may look at the resplendent fair one and discern her true outline; though I'm afraid, by the by, the <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> is apt to be missing just at the moment it is most wanted. I daresay, now, even a man fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an imprudent marriage, in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in the Prometheus." ...|$|E
60|$|The most {{surprised}} man was Captain Hunker, and he readily {{told his}} {{story of how}} the Englishmen had hired him to take them to Cave Island and then call for them later. When Jasniff had appeared, with the <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses</b> and the bandage on his face, he had pitied the fellow but had not paid much attention to him. When Dave had fired his gun from the shore, Geswick had explained that other fortune hunters were on the island but that they {{wanted nothing to do with}} the crowd, so the master of the Aurora had gone off without investigating.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few weeks}} the new consul arrived, {{releasing}} Keogh from his temporary duties. He {{was a young man}} fresh from college, who lived for botany alone. The consulate at Coralio gave him the opportunity to study tropical flora. He wore <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses,</b> and carried a green umbrella. He filled the cool, back porch of the consulate with plants and specimens so that space for a bottle and chair was not to be found. Keogh gazed on him sadly, but without rancour, and began to pack his gripsack. For his new plot against stagnation along the Spanish Main required of him a voyage overseas.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, he is {{honored as}} a Finnish Artist at Finlandia University, Hancock, Michigan with an exhibition: Parables of the Palace, {{based on the}} poem by Luis Borges, which {{features}} <b>smoke</b> installations, <b>glass,</b> video, painting, and sculpture.|$|R

Why should I peep at it through <b>smoked</b> <b>glass</b> to see things that don't affect me?" [...] He smiled his delight at his companion.|$|E
60|$|Day {{was shining}} radiantly upon the town then, and the bells were {{going for the}} morning work. Domestic fires were not yet lighted, and the high {{chimneys}} had the sky to themselves. Puffing out their poisonous volumes, {{they would not be}} long in hiding it; but, for half an hour, some of the many windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun eternally in eclipse, through a medium of <b>smoked</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
60|$|At ten {{thousand}} feet elevation {{the twilight of}} this clear and cold night was a rich and rare atmospheric effect. It {{looked as if it}} was seen through perfectly clear <b>smoked</b> <b>glass.</b> Objects were singularly visible, even at long range, and seemed magnified. In the west, where the afterglow of sunset lingered over the dark, ragged, spruce-speared horizon-line, there was such a transparent golden line melting into vivid star-fired blue that Helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering admiration.|$|E
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} of {{her book}} The secret of democracy, Time magazine wrote: Suzanne Labin writes with a hatpin. This young (thirtyish) French political scientist impales totalitarian myths and neutralist delusions, prods lukewarm intellectuals who rarely rise {{to the defense of}} democracy, or if they do, praise it with faint damns. Author Labin has small use for so-called thinkers who don the <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses</b> of a spurious objectivity and report that they can see no difference between Western freedom and Eastern tyranny except [...] "shades of grey." [...] She believes that it is worth restating the great central truth, or [...] "secret," [...] of democracy, i.e., that it is the first, last, best and only hope of 20th century mankind.

5000|$|Petard and her consorts {{were still}} {{involved}} in convoy escort work. On one occasion, their convoy {{was attacked by}} six Ju 87 (Stuka) dive bombers escorted by ME 109 fighters. As the Stukas {{came out of the}} sun in a near vertical dive, the four-inch high-angle guns put out a barrage, firing up to 22 rounds a minute. Egan established his style of ship-handling, lying back in his bridge chair and wearing <b>smoked</b> <b>glasses</b> (against the sun's rays), while calling out helm and speed alterations. Three dive bombers were shot down; one, which narrowly missed Queen Olga, by the accompanying Beaufighters. Ex-Leading Seaman Douglas Vowles cited Egan's commitment and skill as [...] "saving my life and that of my shipmates many times over".|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the vehicle were then transported to the green screen unit, and the {{internal}} shots of the impact were filmed with the actresses.
