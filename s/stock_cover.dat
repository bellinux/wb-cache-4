Although remote sensing {{is known as a}} useful method for mapping benthic habitat and monitoring changes at large spatial scale compared to field survey methods, it has not been attempted for quantifying seagrass C stock. A satellite-based mapping approach, applied on Landsat imagery (acquired in 2004, 2009 and 2013) and field biomass data obtained from previous studies were used for repeat mapping of above ground seagrass C for the turbid water of the Sungai Pulai estuary, Johor Straits, Malaysia.

According to the estimates, the highest mean C stock was in 2004 (90. 68 kg C/pixel) and the lowest in 2013 (18. 77 kg C/pixel) - a declining trend of seagrass cover, biomass and C stocks in the Sungai Pulai estuary.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Conservation efforts across Europe and a {{substantial}} {{lack of information}} regarding the present status of black poplar (Populus nigra L.) in Slovenia led us to conduct this research. The objectives were to determine the presence of preserved native black poplar in Slovenia, to evaluate the variation within and between two selected populations, and to evaluate the condition of these populations, which is important for enabling their long-term gene pool conservation. Material and Methods: To determine the black poplar distribution, the national database of growing stock of tree species in sub-compartments was used. Species determination was based on standard determination keys and descriptors. To assess a variation, a morphological comparison of leaves from two black poplar populations from the Sava and Mura rivers was done, {{as well as a}} comparison with a Canadian poplar (Populus ´canadensis) clone. Material for analyses was taken from 38 trees, totalling 3811 leaves. Descriptive statistics, non parametric Mann-Whitney U-tests, discriminant analysis (DA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were used for data analyses. Results and Conclusions: The existence of well preserved European black poplar populations in Slovenia was confirmed. Sub-compartments that include black poplar in the growing <b>stock</b> <b>cover</b> 51 935. 06 hectares, which represents 4. 4 % of the Slovenian forested area. Black poplar populations from the Sava and Mura sites differed significantly in morphological traits describing the lamina shape, while populations of black poplar and Canadian poplar differed mostly in petiole length and leaf apex shape. Variation within populations of black poplar was larger than between populations and variation of the Sava population was smaller than the Mura population. In the Mura population,only black poplar individuals were found, whereas 6 adult Canadian poplars of unknown origin were identified among black poplars in the Sava population. The recorded regeneration of black poplar was poor. Variation of the examined black poplar populations emphasizes the need to expand the research to other poplar populations in Slovenia and to start conservation activities as soon as possible...|$|E

A portfolio of <b>stocks</b> not <b>covered</b> in the media has on average a similar performance as a portfolio of <b>stocks</b> highly <b>covered</b> in the media. Additionally, we study the impact of media coverage on the momentum profits. We find that the momentum effect is stronger among firms highly covered by media.

It covers roughly the small-cap range of US stocks, using a capitalization-weighted index. , the market capital of companies included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index ranged from US$ 400 million to US$ 1.8 billion.
