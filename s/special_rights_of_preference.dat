50|$|When Alexander III {{ascended the}} throne in 1881, {{a process of}} making Finland a more {{integrated}} part of the empire started - many attacks {{were made in the}} Russian public on the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the Finnish people and efforts were undertaken to abolish these <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> granted to them, and by many small steps this led to the Russification of the Finnish Post.|$|R
50|$|Aboriginal peoples {{were not}} {{convinced}} {{by the white}} paper and felt that their concerns during the consultation process, such as recognition <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>rights,</b> were not addressed.

Meaningful Aboriginal participation in public policy making was also not covered in the white paper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mortgagee}} has a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference,</b> a “priority right”, where sale of {{the property}} has been levied (even {{where it has been}} levied by other creditors). Similarly, when the debtor is declared insolvent, the mortgagee is to be regarded as a preferent creditor. However, if the sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the debt, the mortgagee will rank pari passu with concurrent creditors for the deficit.|$|R
50|$|In the Forest <b>of</b> Dean <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> mineral {{extraction}} were reserved for Free Miners, but this {{had the effect}} of preventing large scale investment by external companies. However in 1808 David Mushet, a Scottish metallurgist, became involved. Thomas Halford was the owner of ironworks at Whitecliff, and he brought Mushet in {{to improve the quality of}} the iron produced there.|$|R
50|$|College Garden, to the East of Little Dean's Yard, is {{believed}} to be the oldest garden in England, under continuous cultivation for around a millennium.

5000|$|The Declaration also {{asserted}} {{the principles}} of popular sovereignty, {{in contrast to the}} divine <b>right</b> <b>of</b> kings that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, [...] "All the citizens, being equal {{in the eyes of the}} law, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents," [...] eliminating the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the nobility and clergy.|$|R
50|$|To {{create a}} real {{security}} right, the lessor must perfect the tacit hypothec by obtaining {{a court order}} which interdicts the alienation or removal of the invecta et illata, or else attaches them. Once the lessor’s hypothec has been perfected, the lessor acquires a real security right: a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> following a sale in execution of the movable property. The lessor may also prevent the lessee from removing the invecta et illata from the premises.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, professors Ted Morton and Rainer Knopff, {{in their}} criticisms of Charter case law and growing {{judicial}} discretion, treat section 35 {{as if it}} were part of the Charter.

60|$|Emma did {{not want}} to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys, and the Mrs. Coles, who would force {{themselves}} anywhere; neither could she feel any <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> herself--she submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.|$|R
25|$|However, {{during the}} 1860s, under Tsar Alexander II, {{it was decided}} that legal {{equality}} between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the higher estates of the realm were abolished, a modern parliament based on universal suffrage was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.|$|R

It proposed to assemble at five locations (initially seven, which included the Chinese-majority Low Yat Plaza) before joining the United People's Rally at Padang Merbok. The organisers of the United People's Rally, however, did not recognise nor acknowledge the presence of Himpunan Maruah Melayu.|$|R
50|$|Although TV Licensing enforces the BBC's {{statutory}} obligation {{to ensure that}} every address where a television licence is required is correctly licensed its agents have no <b>special</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> access and, like any other member of the public, rely on an implied <b>right</b> <b>of</b> access to reach the front door. A householder may withdraw the implied <b>right</b> <b>of</b> access to TV Licensing personnel by contacting the BBC and informing them that this right has been revoked; the BBC says they respect such requests (although could still seek a warrant to search the property), except in Scotland. As of March 2014, 7299 households had withdrawn the implied <b>right</b> <b>of</b> access. This figure had increased to over 20,000 by December 2015.|$|R

40|$|What is the {{relation}} between the forms of principled law-breaking that we know as civil disobedience and the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> teachers and students that comprise academic freedom? It is argued that academic freedom does not give them a right to engage in civil disobedience, not even on campus. At the same time, however, academic freedom does protect them in studying, discussing, assessing, and even recommending civil disobedience [...] even when their opinions and recommendations are misguided or wrong. The subject is discussed in light of some recent cases...|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands a <b>special</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> a full {{professor}} {{has always been}} the ius promovendi.

From 2018 onwards, the law has changed and any professor positions with a research university appointment is eligible to be main supervisor of a PhD student. Universities have agreed that only professor with shown capacity to supervise PhD projects will be granted this right.|$|R

50|$|A {{notarial}} bond is {{a limited}} real security which hypothecates movable property {{in an attempt to}} secure the bondholder’s ranking for the satisfaction of a debt. To be valid, a notarial bond must be notarially executed, and to be enforceable against third parties, it must be registered in the Deeds Registry at the bond debtor’s place of residence or registered office within three months of execution. A notarial bond can only be taken over movable property and merely grants the bondholder a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> (prior ranking) over unsecured creditors and hypothec holders at the debtor’s insolvency.|$|R
50|$|A general {{notarial}} bond, {{governed by}} the common law, applies generally to all movable property, both corporeal and incorporeal (including liquor licenses, book debts, and goodwill), in the bond debtor’s possession, which may include movables acquired after executing the bond. Despite registration in the Deeds Registry, the real <b>right</b> <b>of</b> security merely “attaches” to the bonded property and is inchoate, so that the property may be alienated {{without the consent of}} the bondholder, and the bond does not bind any third party who acquires property. That is to say the bondholder’s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> is defeated following a sale in execution; when, however, the bond debtor’s estate is sequestrated as insolvent, the bondholder’s preference is still perfectable.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{continental}} European tradition <b>of</b> author's <b>rights,</b> the law recognized moral and economic (patrimonial) <b>rights.</b> A <b>special</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the author to remuneration {{was no longer}} mentioned: it was not needed anymore since the author's rights were exclusive and authors could freely negotiate contracts. On contracts, the law provided that only the rights explicitly mentioned in a contract were transferred, and that the new rights holder could sub-license these rights to a third party only if the contract explicitly provided for this. Furthermore, contracts {{were not allowed to}} cover the future works of an author.|$|R
50|$|The Schaunbergers {{continued}} {{to claim a}} certain position for around a century. Among other things Friedrich V von Schaunberg was between 1489 and 1494 Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. With the succession of the Austrian Habsburgs to the imperial throne (Friedrich III and then Maximilian I), the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the Schaunergers were finally curtailed; in 1548 during the Reformation the Schaunbergers lost their voting rights in the Imperial Diet upon becoming Lutheran, and in 1559 the male line died out upon the death of Count Wolfgang von Schaunberg, after which the title was inherited by the Starhembergers through his sister Anna.|$|R
50|$|The Hull-Alfaro revisions, though {{hailed by}} both governments, radically altered the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the United States in the isthmus, and the United States Senate was {{reluctant}} to accept the alterations. Article X of the new treaty provided that {{in the event of}} any threat to the security of either nation, joint measures could be taken after consultation between the two. Only after an exchange of interpretative diplomatic notes had permitted Senator Key Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, to advise his colleagues that Panama was willing under this provision to permit the United States to act unilaterally, did the Senate give its consent on July 25, 1939.|$|R
50|$|In Ex parte Van Heerden, an {{important}} case in South African insolvency law, “It is necessary,” the court held, “to consider whether the surplus {{of the proceeds}} of the immovable property, after satisfying the mortgage bonds which have a preferential claim thereon, {{can be considered as}} ‘free residue’ within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act.” The definition of “free residue” must be taken to refer to that portion of an estate under sequestration when liquidated, which is not subject to any <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference.</b> In estimating the free residue in an estate, the surplus in value of immovable property over the amount of mortgage bonds thereon may be included in such estimate.|$|R
