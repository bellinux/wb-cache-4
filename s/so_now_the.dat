5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> width is about two-thirds {{what it would have}} been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E

25|$|At 19:00 AEST, Tim Mander, officiating his 2nd grand final, blew time {{on and the}} Tigers kicked off. In {{the eighth}} minute the Cowboys had almost reached the Tigers' twenty-metre line on the third tackle of the set when Payne ran from dummy-half and passed inside for Rauhihi {{to hit the ball}} up and stand in the takle, {{offloading}} to Thurston who passed to Matt Bowen. Bowen then threw a deft pass back on the inside to Justin Smith who charged toward the line and threw the ball blindly back over his head before being tackled. The loose ball was picked up by Thurtson and handed to Bowen to dash the remaining few metres to the line and touch down behind the uprights. For the third week in a row, Bowen was the first try scorer of the game. Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were leading 0-6. Ten minutes later the Tigers were down at the opposition's end of the field where halfback Scott Prince on the last tackle put up a kick that came down over the try line and was taken by Paul Bowman who was about to be tackled in goal and threw a speculative pass which was not caught by his teammate and Tigers forward Bryce Gibbs was there to fall onto the loose ball near the goal posts. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the scores were even at 6-6. Cowboys winger Ty Williams crossed the Tigers' try-line in the twenty-third minute but the video referee ruled no try due to an obstruction in back play. A few minutes later, Tigers' left winger Pat Richards (whose fractured ankle required six pain-killing injections for him to defy medical opinion and play in the match) crossed in the corner but the video referee disallowed the try as the ball was not properly grounded. In the thirty-fifth minute the Tigers received a Johnathan Thurston kick on their own try line, the ball going to Benji Marshall who ran with it, splitting the defence and charging down the left side and over the half-way line. Drawing a defender, Marshall then threw a flick pass behind his back to his winger Pat Richards coming through in support. Richards palmed off a Cowboys defender as he ran the remaining twenty metres to dive over and score, finishing {{one of the most famous}} grand final plays in history. Hodgson kicked the extra two points <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Tigers were leading 12-6. Shortly before half time the Cowboys were penalised on their twenty-metre line and Hodgson took the kick at goal but missed.|$|E

The grill was not so prominent and various options were available as a package. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> range consisted of Supreme IV, Supreme IV Express and Supreme IV GT.

2500|$|Marshall looked {{towards a}} new {{flagship}} to nail all the compromising {{of the earlier}} models, the JVM, made {{in a variety of}} models and ranges. These amps have up to four channels, each with three-foot-switchable modes, dual master volumes, reverb controls for each channel, and a foot-switchable effects loop. These features can be programmed into the standard foot-switch to be foot-switchable as [...] "patches", <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> user can switch from, say, a clean channel with a chorus in the effects loop and reverb, to a medium-gain rhythm sound with no effects, to a high-gain lead sound with boosted output volume, with one click of the foot-switch per sound. The JVM range consists of a 100-watt four-channel head, JVM 410C (2×12-inch speaker combo), a 100-watt two-channel head (JVM 210H, used by Joe Satriani for some time), JVM 210C (2×12-inch speaker combo) and 50-watt versions of these (JVM 205H (head), JVM215C (1×12-inch speaker combo) and JVM205C (2×12-inch speaker combo), respectively).|$|E
2500|$|The Rembrandt Room Now {{called the}} Chandos Delta Dormitory. Immediately {{to the east}} of the Breakfast Parlour, {{originally}} dated 1748, the room was extended and redecorated in 1775. In a relatively plain room, the painting that {{used to be in the}} centre of the ceiling, Venus at her toilet by Vincenzo Valdrè was sold in 1922 along with the marble chimneypiece with its central relief of Hebe and Jupiter's Eagle. The room once contained eleven paintings attributed to Rembrandt although only three are considered <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> <b>the</b> rest being School of Rembrandt. All the paintings were sold in 1848. They included: Samson Threatening his Father-in-law, in 1989 this was sold by the estate of the late P Chrysler Jr; Bellona now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Self-Portrait as a Young man now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; Eleazor Swalmius now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp; A Young Negro Archer and (genuine Rembrandt) The Centurion Cornelius sold for £2,300 (the highest price any of the paintings sold in 1848 fetched) both now in the Wallace Collection. Also originally in this room and now in the Wallace Collection are the almost [...] high astronomical regulator clock by Michael Stollewerck formerly at the Palace of Versailles and a Boulle armoire. Also from this room was a German marquetry cabinet, later bought by Mayer Amschel de Rothschild for Mentmore Towers. It was in this room that Queen Victoria and her husband slept during their visit, redecorated for the occasion, including the purchase of the largest Persian carpet in the country, 25.5 by , this cost £200, but only fetched £55 in the 1848 sale. The 2nd Duke spent £5,300 on redecorating the house and on entertaining the royal couple for a visit that lasted a few days.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 January, it was {{announced}} that the church had had its listing upgraded to Grade 1 status. Announcing the decision, Andrew Derrick stated:"Grade I is the right grade for St. Laurence's Church and it confirms it as a very important building. Only the two per cent most important buildings in the country are Grade I listed <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> church is in the same bracket as the most important buildings. This means that demolishing the church would be unthinkable. Any decision on moving the church will {{have to go through the}} local planning authority, but being Grade I listed will make a difference on how people view the building." [...] On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated:"The decision was simple – the church has to move if the airport is to survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go ahead, will be lost. It is not just a case of expansion. We have to comply with safety standards set down by the Civil Aviation Authority and they must be implemented. The future hinges on these plans." [...] The vicar of the church, Rev. Nigel Ransom, was delighted at the news."I was not surprised to hear from English Heritage that the church has been upgraded to a Grade I listed building. It is a unique and historic place. For more than 1,000 years the church has stood on this site undisturbed. It is shrouded in history and is truly a magnificent example of architecture. The decision by English Heritage will certainly make it more difficult for any plans to move the church. The local community is firmly against any changes and so am I." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1974 Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane {{reclaimed}} his {{ancestral home}} and moved {{with his new}} wife back into Brympton d'Evercy {{with the intention of}} restoring it and opening it to the public as a stately home. His problem was that, while the empty and neglected house may have been his home, it was far from stately. While the house was structurally in a fair condition, it had not been redecorated since the 18th century and had endured the obvious ravages caused by its use as a boys' school. The redecoration of the state rooms was executed on a very restricted budget. The principal problem facing the owners was furnishing the house. Few of its former contents remained, and while Brympton d'Evercy is not on a par with Blenheim Palace in size, it still required large items and quantities of high quality antique furniture. This was the stumbling block to the stately home scheme. The Clive-Ponsonby-Fanes made great efforts to draw in the crowds, an agricultural museum, a vineyard, a distillery of apple brandy, but none of this was interesting enough to attract visitors from as far afield as London, let alone those from across the Atlantic. Ultimately, as a financial enterprise, opening to the public failed. In 1992 after almost 300 years of ownership the family sold Brympton d'Evercy. The situation was summed up at the time by the satirist Auberon Waugh: [...] "Last week we learnt that the most beautiful house in Somerset has been sold.....it is sad of course for the family who owned it who had made a valiant effort to keep it going [...].it did not succeed as a showpiece: they had run out of money, the internal decorations were dreadful, and they lacked the proper kit {{to make it look like}} anything more than a prep school on open day. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> most beautiful house in England will be a private family home once again..".|$|E
