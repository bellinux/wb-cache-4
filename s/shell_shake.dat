5000|$|... 20 July, al-Shabaab {{attacked}} AMISOM forces {{stationed at}} the KM4 area. Witnesses reported that heavy <b>shelling</b> <b>shook</b> the city, as artillery fire hit neighborhoods around the Bakara Market. A total of 3 {{people were killed and}} 14 were injured, all of which civilians. On 21 July, the amount of displaced was said to have hit 223,000 with over 20,000 fleeing in the last 2 weeks.|$|R
50|$|Dinner {{takes place}} during a {{prolonged}} penultimate scene, with contrapuntal snippets of the Khasi's army demolishing the Residency's exterior, {{and the officers}} and ladies ignoring the devastation as they dine. <b>Shells</b> <b>shaking</b> the building and plaster falling into the soup do not interrupt dinner, even when the fakir's severed - but still talking - head is served, courtesy of the Khasi. Only Brother Belcher fails to display a stiff upper lip, and panics like a normal person. Finally, at Captain Keene's suggestion, the gentlemen walk outside to be greeted by a bloody battle being waged in the courtyard. Still dressed in black tie, Sir Sidney orders the Regiment to form a line and lift their kilts, this time exposing their (implied) lack of underwear. The invading army is terrified, and retreats at once.|$|R
6000|$|... § XXVIII. But {{the palace}} {{was not long}} {{permitted}} to remain in this finished form. Another terrific fire, commonly called the great fire, burst out in 1574, and destroyed the inner fittings and all the precious pictures of the Great Council Chamber, {{and of all the}} upper rooms on the Sea Façade, and most of those on the Rio Façade, leaving the building a mere <b>shell,</b> <b>shaken</b> and blasted by the flames. It was debated in the Great Council whether the ruin should not be thrown down, and an entirely new palace built in its stead. The opinions of all the leading architects of Venice were taken, respecting the safety of the walls, or the possibility of repairing them as they stood. These opinions, given in writing, have been preserved, and published by the Abbé Cadorin, in the work already so often referred to; and they form {{one of the most important}} series of documents connected with the Ducal Palace.|$|R
50|$|The {{seeds are}} dried {{gradually}} {{in the sun}} {{over a period of}} six to eight weeks. During this time the nutmeg shrinks away from its hard seed coat until the kernels rattle in their <b>shells</b> when <b>shaken.</b> The <b>shell</b> is then broken with a wooden club and the nutmegs are picked out. Dried nutmegs are grayish brown ovals with furrowed surfaces. The nutmegs are roughly egg-shaped, about 20 to 30 mm long and 15 to 18 mm wide, and weighing between 5 and 10 g dried.|$|R
50|$|During {{the main}} part of the ritual, the False Face members, wearing masks, go through houses in the community, driving away sickness, disease and evil spirits. The False Face members use turtle <b>shell</b> rattles, <b>shaking</b> them and rubbing them along the floors and walls. The arrival of the False Faces is heralded by another {{medicine}} society that uses masks made of corn husk. If a sick person is found, a healing ritual may be performed using tobacco and singing. The tobacco is burned, and wood ashes are blown over the sick person.|$|R
25|$|There are few {{problems}} due to gases, {{because of the}} absence of moisture in the shell, and the little gas that is still present easily escapes through the thin shell. When the metal is poured some of the resin binder burns out {{on the surface of the}} <b>shell,</b> which makes <b>shaking</b> out easy.|$|R
500|$|The range {{had grown}} too far for {{accurate}} shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port {{to close the}} range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused [...] {{to lose sight of}} Lion, which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to Queen Mary, now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal, at 16:16. Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for Queen Mary, as Derfflingers fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated {{one or both of the}} forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from <b>shells</b> breaking loose, <b>shook</b> the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.|$|R
