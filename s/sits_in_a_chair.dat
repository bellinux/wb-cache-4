5|$|Act III Le Chiffre tortures Bond {{in order}} to find out where Bond has hidden the cheque for his winnings, but Bond does not reveal where it is. After a fight between Bond and Le Chiffre's guards, Bond shoots and wounds Le Chiffre, saving Valerie in the process. Exhausted, Bond <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> {{opposite}} Le Chiffre to talk. Mathis gets in between them and Le Chiffre grabs her from behind, threatening her with a concealed razor blade. As Le Chiffre moves towards the door with Mathis as a shield, she struggles, breaking free slightly and Bond is able to shoot Le Chiffre.|$|E
25|$|The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a {{subjective}} style {{from the point}} of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{presiding}} officer <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in {{the front}} of the Senate chamber. The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less extensive than those of the Speaker of the House. The presiding officer calls on senators to speak (by the rules of the Senate, the first senator who rises is recognized); ruling on points of order (objections by senators that a rule has been breached, subject to appeal to the whole chamber); and announcing the results of votes.|$|E

25|$|As she {{approaches}} the castle, the Beast is watching her movements through {{the reflection of}} his drink. As she comes into the castle the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits {{in his chair and}} rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she is sitting on.|$|E

5000|$|The {{attribution}} and re-attribution work is ongoing. In 2005 four {{oil paintings}} previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified {{as the work}} of Rembrandt himself: Study of <b>an</b> Old Man <b>in</b> Profile and Study of an Old Man with a Beard from a US private collection, Study of a Weeping Woman, owned by the Detroit Institute of Arts, and Portrait of <b>an</b> Elderly Woman <b>in</b> <b>a</b> White Bonnet, painted in 1640. The Old Man <b>Sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chair</b> is <b>a</b> further example: <b>in</b> 2014, Professor Ernst van de Wetering offered his view to The Guardian that the demotion of the 1652 painting Old Man <b>Sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chair</b> [...] "was <b>a</b> vast mistake...it is a most important painting. The painting needs to be seen in terms of Rembrandt’s experimentation”. This was highlighted much earlier by Nigel Konstam who studied Rembrandt throughout his career.|$|R
