5|$|The decorations are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch <b>square</b> <b>piece</b> of a page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon {{with a black}} border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E

[...] Let X be {{the unit}} Cartesian square [...] , and let ~ be the equivalence relation on X defined by ∀a, b ∈ [...] ((a, 0) ~ (a, 1) ∧ (0, b) ~ (1, b)). Then the quotient space X/~ can be naturally identified (homeomorphism) with a torus: take a <b>square</b> <b>piece</b> of paper, bend and glue together {{the upper and}} lower edge to form a cylinder, then bend the resulting cylinder so as to glue together its two open ends, resulting in a torus.|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese Mei-tai ( [...] , Cantonese pronunciation) - meaning mei: {{to carry}} on the {{shoulders}} / tai: strap, band - is a square or nearly <b>square</b> <b>piece</b> of cloth with parallel unpadded straps emerging from the sides of each corner. It was traditionally secured by bringing all the straps together in a twist with the ends tucked. A variation on the traditional mei tai was popularized in Australia in the 1960s. There are now hundreds of different brands of mei tai available with a variety of features, but the longer straps, taller body and wrap-style tying method are found in almost all of them. Mei tais are suitable for front or back carries with children ranging from birth to as heavy as a parent can support.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the tower}} {{was not yet}} finished, the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard. The first bell was transported to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses, with crowds cheering its progress. During the bell's testing, it cracked beyond repair and a {{replacement}} had to be made. The bell was recast on 10 April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 13½ton (13.76-tonne) bell. This was pulled [...] up to the Clock Tower’s belfry, a feat that took 18 hours. It is [...] tall and [...] diameter. This new bell first chimed in July 1859; in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager, George Mears, the horologist Denison had used a hammer {{more than twice the}} maximum weight specified. For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired. To make the repair, a <b>square</b> <b>piece</b> of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack, and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place. Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since, and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired. Big Ben was the largest bell in the British Isles until [...] "Great Paul", a 16¾ton (17tonne) bell currently hung in St Paul's Cathedral, was cast in 1881.|$|E

After sailing the potatoes about for some time, her eye chanced to fall upon a smooth spot in the sand, which she thought would make a good place for a garden. So she determined to plant her potatoes instead of roasting them.|$|E
