2500|$|This {{initiative}} {{has been}} ongoing {{since the late}} 1990s. Software Process Improvement (SPI) has received much attention in recent years; however, {{it has been very}} difficult to translate benefits achieved in one organization to another organization. This initiative is focused on accumulating data from SPI efforts, analyzing it, generalizing and modeling the cost benefits one can achieve from SPI efforts. In 1999 DACS produced a State of the Art Report (SOAR) titled [...] "A Business Case for Software Process Improvement" [...] and revised this report in 2007 to provide new insights into the details necessary to demonstrate from a business perspective the benefits of improved <b>software</b> <b>management</b> using SPI techniques. This revised SOAR examines the business implications of some more recent SPI practices, including the Capability Maturity Model for Integration(CMMI), agile development, and systems engineering.|$|E
