40|$|Abstract — Over {{the last}} decade, {{research}} efforts {{are made in}} MANET’s (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) to develop an efficient routing based on energy consumption, time delay and also based on Quality Of Service (QOS). But many research papers concentrate with the routing and with less security or with no security. Security and Routing do not {{go hand in hand}} as security features when included with routing leads to cost factor. In our paper we have suggested theoretically to provide routing with <b>Security</b> as a <b>software</b> <b>package</b> so that we need not add extra features for security to shell out extra perks. Thus in this paper security and routing go hand in hand. Thus we conclude the paper stating that adding security to routing protocol does not affect the time delay, energy consumed and other Quality of service (QOS).

The most significant contributor to application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> project failure lies in the misalignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> While various IT control frameworks that may assist in the implementation of application <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> are available, the question arises why industry still reports that the success rate of application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implementation projects remains low. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent to which the Projects in Controlled Environment (PRINCE 2) framework assists in the alignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality provided by the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented. This study investigated whether PRINCE 2 addresses all the reasons for project failure. It identifies the shortcomings and weaknesses in PRINCE 2 which may contribute to the misalignment between the business processes of the organisation and the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented. The study recommends how these weaknesses identified in PRINCE 2 can be addressed.
