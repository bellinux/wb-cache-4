[...] In 1959 a new 'Courtelle' factory was {{constructed}} to make a proprietary acrylic fibre. [...] Both factories were substantially expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. Later the advanced form of rayon known as Tencel fibre was manufactured using a more environmentally friendly process. [...] Acrylic dope for 'Grafil' carbon fibre was also manufactured. [...] The site was sold in 1998 to Accordis UK Ltd; the Tencel plant sold to the Lenzing Group, whilst the acrylic fibre plant went through a number of administrations in the 2000s, with production ceasing 2013.|$|E

40|$|Objective This {{study has}} as {{objective}} {{to analyze the}} effect of joint immobilization of the soleus muscle of posterior members of rats on morphometric profile view, at periods of 21 and 45 days. Materials and methods Ten male Rattus novergicus albinus, Wistar variety, were used, separated into two groups (group I and II), of 5 animals each, with the first group submitted to immobilization for 21 days and the second for 45 days. The experiment control was acquired from the right contralateral member of each animal. The immobilization of the left posterior member was done by adapted orthesis. The morphometric analysis of soleus was by non-serial cross sections, 8 &# 956;m thick.

50|$|In {{core type}} {{friction}} spinning, the core, {{made of a}} filament or a bundle of <b>staple</b> <b>fibres,</b> is false twisted by the spinning drum. The sheath fibres are deposited on the false twisted core surface and are wrapped helically over the core with varying helix angles. It is believed that the false twist in the core gets removed once the yarn is emerged from the spinning drums, so that this yarn has a virtually twist-less core. However, {{it is quite possible}} for some amount of false twist to remain {{in the fact that the}} sheath entraps it during yarn formation in the spinning zone.|$|R

5000|$|Spun yarn {{is made by}} {{twisting}} <b>staple</b> <b>fibres</b> {{together to}} make a cohesive thread, or [...] "single." [...] Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic, and yarn spinning was one of the very first processes to be industrialized. Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types. Combining synthetic fibres (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere.|$|R

40|$|Five cotton cultivars were crossed in a {{complete}} diallel to study the inheritance of different polygenic traits. Genotypic differences {{were found to be}} significant (P< 0. 01) for all the characters. Adequacy tests disclosed that data of all the parameters were fully adequate for genetic analysis except bolls per plant, <b>staple</b> length, <b>fibre</b> strength, and fibre fineness, which was partially or not adequate. Additive component of genotypic variation (D) was significant and predominant for plant height, sympodia per plant, <b>staple</b> length and <b>fibre</b> strength, while dominance effects (H 1 and H 2) were main controlling factors for of monopodia per plant, number of bolls, lint percentage and seed cotton yield. More dominant genes were revealed in the parents for sympodia per plant, lint percentage and seed cotton yield. The values of H 2 / 4 H 1 demonstrated asymmetrical and unequal distribution of dominant genes in the parents for all characters. Plant height, sympodia per plant, <b>staple</b> length and <b>fibre</b> strength exhibited high narrow sense heritability (h 2 n. s) due to the presence of additive gene action, whereas, monopodia per plant, number of bolls, lint percentage and seed cotton yield possessed low heritability.
