40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence from case reports that synaesthesia {{is more common}} in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Further, genes related to synaesthesia have also been found to be linked to ASC and, similar to synaesthetes, individuals with ASC show altered brain connectivity and unusual brain activation during sensory processing. However, up to now a systematic investigation of whether synaesthesia {{is more common in}} ASC patients is missing. The aim of the current pilot study was to test this hypothesis by investigating a group of patients diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (AS) using questionnaires and <b>standard</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>tests</b> in order to classify them as grapheme-colour synaesthetes. The results indicate that there are indeed many more grapheme-colour synaesthetes among AS patients. This finding is discussed in relation to different theories regarding the development of synaesthesia as well as altered sensory processing in autism...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review of freshwater (model) ecosystem studies with neurotoxic insecticides {{was performed to}} assess ecological threshold levels, to compare these levels with the first tier approach within European Union (EU) administration procedures, and to evaluate the ecological consequences of exceeding these thresholds. Studies published between 1980 and 2001 were reviewed. Most studies covered organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids in lentic waters. The most sensitive taxa were representatives of crustaceans, insects and fish. Based on toxic units, threshold values were equivalent for compounds with a similar mode of action. This also accounted for the nature and magnitude of direct effects at higher concentrations. Although laboratory single species toxicity tests may not allow predictions on precise ecological effects, some generalisations on effects and recovery {{can be made with}} respect to acute standard laboratory EC 50 data. The NOECecosystem usually is a factor of 10 or more higher than first tier acceptable concentrations, particularly in the case of single applications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Acceptable concentrations, as set by the EU first tier approach, appear to be protective. Recovery of sensitive endpoints usually occurs within 2 months of the (last) application when peak concentrations remain lower than (0. 1 – 1) × EC 50 of the most sensitive <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> species. The <b>consistency</b> of response patterns found in model ecosystem studies can be useful when estimating the ecological risks of pesticides.

40|$|We {{consider}} the following problem. A structural equation of interest contains two sets of explanatory variables which economic theory predicts may be endogenous. The researcher is interesting in testing the exogeneity of only one of them. <b>Standard</b> exogeneity <b>tests</b> are in general unreliable from the view point of size control to assess such a problem. We develop four alternative tests {{to address this issue}} in a convenient way. We provide a characterization of their distributions under both the null hypothesis (level) and the alternative hypothesis (power), with or without identification. We show that the usual 2 critical values are still applicable even when identification is weak. So, all proposed tests can be described as robust to weak instruments. We also show that <b>test</b> <b>consistency</b> may still hold even if the overall identification fails, provided partial identification is satisfied. We present a Monte Carlo experiment which confirms our theory. We illustrate our theory with the widely considered returns to education example. The results underscore: (1) how the use of <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> to assess partial exogeneity hypotheses may be misleading, and (2) the relevance of using our procedures when checking for partial exogeneity...|$|R

Varied percentage of bamboo leaf ash at 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % replaced cement in 1 : 2 : 4 concrete mix. Sieve analysis of the BLA, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate were carried out. The workability of the mix was determined through slump; <b>standard</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>test</b> was carried on the cement and BLA at a replacement level of 5 % to determine the strength and soundness of the cement in comparison with BLA.

40|$|Most of {{the problem}} faced by {{geotechnical}} engineers is when a given site does not have suitable engineering properties to support structures, roads and foundation. The soil of the site may be weak due to various reasons. A difficult problem in work exists when the soil {{is found to be}} clay or the water table in that region is high. Soils with high clay content generally have low shear strength and has tendency to swell when their moisture content is allowed to increase. For these reasons clayey soil is not suited for structures, roads and foundation. Engineering properties of clayey soil can be improved by adopting different methods of soil stabilization. Many stabilization methods are in practice for altering the engineering properties of the clayey soil. Common methods for stabilization of clayey soil are lime and cement stabilization. Soil can also be stabilized by chemical stabilization as well as physical stabilization. Physical stabilization includes dynamic compaction and chemical stabilization is done by using chemically active materials such as lime, fly ash, Portland cement, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium silicate, magnesium chloride or materials having elastic properties such as bitumen. Calcium chloride is the ionic compound of calcium and chloride. A recent study shows that calcium chloride can be effectively dissolves in water quickly and provide enough calcium ions for exchange ionic reactions with clayey soil. Function of this chemical (calcium chloride) is to form into cluster of fine particles and bind them together. Calcium chloride dosage is added in 0. 5 % to 3. 0 % by weight of soil with 0. 5 % of increment in each dosage. <b>Standard</b> proctor <b>test,</b> CBR, <b>consistency</b> limits <b>test</b> and UCS test are performed to determine the optimum dosage of calcium chloride...|$|R
