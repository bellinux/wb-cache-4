60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{held out}} her hand. She {{distinctly}} pressed his.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> a rapid glance {{passed between}} her and the Count.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{great change}} come over her lately. <b>She</b> <b>laughs</b> <b>and</b> jokes like a girl, {{and from her}} talk I gather she's here real often." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} On Her Majesty's Secret Service, James Bond removes his kilt to seduce Ruby Bartlett. As it {{falls to the}} floor, <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> <b>and</b> cries out, [...] "It's true!".|$|R
6000|$|CANDIDA (delighted). He {{is always}} right. He {{understand}}s you; he understands me; he understands Prossy; and you, James--you understand nothing. (<b>She</b> <b>laughs,</b> <b>and</b> kisses him to console him. He recoils as if stung, and springs up.) ...|$|R
60|$|And jumping {{down without}} my assistance, <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{disappeared}} into the house.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{shook her}} head, {{and held her}} hands up for inspection.|$|E
60|$|And again <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{simulated}} a vain {{attempt to}} escape his bearlike arms.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> good-humoredly, <b>and</b> {{her father}} sauntered up to them.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> remonstrates, <b>laughing,</b> <b>and</b> is a childish schoolgirl again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> mockingly, <b>and</b> {{shook her}} hair {{like a wild}} young colt.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> {{this time}} it was naturally, and without the least restraint.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{clapped her}} hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{drew him}} {{down so that}} she could whisper in his ear.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> loud <b>and</b> long, {{as though}} the idea tickled her fancy amazingly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> gently, <b>and</b> {{raised her}} eyes to the green roof of the needles.|$|R
60|$|Ursula <b>laughed.</b> <b>She</b> was frightened, <b>and</b> {{when she}} was frightened <b>she</b> always <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> pretended to be jaunty.|$|R
60|$|Then first <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> next {{looked as}} though she were going to cry.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> held me down; for I made {{a motion}} to leave my chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> {{her white}} teeth made him ready {{to fall down}} and worship her.|$|E
60|$|To this sally <b>she</b> merely <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> pressed out her half-smoked cigarette.|$|R
60|$|His words, {{necessarily}} commonplace, dissolved the situation. <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> softly, <b>and</b> came {{further into}} the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy {{women like}} deference," [...] Pierre Leroux said. [...] "She {{is a good}} comrade with us all, <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> <b>and</b> jokes with us {{as if she were}} one of ourselves. Now the American very seldom <b>laughs</b> <b>and</b> never jokes. He treats {{her as if she were}} a duchess and takes her {{altogether}} seriously. I believe he would be capable of marrying her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> {{jumping to}} the ground, {{sat down at}} my side on the grass.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> {{moved her}} parasol a little {{so that she}} could see him better.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> then {{burst out}} sobbing with loud tears, and hid her face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> softly <b>and</b> {{glanced at}} me. By {{this time we}} were all three under the branches.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} {{half an hour}} later, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> playing sweetly {{with her}} babe.|$|R
60|$|Alvina {{did more}} than smile. <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> outright. <b>And</b> yet <b>she</b> {{remained}} good friends with the odd little man.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> {{withdrew from}} the {{aperture}} through which she had held the parley.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{shook her}} head as I opened the chart-house door for her to pass.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} she looked serious, then <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> again put on a demure air.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] said Mr. Woolsey to his ally, Crump, as {{they sat}} {{together}} after the retirement of the ladies. [...] "She was dumb all night. <b>She</b> never once <b>laughed</b> at the farce, nor cried at the tragedy, <b>and</b> you know <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> <b>and</b> cries uncommon. <b>She</b> only took half her negus, and not above a quarter of her beer." ...|$|R
