5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. The {{dead and wounded}} of Grant's army lay {{in the heat of}} Mississippi <b>summer,</b> <b>the</b> odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
5|$|After 1860 handcarts were {{no longer}} used.

5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in <b>summer.</b> <b>The</b> species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the disaster, new safety {{legislation}} was proposed. The local economy declined because the factory was closed down.

Some victims filed legal suits for damages against the owner and the company hired to clean up the refinery.

5|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} the influx of visitors during the <b>summer.</b> <b>The</b> High Street {{has a variety of}} shops and services, and there are a small number of factories. The elderly population has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes.

5|$|As a young man, Thomas Jefferson read many books, {{including}} Paradise Lost, Tristram Shandy and the Life of Johnson. John {{taught his}} son Greek and Latin.

5|$|Common {{trees are}} oaks, willows and alders, which {{tolerate}} wet soils.

Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France.

5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of <b>summer.</b> <b>The</b> images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
5|$|During 2009 and 2010, {{work was}} {{undertaken}} to upgrade sluice gates, watercourses, and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor {{during the winter}} diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor.

5|$|During the <b>summer,</b> <b>the</b> American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded.

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early <b>summer,</b> <b>the</b> small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
