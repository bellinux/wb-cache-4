5|$|From 12 to 14 September 2013, {{details of}} the Framework were {{negotiated}} at the InterContinental Hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. High-level negotiations were held between Kerry and Lavrov, with large teams of experts simultaneously working on technical details. A key breakthrough was reported to occur when the U.S. and Russia agreed on their approximations of the Syrian chemical weapon stockpile (estimated at 1,000 tons of <b>sarin,</b> mustard agent and VX nerve agent). On 14 September 2013 the Framework was agreed and signed.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, {{the head}} of OPCW, Ahmet Üzümcü, {{announced}} in The Hague that the last of Syria's declared chemical weapons had been shipped {{out of the country}} for destruction. The last 8% of the chemical stockpile was loaded onto ships at Latakia. The most toxic chemicals, including <b>sarin</b> precursors and sulphur mustard, were destroyed by 18 August aboard the US naval vessel MV Cape Ray. The remaining were destroyed in the US, Great Britain and Finland. On 4 January 2015, the OPCW confirmed that the destruction was completed.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as <b>sarin,</b> VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of <b>sarin</b> and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|At Rahul Arora's (Samir Soni) fashion show, Meghna meets supermodel Shonali Gujral (Kangana Ranaut) and is {{ridiculed}} by the show's choreographer, Christine, {{and told}} to have her portfolio photographed by Kartik (Rohit Roy). To afford Kartik's fees, Meghna shoots a lingerie advertisement; she is mentored by another aspiring model, Janet (Mugdha Godse). Meghna's lingerie photos appear {{on the cover of}} a magazine; her relatives in Mumbai see the cover and ask her to leave the house. She moves into an apartment with Maanav. Meghna is noticed by Anisha Roy (Kitu Gidwani), an executive at Panache, a major modeling agency. Anisha introduces her to her superior, Abhijit <b>Sarin</b> (Arbaaz Khan), who is impressed by Meghna's ambition and confidence. Panache's top model is Shonali, but her drug abuse becomes problematic. Abhijit includes Meghna in a fashion show organised by Vinay Khosla, but is replaced after a misunderstanding. Abhijit consoles her, and decides to replace Shonali with Meghna as Panache's new top model.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August 2013, rockets {{containing}} the chemical agent <b>sarin</b> struck several opposition-controlled or disputed {{areas of the}} Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, resulting {{in the death of}} more than 300 people and injury to thousands in the Ghouta chemical attack. The United States and other Western countries blamed the Syrian government for the attacks, while Syria blamed civil war opposition forces. In response to Ghouta, a coalition of countries led by the United States and France, which support the rebels, threatened air strikes on Syria. Russia, a key ally of Syria, along with China had earlier blocked efforts by the United States, France, and the UK to secure United Nations Security Council approval for military intervention. The United States and France headed a coalition of countries on the verge of carrying out air strikes on Syria.|$|E
25|$|Each of the CAIS held {{between one}} and five {{different}} chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were phosgene, adamsite, lewisite, cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, <b>sarin,</b> nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin. In addition, triphosgene, a phosgene simulant, and ethyl malonate, a tabun simulant were also used. <b>Sarin</b> was the only nerve agent used in CAIS.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1993, {{the cult}} started {{secretly}} manufacturing the nerve agent <b>sarin</b> and later VX gas. They also attempted to manufacture 1,000 automatic rifles but only managed to make one. Aum tested its <b>sarin</b> on sheep at Banjawarn Station, a remote pastoral property in Western Australia, killing 29 sheep. Both <b>sarin</b> and VX were then used in several assassinations (and attempts) over 1994–95. In December 1994 and January 1995, Masami Tsuchiya of Aum Shinrikyo synthesized 100 to 200grams of VX which was used to attack three persons. Two persons were injured and a 28-year-old man died, who {{is believed to be}} the first fully documented victim of VX.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 27 June 1994, the cult carried out a {{chemical}} weapons attack against civilians when they released <b>sarin</b> in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto, Nagano. With {{the help of a}} converted refrigerator truck, members of the cult released a cloud of <b>sarin</b> which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted to go against the cult. This Matsumoto incident killed eight and harmed 500 more. Police investigations focused only on an innocent local resident, Yoshiyuki Kouno, and failed to implicate the cult at the time. It was only after the Tokyo subway attack that Aum Shinrikyo was discovered to be behind the Matsumoto <b>sarin</b> attack.|$|E
25|$|Although pure tabun is clear, less-pure tabun may be brown. It is a {{volatile}} chemical, although less so than either <b>sarin</b> or soman.|$|E
25|$|The key to mycoremediation is {{determining}} the right fungal species to target a specific pollutant. Certain strains {{have also been}} reported to successfully degrade the nerve gases VX and <b>sarin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The M34 {{cluster bomb}} {{was the first}} mass-produced United States Army weapon meant to deliver the {{chemical}} agent <b>sarin</b> (GB). A large stockpile of M34s was destroyed between 1973 and 1976.|$|E
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 to 1988, Iraq {{employed}} {{quantities of}} chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although {{the most commonly used}} agents were mustard gas and <b>sarin,</b> tabun and cyclosarin were also used.|$|E
25|$|The M125 bomblet was a U.S. {{chemical}} sub-munition {{designed to}} deliver the nerve agent <b>sarin.</b> It was brought into service in 1954 with the M34 cluster bomb {{as part of the}} first U.S. air-delivered nerve agent weapon.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 March 1995, Aum members {{released}} <b>sarin</b> in a coordinated attack on five trains in the Tokyo subway system, killing 13 commuters, seriously injuring 54 and affecting 980 more. Some estimates claim as many as 6,000 people were injured by the <b>sarin.</b> It is difficult to obtain exact numbers since many victims are reluctant to come forward. Prosecutors allege that Asahara was tipped off about planned police raids on cult facilities by an insider, and ordered an attack in central Tokyo to divert police {{attention away from the}} group. The attack evidently backfired, and police conducted huge simultaneous raids on cult compounds across the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} diazepam {{can help in}} the treatment of seizures due to a drug overdose or chemical toxicity as a result of exposure to <b>sarin,</b> VX, or soman (or other organophosphate poisons), lindane, chloroquine, physostigmine, or pyrethroids.|$|E
25|$|One year later, in {{the early}} hours of 21 August 2013, two opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs around Damascus, Syria were struck by rockets {{containing}} the chemical agent <b>sarin.</b> The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the Iran–Iraq War.|$|E
25|$|The US {{once had}} a tabun {{production}} program, which ended many decades ago. Like the other Allied governments, the Soviets soon abandoned Tabun (GA) for <b>Sarin</b> (GB) and Soman (GD). Large quantities of the German-manufactured agent were dumped into the sea to neutralize the substance.|$|E
25|$|As the United States Army Chemical Corps focused {{its efforts}} on the weaponization of <b>sarin</b> nerve agent (GB) during the 1950s the M34 cluster bomb was the first such weapon mass-produced by the Army. The weapon was the United States' first major nerve agent weapon after World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, over 20 {{servicemen}} (23 U.S. {{soldiers and}} one U.S. civilian, according to other reports) {{were exposed to}} low levels of the nerve agent <b>sarin</b> while sandblasting and repainting storage containers. The resultant publicity appears to {{have contributed to the}} decision to move the weapons off Okinawa.|$|E
25|$|In June, an {{individual}} unrelated to Aum launched a copycat attack by hijacking All Nippon Airways Flight 857, a Boeing 747 bound for Hakodate from Tokyo. The hijacker {{claimed to be}} an Aum member in possession of <b>sarin</b> and plastic explosives, but these claims were ultimately found to be false.|$|E
25|$|The VX victim, whom Shoko Asahara had {{suspected}} was a spy, was attacked at 7a.m. on 12 December 1994, {{on the street}} in Osaka by Tomomitsu Niimi and another Aum member, who sprinkled the nerve agent on his neck. He chased them for about 100 yards (90 metres) before collapsing, dying 10 days later without coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an organophosphate pesticide. But {{the cause of death was}} pinned down only after cult members arrested for the subway attack in Tokyo in March 1995 confessed to the killing. Ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid, and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio) ethylamine were later found in the body of the victim. Unlike the cases for <b>sarin</b> (Matsumoto incident and <b>Sarin</b> gas attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to <b>sarin</b> {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this <b>sarin</b> mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B was produced as an incapacitating agent.|$|E
25|$|According to {{politician}} Kōichi Hamada, Ishihara gave {{financial and}} political support to Aum Shinrikyo, a religious cult that {{was involved in}} several murders and assassination attempts during the early 1990s. Immediately after the <b>Sarin</b> gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, Ishihara dropped out of national politics, suddenly ending a 25-year career in the Diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as <b>sarin</b> by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than <b>sarin.</b> Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|As a playwright, he {{has been}} awarded several accolades such as the Fifteenth Kinokuniya Drama Award in 1990 and the Kishida Prize for Drama in 1991 for Breathless (ブレスレス Buresuresu, 1990). This play focuses {{on the issue of}} Tokyo’s garbage {{disposal}} problem and the events of the 1995 Subway <b>Sarin</b> Incident. His works have also been published and translated in over 10 languages.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1995 <b>sarin</b> gas attack on a Tokyo subway and the growing concern about a {{terrorist}} chemical attack, the U.S. Congress passed laws to implement a program to train civilian agencies on responding to incidents involving chemical agents. Further, U.S. Army Reserve Chemical units began fielding equipment and training Soldiers to perform mass casualty decontamination operations.|$|E
25|$|Since executions resumed in 1993, a rise {{in street}} crime during the 1990s, the <b>sarin</b> gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995 and several {{high-profile}} murders have hardened attitudes amongst {{the public and the}} judiciary. Since 1999, there have been a series of cases in which criminals sentenced to life imprisonment have been given the death penalty after prosecutors successfully appealed to High courts.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2004, {{the mastermind}} of the <b>Sarin</b> gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Shoko Asahara, was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. On 25 December 2006, serial killer Hiroaki Hidaka and three others were hanged in Japan. Hanging is the common method of {{execution}} in capital punishment cases in Japan, as in the cases of Norio Nagayama, Mamoru Takuma, and Tsutomu Miyazaki.|$|E
25|$|In both Axis and Allied nations, {{children}} in school were taught to wear gas masks in case of gas attack. Germany developed the poison gases tabun, <b>sarin,</b> and soman during the war, and used Zyklon B in their extermination camps. Neither Germany nor the Allied nations used any of their war gases in combat, despite maintaining large stockpiles and occasional calls for their use. Poison gas {{played an important role}} in the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Tabun {{is the first of}} the G-series nerve agents along with GB (<b>sarin),</b> GD (soman) and GF (cyclosarin).|$|E
25|$|In May 1995, in {{the early}} stages of {{investigations}} into the <b>sarin</b> gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Melton, fellow scholar James R. Lewis and religious freedom lawyer Barry Fisher flew to Japan to voice concern that police behaviour, including mass detentions without charge and the removal of practitioners' children from the group, might be infringing the civil rights of Aum Shinrikyo members. They had travelled to Japan at the invitation and expense of Aum Shinrikyo after they had contacted the group to express concern over developments, and met with officials over a period of three days. While not having been given access to the group's chemical laboratories, they held press conferences in Japan stating their belief, based on the documentation they had been given by the group, that the group did not have the ability to produce <b>sarin</b> and was being scapegoated. Melton revised his judgment shortly after, concluding that the group had in fact been responsible for the attack and other crimes. Some felt that the scholars' defense of Aum Shinrikyo led to a crisis of confidence in religious scholarship when the group's culpability was proven.|$|E
25|$|A <b>sarin</b> gas attack {{occurred}} in Syria, near Damascus, on 21 August 2013. The attack {{is alleged to}} have been carried out by the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad according to French and United States' government's intelligence. However, Russia, one of the Syrian government's international supporters, seems unconvinced of the origins of the attack. The attack has led to increased international pressure on the Assad government and threat of international military intervention in Syria led by United States armed forces.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} week, the full scale of Aum's {{activities}} was revealed {{for the first}} time. At the cult's headquarters in Kamikuishiki on the foot of Mount Fuji, police found explosives, chemical weapons, and a Russian Mil Mi-17 military helicopter. While the finding of biological warfare agents such as anthrax and Ebola cultures was reported, those claims now {{appear to have been}} widely exaggerated. There were stockpiles of chemicals {{that could be used for}} producing enough <b>sarin</b> to kill four million people.|$|E
25|$|The PSB {{had been}} mobilized to {{investigate}} all Aum Shinrikyo facilities after the deadly <b>sarin</b> gas {{attack on the}} Tokyo subway. Following the discovery of an Aum cultist who had been employed by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces after sensitive military information had been leaked out, the PSB had investigated the matter. The PSB had been the leading agency to investigate reports that Aum Shinrikyo had acquired names of 3,000 Honda executives and sensitive data from government ministries and other important facilities via Aum-created software.|$|E
