40|$|ABSTRACT Urinary {{excretion}} of thioether before <b>starting</b> <b>work</b> and in {{the early}} work period in a rubber factory was measured in urine samples collected after one, two to four, and five or more months of <b>starting</b> <b>work.</b> The study population consisted of 84 new workers. The urinary excretion of thioether decreased after one month's exposure and increased thereafter up to five months. Measurement of urinary thioethers in groups of new workers is therefore informative of exposure to alkylating agents only after several months from <b>starting</b> <b>work.</b> This effect may be mediated by the induction of the pertinent metabolic pathway...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} employment in childhood on self reported health in adulthood Design Cross sectional household survey, with households selected through two stage sampling. Setting Urban and rural areas in the Northeast and Southeast of Brazil Subjects 4940 individuals, aged between 18 and 65 Main outcome measure Self reported health. Results There has been a marked reduction in the proportion of people <b>starting</b> <b>work</b> during childhood although, even in the youngest age group, nearly 20 % of males began work when under 10. Early entrance into the labour market is strongly associated with low levels of both education and income, with income differentials remaining at later ages. Age <b>starting</b> <b>work</b> is also linked to current household income, with approximately 35 % of those <b>starting</b> <b>work</b> when 15 or over currently in the top quartile of household income, compared with 12 % of those <b>starting</b> <b>work</b> when unde...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies <b>started</b> <b>work</b> on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
