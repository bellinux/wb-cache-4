25|$|In {{terms of}} gait, while walking at a {{constant}} speed of 4km/h {{for a few minutes}} until a steady state is reached, relative to non-scoliotic people, idiopathic scoliotic people have a frontal (i.e. coronal) pelvis, hip, and shoulder, transversal hip and sagittal knee motion restriction. The step length is reduced and the <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> duration is also reduced.|$|E
25|$|During {{the motion}} of walking, an upward {{movement}} of the pelvis, one side then the other, is required to let the leg follow through. The faster or longer each step the pelvis adjusts accordingly. The flexibility within the knees, ankles and hips are stabilized by the pelvis. Normal gait tends to minimize displacement of centre of gravity whereas abnormal gait through pelvic instability tends to amplify displacement. During pregnancy {{there may be an}} increased demand placed on hip abductor, hip extensor, and ankle plantar flexor muscles during walking. To avoid pain on weight bearing structures a very short <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> and limp occurs on the injured side(s), this is called Antalgic Gait.|$|E
500|$|To resolve {{questions}} about the blades, Pistorius was asked {{to take part in}} a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius [...] "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear." [...] The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology, but later researchers stated that the analysis [...] "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "take-off" [...] {{begins when}} the forelegs leave {{the ground and}} is {{completed}} when the hindlegs leave the ground. Once the horse leaves the ground, {{he is unable to}} influence the trajectory that his center of mass follows through the air, which makes take-off the most critical phase of the jumping process. Most of the energy required to clear an obstacle is produced by the hind legs. The longer the hindlegs are in contact with the ground, the greater their capacity for producing power; the further forward the hindlegs are placed under the body, closer to the obsctacle, the longer this <b>stance</b> <b>phase.</b> Power is produced by the compression of the hindleg, which flexes at the hip, stifle, hock, and fetlock, and then releases energy like a spring.|$|E
2500|$|The key {{variables}} for gait are the duty factor and the forelimb-hindlimb phase relationship.

[...] Duty factors over 50% are considered a [...] "walk", while those less than 50% are considered a run. Forelimb-hindlimb phase is the temporal relationship between the limb pairs. [...] If the same-side forelimbs and hindlimbs initiate <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> at the same time, the phase is 0 (or 100%).

40|$|Walking {{is a key}} motor {{behaviour}} of limbed animals, executed by contraction of functionally antagonistic muscle groups during swing and <b>stance</b> <b>phases.</b> Nevertheless, neuronal circuits regulating the activation of antagonistic extensor-flexor muscles remain poorly understood. Here we use monosynaptically restricted trans-synaptic viruses to elucidate premotor anatomical substrates for extensor-flexor control in mice. We observe a medio-lateral spatial segregation between extensor and flexor premotor interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord. These premotor interneuron populations are derived from common progenitor domains, but segregate by timing of neurogenesis. We find that proprioceptive sensory feedback from the periphery is targeted to medial extensor premotor populations and is required for extensor-specific connectivity profiles during development. Our findings provide evidence for a discriminating anatomical basis of antagonistic circuits {{at the level of}} premotor interneurons, and point to synaptic input and developmental ontogeny as key factors in the establishment of circuits regulating {{motor behaviour}}al dichotomy...|$|R

40|$|The {{spring-loaded}} inverted pendulum (SLIP) is a simple, passivelyelastic two-degree-of-freedom {{model for}} legged locomotion {{that describes the}} center-of-mass dynamics of many animal species and some legged robots. Conventionally, SLIP models employ a single support leg during stance and, while they can exhibit stable steady gaits when motions are confined to the sagittal plane, threedimensional gaits are unstable to lateral toppling. In this paper it is shown that multiple stance legs can confer stability. Three SLIPinspired models are studied: a passive bipedal kangaroo-hopper, an actuated insect model, and passive and actuated versions of a hexapedal robot model.

50|$|The {{function}} of the lower-limbs during walking is to support the whole-body against gravitational forces while generating movement patterns which progress the body forward. Walking is an activity that is primarily confined to the sagittal plane, which is also described as the plane of progression. During one gait cycle, {{there are two major}} phases: stance and swing. In a healthy individual walking at a normal walking speed, <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> makes up approximately 60% of one gait cycle and swing makes up the remaining 40%. The lower-limbs are only in contact with the ground during <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> which is typically subdivided into 5 events: heel contact, foot flat, mid-stance, heel off, and toe off. The majority of <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> (~40%) takes place in single-limb support where one limb is in contact with the ground and the contralateral limb is in swing phase. During this time interval, the lower-limb must support constant changes in alignment of body weight while propelling forward. The hip, knee, and ankle joints move through cyclical kinematic patterns that are controlled by muscles which cross these joints. As postural changes occur, the body adapts by motor tuning an efficient muscular pattern that will accomplish the necessary kinematics required to walk.|$|E

It can be divided into two phases: <b>stance</b> <b>phase</b> and swing phase. [...] <b>Stance</b> <b>phase</b> consists of the time during which the heel strikes the ground to the point in time at which the toe leaves the ground.

40|$|Objective: Claudication is {{the most}} common manifestation of {{peripheral}} arterial disease, producing significant ambulatory compromise. Our study evaluated patients with bilateral lower limb claudication and characterized their gait abnormality based on advanced biomechanical analysis using joint torques and powers. Methods: Twenty patients with bilateral claudication (10 with isolated aortoiliac disease and 10 with combined aortoiliac and femoropopliteal disease) and 16 matched controls ambulated on a walkway while 3 -dimensional biomechanical data were collected. Patients walked before and after onset of claudication pain. Joint torques and powers at early, mid, and late stance for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were calculated for claudicating patients before and after the onset of claudication pain and were compared to controls. Results: Claudicating patients exhibited significantly reduced hip and knee power at early <b>stance</b> (weight-acceptance <b>phase)</b> due to decreased torques produced by the hip and knee extensors. In mid <b>stance</b> (single-limb support <b>phase),</b> patients had significantly reduced knee and hip power due to the decreased torques produced by the knee extensors and the hip flexors. In late <b>stance</b> (propulsion <b>phase),</b> reduced propulsion was noted with significant reduction in ankle plantar flexor torques and power. These differences were present before and after the onset of pain, with certain parameters worsening in association with pain. Conclusions: The gait of claudication is characterized by failure of specific and identifiable muscle groups needed to perform normal walking (weight acceptance, single-limb support, and propulsion). Parameters of gait are abnormal with the first steps taken, in the absence of pain, and certain of these parameters worsen after the onset of claudication pain...|$|R
