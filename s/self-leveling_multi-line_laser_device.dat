The purpose of this feasibility {{study was to examine the}} ease and accuracy of a <b>laser</b> <b>device</b> for measuring height in children and adults. Findings: In immediate succession, participant height was measured in triplicate using a stadiometer followed by the <b>laser</b> <b>device.</b> Measurement error for the <b>laser</b> <b>device</b> was significantly higher than that for the stadiometer (0. 35 and 0. 20 cm respectively). However, the measurement techniques were highly correlated (r 2 = 0. 998 and 0. 990 for the younger [< 12 y, n = 25] and older [≥ 12 y, n = 100] participants respectively), and the estimated reliability between measurement techniques was 0. 999 (ICC; 95 % CI: 0. 998, 1. 000) and 0. 995 (ICC; 95 % CI: 0. 993, 0. 997) for the younger and older groups respectively.
