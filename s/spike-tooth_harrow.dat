40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effectiveness of four methods of incorporating the herbicide trifluralin into the soil, and to determine the interaction between depth of incorporation of trifluralin and depth of weed seed germination. Field experiments on green and dry peas were established in Oregon and Idaho. Trifluralin, applied at four rates, was incorporated by a rototiller, tine-tooth harrow, <b>spike-tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> or double-disked, prior to planting. At time of harvest, yields were taken and plots were evaluated for weed control. On dry peas, only the tine-tooth harrow gave unsatisfactory incorporation of trifluralin. Increasing the rate of trifluralin, regardless of the method of incorporation, reduced the yield of dry peas, indicating injury. On green peas, both the double-disk and rototiller satisfactorily incorporated trifluralin. However, yields from the rototiller plots were slightly less than those from the disk plots. No injury was noted with increasing rates of trifluralin. Greenhouse experiments were conducted at Corvallis to determine the effect of increasing the depth of incorporation and depth of weed seed germination on the herbicidal activity of trifluralin. Trifluralin, applied at three rates, was incorporated to four depths and planted at three depths to pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.). Pigweed was not affected when planted below the trifluralin-treated zone. Only pigweed plants whose roots grew into the trifluralin were controlled. Shoot uptake appeared to be more effective than root uptake by barn-yardgrass. When trifluralin was incorporated over 1. 5 inches, weed control was reduced, indicating a dilution effect. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the weed species to be controlled will be of major importance when determining the depth and method of incorporation of trifluralin...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} wild oats (Avena Jatua L.) in Alaskan spring-planted barley was {{investigated}} {{in a series of}} experiments conducted from 1981 - 1984. Rates and times of applications of triallate (a preemergence, soil-incorporated herbicide), diclofop, barban, and difenzoquat (postemergence herbicides) were investigated in relation to control of wild oats and barley yield in 1981 - 1982. Because of very high wild oats populations. none of the herbicides controlled wild oats to the point ofÂ· allowing a barley harvest. [...] Generally, wild oats were best controlled when herbicides were applied at an early growth stage and at the highest application rates. Control of wild oats with triallate was the same whether incorporated using parallel or perpendicular passes of a <b>spike-tooth</b> <b>harrow.</b> In 1983 - 84 both single herbicide treatments and combinations of herbicides were studied. Barban, diclofop, and difenzoquat were applied alone or with triallate applied in the fall or spring in emulsifiable concentrate or granular formulation. Wild oats population levels were lower in these 2 years, and applications of even single herbicides provided good wild oats control. [...] Of the individual herbicides, diclofop provided the best control of wild oats. In general, when triallate was applied in conjunction with diclofop, barban, or difenzoquat, control of wild oats was better and higher barley yields were obtained than when a single wild oats herbicide was applied. When triallate was applied in the fall, the granular formulation provided better control of wild oats than the emulsifiable formulation. In a study of the response of eight barley varieties ('Eero', 'Paavo', 'Galt', 'Otra', 'Otal', 'Datal', 'Udal', 'Weal') to high rates and late times of application of the four herbicides, none of the varieties were differentially susceptible. Diclofop decreased heights of all varieties and decreased test weights...|$|E
40|$|The area {{devoted to}} growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) in the {{province}} of Granma, Cuba, accounted for nearly 2600 ha in the year 1997, which represented the 4 % of the total tobacco plantation area on the island in that year. Tobacco is tillage-intensive since traditional production systems entail seven or eight cultivation operations before transplanting. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate two alternative tillage systems in comparison with conventional tillage for tobacco production with the aim to improve soil conditions, reduce the number of tillage operations for soil preparation for transplanting, and increase yields. The treatments studied were: (T 1) conventional or traditional tillage, (T 2) reduced tillage with a multi-tiller plough, and (T 3) reduced tillage with a chisel plough. T 1 consisted in disc ploughing twice and disc harrowing twice for primary tillage, while before transplanting plots were ploughed twice with a horse-drawn mouldboard plough and harrowed twice with a horse-drawn <b>spike-tooth</b> <b>harrow.</b> In T 2 primary tillage was accomplished with two passes with the multi-tiller followed by disc harrowing twice before transplanting. In T 3 chisel ploughing was substituted for multi-tiller ploughing. The two reduced tillage systems improved the physical conditions of the soil, which resulted in: lower bulk density, with average values across the 0 - 30 cm soil profile of 1. 48, 1. 34 and 1. 30 Mg m - 3 in T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively, at the end of the growing season; higher soil water content in the soil profile in all four sampling dates per season; greater porosity; and lower resistance to penetration with values of 2. 48, 2. 15 and 1. 71 MPa in T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively, before crop harvesting. Tillage system T 3 provided the highest crop yields (2. 26 Mg ha - 1) compared with T 2 (2. 14 Mg ha - 1) and T 1 (1. 95 Mg ha - 1), for the plants grown on T 3 plots had the largest number of leaves. The size of the leaves was similar in all three systems, however. </p...|$|E
