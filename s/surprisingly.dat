5|$|At the Australian Open, seeded No. 23, {{she reached}} the second round, where she lost <b>surprisingly</b> to {{returning}} Kateryna Bondarenko from Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Surprisingly,</b> perhaps, the tithes were {{administered}} locally by a Welshman, Gwilym ap Gwrwared, who was probably grandfather of famed bard Dafydd.|$|E
5|$|After Vytautas' {{death in}} 1430, Lithuania became embroiled in {{internal}} wars and conflicts with Poland. Casimir, sent {{as a boy}} by King Władysław on a mission there in 1440, was <b>surprisingly</b> proclaimed by the Lithuanians as their Grand Duke, and he remained in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale was <b>surprisingly</b> strong. The men knew the Allies were {{demanding}} an unconditional surrender. They were now fighting for the fatherland, defending the soil of their country, not just fighting for Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the sheer}} {{intensity}} of the fighting {{and the number of}} Indonesian troops, final casualty numbers are placed at a <b>surprisingly</b> low 2 killed and 8 wounded on the British side. The British in turn inflicted at least 30 casualties upon the Indonesians, but an exact number cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{extremely}} {{cold winter}} temperatures, the falls freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that can last {{well into the}} spring. If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually dry up. In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be <b>surprisingly</b> forceful.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{males are}} known to enter <b>surprisingly</b> shallow bays to rest (whales will be in state of rest during these occasions). There are unique, coastal groups {{reported}} from various areas among the globe such as Scotland, Shiretoko Peninsula, off Kaikoura, in Davao Gulf. Such coastal groups were more abundant in pre-whaling days.|$|E
5|$|Lupe Fiasco {{is an avid}} {{video game}} fan and likes to play the Street Fighter series of {{fighting}} games. He <b>surprisingly</b> won an exhibition match of Street Fighter V against professional player Daigo Umehara in 2016, defeating him 3-2 using Ken.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} have long, broad wings, are strong fliers and, rather <b>surprisingly,</b> given their size and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, {{straight}} and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|Schultz {{ran for the}} {{election}} to the Joliet City Council in the spring 1989 municipal elections. He advanced from the February 28, 1989 primary election to the general election in what the Chicago Tribune described as a <b>surprisingly</b> strong showing, but finished fourth in the six-way April 4 general election for three seats.|$|E
5|$|After Spain were <b>surprisingly</b> {{eliminated}} from the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup by a defeat to the United States, Alonso and Spain faced South Africa in the third-place match. After 90 minutes, the game was deadlocked at 2–2, so extra time was added, where Alonso scored a free-kick in to the bottom corner of the goal to help Spain win third.|$|E
5|$|After plans by WWF {{writers to}} turn the Ultimate Warrior against Savage were {{scrapped}} due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel, the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was <b>surprisingly</b> offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} <b>surprisingly</b> fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a <b>surprisingly</b> fair trial.|$|E
5|$|Callender's true success, however, was in {{the passing}} game, where he accrued 92yards, putting him first among all {{receivers}} in the game. Callender's 13catches were an ACC Championship Game record and were the fourth-highest total for a receiver in any game in ACC history. Wide receiver Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4catches for 45yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54yards. <b>Surprisingly</b> {{for the number of}} receiving yards recorded by the Eagles in the game, no Boston College receiver caught a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Excluding these, <b>surprisingly</b> few {{documents}} {{dating to}} Unas' reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly mention his third, fourth, sixth and eighth {{years on the}} throne. Unas also left a rock inscription {{on the island of}} Elephantine, next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were <b>surprisingly</b> unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are <b>surprisingly</b> complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|Just as the 1630s replica {{has proven}} to be an {{accurate}} copy of the lost original, the panorama {{has proven to}} be a <b>surprisingly</b> reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm. The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather <b>surprisingly,</b> Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful {{to assess the}} {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but <b>surprisingly</b> they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states {{that are related to}} each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.|$|E
5|$|Others {{that were}} not {{originally}} intended for the dump months get shifted there anyway {{not because they are}} bad but because the studios cannot figure out how to market them or aren't sure they will succeed. C. Robert Cargill, a former critic for Ain't It Cool News who scripted the successful 2012 horror film Sinister, points to Chronicle, which had a <b>surprisingly</b> strong opening on Super Bowl weekend earlier that year, an example.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sihanouk was <b>surprisingly</b> acquiescent {{about the}} whole affair. He was under {{pressure}} from the U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk felt that this was a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E
5|$|Recent extractions of DNA {{from the}} dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, {{as well as}} 37 species of doves, has found where in Columbidae the raphines should be placed. <b>Surprisingly,</b> raphines are not the most {{primitive}} columbid, instead they are grouped with the Nicobar pigeon as their closest relative, with other closely related birds being the crowned pigeons and tooth-billed pigeon. A third raphine, Raphus solitarius, is now {{considered to be an}} ibis in the genus Threskiornis.|$|E
5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of populations and {{individuals}} vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants. In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 plants were found; <b>surprisingly,</b> only fifty plants could be found in the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead plants, and no evidence of disturbance. Since then the number of populations reported have ranged from 6 to 11, and reports {{of the total number of}} plants have ranged from 340 to 580.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film is full of unexpected pleasures set to a <b>surprisingly</b> retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. Against this, the historian Paolo Squatriti, reviewing Watson's paper 40 years on, noted that it had proven useful to many different historical agendas, and had held up <b>surprisingly</b> well {{in the face of}} new findings in archaeology and archaeobotany.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{of mammals}} in Canada hearken {{back to the}} 1795 {{northern}} explorations of Samuel Hearne, whose account is considered <b>surprisingly</b> accurate. The first seminal work on Canadian mammals, however, was John Richardson's 1829 Fauna Boreali-Americana. Joseph Burr Tyrrell {{was the first to}} attempt to produce, in 1888, a comprehensive list of Canadian mammalian species. Ernest Thompson Seton and Charles-Eusèbe Dionne's work were also important. Modern Canadian publications with interest in mammalogy include The Canadian Field Naturalist, the Canadian Journal of Zoology and the French-language Le Naturaliste Canadien.|$|E
5|$|<b>Surprisingly,</b> Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, {{reinstating}} Luongo in the starting position for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Surprisingly,</b> {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E
5|$|Swirral Edge {{offers a}} shorter but equally {{exciting}} scramble along a similar sharp arête. The main path to {{it comes up}} from Red Tarn, which is linked by a <b>surprisingly</b> level path to Hole-in-the-Wall, making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding. The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye Cam.|$|E
5|$|The LPF won just 2.6% of {{the vote}} in the 2004 European Parliament election, and did not win a seat. In this election, Paul van Buitenen <b>surprisingly</b> won two seats with his anti-corruption Europe Transparent (although it was not {{successful}} in the long term). By 2004, the LPF had fallen to a less than 1% support and disintegrated. The party had lost most of its members, and the parliamentary faction had declared itself independent from the party.|$|E
5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not <b>surprisingly,</b> very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} criticism by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|The chasms {{that open}} {{throughout}} {{the sea in}} the final moments of the book derive from the Hollow Earth theory. The area closest to the Pole is also, <b>surprisingly,</b> warm rather than cold, as Symmes believed. Symmes also believed there were civilizations inside this Hollow Earth and the enshrouded figure who appears at the end may indicate one such civilization near the Pole.|$|E
5|$|The final leg of Gloucestershire's {{northern}} {{tour was}} at Trent Bridge where they played Nottinghamshire from Thursday, 1 August, to Saturday, 3 August. This match was drawn after rain intervened. Gloucestershire scored 165 (Grace 9) and 253 (Grace 116). Nottinghamshire scored 258 (Grace 2–91) and 10 for 1 (Grace (1–2). So Grace finally {{made his first}} (and only) century of the 1878 season, <b>surprisingly</b> against arguably the strongest bowling attack in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{homology}} groups H'i(S'n), with i > n, are all trivial. It therefore {{came as a}} {{great surprise}} historically that the corresponding homotopy groups are not trivial in general. This {{is the case that}} is of real importance: the higher homotopy groups πi(S'n), for i > n, are <b>surprisingly</b> complex and difficult to compute, and the effort to compute them has generated a significant amount of new mathematics.|$|E
