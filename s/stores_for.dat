5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even more seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.|$|E

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{buckwheat}} seed storage duration on major indices {{of the quality}} was analyzed. Seed collected in 1996 and <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 30 days (analyzed in 1996), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> one year (analyzed in 1997), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> two years (analyzed in 1998), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> three years (analyzed in 1999) seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> four years (analyzed in 2000), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> five years (analyzed in 2001) and seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> six years (analyzed in 2002) were investigated. The results of investigation have shown that seed stored {{up to two years}} had preserved its good production traits. Seed stored longer than two years have shown poor quality traits, and seed stored over three years could not be used - its production traits (germination energy and total germination) confirmed that such seed could not be used <b>for</b> planting. Seed <b>stored</b> over five years, regardless of storage conditions, had no qualitative traits, and therefore no value. It was also observed that longer storage duration induced decrease of seed mass. In regard to fractions, it was observed that smaller fractions lost their quality more quickly than medium fractions...|$|R

Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but Bellerophons Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> the Russian Army also being taken.

5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E

Just before 12:00, an air raid siren was issued and Colhoun moved out to sea. A second alert was received at 14:00. Shortly thereafter, a lookout spotted a formation of Japanese aircraft approaching using the sun as cover. The Japanese aircraft, using clouds as cover, dove and released three bombs against Colhoun, two splashing nearby and one striking the after searchlight platform and a nearby boat. The bomb blew the after davits down and forward, blocking the after engine room hatches, and starting a fire from the diesel oil spilled by the boat.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Underground was a {{non-traditional}} {{magazine that}} Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, {{along with a}} booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind Memory Card saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of PlayStation Underground JamPacks Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of PlayStation Underground, along with seemingly as many game demos that could be packed on a single CD. Unlike PlayStation Underground these were available in most <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released or coming soon games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out Underground {{to focus on the}} JamPacks with the release of the PlayStation 2.

5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NPL decided that, of all the work being {{carried out by the}} TRE on its behalf, ACE was to be given the top priority. NPL's decision led to a visit by the superintendent of the TRE's Physics Division on 22 November 1946, accompanied by Frederic C. Williams and A. M. Uttley, also from the TRE. Williams led a TRE development group working on CRT <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> radar applications, as an alternative to delay lines.

5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen <b>stores</b> <b>for</b> use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their blood pressure stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E
