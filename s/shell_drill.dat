50|$|The {{idea is that}} sensors will {{transmit}} data at {{the speed}} of light (taking into account delay on networks). If an earthquake was to have its epicenter 20 miles away, you could know about it 10 seconds before you felt the ground shake. That’s the promise behind one of the newest products coming out of Hewlett-Packard’s labs. By installing a trillion tiny sensors to collect data about the world around us, HP is trying to build a central nervous system for the earth. HP will first deploy CeNSE to help <b>Shell</b> <b>drill</b> for oil.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 <b>Shell</b> <b>drilled</b> {{the first}} well off Nova Scotia, the Sable Offshore Energy Project C-67 well. Located on desolate, sandy Sable Island (best {{known for its}} herd of wild horses), the well {{bottomed}} in gas-bearing Cretaceous rocks. Drilling stopped there because the technology did not exist to handle the super-pressures the well encountered.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{up on the}} {{positive}} results of the A-52 well, <b>Shell</b> <b>drilled</b> a discovery well at Panuke, [...] southwest of Cohasset. The Shell Panuke B-90 wildcat encountered a relatively thin zone that tested light oil {{at a rate of}} 1,000 m³ (8,648 barrels) per day. The following year, Petro-Canada drilled the F-99 delineation well at Panuke. That well tested oil at 8,000 m³ (69,188 barrels) a day for six days.|$|R
50|$|Greenpeace {{used the}} Belgian Grand Prix {{as a main}} point of protests against Shell, a {{principal}} sponsor of the race. Greenpeace activists went to the track and put up a number of banners protesting against <b>Shell</b> <b>drilling</b> in the Arctic. These included two remote controlled banners which scrolled {{up in front of}} the podium celebrations, which were quickly disposed of by security, and a large banner on the main grandstand. The official world feed broadcast did not show any banner in detail.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2012 Shell delayed actual oil {{drilling}} in the Chukchi until the following summer due to heavier-than-normal ice and the Arctic Challenger, an oil-spill response vessel, not being ready on time. However, on September 23, <b>Shell</b> began <b>drilling</b> a [...] "top-hole" [...] over its Burger prospect in the Chukchi. And on October 3, <b>Shell</b> began <b>drilling</b> a top-hole over its Sivulliq prospect in the Beaufort Sea, after being notified by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission that drilling could begin.|$|R
50|$|Nova Scotia’s {{offshore}} industry includes oil {{and natural}} gas. Shell has operated offshore Nova Scotia since 1963, when it filed for nearly 20 million acres of Federal permits. It participated in 77 or {{one third of the}} nearly 200 wells drilled offshore Nova Scotia to date and drilled Nova Scotia’s first offshore gas discovery well, Onondaga E-84, in 1969.In 1970, Shell introduced the first offshore oil rig, a semi-submersible Sedco-H made at the Halifax shipyards.Through the early 1970s, <b>Shell</b> <b>drilled</b> 24 wells, making a second discovery at Primrose in 1972 and continued an active exploration program throughout the 1980s. In addition to drilling the first deepwater well offshore Nova Scotia (Shubenacadie H-100), Shell made a number of new gas discoveries (Glenelg, Alma, North Triumph) which {{led to the development of}} the Sable Offshore Energy Project, which it owns at 31.3 percent. The project started producing gas on December 31, 1999 and Shell has been a non-operating co-venturer. In 1986 <b>Shell</b> <b>drilled</b> at Panuke discovering light sweet crude oil. While the company was not interested in developing what was thought to be a marginal discovery, it led to the development of Canada’s first offshore oil project, the decommissioned Cohasset-Panuke project, which produced a total of 44.5 million barrels between 1992 and 1999 from 16 wells.|$|R
25|$|A {{sedimentary}} basin also exists off the British Columbia Coast, and some exploratory drilling {{has taken place}} there. From 1967 to 1969, <b>Shell</b> <b>drilled</b> 14 deep dry holes from the Transocean 135-F semi-submersible – some west of Vancouver, others in Hecate Strait beside the Queen Charlotte Islands. Exploration off the west coast stopped in 1972 when the federal and British Columbia governments imposed moratoria on exploration, pending the results of studies into {{the environmental impact of}} drilling. In 1986 a government-appointed commission recommended an end to the moratorium.|$|R

50|$|Two large rolls {{typically}} {{form the}} ends of the drainage section, which is called the drainage table. The breast roll is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At {{the other end of the}} drainage table is the suction (couch) roll. The couch roll is a hollow <b>shell,</b> <b>drilled</b> with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box. From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.|$|R

50|$|Veined rapa whelks are {{carnivorous}} selective predatory gastropods {{whose main}} diet {{consists of a}} variety of other mollusk species, mainly epifaunal bivalves such as oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolus and Geukensia), but also clams (Anadara inaequivalvis, Chamelea gallina, Tapes philippinarum, Venus verrucosa, and the northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria). Prey are chosen by the whelk according to their species and size. Most snails feed by drilling a hole into their bivalve prey, but rapa whelks usually smother their prey by wrapping around the hinged region of the shell and feed by introducing their proboscis between the opened valves. The whelk can also secrete a thick mucus {{that may or may not}} contain biotoxins to weaken the prey. <b>Shell</b> <b>drilling,</b> however, is also not unknown in this species.|$|R

50|$|While {{most species}} of octopus are nocturnal, O. cyanea is diurnal, {{although}} mostly crepuscular, being active {{at dawn and}} dusk. It maintains a den to which it returns after foraging; a rock crevice, a hidden place under an overhang, a hiding place among coral heads, or a hole excavated in rubble or sand. It is a predator and searches the reef for fish, crabs, shrimp, and molluscs. Small items may be eaten where they are caught, while larger items are carried back to the den for consumption. Crabs may be killed by a bite and given an injection of toxic saliva, then chewed up in the beak of the octopus, while molluscs may have their <b>shells</b> <b>drilled</b> and the animal inside being predigested to ease extraction. Empty mollusc shells and crab carapaces are discarded outside the den, forming a midden.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Shell {{was awarded}} {{the oil and gas}} rights to the Klappan valley, one of British Columbia's largest coal {{deposits}} and an estimated [...] of methane. That year, <b>Shell</b> <b>drilled</b> three exploratory wells at the headwaters, but in 2005 four Shell employees who arrived at the band office in Iskut were turned away by a group of elders, and no drilling occurred that summer. Non-violent blockades in 2005 and 2006 delayed development efforts and led to the arrests of 13 protesters. Talhtan territory was the site of half of all the mining exploration in British Columbia during 2006. Protests in Smithers have been as large as 600 people. David Suzuki and Wade Davis have both criticized plans for coal-bed methane mining in the headwaters, and in June 2007, 14 different environmental groups sent a joint letter to Shell opposing the project.|$|R
