So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny.

500|$|The group took a {{hands-on}} {{approach to the}} actual recording sessions for Phantom Power, engineering and producing themselves for the first time. Recording largely took place at AV Happenings {{during the second half}} of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band [...] "didn't really know what [...] were doing". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: [...] "we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had to figure out why. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best". The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as [...] "ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine". A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album's more [...] "straight ahead" [...] tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and [...] "messed around" [...] with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{process for}} California was {{more complex than}} for the band's previous records. They chose to record the disc to analog tape rather than digitally and some songs required several 24-track machines, utilizing over 50 tracks.

The album displays influences from Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys, while blending lounge, pop, jazz, funk, thrash metal, Hawaiian, Middle Eastern, kecak and avant-garde music. The band toured North America, Australia and Europe to support the record. They also notably appeared on the 2000 edition of the SnoCore Tour, performing alongside alternative metal acts whom they had influenced, such as Incubus and System of a Down. According to Trevor Dunn, Mr. Bungle were [...] "completely out of place" [...] on the SnoCore Tour.
