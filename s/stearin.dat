500|$|In 1837 Bird {{took part}} in an {{investigation}} of the dangers posed by the arsenic content of cheap candles. [...] These were <b>stearin</b> candles with white arsenic added, which made them burn more brightly than ordinary candles. [...] The combination of cheapness and brightness made them popular. [...] The investigation was conducted by the Westminster Medical Society, a student society of Westminster Hospital, and was led by John Snow, later to become famous for his public health investigations. [...] Snow had previously investigated arsenic poisoning when he and several fellow students were taken badly ill after he introduced a new process for preserving cadavers at the suggestion of lecturer Hunter Lane. [...] The new process involved injecting arsenic into the blood vessels of the corpse. [...] Snow found that the arsenic became airborne as a result of chemical reactions with the decomposing corpse, and this was how it was ingested. [...] Bird's part in the candle investigation was to analyse the arsenic content of the candles, which he found to have recently been greatly increased by the manufacturers. [...] Bird also confirmed by experiment that the arsenic became airborne when the candles were burnt. [...] The investigators exposed various species of animal and bird to the candles in controlled conditions. [...] The animals all survived, but the birds died. [...] Bird investigated the bird deaths and analysed the bodies, finding small amounts of arsenic. [...] No arsenic was found on the feathers, however, indicating that poisoning was not caused by breathing airborne arsenic, since arsenic in the air would be expected to adhere to the feathers. [...] However, Bird found that large amounts of arsenic were in the birds' drinking water, indicating that this was the route taken by the poison.|$|E

Thermal behavior, equilibrium and actual isothermal solid fat content and morphology of phases were also analyzed. Three polymorphic forms were observed when samples were crystallized at 10 °C/min to different crystallization temperatures (Tc) : α, β 2 ̆ 72, and β 2 ̆ 71. The α form was the first polymorph obtained at all temperatures used and in the opposite way expected, at most crystallization temperatures it did not disappear when β 2 ̆ 72 or β 2 ̆ 71 forms appeared. β 2 ̆ 72 form crystallized below 16 or 23 °C for soft and hard <b>stearins,</b> respectively. Above those temperatures, the obtained polymorph was the β 2 ̆ 71 form. The β polymorphs were not obtained during the times selected for isothermal crystallization. However, β 2 form appeared at least after 6 h at Tc while after 48 h of storage at 25 °C the β 1 polymorph was the main form. The β 2 polymorphic form, which is required for chocolate manufacture, has a very short life and was isolated from β 1 by applying cooling/reheating cycles. The β 1 form was the most frequently observed. Therefore, processing conditions must be carefully controlled to obtain the desired polymorphic form during product manufacturing. This study provides full characterization and quantification of polymorphic phases of HSHO <b>stearins</b> in real time. Results from this study will help optimize processing conditions for the use of HSHO <b>stearins</b> in industrial applications as trans fat replacers and cocoa butter equivalents...|$|R

Esta propriedade pode ser considerada como um aspecto funcional {{relevante}} das gorduras plásticas, que são misturas de cristais de gordura sólida e óleo líquido. Os cristais de gordura formam uma rede tridimensional, que comunica plasticidade ao material. O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar as interações que ocorrem em misturas binárias de duas gorduras animais (abdominal de frango e de toucinho) quanto a sua propriedade de consistência em diferentes temperaturas. As amostras foram analisadas quanto à composição em ácidos graxos e à consistência, às temperaturas de 10 a 25 ºC. Utilizou-se o analisador de textura TA-XT 2 (Stable Micro Systems). Aplicou-se um modelo de regressão múltipla do tipo quadrático. Os resultados demonstraram que ocorreu o efeito eutético entre as estearinas obtidas no fracionamento da gordura de frango e a gordura de toucinho. Por outro lado, nas misturas entre gordura de frango e gordura de toucinho ocorreu efeito sinérgico, caracterizando a formação de compostos. Consistency {{is one of}} {{the most}} important physical properties of fats since it is directly associated with its several applications. This property can be considered an important functional aspect of the plastic fats, which are a mixture of solid and liquid fat phase. The fat solid phase forms a tridimentional lattice arising plasticity to the fat. The objective of this paper was to analyze the interactions that occur in binary mixtures of two animal fats (abdominal chicken fat and bacon fat), regarding their consistency at different temperatures. The samples were analyzed for the fatty acid composition and for the consistency at the temperatures of 10 to 25 ºC. The texture analyzer TA-XT 2 (Stable Micro Systems) was utilized. A mathematical model of multiple regression of the quadratic type was applied. The results showed that the eutectic effect was observed between the binary mixtures of <b>stearins</b> and bacon fat.

2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, <b>stearin</b> and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E
60|$|Mr. Field, of Lambeth, has {{supplied}} me abundantly {{with beautiful}} illustrations of the candle and its materials. I shall therefore now refer to them. And, first, {{there is the}} suet--the fat of the ox--Russian tallow, I believe, employed {{in the manufacture of}} these dips, which Gay Lussac, or some one who entrusted him with his knowledge, converted into that beautiful substance, <b>stearin,</b> which you see lying beside it. A candle, you know, is not now a greasy thing like an ordinary tallow candle, but a clean thing, and you may almost scrape off and pulverise the drops which fall from it without soiling anything. This is the process he adopted[2]:--The fat or tallow is first boiled with quick-lime, and made into a soap, and then the soap is decomposed by sulphuric acid, which takes away the lime, and leaves the fat re-arranged as stearic acid, whilst a quantity of glycerin is produced at the same time. Glycerin--absolutely a sugar, or a substance similar to sugar--comes out of the tallow in this chemical change. The oil is then pressed out of it; and you see here this series of pressed cakes, shewing how beautifully the impurities are carried out by the oily part as the pressure goes on increasing, and at last you have left that substance which is melted, and cast into candles as here represented. The candle I have in my hand is a <b>stearin</b> candle, made of <b>stearin</b> from tallow in the way I have told you. Then here is a sperm candle, which comes from the purified oil of the spermaceti whale. Here also are yellow bees-wax and refined bees-wax, from which candles are made. Here, too, is that curious substance called paraffin, and some paraffin candles made of paraffin obtained from the bogs of Ireland. I have here also a substance brought from Japan, since we have forced an entrance into that out-of-the-way place--a sort of wax which a kind friend has sent me, and which forms a new material for the manufacture of candles.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{there is}} another point about these candles which will answer a question,--that is, as {{to the way in}} which this fluid gets out of the cup, up the wick, and into the place of combustion. You know that the flames on these burning wicks in candles made of beeswax, <b>stearin,</b> or spermaceti, do not run down to the wax or other matter, and melt it all away, but keep to their own right place. They are fenced off from the fluid below, and do not {{encroach}} on the cup at the sides. I cannot imagine a more beautiful example than the condition of adjustment under which a candle makes one part subserve to the other to the very end of its action. A combustible thing like that, burning away gradually, never being intruded upon by the flame, is a very beautiful sight; especially when you come to learn what a vigorous thing flame is--what power it has of destroying the wax itself when it gets hold of it, and of disturbing its proper form if it come only too near.|$|E
6000|$|And how {{are these}} candles made? I {{have told you}} about dips, and I will shew you how moulds are made. Let us imagine any of these candles {{to be made of}} {{materials}} which can be cast. [...] "Cast!" [...] you say. [...] "Why, a candle is a thing that melts; and surely if you can melt it, you can cast it." [...] Not so. It is wonderful, in the progress of manufacture, and in the consideration of the means best fitted to produce the required result, how things turn up which one would not expect beforehand. Candles cannot always be cast. A wax candle can never be cast. It is made by a particular process, which I can illustrate in a minute or two: but I must not spend much time on it. Wax is a thing which, burning so well, and melting so easily in a candle, cannot be cast. However, let us take a material that can be cast. Here is a frame, with a number of moulds fastened in it. The first thing to be done is to put a wick through them. Here is one--a plaited wick, which does not require snuffing[3]--supported by a little wire. It goes to the bottom, where it is pegged in--the little peg holding the cotton tight, and stopping the aperture, so that nothing fluid shall run out. At the upper part there is a little bar placed across, which stretches the cotton and holds it in the mould. The tallow is then melted, and the moulds are filled. After a certain time, when the moulds are cool, the excess of tallow is poured off at one corner, and then cleaned off altogether, and the ends of the wick cut away. The candles alone then remain in the mould, and you have only to upset them, as I am doing, when out they tumble, for the candles are made in the form of cones, being narrower at the top than at the bottom; so that what with their form and their own shrinking, they only need a little shaking, and out they fall. In the same way are made these candles of <b>stearin</b> and of paraffin. It is a curious thing to see how wax candles are made. A lot of cottons are hung upon frames, as you see here, and covered with metal tags at the ends to keep the wax from covering the cotton in those places. These are carried to a heater, where the wax is melted. As you see, the frames can turn round; and as they turn, a man takes a vessel of wax and pours it first down one, and then the next and the next, and so on. When he has gone once round, if it is sufficiently cool, he gives the first a second coat, and so on until they are all of the required thickness. When they have been thus clothed, or fed, or made up to that thickness, they are taken off, and placed elsewhere. I have here, by the kindness of Mr. Field, several specimens of these candles. Here is one only half-finished. They are then taken down, and well rolled upon a fine stone slab, and the conical top is moulded by properly shaped tubes, and the bottoms cut off and trimmed. This is done so beautifully that they can make candles in this way weighing exactly four, or six, to the pound, or any number they please.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} summer of 1843, Alphonse Rallet {{established}} a business at 47 Vyatskaya Street in Moscow to manufacture <b>stearin</b> candles. The factory {{was equipped with}} a single steam engine and employed 40 workers. He was joined by his older brother, Eugene. In 1818 <b>stearin,</b> often produced from palm oil, had been discovered to be a particularly suitable wax for candles as it produced minimal soot and retained its shape at higher temperatures.

50|$|Paraffin {{could be}} used to make {{inexpensive}} candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, burned cleanly, and left no unpleasant odor, unlike tallow candles. A drawback to the substance was that early coal- and petroleum-derived paraffin waxes had a very low melting point. The introduction of <b>stearin,</b> discovered by Michel Eugène Chevreul, solved this problem. <b>Stearin</b> is hard and durable, with a convenient melting range of 54-72.5 °C (129.2-162.5 °F).
