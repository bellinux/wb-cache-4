25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall {{in the eyes of}} the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. The Muse, in their view, might prove immensely prolific, but she would never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false and foolish. The Muse, claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Greg Daniels. Daniels had previously directed the episodes [...] "Basketball" [...] and [...] "The Dundies". [...] "The Client" [...] was written by Paul Lieberstein, who acts on the show as human resources director Toby Flenderson. The idea for Jan and Michael to have a romantic relationship was conceived by Steve Carell {{as far back as}} the filming of the pilot episode. According to writer and producer Greg Daniels [...] "it was like he (Michael) was turned on by his teacher." [...] Writer and actor Paul Lieberstein said that the first idea that anybody came up for the episode was the final shot, where Jim and Michael look at each other and <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> suggesting that they had been through similar experiences. The rest of the episode was written to lead to that scene. The scene where Oscar tells a story about a date getting a background check on him was based on an actual date that Paul Lieberstein went on.|$|E
500|$|One of Busch's notable {{stories is}} Der Virtuos (1865), which {{describes}} {{the life of}} a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener. Satirizing the self-publicizing artist's attitude and his overblown adoration, it varies from Busch's other stories as each scene does not contain prose, but is defined with music terminology, such as [...] "Introduzione", [...] "Maestoso" [...] and [...] "Fortissimo vivacissimo". As the scenes increase in tempo, each part of his body and lappet run around. The penultimate scene again depicts the pianist's movements, with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes are dancing. Over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by Der Virtuos. August Macke, in a letter to gallery owner Herwarth Walden, described Busch as the first Futurist, stating how well he captured time and movement. Similar pioneering scenes are in Bilder zur Jobsiade (1872). Job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy, who <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in synchronicity. Each scene is a movement study that presages Eadweard Muybridge's photography. Muybridge began his work in 1872, not released until 1893.|$|E

The farrier said that {{certainly}} Will Marks was a good horseman, nobody should ever say he denied that: but he was rash, very rash, {{and there was no}} telling what the end of it might be; what did he go for, that was what he wanted to know? He wished the young fellow no harm, but why did he go? Everybody echoed these words, and <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> again, having done which they wished John Podgers good night, and straggled home to bed.|$|R

500|$|Michael Lantieri, {{mechanical}} effects {{supervisor for}} the 1912 scenes, noted {{the difficulty in}} shooting the train sequence. [...] "You can't just stop a train," [...] he said, [...] "If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up." [...] Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors shot at Universal Studios Hollywood were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion. For the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided {{he wanted it to}} move, the prop was sent to John Carl Buechler in Los Angeles, who resculpted it over three days to blink, snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The giraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud, Lantieri's crew would respond to first assistant director David Tomblin's radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> to his questions, which amused the crew. For the villains' cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 Ford Model T, a 1919 Ford Model T truck and a 1916 Saxon Model 14, fitting each with a Ford Pinto V6 engine. Sacks of dust were hung under the cars to create a dustier environment.|$|E
500|$|At Slayage.com, the Online Journal of Buffy Studies, author Daniel Erenberg {{placed the}} episode {{as the second}} best of the series; stating that the episode [...] "lends itself to {{infinite}} interpretations. No one watches it the same way. That's {{the mark of a}} true masterpiece." [...] When Noel Murray of The A.V. Club reviewed [...] "Restless" [...] in 2009, after beginning his first look at the series in 2008, he praised Joss Whedon's ability to represent what dreams are actually like. The A.V. Club also included [...] "Restless" [...] as an [...] "essential episode" [...] of the series in their list of the best TV series of the 2000s, in which Buffy the Vampire Slayer placed at #25. [...] "Restless" [...] was listed at #10 in The A.V. Clubs list of [...] "21 TV episodes that do dream sequences right", commenting, [...] "This device allows for a lot of surreal images and moments of weird comedy" [...] and that [...] "there are also some striking, unsettling touches that have the indefinable power and strangeness of a real dream." [...] The episode was listed as #1 in Daily Kos' list of the top 10 episodes of the series, and the episode was listed as the second best episode featuring dream sequences by USA Today. In series creator Joss Whedon's own list of his favorite episodes, he includes [...] "Restless", saying [...] "Most people sort of <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> at it. It was different, but not pointless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freamon {{receives}} {{word from}} Daniels and assigns Leander Sydnor and Kenneth Dozerman {{to introduce the}} specifics of the search to the patrol division. Greggs asks what she can do and Freamon asks her to raise Sergeant Thomas [...] "Herc" [...] Hauk, who is currently suspended from duty pending the results of an internal investigation. Greggs finds Herc drinking in the morning and reluctant to become involved while suspended. She goads him into accompanying her by questioning whether he is police or not. She takes him to the site of his recent traffic stop of Chris Partlow and Felicia [...] "Snoop" [...] Pearson, as he told Freamon that he fired a nail from their nail gun into the road. They find the mark but are unable to locate the nail. Herc spends the whole time questioning why IID is investigating him when Marimow has been transferred away and Daniels had already given him a mild punishment for the incident with the minister. Tired of Herc's complaints, Greggs asks what he did in order to reassure him that he will have an easier hearing. When Herc admits the falsified paperwork and stolen camera, Greggs and her partner Bunk Moreland <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in disbelief. Herc experiences further dismay, concerned that he may lose more than just his sergeant's rank.|$|E

2500|$|Dennis Mitchell — an importuning but lovable, freckle-faced five-and-a-half-year-old {{boy with}} a famous blond cowlick and a penchant for mischief. His long-suffering parents can only <b>shake</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and try to explain their son's antics to others. Despite this, they really do love him very much. Dennis's wide-eyed curiosity, his well-meaning {{attempts}} to help, his innocent, matter-of-fact bluntness, his youthful energy and enthusiastic nature always seem to lead to trouble wherever he goes (most often at Mr. Wilson's expense). He wears a blue/black striped shirt, tennis shoes, and red overalls with pockets that are sometimes filled with snakes, frogs, or his slingshot. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer (especially with cookies), ketchup, water pistols, his teddy bear [...] "Teddy", getting into fights with other boys his age, mud puddles, and TV Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Dennis has a poster and an autographed picture of Cowboy Bob as well. In fact, {{he is such a}} fan that once a week he goes to the local theater to watch a Cowboy Bob western. A favorite TV show of Dennis's is [...] "Uncle Earl." [...] Among the running gags: Dennis has a soft spot for kittens and puppies, which he is always taking home to feed; Dennis loves loud instruments—such as horns and drums; Dennis ruins Christmas songs with shouts of cowboy songs or annoys adults by shouting out loud. Whenever Dennis is in the local department store trying out toys, such as tricycles, he ends up breaking them and his parents have to buy them. In fact Dennis nearly causes kindergarten teachers, Librarians [...] department store Christmas Santas, department store saleswomen, Drugstore salesmen, Hardware store salesmen, shoe salesmen, barbers, and the local post office workers to have nervous breakdowns when he comes around. Dennis also believes in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus; another running gag is Dennis on Christmas Eve dreaming that he meets Santa Claus, and causing chaos for everyone else.|$|E
