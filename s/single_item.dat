5|$|In Adventure, the player's goal is {{to recover}} the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom {{and return it to}} the Golden Castle. The kingdom {{includes}} two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (green dragon), and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items in the game and will try to chase and eat the player's avatar. There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a <b>single</b> <b>item</b> (which can include the player's avatar or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name did not make it into the manual. The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.|$|E

40|$|Establishing {{predictive}} {{validity of}} measures {{is a major}} concern in marketing research. This paper investigates the conditions favoring the use of <b>single</b> <b>items</b> versus multi-item scales in terms of predictive validity. A series of complementary studies reveals that the predictive validity of <b>single</b> <b>items</b> varies considerably across different (concrete) constructs and stimuli objects. In an attempt to explain the observed instability, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted aimed at identifying the influence of different factors on the predictive validity of single versus multi-item measures. These include the average inter-item correlations in the predictor and criterion constructs, the number of items measuring these constructs, as well as the correlation patterns of multiple and <b>single</b> <b>items</b> between the predictor and criterion constructs. The simulation results show that, under most conditions typically encountered in practical applications, multi-item scales clearly outperform <b>single</b> <b>items</b> in terms of predictive validity. Only under very specific conditions do <b>single</b> <b>items</b> perform equally well as multi-item scales. Therefore, the use of single-item measures in empirical research should be approached with caution, and the use of such measures should be limited to special circumstances...|$|R

25|$|The ISS {{has been}} {{described}} as the most expensive <b>single</b> <b>item</b> ever constructed. In 2010 the cost was expected to be $150billion.

Assuming 20,000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews, each person-day would cost $7.5million, less than half the inflation-adjusted $19.6million ($5.5million before inflation) per person-day of Skylab.|$|E

On van der Hamen's death, twenty of these portraits were inventoried as a <b>single</b> <b>item</b> among his belongings. The portrait of his older brother, Lorenzo van der Hamen, probably belonged to this series.

25|$|Divergence among dialects of Malayalam embrace {{almost all}} aspects of {{language}} such as phonetics, phonology, grammar and vocabulary. Differences between any two given dialects can be quantified {{in terms of the}} presence or absence of specific units at each level of the language. To cite a single example of language variation along the geographical parameter, it may be noted that there are as many as seventy seven different expressions employed by the Ezhavas and spread over various geographical points just to refer to a <b>single</b> <b>item,</b> namely, the flower bunch of coconut. 'Kola' is the expression attested in most of the panchayats in the Palakkad, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala, whereas 'kolachil' occurs most predominantly in Kannur and Kochi and 'klannil' in Alappuzha and Kollam. 'Kozhinnul' and 'kulannilu' are the forms most common in Trissur Idukki and Kottayam respectively. In addition to these forms most widely spread among the areas specified above, there are dozens of other forms such as 'kotumpu' (Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram), 'katirpu' (Kottayam), krali (Pathanamthitta), pattachi, gnannil (Kollam), 'pochata' (Palakkad) etc. referring to the same item.|$|E

500|$|The second Part {{begins in}} G minor, a key which, in Hogwood's phrase, brings {{a mood of}} [...] "tragic presentiment" [...] to the long {{sequence}} of Passion numbers which follows.

The subsequent series of mainly short choral movements cover Christ's Passion, Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection, at first in F minor, with a brief F major respite in [...] "All we like sheep". Here, Handel's use of Nò, di voi non vo'fidarmi has Sedley Taylor's unqualified approval: [...] " [...] bids the voices enter in solemn canonical sequence, and his chorus ends with a combination of grandeur and depth of feeling such as is at the command of consummate genius only".|$|E

30|$|Against the {{background}} of our results we provide several recommendations for applying the task approach to the German Employment Surveys. First, we advise not to overemphasize the importance of observed changes in routine cognitive tasks and instead empirically focus on the increase in nonroutine tasks. For this group of tasks, the number of <b>single</b> task <b>items</b> is sufficiently high, these items are regularly observable throughout the cross-sections, their content did not change significantly from year to year, and measurement validity is comparatively strong. Regarding the different classifications, we would prefer to classify items according {{to the results of}} our criterion validation. The information used to validate <b>single</b> task <b>items</b> proved a fruitful resource for deciding into which task category <b>single</b> task <b>items</b> should be classified. Data on routine job contents could possibly also be used to construct a routine index apart from the <b>single</b> task <b>items,</b> which cover the other four ALM task domains.|$|R
