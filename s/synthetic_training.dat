[URL] 1986, seven normally-hearing subjects were trained in the use of an electrotactile speech processor ("Tickle Talker"). Two training methods were used: (a) a combined strategy. in which a variety of training materials ranging from analytic to synthetic level were employed; and (b) a <b>synthetic</b> alone <b>training</b> strategy, in which only <b>synthetic</b> level <b>training</b> materials were used. All seven subjects received 70 hours of training, 35 hours in each training strategy. Subjects were evaluated in the tactile-lipreading (TL) and lipreading alone (L) conditions at: (I) 0 hours training; (2) 35 hours training; and (3) after 70 hours of training. An evaluation test battery was constructed which contained both closed-set and open-set materials. Results indicated differences in performance on the evaluation tests which were dependent upon the training strategy. The differences in performance were greater in some evaluation tests than others. Subsequently; seven severe-profoundly hearing-impaired children (aged 7 - 11) have been fitted with the Tickle Talker and are presently participating in an ongoing training programme. Evaluation of their performance will help to assess the suitability of the device for young children. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|In street-based {{mobility}} mining, {{traffic volume}} estimation receives increasing attention as it provides important {{applications such as}} emergency support systems, quality-of-service evaluation and billboard placement. In many real world scenarios, empirical measurements are usually sparse due to some constraints.

We propose a Gaussian process regression based method for traffic volume estimation, which incorporates topological information and prior knowledge on preferred trajectories with a trajectory pattern kernel. Our approach also enables effectively finding most informative sensor placements. We evaluate our method with <b>synthetic</b> German <b>train</b> station pedestr ian data and real-world episodic movement data from the zoo of Duisburg.
