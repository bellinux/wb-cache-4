5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and {{analgesic}} effects. In 2012, <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid {{that stops}} {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells. <b>Salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is known to}} be less effective than retinoid therapy. Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types.|$|E
5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals.

5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol.

5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> that Piria had found.|$|E

5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{and sodium}} salicylate— were {{difficult}} and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
5|$|Salicylates are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. <b>Salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Phytohormones {{are the key}} {{metabolites}} {{participating in}} the regulation of multiple functions of plant organism. Among them, jasmonates, as well as abscisic and <b>salicylic</b> <b>acids</b> are responsible for triggering and modulating plant reactions targeted against pathogens and herbivores, as well as resistance to abiotic stress (drought, UV-irradiation and mechanical wounding). These factors induce dramatic changes in phytohormone biosynthesis and transport leading to rapid local and systemic stress responses. Understanding of underlying mechanisms is of principle interest for scientists working in various areas of plant biology. However, highly sensitive, precise and high-throughput methods for quantification of these phytohormones in small samples of plant tissues are still missing. Results Here we present an LC-MS/MS method for fast and highly sensitive determination of jasmonates, abscisic and <b>salicylic</b> <b>acids.</b> A single-step sample preparation procedure based on mixed-mode solid phase extraction was efficiently combined with essential improvements in mobile phase composition yielding higher efficiency of chromatographic separation and MS-sensitivity. This strategy resulted in dramatic increase in overall sensitivity, allowing successful determination of phytohormones in small (less than 50 mg of fresh weight) tissue samples. The method was completely validated in terms of analyte recovery, sensitivity, linearity and precision. Additionally, it was cross-validated with a well-established GC-MS-based procedure and its applicability {{to a variety of}} plant species and organs was verified. Conclusion The method can be applied for the analyses of target phytohormones in small tissue samples obtained from any plant species and/or plant part relying on any commercially available (even less sensitive) tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multistep radical {{processes}} are proposed to rationalize {{the formation of}} product ions formed by collisionally induced and spontaneous fragmentation of lithium-cationized 6 -alkenyl and 6 -alkadienyl <b>salicylic</b> <b>acids.</b> An important step in these processes consists of a homolytic C-H cleavage, a mechanism {{which is consistent with}} the charge-remote concept.

The proposed mechanisms also explain very well the observed enhanced abundances of ions whose formation involves formal benzylic, homobenzylic and homoallylic cleavages. The enhanced abundance of ions whose formation involves formal allylic cleavages can be readily rationalized by resonance stabilization of intermediate allylic radical ions...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). <b>Salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
