40|$|The {{preservation}} of rivers against the erosion and devastation caused by water flow through using groins is considered as on {{of the most}} common methods in river engineering. Changing the hydraulic conditions and creating laminar flow. The groins decrease the erosion power of water and its ability to carry the sediments and set the ground for sedimentation and stabilizing the banks of the rivers. One of the important issues in designing groins is studying scoring and determining the <b>scoring</b> <b>depth</b> in the head land of the groins. One of the effective parameters on the <b>scoring</b> <b>depth</b> around the groins is the angle alternation in river bend. In order to investigate the effect of different angles parallel to the groins across the bend on the scoring process. A number of experiments were conducted by using a flexible glass laboratory flume with 180 deg bend and a ratio of R/B= 4. 7. in this study by placing a groin in a laboratory flume at 30 deg position of the bend with varying angle of 70, 90, 100 and 110 deg to the direction of the water flow with flows of 20, 24, and 28 L/S and fixed depth of 13 cm. the scoring phenomenon around the groin in purity water was studied. The material used for the bed of flume was harmonious granulated sands. Fig. 1. Layout of flume for spur dike positions experiments 1 Fig. 2.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of local scour at pier groups {{has been conducted}} {{with the aim of}} developing design recommendations and scour depth prediction equations for the bridge pier groups. A comprehensive series of steady uniform flow experiments was performed on groups of 2, 3, 4, and 6 model piers. All tests were conducted under clear-water scour conditions. Parameters governing local scour depth around bridge piers include: flow characteristics, sediment properties, and pier size and shape. The effects of these parameters on the maximum local scour depth for a single pier (D s), have been thoroughly investigated in the past. However, when design criteria developed for single piers are applied directly to pier groups, this approach ignores the following important group effects: (1) sheltering, (2) reinforcement, and (3) horse-shoe vortex (HSV) compression. Furthermore, the group effects will alter with changes in pier spacing, S, and flow angle of attack, β. This study, which investigates the local scouring process for the aforementioned groups of model bridge piers, and presents design relationships for predicting the corresponding maximum local scour depths, is an attempt to address this limitation in current design practice. Initially the local scour was examined for five different single pier diameters (0. 0127 m, 0. 018 m, 0. 025 m, 0. 033 m and 0. 05 m). Having established single pier relationships, groups of 2, 3, 4, and 6 equally spaced piers were examined, while altering alignment to the flow and separation distances. For piers in line with the flow direction, downstream piers are sheltered by the upstream ones resulting in reducing scour depth around downstream piers. This effect diminishes with the increasing β if there is only one row of piers i. e., 2 and 3 pier groups. In the case of 2 rows of piers aligned to the flow direction (i. e., 4 - and 6 -pier groups), there is a specific range of β in which downstream piers are exposed to the flow. As β increases, depending on pier spacing, the piers of one row may shelter the downstream piers of the other row. The reinforcement effect is significant only for small ratios of pier spacing/ pier diameter (S/d) when β< 100. In these ranges of S/d and β, the front piers are scoured more than that of a single pier. Moreover, the <b>score</b> <b>depth</b> of downstream piers, which are less than that of a single pier, increases with increasing S/d. The compressed (HSV) arms affect the local scour depth significantly if piers are staggered and S/d < 5. In this range of S/d, the HSV arms are intensified, resulting in a deeper scour hole. However, this effect also becomes insignificant with increasing S/d. The data obtained for each pier group were analysed, using a multiple regression model, to develop local scour depth prediction equations for the front, middle, and rear piers. The regression model includes two important dimensionless parameters (β and S/d) associated with group effects, as regressors. The proposed prediction equations estimated the observed data and similar-type published data reasonably well, within marginal errors. From a general practical view-point, the number of prediction equations was reduced to two equations for all pier groups: one for the front piers and the second one for the downstream piers (i. e. combined middle and rear piers) ...|$|E

40|$|Monocular depth {{estimation}} is {{a challenging}} task in complex compositions depicting multiple objects of diverse scales. Albeit the recent great progress {{thanks to the}} deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods still fall short to handle such real-world challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deep end-to-end learning framework to tackle these challenges, which learns the direct mapping from a color image to the corresponding depth map. First, we represent monocular depth estimation as a multi-category dense labeling task by contrast to the regression based formulation. In this way, we could build upon the recent progress in dense labeling such as semantic segmentation. Second, we fuse different side-outputs from our front-end dilated convolutional neural network in a hierarchical way to exploit the multi-scale depth cues for depth estimation, which is critical to achieve scale-aware depth estimation. Third, we propose to utilize soft-weighted-sum inference instead of the hard-max inference, transforming the discretized <b>depth</b> <b>score</b> to continuous <b>depth</b> value. Thus, we reduce the influence of quantization error and improve the robustness of our method.

Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of <b>scoring</b> <b>depth.</b> Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|R

The background of the problem in light of changing global paradigms and educational action orientations was outlined and {{a review of the literature}} was provided. Roots of thought for two key concepts (i. e., learning to learn from experience and meaningful reflection in learning) were traced. Reflective perspectives from the work of eight researchers were compared. A meta-model of learning from experience drawn from the literature served as a conceptual framework for the study. A strategy for reflective learning developed from this meta-model was taught to 109 teachers-in-training at Florida International University in Miami, Florida. Kolb 2 ̆ 7 s Adaptive Style Inventory and Learning Style Inventory were administered to the treatment group and to two control groups taught by the same professor. Three research questions and fourteen hypotheses guided data analysis. Qualitative review of 1565 personal documents generated by the treatment group indicated that 77 students demonstrated 2 ̆ 2 double-loop 2 ̆ 2 learning, going beyond previously established limits to perception, understanding, or action. The mean <b>score</b> for <b>depth</b> of reflection indicated 2 ̆ 2 single-loop 2 ̆ 2 learning with 2 ̆ 2 reflection-in-action 2 ̆ 2 present.

Methodology: Twenty-four patients with anal canal carcinoma were evaluated. Five-mum sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were tested with monoclonal anti-CD 31 antibody. CD 31 value is considered positive if more than 185 vessels/mm(2) were counted. Pearson's chi (2) test was employed to test for association between CD 31 value and clinicopathological variables.

Moreover, the instrument to test the depth perception was the electrical examiner of depth perception (122 B). Participants performed the examinations under two motivational environments (with viewer and without viewer). The results of paired t-test showed significant difference between athletes <b>scores</b> in <b>depth</b> perception test under two motivational environments at 0 / 05 significance level. In other words, participants in high arousal environment (i. e. in presence of viewers) had inaccurate estimation of depth perception. This effect was same in both genders. The results of this study indicated that participants in high arousal environment pay attention to different information resources or different peripheral cues which cause to an inaccurate depth estimation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the genetic {{relationships}} between major reproductive traits in beef cattle (Calving Date, Calving Interval and Age at First Calving) and type traits have been estimated {{to evaluate the}} usefulness of type classification in predicting reproductive performance in beef cattle. We estimated favourable genetic correlations between Calving Interval and type traits ranging from 20. 027 to 20. 297. However, type traits and Calving Date appear to be genetically independent and the genetic relationships between Age at First Calving and type traits are, in general, non-favourable. Genetic correlations between type traits and Calving Date ranged from 0. 0 to – 0. 125. Genetic correlations between Age at First Calving and Final <b>Score,</b> Body <b>Depth</b> and Tight Development were, respectively, 0. 399, 0. 445 and 0. 447. Our {{results suggest that the}} possibility of using type classification to construct an index to improve reproductive performance is little. The more reliable possibility to build a possible selection index comprising type classification and reproductive performance would be based on Age at First Calving. Type classification at first calving could help to increase the information to select dams to stay on the farm in subsequent calvings {{on the basis of their}} expected performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the extent to which <b>scores</b> on <b>depth</b> and breadth of vocabulary knowledge as two dimensions of vocabulary knowledge would contribute to predicting the EFL learners' reading performance with a minimum vocabulary size of 3000 word families and also to find out the difference, if any, between the reading comprehension performance of two groups as having high and low depth and breadth of vocabulary knowledge. All instruments (Word-Associate Test (WAT) (Read, 1993) measuring depth of vocabulary knowledge (DVK), Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) (Nation, 1983) measuring vocabulary size (VS), and Reading Comprehension Test (RC) were administered together within the same session to 38 Iranian senior university students. Then the gathered data were analyzed by a Pearson correlation and two Independent T-tests. Results revealed that a) the interrelations among DVK, VS, and RC were high and positive; b) depth of vocabulary knowledge provided a significant contribution to the prediction of reading comprehension; and c) the students who had stronger depth and breadth of vocabulary knowledge performed better on reading comprehension. These findings provided empirical support for the importance of depth of vocabulary knowledge in reading comprehension. Regarding this, the necessity of incorporating this aspect into EFL programs and activities is desirable...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevention}} {{and management of}} pit and fissure caries has become relatively more important in recent times. There {{is a need for}} an effective preventive measure against pit and fissure caries. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of laser beam as a cleaning method of pits and fissures. Methods: Ho-YAG laser which has a wavelength of 2. 1 µm was used in this experiment. The specimens were extracted human teeth. The effect of three cleaning methods was examined comparatively by scoring the cleaned area of fissure, namely laser irradiation with Ho-YAG laser, chemico-mechanical with combination of 10 % NaOCl and ultrasonic scaler and mechanical with ultrasonic scaler. Vertico-bucco-lingual serial ground sections of each tooth were observed under light microscopy. <b>Scoring</b> the <b>depth</b> of cleaned area was performed by comparing the depth of fissure. result: Progressive result was obtained on the cleaning effect of three methods laser irradiation methods which was the most effective compared to other methods but statistically was not significant. Cleaned area of laser irradiation method was 48. 91 %, chemico-mechanical method was 41. 77 % and mechanical method was 36. 78 %. Conclusion: Holmium -yttrium aluminum garner laser is a relatively new method for pit and fissure cleaning even though the effectivity is not yet maximal. More research is needed to maximize the use of this laser. </span...|$|R

40|$|A clinical, histological, and {{radiographic}} examination {{was performed on}} 77 permucosal dental implants, made of dense sintered hydroxyl-apatite: 34 solid cylinders and 43 hollow cylinders. The hollow cyl-inders were pre-compressed between two titanium caps. The implants were placed in partly edentulous mandibles of dogs, and were phys-iologically loaded. Healing was clinically and radiographically eval-uated during a six-month to five-year period. At various times, implants with their surrounding tissues were re-moved and prepared for light and electron microscopy. All implants showed a good initial fit and were maintained in place without un-dercut or mechanical stabilization. After 18 months, 76 % of the solid cylinders had fractured at the implantlbone junction due to fatigue. However, the submerged portions of the solid cylinders were pre-served without clinical problems, and became entirely embedded in bone. The pre-stressed implants did not fracture, and 91 % were func-tioning 24 months after placement. The average <b>scores</b> ofpocket <b>depths</b> and gingival bleeding showed {{no significant differences between}} im-plants and surrounding natural teeth. Bone deposition occurred on the entire surface of the implant below the crest of the alveolar bone, and intimate bone contact was con-firned by electron microscopy. It was also observed that a layer of bone tissue was deposited on the implant surface in the permucosal area just above the alveolar bone level. Embedding ofgingival fibers in this layer resulted in gingival attachment to the implant, compa-rable with that of natural teeth...|$|R
