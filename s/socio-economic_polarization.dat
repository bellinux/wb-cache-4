40|$|This paper {{explores the}} idea that how wealth is {{distributed}} across social groups (ethnic or language groups, gender, etc.) fundamentally affects the evolution of economic inequality. By providing microfoundations suitable for this exploration, this paper hopes to enhance our understanding of when social forces contribute to the reproduction of economic inequality, and what the relevant policy implications might be. In tackling this issue, this paper offers contributions in two domains. First, it adds a dimension to the literature on social capital. Second, it offers a modest generalization of the concepts of identity, alienation and economic polarization used by Esteban and Ray (1994). This generalization permits us to consider the multiple characteristics that shape social identity, inclusion and exclusion. It also underwrites a higher-order measure of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> that permits us to explore the hypothesis of Frances Stewart and others that economic inequality is most pernicious and persistent when it is socially embedded. Among other things {{we are able to}} show that holding constant the initial levels of economic polarization and inequality, increases in <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> deepe...|$|E
30|$|There is a {{claim that}} the {{self-regulation}} of childcare fees {{will contribute to the}} enhancement of childcare service through competition in service, with the view that regulations on prices cause poor quality childcare service. Furthermore, since options for consumers will be expanded according {{to a wide range of}} service price options, the market for childcare will be revitalized, even contributing to the support of high-income groups. However, the adoption of a self-regulating price mechanism means that the Government will have to surrender the public nature of childcare, because the service provided for young children will be graded according to the incomes of their parents, resulting in deepening <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> In terms of private childcare, there is a degree of opposition to self-regulation because price competition rather than service competition is likely to cause those facilities in poor condition to be neglected.|$|E
40|$|This paper looks {{comparatively}} at {{the process}} of social change {{and its impact on}} local community cohesion in two Melbourne suburbs, &# 039;Northburb&# 039; and &# 039;Greenburb&# 039;. The two localities are geographically close, part of the same local government area and both highly ethnically diverse, but considerably different in terms of their socio-economic and ethnic profiles. Based on ethnographic data collected through individual interviews, focus groups and participant observation in 2012 - 2013, the paper shows how {{the process of}} deindustrialization and the switch to service economy over the past decades took distinctly different turns in the two localities. Our data suggest that the processes of social change seem to have diminished local community cohesion in both localities. In Northburb, gentrification has contributed to <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization,</b> while Greenburb has lagged behind in socio-economic indicators and experienced ethnic fragmentation due to a considerable influx of new immigrant groups...|$|E
40|$|With the {{election}} of Leung Chun-ying as the fourth chief executive (CE) of the Hong Kong Special Admininstration Region (HKSAR), the people of Hong Kong are keen {{to have a new}} government with policy visions and leadership. This public expectation is running high because Hong Kong has been suffering from a seris of critical and deep-seated <b>socio-economic</b> problems: the <b>polarization</b> of wealth, low social mobility, the subtraction of public (government) services, and so on. The inability of the HKSAR governments to address these problems {{has its roots in the}} governing system in general and the institutional design for selecting the CE and forming the executive in particular. This chapter therefore first examines the establishment and functions of the executive of the HKSAR, and then the way the CE and the executive govern, and their interaction with the Legislative Council (Legco) in terms of general policy-making and budgetary decision-making processes. Lastly, various challenges faced by the executive are considered...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{segregation}} is {{the reflection}} of social structures onto space”. Understood as a negative condition the socio-spatial segregation of urban dwellers as the opposing form to urban integration {{has become a major}} hindrance to both functional urban development and the inclusive vision that cities are supposed to foster. This premise forms the underpinning rational to construct this dissertation using the situation of the informal settlements of Caracas, Venezuela, as its subject of analysis. Like in many other Latin American major cities the rapid and unregulated urbanization of Caracas is compounded by social <b>polarization,</b> <b>socio-economic</b> inequalities and urban fragmentation. Inefficient government responses to provide large portions of the urban population with adequate access to housing have resulted in the formation and consolidation of informally-built areas outside the purview of urban regulations. Known in Venezuela as barrios de ranchos, these settlements are the spatial manifestation of urban poverty, social exclusion and precarious urban conditions characterized by poor quality housing, poor access to basic services, insecure property rights, and ambiguous citizenship, all of this contributing to their lack of integration to the surrounding city. The physical and socio-economic integration and inclusion of these urban dwellers represent a tremendous challenge for policymakers, professionals and civil society alike. Particular attention must be devoted to them in order to understand why the situation has evolved into what is today with the purpose of envisioning strategies aimed at integrating them to mainstream urban development. Actions to remedy this situation have fallen under projects and programmes implemented in a piecemeal basis, tackling mostly the physical improvement of these settlements. Such actions, at least in the Venezuelan context, have been many times tainted by political patronage and manipulation. It is argued in this dissertation that an integrated, holistic and multi-disciplinary approach denuded from political patronage is necessary to activate the integration process of these settlements. In this context, urban upgrading interventions have assumed a special significance in the process of spatial and socio-economic integration of barrios. For the purpose of this dissertation a specific upgrading project in one informal settlement in Caracas has been chosen to both explore the meaning of integration and how to actually achieve it by drawing up the lessons derived from the project‟s planning and implementation process. The project, known as the Caracas Barrio Upgrading Project (CAMEBA), has been undertaken in two major barrio agglomerations of Caracas in an attempt towards devising a humane and integrated barrio renewal policy. The empirical evaluation of CAMEBA is believed to offer valuable insights and positive lessons for future implementation of urban integrationist strategies. The main objective of this dissertation is therefore to explore the meaning of urban integration using the implementation process of project CAMEBA as its subject of research. In order to operationalize the research, the theorethical underpinnings of Polanyi´s modes of economic integration were used as the base to construct the analytical model to be tested in the field. The articulation of such model was guided on the other hand by a European research on urban integration known as the URBEX project, which applied Polanyi‟s model in spatial terms and emphazised the interplay of three functional domains as the key to socio-economic integration, viz. the State´s redistributive policies, public reciprocity and the dynamics of market exchange. Even though the theoretical underpinnings of the model were used by the URBEX project in the context of Western cities in Europe, this dissertation attempted to adapt the analytical framework envisaged by this project to the particular situation of the barrios of Caracas. Through this theoretical exercise a number of variables and indicators were developed to measure the degree of socio-economic, political and spatial integration of the barrio intervened by the upgrading project of CAMEBA. The complexity of the issue called for an understanding of the different forces and processes behind the social, economic, political and spatial exclusion of the large portion of the Venezuelan urban dwellers that live in barrios. The exploration thus far points out to the fact that urban upgrading endeavours in informal settlements in the context analysed can only be sustainable and relevant if the community being intervened is able to own the process and become the main stakeholder of the intervention. The study reveals that the process of barrio upgrading must be activated and sustained {{over a period of time}} in order to enable barrio inhabitants to realize their much cherished aspirations including the achievement of a sense of socio-economic and political integration and a sustained improvement in the quality of their lives. Quality access to basic and physical infrastructure, socio-political recognition of barrios and fostering of proactive community organizations while enabling their meaningful participation in the barrio upgrading process emerge as the major preconditions for working towards the urban integration of barrios. The analytical model articulated in the study stands out as a useful contribution to the scientific debate regarding urban integration, and it is expected to inform policymakers and urban specialists about posible paths towards the integration of informal settlements...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of state socialism {{and the introduction}} of market relationships in Central and Eastern Europe resulted in profound changes of urban development. Evidence from Central and Eastern Europe indicates that the development of a strong housing market and growing material inequalities contribute to the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> of city districts and residential segregation. Based on empirical data, we analyze spatial variation of migrants' first residential choices within Moscow, i. e. intensity of in-migration to a specific district. We test the theory-driven hypotheses about the association between residential choices and housing prices. Our results show that there are some areas that attract migrants of specific socio-economic status. However, housing prices do not explain a substantial share of variance in the intensities of in-migration, at least at the level of city districts; quite a strong association is only evident for foreign migrants. Thus, we find limited evidence of the Moscow' socio-spatial structure polarization due to the residential choices of migrants...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an empirical study, which analyzes {{the characteristics of}} those social housing projects implemented in the medium-sized city of Liberia, in Costa Rica, {{and their relationship to}} the territorial distribution of inequality and urban poverty. The dynamic economic growth of the province of Guanacaste and in particular of its capital, the city of Liberia, is widely recognized in Costa Rica. Unfortunately, this growth is accompanied by a process of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> Particularly, and after conducting an urban analysis, {{it was found that the}} implementation of social housing projects have benefited almost 20 % of its population -mostly very poor households-, yet it was also found that its implementation has contributed to the generation of what could be referred as 'enclaves of poverty' in the northern corner of the city, reducing the possibilities for development of those households. The study evidence the potential that urban planning and the implementation of the housing policy has on collaborating to promote equity and inclusiveness, in addition to its direct objective of providing decent housing to those household in need...|$|E
40|$|Social housing {{allocation}} {{systems have}} often been identified as contributing to the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> of neighbourhoods. Part of this argument has rested on a contention that - notwithstanding the impartial operation of 'needs-based' approaches - there is an inevitable tendency for the most disadvantaged households to be filtered into the least desirable housing. However, the empirical basis for this belief rests largely on {{a body of research}} dating from the mid- 1980 s and few studies have revisited the issue over the past decade. Drawing on a recently completed review of housing associations' allocation policies and practices, this paper presents important new evidence on that vital social policy question - who gets what? Broadly speaking, the analysis finds no evidence of any systematic tendency for potentially disadvantaged groups - e. g. single parents, black and minority ethnic households, low-income households, statutory homeless - to be rehoused in less desirable housing. Indeed, at the national scale some of these groups are somewhat more likely than other households to be rehoused in the best housing. However, because some of the likely explanations for these findings are specific to the housing association sector, it cannot be assumed that the conclusions can be read across to council housing. Further research would be required to explore this question. Social housing, housing allocations, discrimination,...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the effects of}} globalization on Mexico City, as well as whether this urban area, {{one of the largest}} in the world, can be considered a “global city. ” We base our arguments on a number of scales of analysis suggested in the literature on these topics. At the international scale, we look at the increased concentration of corporate headquarters and air traffic flows in the city. In terms of its role in the national urban system, we argue that while domestic migration patterns have shifted toward other destinations, the majority of domestically produced merchandise continues to find its way to the capital. At the metropolitan scale, our analysis suggests increasing spatial segregation, as well as longer commutes. At the intraurban level, we find that the sectoral composition of jobs has shifted toward commercial and service sectors, the informal sector has expanded, the labor force is polarizing, and that high-level service sector growth is spatially concentrated. In view of these findings, we suggest that the effects of globalization on Mexico City are mixed, as it consolidates its position as a second-tier global city. We also argue that, in spite of welcome steps toward democratization, pre-existing income inequalities in the country have accentuated the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> predicted by the literature on global cities and globalization, giving rise to a megacity with two very distinct sides.

40|$|Hong Kong is {{an ideal}} {{laboratory}} in which to study relationships between economy and architecture. In this city, tremendous power is held by {{both the state and}} in private capital. Urban form may be read as a tangible spatial manifestation both calculated and inadvertent, of a historic model of economic development since its origins as a colonial outpost living in borrowed times. Significantly, housing dominates the urban landscape and the city’s economic underpinnings. The housing-led economic urban system is not a reflection of market rationality. Instead, it is a complex and protracted attempt to preserve its land system. In colonial history, British authorities relied on the leasing of lands to control its ongoing development and to benefit from its ongoing economic growth. Today, although the model allows administrators to finance the government and maintain low direct taxation, it also requires the perpetuation of spatial distortions and the inflation of housing prices. These distortions result in a housing system that divides its population into two equally populous economic classes: defined by the difference between public and private home ownership. Using a combination of photographs, illustrations, textual documentation, and spatial and statistical analyses, this thesis explores the social, economic and spatial impact of value maximization in four key areas: Sovereignty, Price, Density and Efficiency. These measures of productivity respectively address the domains of power, market, urban geography and architectural morphology. Hong Kong’s housing infrastructure is framed as a calibrated production, optimising all four aspects identified at the cost of chronic housing unaffordability. As space is designed for the abstract value it represents, Hong Kong has refined a rigorous process of spatial design that is paradoxically non-spatial, which has led to a homogenization of spatial forms amidst growing <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> The identification of spatial distortions and operations integral to the model’s logical irrationality is the primary intent of this thesis. 4 month...|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{problems}} associated with large housing estates in Western Europe are emerging in Slovenia. Others, such as vacancies and high turnover, have yet to become significant problems in Slovenia. Moreover, {{the problems}} arising from poor construction are far less prevalent in Slovenia than in the West due to greater regulating control over construction standards after 1963 aimed at protecting buildings from earthquakes. Following the extensive privatization of the social housing stock after 1991, a range of new problems have emerged in Slovenia. There are already indications that the unsuccessful handling of maintenance problems after the introduction of housing reform, coupled with the absence of relevant legislative backup, may lead to the worsening of living conditions in some of the country's large housing estates. Owing also to the growing <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> of the inhabitants {{as a consequence of the}} shift to a market-based economy, the transition period has also been marked by a slow but steady trend of outward migration of better-off households from large housing estates to more favourable locations. Consequently, there is a risk that, in the first place, the large housing estates might become residential enclaves of low-income households. This may, in turn, lead to their degradation and the corresponding negative attributes of such neighbourhoods. This paper discusses the outcomes of research carried out at the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia on the development of appropriate methods for the renovation of large housing estates. Guided by the research findings and supported by an extensive review of the various renewal strategies that have been applied in different countries, we propose a framework for the regeneration of large housing estates in Slovenia. This framework represents a comprehensive approach to housing estate renewal and improvement, extending from the physical analysis of the buildings and their surroundings to the evaluation of the measures as implemented. Proposals for administrative, legislative and financial measures necessary to support the framework are also put forward. Housing Renewal Housing Management Slovenia,...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} consequences of internal migration to Santa Cruz, an expanding urban center in lowland Bolivia whose growth stems from uneven regional development. Regional divisions between the highlands and the lowlands have long afflicted Bolivia. The roots of the regional differences predate the country's independence, but they have intensified {{in the past decade}} amid unresolved power struggles between Bolivia's central government and the opposition based in the lowland region, as recent events in Bolivia over regional autonomies have demonstrated. Drawing on the perspectives of political geography, urban planning, and sociology, this study examines the processes of migrant integration and social exclusion in Santa Cruz, and how migration is affecting regional identity formation in Bolivia's lowland region. In Chapter 2, I explore the historical construction of the eastern lowlands region, called the Oriente. I trace its transformation from an isolated frontier to Bolivia's major production zone and the emergence of the regional elite though periods of economic change based on extractive industries. Chapter 3 shifts the focus to the city of Santa Cruz and argues that modernist planning in the 1950 s and 1960 s did not coincide with the realities of mass urban migration that ensued. I also suggest that migration-induced population growth and shifts in the local economy toward services and informal employment are creating particular patterns of urban growth and deepening <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> In Chapter 4, I analyze migrant integration and social exclusion through migrant interviews in several urban districts, the ways that civil society organizations potentially intermediate between migrants and longerterm residents, and connections between migrants and local institutions. Chapter 5 examines the connections between migration flows, growth of the informal economy, and conflicts over public space in Santa Cruz as a window into the dynamics of migrant integration and exclusion. I investigate the spatial dimensions of informal commerce in the city and analyze a municipal plan for reorganization of public markets, as well as contrasting visions of public space from planners, long-term residents, informal workers, and migrants. In the perspective taken here, struggles over public space reflect unresolved tensions around race, ethnicity, and space in a changing city...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse {{migration}} and socio-economic differentiation in rural and urban spaces: where people move, what the characteristics of migrants are and whether experiences of rural and urban space affect attitudes toward the local living environment and place attachment. The background consists of five themes discussing different aspects of socio-economic differentiation and selective migration, for example polarization and rural gentrification. Integrated in the five themes are summaries of the four papers. The first paper, The divided city? Socio-economic changes in Stockholm metropolitan area, 1970 - 1994, analyses the income distribution in the Stockholm metropolitan area using residential area statistics regarding income among residents. The results show that polarization and segregation has increased during the study period. The second paper, The attraction of the rural: Characteristics of rural migrants, analyses the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of migrants to the countryside in Sweden using individual register data. The results show that urban areas attract the young, the highly educated and those with high income while rural areas attract older migrants, the self employed and families, but when comparing rural areas, periurban countrysides were more attractive to those with high income and education than more remote areas.   The third paper, Rural gentrification as a migration process: Evidence from Sweden, focuses on rural gentrification as a migration process {{and is based on}} an analysis of register data. The results show that rural gentrification in the remote countrysides of Sweden is of marginal importance. In the fourth paper, Place attachment and attitudes among young adults in rural/urban spaces, young adults’ (25 - 40 years of age) attitudes toward the rural/urban qualities of their local living environment and their place attachments are investigated using a survey. The results show that most people appreciate the environment they live in and they are also attached to this place. However, urban residents with a rural background seem less pleased with and are less attached to their present environment. In conclusion, migration selectivity works to reinforce both patterns of segregation and patterns of ageing. There is indication of both demographic and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> between and within rural and urban areas and this polarization is reinforced by selective migration flows. However, the results also indicate that rural areas are attractive living environments to many, particularly the periurban countryside and {{that there may be a}} rural migration potential among urban residents with a rural background...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Currently, {{the global}} agenda of {{sustainability}} {{and sustainable development}} have become the yardstick to which human activities are measured. The concept of sustainability is known to contain directives, when implemented will ensure that resources are used in ways that can benefit current and future generations. The ways in which spatial planning and urban development occur have also become relevant in this respect. Within this premise, urban form has also become relevant to the urban sustainability. Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre is a private development modeled {{on the concept of}} New Urbanism. The concept of New Urbanism is known to contain elements which respond positively to current urban challenges such as urban sprawl, increased pollution from automobile dependency and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> In essence, New Urbanism purports to contribute towards urban sustainability. The main objective of this research has been to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} current developments in Umhlanga Ridge satisfy the principles of New Urbanism and urban sustainability. This included the identification of appropriate indicators of a sustainable urban form. Emphasis was made on how the indicators of urban form had manifested in the development of Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the impacts they have had on identified urban challenges in the Ethekwini Municipality. The rationale was that sustainable urban development must be able to address local urban challenges and promote sustainable practices within the private and the public domain. The methodology for this research included the use of secondary and primary sources. Interviews were conducted with Tongaat Hulett Development in their capacity as a land owner and planners of the Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre. The Ethekwini Municipality was also interviewed with respect to what impacts this development had had on their overall long-term development strategy. Three renowned planners who had adequate knowledge of urban development trends in the Ethekwini Municipality were also interviewed. A questionnaire survey was undertaken with users of the Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre to gain their perceptions on urban form in relation to their needs. The research revealed that the application of New Urbanism in the development of Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre was partly an investment initiative for profit-maximisation as well as a response to sustainable practices in urban development. Being part of a major investment node in the Ethekwini region, it had contributed towards job creation and enhanced the economic base of the region. However, it was found to have partially fulfilled the principles of New Urbanism used in the assessment. It was concluded that the application of New Urbanism in urban development was not adequate to achieve urban sustainability but provided lessons which can be learnt such the use of high densities to enhance compaction and the creation of a living environment which supported non-motorised forms of transport. Private sector participation and buy-in into the long-term vision of regions had also become necessary to enhance the adoption of sustainable practices into the future...|$|E
