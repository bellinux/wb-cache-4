30|$|Data are {{reported}} as mean ± SD or as median [IQ], unless otherwise <b>specified,</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Statistical significance {{was defined as}} p <  0.05. Baseline and physiologic variables were compared by Student’s t test for variables that were normally distributed and by Mann–Whitney U test for variables that were not normally distributed and by Chi-square test for qualitative variables. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between variables and to describe linear segment of the volume/pressure curve. Three-way ANOVA was {{used to describe the}} effects of the presence of the disease, the level of PEEP and tidal volume. Bonferroni’s t test was employed to correct for multiple comparisons. Power least squares fitting was used to describe the shape of the volume/pressure curve shape. Analysis was performed using SigmaPlot software, version 12.0 (Systat, Chicago, IL).|$|R
30|$|The CMP {{consists}} of three members: the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities are each represented by a Member appointed by their respective leaders, while the Third Member is nominated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and is appointed by the UN Secretary-General. The Committee Members make decisions {{on the basis of}} consensus, and the mandate clearly states the CMP’s humanitarian mission (Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus 2015 a). One should note that the Committee will never seek or attribute responsibility for the death of a missing person or the circumstances of their death. It will, however, as stated in Article 13, make every effort to compile a comprehensive list regarding each community’s missing persons, <b>specifying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate,</b> whether they are alive or dead and, in the latter case, the approximate time of death.|$|R

Milton Mayfield. received his PhD in management from the University of Alabama in 1994, with a specialization in research methods. Milton has done extensive consulting work on effective organizational communication and improving group performance. He is also a Visiting Professor of Management at Radford University. Both authors share first authorship, order is alphabetical. Executive Summary This paper proposes a training/research agenda for teaching leaders strategic language. Strategic language is defined by motivating language theory (Sullivan, 1988) as leader-to-subordinate oral communication that increases the likelihood of such desirable worker outcomes as high performance levels and job satisfaction. Motivating language has been further <b>specified</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate</b> use of the following speech act categories: 1) Direction-Giving, 2) Empathetic, and 3) Meaning-Making. Motivating language theory and its predictions have received strong support from previous research, including scale development and model testing. The proposed next step is implementation through organizational diagnosis and training programs...|$|R
40|$|Evidence-based continuums {{have become}} a guide for {{identifying}} the level of evidence in evaluations of home visiting programs conducted to determine their effectiveness in preventing child abuse and neglect. While randomized controlled trials are required for {{the highest levels of}} evidence, quasi-experimental designs have also been <b>specified</b> <b>as</b> an <b>appropriate</b> alternative. Using a quasi-experimental evaluation of a home visiting program to prevent child abuse and neglect that adheres to the Healthy Families America model, this paper describes and illustrates how types of validity can be improved. More specifically, we address how threats to internal validity can be identified and reduced through statistical techniques; how construct validity may be strengthened using state records to measure the outcomes; and how external validity is affected by including or excluding study participants. After applying a variety of statistical adjustments to reduce selection bias, we found that the outcomes favored the home visiting program and increased after accounting for covariates that contributed to child abuse and neglect. This was true across the statistical techniques (traditional covariate and propensity score adjustment) used. For evaluations using quasi-experimental designs, recommendations relevant to the illustrations in the paper are also presented.

40|$|About the book: As {{ethnography}} {{enters the}} twenty-first century, {{it has been}} transformed from a method of research standing {{on the edges of}} mainstream social science theory and research. Ethnography now attracts widespread interest, not only from anthropology and sociology but also from many other genres. The four distinctive idioms of qualitative inquiry—naturalism, ethnomethodology, emotionalism, and postmodernism—each use field research to pursue different questions and concerns, posit different versions of “the field,” and <b>specify</b> different methods <b>as</b> <b>appropriate</b> for doing so. Emerson provides comprehensive reviews of core issues, reflecting the increased acceptance of and growing divergences among current ethnographic approaches. In addition, he addresses concerns central both to earlier periods of field research, particularly those marking the beginnings of the reflexive turn, and to those raised by contemporary, more radically representational and postmodern approaches to ethnography...|$|R
