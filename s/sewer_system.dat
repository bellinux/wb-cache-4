5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which {{allowed it to}} set up a {{self-contained}} water and <b>sewer</b> <b>system.</b> Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did not immediately develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E
5|$|The sinkhole's {{collapse}} in Guatemala City's Zona 2 left at least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at risk. Because {{of the role}} played by sewage pipes in the sinkhole's collapse, Sam Bonis, along with other geologists, has demanded that the government inspect the <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> more regularly.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the first}} <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> in the United States were built as {{combined}} sewers (carrying both storm water and sewerage). They discharged into rivers, lakes and the sea without any treatment. The main reason for choosing combined <b>sewers</b> over separate <b>systems</b> (separating sanitary <b>sewers</b> from storm water drains) was a belief that combined <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> were cheaper to build than separate systems. Also, there was no European precedent for successful separate <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> at the time. The first large-scale <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> in the United States were constructed in Chicago and Brooklyn in the late 1850s, followed by other major U.S. cities.|$|R
40|$|First {{section of}} this master thesis is {{background}} research of energy demand of <b>sewer</b> <b>systems.</b> Intrudoctory chapter explains basic concepts. Second chapter is dealing with Czech and European legislation concerning energy consumption of water service. Third chapter describes energy demand of <b>sewer</b> <b>systems.</b> In this chapter there are described conventional gravity, vakuum and pressure <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> and components with major power consumption. Fourth chapter describes actual state of energy demand of WWTP and possible ways of improving power consumption of WWTP. Second section is a review of energy consumtion of vacuum systems of five different municipalities including one WWTP.

40|$|Part 1 : Environmental Application in the Scope of the Future InternetInternational audienceWe {{discuss how}} Delft-FEWS {{is applied to}} {{incorporate}} real-time sensor data and dynamic modeling to allow Real Time Control (RTC) of three <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the area of}} the Hoeksche Waard, the Netherlands. The purpose of this project was to reduce sewerage spilling to the surface water by optimizing the available storage in the <b>sewer</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper we will present how Delft-FEWS makes use of Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) webservices to exchange real-time data with multiple <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> and their different Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. We will also explain how we combine this with dynamic models, allowing for central automatic control of multiple <b>sewer</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Bazalgette's work {{ensured that}} sewage {{was no longer}} dumped onto {{the shores of the}} Thames and brought an end to the cholera outbreaks; his actions {{probably}} saved more lives than any other Victorian official. His <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> operates into the 21st century, servicing a city that has grown to a population of over eight million. The historian Peter Ackroyd argues that Bazalgette should be considered a hero of London.|$|E
5|$|Jerome manages its own water system, {{sourced by}} 10 {{mountain}} springs. The town's annual water report for 2016 assured residents that Jerome's water met all {{state and federal}} requirements and was safe to drink. Jerome administers its own <b>sewer</b> <b>system,</b> trash collection, and recycling services. Its public works department maintains the equipment and infrastructure associated with these systems as well the water system, streets, parks, and other city property.|$|E
50|$|Plumbing smoke {{tests are}} also used to find places where pipes will spill fluid, and to check {{sanitary}} <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> for places where ground water and storm runoff can enter.

5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various {{attempts were made}} by the local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council were unhappy about a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A mains <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> was only installed in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Beatty's {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} first half of the 20thcentury, rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950. The first reliable electric company in the community, Amargosa Power Company, began supplying electricity in about 1940. Phone service arrived during World War II, and the town installed a community-wide <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> in the 1970s. When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988, the population briefly surged from about 1,000 to between 1,500 and 2,000 by the end of 1990. Since the mine's closing in 1998, the population has fallen again to near its former level.|$|E
5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and <b>sewer</b> <b>system,</b> new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E

50|$|Separate {{sanitary}} <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> {{are designed}} to transport sewage alone. In municipalities served by sanitary sewers, separate storm drains may convey surface runoff directly to surface waters. Sanitary sewers are distinguished from combined sewers, which combine sewage with stormwater runoff in one pipe. Sanitary <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> are beneficial because they avoid combined sewer overflows.|$|R
5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the <b>sewer</b> <b>system,</b> village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{development was}} {{the construction of}} a network of sewers to collect wastewater. In some cities, including Rome, Istanbul (Constantinople) and Fustat, networked ancient <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> continue to function today as collection systems for those cities' modernized <b>sewer</b> <b>systems.</b> Instead of flowing to a river or the sea, the pipes have been re-routed to modern sewer treatment facilities.|$|R
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a combined <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|Store Norske {{underwent}} a gradual change during the 1980s. Since 1980, Spitsbergen {{money has been}} taken out of circulation and replaced with ordinary Norwegian currency. Mine 6 closed the following year. From 1982, SNSK permitted private individuals to own and operate cars. By 1990, there were 353 registered cars and 883 snowscooters. On 1 July 1983, SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen. Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company that was responsible for public infrastructure and services, was established by SNSK on 1 January 1989. Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire brigade, the kindergarten, roads, rubbish disposal, power production, the water and <b>sewer</b> <b>system,</b> the cinema, cultural actives and the library. Ownership was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993.|$|E

50|$|To {{counter the}} problem, towns {{are trying to}} {{institute}} new programs and procedures to reduce the levels of nitrogen present {{in the waters of}} Cape Cod. A common solution that has been brought up is installing new town-wide <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> to prevent runoff from septic tanks reaching the waters, since <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> release less nitrogen into the environment than private septic tanks.|$|R

5|$|The Kiautschou Bay concession, as {{it became}} known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the {{imperial}} province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (Schantung-Halbinsel) in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposals}} faced strong {{objections from}} the Metropolitan and District Railways (MR and DR) whose routes on the Inner Circle, {{to the north}} and the south respectively, the CLR route paralleled; and from which the new line was expected to take passengers. The City Corporation also objected, concerned about potential damage to buildings close to the route caused by subsidence as was experienced during the construction of the C The Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral objected, concerned about the risks of undermining the cathedral's foundations. Sir Joseph Bazalgette objected that the tunnels would damage the city's <b>sewer</b> <b>system.</b> The bill was approved by the House of Commons, but was rejected by the House of Lords, which recommended that any decision be postponed until after the C had opened and its operation could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E
50|$|Effluent <b>sewer</b> <b>systems,</b> {{as well as}} all <b>sewer</b> <b>systems,</b> can use {{two methods}} to {{transport}} wastewater to a treatment facility. These methods are gravity and pumping, also called pressure systems. Gravity systems use pipes that are laid on a slight downhill slope to transport wastewater. Effluent pumping systems have pipes that are buried at a constant depth, such as a metre and a half, and rely on pumping stations that create pressure to move the waste to a treatment facility. An effluent sewer that uses gravity may be called a septic tank effluent gravity (STEG) system, while a pumping system may be called a septic tank effluent pumping (STEP) system. It is also possible to have a hybrid system that uses gravity and pumping. Gravity and pumping effluent <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> both have advantages and disadvantages. The best type of system to use depends on the area it will be serving. Factors such as population size, topography, groundwater level, as well as locations for pumping stations and the treatment plant, must be taken into account. STEG systems {{should not be confused with}} traditional <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> that use gravity to transport untreated sewage to a wastewater treatment plant, which are typically referred to as gravity <b>sewer</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{quality and}} functional efficiency of <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> are key parameters {{to guarantee the}} transfer of domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater to treatment plants without infiltration nor exfiltration. Infiltration of groundwater is particularly detrimental to treatment plant efficiency, while exfiltration of wastewater can lead to groundwater contamination. The APUSS project associating universities, SMEs and municipalities in 7 European countries, developed new methods and techniques to assess and quantify infiltration and exfiltration (I/E) in <b>sewer</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper describes {{the establishment of a}} set of performance indicators (PI) developed {{to assess the impact of}} I/E on <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> and their application to three project case studies, in Italy and France, focusing on <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> characteristics, I/E measurements campaigns and PI application results. The methodology for PI definition consists in the selection and development of a sewer network property or state variable, which is expressive of aspects being scrutinized (I/E); the PI values are then calculated; finally, a classification of the PI values is made in relation to good or bad performance. The use of PI allows a standardized and objective comparison of the performance of <b>sewer</b> <b>systems</b> and constitutes a means to technically support the establishment of priorities for rehabilitation and/or construction investments taking into account I/E impacts...|$|R
