And regardless of which sports specific skill, this concept remains constant. First, movement occurs in the most distal of the total swing lever system and progressively moves to each component one increment closer to the final impact point. And this movement sequence is common for tennis, golf, baseball and similar hitting skills. First the knees, which initiate rotation and forward movement of hips, which in turn initiate upper trunk and shoulder rotation, before progressively bringing upper and lower arms into play, followed by wrist and fingers which impart the final control and speed to the club, racket or stick. For ultimate success it is equally important that perfect swing timing occurs in the correct Swing Plane as determined by anticipated ball contact point, intended direction of ball flight, and the desired <b>spin</b> <b>effect</b> to be imparted to ball.|$|E

5000|$|... {{and is a}} <b>spin</b> <b>effect</b> {{known as}} {{helicity}} suppression. Its mechanism is as follows: The negative pion has spin zero, therefore the lepton and antineutrino must be emitted with opposite spins (and opposite linear momenta) to preserve net zero spin (and conserve linear momentum). However, because the weak interaction is sensitive only to the left chirality component of fields, the antineutrino has always chirality left, which means it is right-handed, since for massless anti-particles the helicity is opposite to the chirality. This implies that the lepton must be emitted with spin {{in the direction of}} its linear momentum (i.e., also right-handed). If, however, leptons were massless, they would only interact with the pion in the left-handed form (because for massless particles helicity is the same as chirality) and this decay mode would be prohibited. Therefore, suppression of the electron decay channel {{comes from the fact that}} the electron's mass is much smaller than the muon's. The electron is thus relatively massless compared with the muon, and thus the electronic mode is almost prohibited. Although this explanation suggests that parity violation is causing the helicity suppression, it should be emphasized that the fundamental reason lies in the vector-nature of the interaction which demands a different handedness for the neutrino and the charged lepton. Thus, even a parity conserving interaction would yield the same suppression.|$|E

On these assumptions, {{we find that the}} curve of the PRV is distorted by the planetary spin and this anomaly is characterized by spin radial velocity at equator and a projected angle on a celestial plane between the spin axis and the axis of orbital motion λ_p in a manner analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

40|$|Study of some {{recently}} developed quantum kinetic models, by employing these models for linear wave analysis, {{is the primary}} purpose of this dissertation. We have focussed here that how these newly developed models take into account the quantum effects that arise due to electron degeneracy,quantum Bohm-potential and <b>spin</b> quantum <b>effects</b> related to electron paramagnetism. In {{the first part of the}} work presented in the thesis, we have studied an electron-positron-ion degenerate Fermi gas, with or without the Madelung term. We have proposed the existence of a new type of zero-sound wave that exhibit a damping character in contrast to the usual undamped zero-sound waves, present in a degenerate electron-ion plasma. In an electron-hole-ion plasma, we have found new type of longitudinal quantum sound waves that have no analogies in quantum electron-ion plasma. The excitation of these quantum sound waves by a low-density monoenergetic straight electron beam has also been examined. In the second part of the work, we have focussed on the electron <b>spin</b> paramagnetic <b>effects.</b> Employing the non-relativistic spin quantum kinetic theory, we have studied the <b>effect</b> of electron <b>spin</b> on the kinetic AlfvÂ´en waves in an electron-ion plasma. We deduce that the usual kinetic AlfvÂ´en waves are modified via <b>spin</b> quantum <b>effects</b> of electrons. The dimensionless parameters that determine the relative importance of the electron spin become prominent at higher densities. It is found that the kinetic AlfvÂ´en wave frequency decreases due to the electron spin contribution in the kinetic limit while in the inertial limit they are almost unaffected in a hot magnetized plasma. A drawback of the non-relativistic spin quantum kinetic theory is that it does not capture <b>spin</b> <b>effects</b> for electrostatic wave modes. To remove this drawback, we have derived a general dispersion relation for electrostatic modes by employing {{recently developed}} weakly-relativistic quantum kinetic theory of spin quantum plasmas. This model contains weakly-relativistic <b>spin</b> <b>effects</b> such as Thomas precession, the polarization currents associated with the spin and also the spin-orbit coupling. It turns out that for strictly electrostaticperturbations the non relativistic <b>spin</b> <b>effects</b> vanish, and the modification of the classical dispersion relation is solely associated with the relativistic terms. Several new wave modes appear due the electron <b>spin</b> <b>effects.</b> As a particular example, we have studied weak-relativistic effects for Bernstein waves in a fully degenerate plasma and proposed the existence of new waves due to the electron <b>spin</b> <b>effects,</b> that have frequency close to the Bernstein wave frequency...|$|R
