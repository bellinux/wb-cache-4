5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E
5|$|The disease {{arrived in}} the South Pacific on the cargo vessel , which sailed from Auckland on 30 October 1918 whilst knowingly {{carrying}} sick passengers. Talune stopped in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Nauru: the first outbreaks in these locations occurred {{within days of the}} ships visits. The local authorities were generally unprepared for the size of the outbreak, allowing the infection to spread uncontrollably. The German territory of Samoa was the worst affected of the small islands, the New Zealand administration carried out no efforts to lessen the outbreak and rejected offers of assistance from nearby American Samoa. The New Zealand government officially apologised to Samoa in 2002 for their reaction to the outbreak. On 29 November 1918 the military governor of Apia requested assistance from Wellington; the request was turned down because all doctors were needed in New Zealand. Australia offered the only alternate <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{third wave}} of migration, in particular, has helped Chinese {{influence}} to proliferate amongst its nearby neighbors. China has established close {{economic and military}} ties with both Myanmar and Laos. Its trade with Thailand is booming significantly and so are their political exchanges. China is Cambodia's closest foreign ally, and a growing <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> trade and migration for the country. Due to the large-scale migration of its people and the many countries in which Chinese have settled and exerted their influence, China has {{emerged as one of}} the most influential global powers.|$|E
30|$|American Red Cross, Salvation Army, church organizations, {{community-based}} organizations, and {{the local}} bank were <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> analyzed under the rubrics <b>of</b> community-based <b>aid</b> organizations. These organizations were grouped together because they relied primarily on local volunteer labor to organize and sustain them, and they directly incorporate some levels of local leadership in their functional operations, though they were still considered formal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> All community-based groups required an application process {{and the ability to}} show financial need to receive aid from them. All of them were heavily accessed in the recovery process (over 50 % of respondents stated they had received help from one or more <b>of</b> these community-based <b>sources).</b>|$|R
30|$|Researchers {{attempted}} {{to gauge the}} strength of cultural norms in the recovery process by determining where (<b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid)</b> people sought assistance and how many different types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> where provided by each source. The fundamental idea being that the more types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> a <b>source</b> provided, the fewer number <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> a household would have to reach-out to. The research covered the entire recovery processes as set forth by Quarantelli (1991), {{from the moment of}} impact (i.e., warning [or lack thereof], emergency sheltering, temporary sheltering, temporary housing, and to permanent housing). This article focuses primarily on the latter half <b>of</b> the survey: <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for housing recovery, though previous research has shown that there is a tendency for disenfranchised households to “adopt” temporary housing as a permanent solution to a sheltering crisis (Phillips 1993; Quarantelli 1991).|$|R
30|$|Families, friends, employers, {{and churches}} were also {{important}} <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for {{the replacement of}} household items and clothing needs. These aid sources seemed to focus their assistance on non-monetary forms <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> specifically through the distribution of excess inventory items such as household goods or donations provided in-kind. The survey showed that content losses, such as clothing, appliances, and furniture, were easier to obtain through non-profit and informal relief sources than assistance for structural repairs, though this often did not matter, if a household {{did not have a}} permanent home, or place to store things. The Red Cross and Salvation Army assisted primarily with food and the replacement of belongings, such as appliances, clothing, and other household items. The ease of content replacement is an indication to the type of help that is perceived as “appropriate,” and easy for a community to galvanize around (Rossé 1993). Formal community-based <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> such as Red Cross, Salvation Army, local governmental entities, and even in the informal sector, such as neighbors and employers, did not show significant variations in the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> accessed between Anglos and combined minorities. However, when comparing Anglos to each ethnic group separately, through an ANOVA, significant differences were evident between Anglos and African-Americans. Albeit, none <b>of</b> these <b>sources</b> were important in the housing recovery process.|$|R
25|$|Maldives {{is located}} south of India's Lakshadweep Islands in the Indian Ocean. Both nations {{established}} diplomatic relations after {{the independence of}} Maldives from British rule in 1966. India {{was one of the}} first nations to recognize Maldives' independence. Since then, India and Maldives have developed close strategic, military, economic and cultural relations. India has supported Maldives' policy of keeping regional issues and struggles away from itself, and the latter has seen friendship with India as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> as well as a counterbalance to Sri Lanka, which is in proximity to the island nation and its largest trading partner.|$|E

30|$|This {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} most common form <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> received {{came in the form of}} replacing belongings (over 82 % of respondents stated they received this type <b>of</b> <b>aid).</b> Previous research has showed that most non-profit and informal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> provide assistance primarily in the form of emergency and temporary housing or replacing belongings (i.e., vouchers and/or products), not direct, fungible assistance (Bolin 2006). Significant differences between ethnic groups existed only in regards to type <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> with rebuilding materials, and labor and services. These are the two most crucial types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for the physical restoration of a housing structure; even though, rebuilding materials was the type <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> least often received by all groups. The main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> used to actually purchase rebuilding materials appears to have come from FEMA and/or SBA loans. Since minorities were at a distinct disadvantage in receiving substantial amounts <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> from either <b>source,</b> as discussed previously, they did not receive much of this type <b>of</b> federal <b>aid.</b>|$|R
50|$|Financial aid is {{available}} for those who qualify at all three community colleges. There are several <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>aid</b> available at all three community colleges such as federal and state monies. Some <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> are only available at one or two colleges but not all three such as grants or scholarships aimed to aid students attending the endorsed college or enrolled in a particular academic study as agreed between the college and the endowing institution. Students are advice to visit their colleges financial aid office or website for information as each financial aid program has its own requirements, procedures and deadlines.|$|R
3000|$|Next, {{researchers}} {{looked at}} <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> {{to see if}} some {{may have been more}} important in the housing recovery process because of the amount <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> provided. Since {{there was no way to}} quantify the actual value <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> received from each category, types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> were compared to sources, with that idea that an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> assistance would provide aid in multiple formats. Researchers were attempting to capture the reliance a household placed on any one source. This was not an ideal analysis since there was no way to capture many of the economic externalities that are essential to the recovery process. But, it does give one a sense of the importance <b>of</b> the various <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> For example, if family provided assistance with all types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> listed (i.e., rent, replacing belongs, building materials, and labor or services), then family could be assumed to be an invaluable <b>source</b> <b>of</b> help because of the breadth of services provided, even if the depth of that service could not be measured. A combined measurement was developed for the number of types of assistance provided by every source, and is referred to as the “variation in types of aid.” [...]...|$|R

40|$|The social {{files and}} medical records of 98 acutely {{battered}} wives {{who attended a}} surgical emergency department were studied. Although all women had been hospitalized during the decade preceding the present incident, wife battering was documented in the records in only 18 %.

The measures taken by the social services to help the battered women consisted mainly of economic support and psychotherapy. The cooperation between the medical and social services and the police in cases of wife battering was very limited or non-existent. It is concluded that support given to battered women by the formal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> is insufficient. The documentation of the cases is poor, there is a lack of practical measures and the cooperation between the authorities is limited. This study indicates that the social and medical services underestimate the importance <b>of</b> informal help <b>sources</b> like women's groups or shelters which often are the most valued resources by the battered women themselves. With improved cooperation between authorities and between formal and informal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> the battered wives could be helped more effectively...|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} greatest statistical differences lie between rebuilding materials for African-Americans and Anglos, and Hispanics and Anglos.
