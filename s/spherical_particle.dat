40|$|The phase {{behaviour}} of {{a single}} large semiflexible polymer immersed in a suspension of <b>spherical</b> <b>particles</b> is studied. All interactions are simple excluded volume interactions and {{the diameter of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>particles</b> is an order of magnitude larger than the diameter of the polymer. The <b>spherical</b> <b>particles</b> induce a quite long ranged depletion attraction between the segments of the polymer and this induces a continuous coil-globule transition in the polymer. This behaviour gives an indication of the condensing effect of macromolecular crowding on DNA. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
2500|$|Zamilon is a virophage, a {{group of}} small DNA viruses that infect protists and require a helper virus to replicate; they are a type of {{satellite}} virus. Discovered in 2013 in Tunisia, infecting Acanthamoeba polyphaga amoebae, Zamilon most closely resembles Sputnik, the first virophage to be discovered. The name is Arabic for [...] "the neighbour". Its <b>spherical</b> <b>particle</b> is 50–60nm in diameter, and contains a circular double-stranded DNA genome of around 17kb, which is predicted to encode 20 polypeptides. A related strain, Zamilon 2, has been identified in North America.|$|E
2500|$|For low {{values of}} the Reynolds number (<1), true for most aerosol motion, Stokes' law {{describes}} the force of resistance on a solid <b>spherical</b> <b>particle</b> in a fluid. However, Stokes' law is only valid when the velocity of the gas at {{the surface of the}} particle is zero. For small particles (< 1 μm) that characterize aerosols, however, this assumption fails. To account for this failure, one can introduce the Cunningham correction factor, always greater than 1. Including this factor, one finds the relation between the resisting force on a particle and its velocity: ...|$|E
2500|$|Aerosols vary {{in their}} dispersity. [...] A {{monodisperse}} aerosol, producible in the laboratory, contains particles of uniform size. [...] Most aerosols, however, as polydisperse colloidal systems, exhibit a range of particle sizes. Liquid droplets are almost always nearly spherical, but scientists use an equivalent diameter to characterize the properities of various shapes of solid particles, some very irregular. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a <b>spherical</b> <b>particle</b> with the same value of some physical property as the irregular particle. The equivalent volume diameter (de) {{is defined as the}} diameter of a sphere of the same volume as that of the irregular particle. Also commonly used is the aerodynamic diameter.|$|E
