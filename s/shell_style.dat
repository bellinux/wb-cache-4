5000|$|Napoleon III showed {{personal}} interest in the mitrailleuse. Montigny had approached the French army {{for the purpose of}} a sale. Experiments to evaluate the weapon began in 1863 in a French facility near Paris but {{the decision was made to}} build a similar weapon by sole French means. [...] Manufacture began at Meudon in 1866 under the direction of Verch√®res de Reffye and the undisclosed assistance of Montigny. Hence the weapon is usually known as the [...] "Reffye mitrailleuse". Altogether 215 mitrailleuses were manufactured for the French Army before the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. They were of the 13mm, 25-barrels type, and used elongated shotgun <b>shell</b> <b>style</b> cartridges instead of foil cartridges as in the Montigny mitrailleuse. The weapon, which was on an artillery carriage, was deployed in six gun batteries and manned by artillery personnel. Most of the time, they were used quite ineffectively to engage distant targets. When the weapon was engaged at the Battle of Gravelotte in 1871, in an infantry support role and at shorter distances, it produced devastating effects.|$|E

25|$|Hemphill style pottery spans {{most of the}} 14th and {{the first}} half of the 15th century CE In this time period there were more than likely only a few potters working in this style at any one time and in some cases archaeologists have found {{signature}} features that suggest a specific potter made multiple known examples.

These earlier pieces also show more influences from outside thematic sources, specifically early Walls Phase and late Braden <b>style</b> <b>shell</b> engravings from the Central Mississippi Valley. As the 15th century progressed, less competency is shown by the potters, which may indicate that less importance was attached to this particular artform.|$|R

5000|$|The Richmond depot {{produced}} several {{variations of}} jackets, trousers, and caps; including militia styled uniforms {{authorized by the}} Confederate Government for construction and distribution. The most common items produced, are the Richmond Depot <b>style</b> <b>shell</b> jacket, the Trousers, and the Kepi. The materials used by the Richmond Depot, were produced by the Crenshaw Wool Mill, in Richmond, Virginia, near the Tredegar Iron Works, {{both of which were}} burnt down in mid-1863. The wool produced by this mill was a medium to bright cadet grey, often in 60 inch-wide bolts, with the blankets being produced in 60 √ó 80 in, probably of the same cadet grey material. Later in the war, imported dark cadet grey kersey, known as [...] "English Army cloth", was being used in the domestically produced jackets, trousers, and caps, as well as the complete uniforms brought through the blockade by companies, such as Peter Tait of Limerick, Ireland. These uniforms started to become commonplace in the Army of Northern Virginia {{and the rest of the}} Confederate States Army later in the war. Battle flags were also produced by the depot from early 1862 to the end of the war in Virginia. These flags were made using captured red, blue, and white bunting stock from the captured Norfolk Naval yards.

40|$|High {{pressure}} screw plug (also called breech lock) exchangers are {{arguably the most}} complicated bolted connection in a refinery. After traveling around the world helping facilities turn these exchangers from chronic leakers (from internal tubesheet and external diaphragm and B <b>style</b> <b>shell</b> leaks) {{to one of the}} most reliable heat exchangers in the plant, it is very clear to me that manufacturers, engineers and mechanics struggle to correctly understand the interactions between gaskets, internal pressure, the two circles of external push bolts that are part of A style exchangers and all the internal parts. Some manufactuers have given up on trying to make these connections operate leak free, and prefer to weld in the tubesheets and diaphragms. This significantly adds to the cost and time needed to open and close these exchangers, as special equipment is needed to machine out the parts and weld them back together again. There are a handful of equipment manufacturers that build these exchangers, and while there are differences from one manufacturer to the next, once the basic design is understood, the reader should be able understand that they are all basically the same when it comes to the few critical steps that must be followed when opening and closing these exchangers. In order to obtain reliable leak free performance, all the basic sealing tools must be employed, including: 1. A spreadsheet that will easily analyze the critical variables; 2. Correct gasket selection; 3. Correct assembly procedures that focus on important steps including proper spacing of internal parts and obtaining consistent thread friction; 4. And finally hot torqueing the exchangers after startup. The goal of this paper to provide the end-user with a good understanding for how parts interact and how the bolted connections function, so that they might also achieve reliable, leak free performance.
