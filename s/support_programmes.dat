Its current chairman is Dr. Leong Che Hung, GBS, JP (Traditional Chinese: 梁智鴻). When the Foundation was founded, public understanding towards AIDS was limited and misconceptions about AIDS (e.g., that AIDS is a contagious disease) were common, leading to widespread discrimination against patients infected with AIDS. Recently, the Foundation has a full-time staff of 13 but relies heavily on over 300 volunteers to maintain services such as telephone hotlines, blood testing and counselling, and <b>support</b> <b>programmes</b> for people living with AIDS.|$|E

This {{research}} {{is about the}} enhancement of the Grade 1 learner's social and emotional development through a music <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> The aim {{of this research was}} to determine how a music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> could enhance the social and emotional development of Grade 1 learners through a music <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> To achieve this goal, data were gathered through a literature study and empirical study. The empirical study was performed by way of semi constructed interviews with the Grade 1 learners' teacher to assemble the empirical data. The results indicated that the Grade 1 learners manifested social and emotional difficulties and that the music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> was effective for those learners' social and emotional development. Recommendations from the study include: • schools should consider a music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> on a permanent basis. • The community must be introduced to the music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> because the concept is still unknown. • To help children with social-emotional behavioural problems, schools can raise a fund that will help these learners to develop through a music <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> • Schools and/or a music support presenter can give parental guidance and can set up a programme for parents.

The plans would relieve overcrowding and improve reliability on all lines, support housing growth, (as {{laid out in the}} London Plan) [...] and <b>support</b> <b>programmes</b> for regeneration in the Croydon metropolitan centre (such as Croydon Vision 2020, the Croydon Opportunity Area, and Westfield Croydon); furthermore, the upgrades seek to future-proof for Crossrail 2, potential Bakerloo line extension to the east of the network, and extensions to the tram network itself. The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the £737m investement programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers. The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs: ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} which factors make a mentor mother <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> for abused women successful. METHOD: We used semi-structured interviews with abused women and focus group {{discussions with the}} mentor mothers to evaluate their experiences and needs within a mentor <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> (MeMoSA). Fourteen abused women were interviewed 6 months after the <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> ended. Mentor mothers participated in two focus group discussions. RESULTS: Abused women emphasised that nonjudgmental listening, equivalence, involvement and bonding are important factors for successful support. Mentor mothers described that empathy, availability, persistence and advocacy fitted the needs of women best to empower them and help them to cope with their violent situation at home. A safe place to meet each other was also an important factor. CONCLUSION: A good relationship, tailored support provided by home visiting, advocacy and safety are required to effectively help abused women. MeMoSA, a home-visiting <b>support</b> <b>programme,</b> is a promising valuable new <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> in primary care for abused women...|$|R

40|$|Background: Staffing {{of rural}} {{healthcare}} facilities is a challenge, with literature supporting {{the selection and}} training of rural-origin students. The Umthombo Youth Development Foundation (UYDF) scholarship scheme supports rural students to train as healthcare professionals and offers a unique <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> This programme has not been evaluated, and this study sought UYDF-supported students’ perceptions of the programme. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to assess students’ perceptions of the UYDF <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> Methods: This was an observational descriptive study. Participants were students supported by UYDF and data were collected by a questionnaire with a Likert scale to assess perceptions of various aspects of the <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> Results: Students’ perceptions about the UYDF <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> were generally positive, with initial orientation and information sharing perceived as useful. Some respondents did not perceive value in holding discussions around English proficiency. The support required appeared to diminish with increasing years of study. Conclusion: A comprehensive, proactive compulsory support system that provides both academic and social support was perceived as useful by the UYDF students. Further research is required around aspects such as encouraging English proficiency. In future, the <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> could prioritise students in the early years of their study...|$|R
