5|$|Prior to {{the finding}} of {{additional}} specimens in Kuwait, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed the smoothtooth blacktip shark as Vulnerable based on its presumed small range and population. Despite {{the discovery of a}} second <b>subpopulation</b> off Kuwait, this species likely still warrants a Vulnerable assessment (or higher) because the waters around the Arabian Peninsula are subject to heavy fishing pressure and habitat degradation. Gillnet and other fisheries off Kuwait are known to take the smoothtooth blacktip shark as bycatch, while intensive Yemeni and Somalian shark fisheries operate in the Gulf of Aden. The status of the Yemen <b>subpopulation</b> is uncertain because no further specimens have been recorded since the original over a century ago.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian <b>subpopulation</b> (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The <b>subpopulation</b> along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the <b>subpopulation</b> off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins as a prelude to copulation.|$|E

40|$|Dioecy {{distributed}} in 157 flowering plant families and 959 flowering plant genera. Morphological and physiological differences {{between male and}} female plants have been studied extensively, but studies of sex-specific genetic diversity are relatively scarce in dioecious plants. In this study, 20 SSR loci were employed to examine the genetic variance of male <b>subpopulations</b> and female <b>subpopulations</b> in Salix viminalis. The results showed that all of the markers were polymorphic (Na= 14. 15, He= 0. 7566) and workable to reveal the genetic diversity of S. viminalis. No statistically significant difference was detected {{between male and female}} <b>subpopulations,</b> but the average genetic diversity of male <b>subpopulations</b> (Na= 7. 12, He= 0. 7071) and female <b>subpopulations</b> (Na= 7. 31, He= 0. 7226) were high. Under unfavorable environments (West Liao basin), the genetic diversity between male and female <b>subpopulations</b> was still not significantly different, but the genetic diversity of sexual <b>subpopulations</b> were lower. The differentiation of the ten <b>subpopulations</b> in S. viminalis was moderate (FST= 0. 0858), which was conformed by AMOVA that most of genetic variance (94 %) existed within <b>subpopulations.</b> Pairwise FST indicated no differentiation between sexual <b>subpopulations,</b> which was accompanied by high long-term migrate between them (M= 0. 73 ~ 1. 26). However, little recent migration was found between sexual <b>subpopulations.</b> Therefore, artificial crossing or/and transplantation by cutting propagation should be carried out so as to increase the migration during the process of ex situ conservation...|$|R
50|$|Populations {{consisting}} of <b>subpopulations</b> can be modeled by mixture models, which combine the distributions within <b>subpopulations</b> into an overall population distribution. Even if <b>subpopulations</b> are well-modeled by given simple models, the overall population may be poorly fit by a given simple model - poor fit may be evidence for existence of <b>subpopulations.</b> For example, given two equal <b>subpopulations,</b> both normally distributed, {{if they have}} the same standard deviation and different means, the overall distribution will exhibit low kurtosis relative to a single normal distribution - the means of the <b>subpopulations</b> fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, these form a bimodal distribution, otherwise it simply has a wide peak. Further, it will exhibit overdispersion relative to a single normal distribution with the given variation. Alternatively, given two <b>subpopulations</b> with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution.|$|R
40|$|To study human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) compartmentalization between intestine and blood, paired faecal and serum samples were collected from 204 HIV- 1 -infected persons. Direct sequencing of the gp 120 V 3 region obtained from 33 persons showed that faecal and serum sequences could be nearly homologous (0 � 3 % different) or very dissimilar (11 � 3 % different). Individual clones were obtained and sequenced from the faecal and serum samples of 13 persons. In 6 persons the HIV- 1 <b>subpopulations</b> in faeces and serum were similar, whereas in 7 persons, distribution of V 3 genotypes showed a marked difference. Genetic characterization of the HIV- 1 <b>subpopulations</b> showed less heterogeneity in faecal <b>subpopulations</b> than in serum <b>subpopulations</b> in 5 of the 7 subjects. Furthermore, faecal and serum <b>subpopulations</b> differed predominantly by nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions (in 6 of 7 persons). Comparison of the HIV- 1 <b>subpopulations</b> in faeces and serum of these 7 persons, using resampling techniques, revealed {{a significant difference between}} faecal and serum <b>subpopulations</b> at an N-linked glycosylation site, C-terminal of the V 3 loop (amino acids 331 – 333).

5|$|While a few leopard sharks {{have been}} {{documented}} traveling hundreds of kilometers, most individuals tend to remain in a localized area for much of their lives. This low level of dispersal has led to genetic divergence across its range. Seven discrete gene pools have been identified along the Californian coast between Humboldt Bay and San Diego. Of these, the Humboldt Bay <b>subpopulation</b> {{is perhaps the most}} isolated, with the sharks there maturing at a larger size and producing fewer offspring than those from other areas. By contrast, the area around Los Angeles represents a genetic transitional zone between subpopulations whose boundaries are more diffuse. Off Baja California, the leopard sharks on the Pacific side are probably distinct from those in the northern Gulf of California. Although there is equivocal evidence for natal philopatry (returning to one's birthplace to breed) in this species, proximity to established breeding grounds likely contributes to the structuring of these different subpopulations.|$|E
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important <b>subpopulation</b> is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E

40|$|Background: Biological data often {{originate}} from samples containing mixtures of <b>subpopulations,</b> corresponding e. g. to distinct cellular phenotypes. However, identification of distinct <b>subpopulations</b> {{may be difficult}} if biological measurements yield distributions that are not easily separable. Results: We present Multiresolution Correlation Analysis (MCA), a method for visually identifying <b>subpopulations</b> based on the local pairwise correlation between covariates, without needing to define an a priori interaction scale. We demonstrate that MCA facilitates the identification of differentially regulated <b>subpopulations</b> in simulated data from a small gene regulatory network, followed by application to previously published single-cell qPCR data from mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that MCA recovers previously identified <b>subpopulations,</b> provides additional insight into the underlying correlation structure, reveals potentially spurious compartmentalizations, and provides insight into novel <b>subpopulations.</b> Conclusions: MCA is a useful method for the identification of <b>subpopulations</b> in low-dimensional expression data, as emerging from qPCR or FACS measurements. With MCA {{it is possible to}} investigate the robustness of covariate correlations with respect <b>subpopulations,</b> graphically identify outliers, and identify factors contributing to differential regulation between pairs of covariates. MCA thus provides a framework for investigation of expression correlations for genes of interests and biological hypothesis generation. Comment: BioVis 2014 conferenc...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{structure}} can be {{a consequence}} of recent population fragmentation and isolation, or a remnant of historical localised adaptation. This poses a challenge for conservationists since misinterpreting patterns of genetic structure may lead to inappropriate management. Of 17 species of reptile originally found in Mauritius, only five survive on the main island. One of these, Phelsuma guimbeaui (lowland forest day gecko), is now restricted to 30 small isolated <b>subpopulations</b> following severe forest fragmentation and isolation due to human colonisation. We used 20 microsatellites in ten <b>subpopulations</b> and two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers in 13 <b>subpopulations</b> to: (i) assess genetic diversity, population structure and genetic differentiation of subpopulations; (ii) estimate effective population sizes and migration rates of subpopulations; and (iii) examine the phylogenetic relationships of haplotypes found in different <b>subpopulations.</b> Microsatellite data revealed significant population structure {{with high levels of}} genetic diversity and isolation by distance, substantial genetic differentiation and no migration between most <b>subpopulations.</b> MtDNA, however, showed no evidence of population structure, indicating that there was once a genetically panmictic population. Effective population sizes of ten <b>subpopulations,</b> based on microsatellite markers, were small, ranging from 44 to 167. Simulations suggested that the chance of survival and allelic diversity of some <b>subpopulations</b> will decrease dramatically over the next 50 years if no migration occurs. Our DNA-based evidence reveals an urgent need for a management plan for the conservation of P. guimbeaui.

40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{is important to}} the long-term survival of a species. Populations with low genetic diversity are more likely to go extinct due to an inability to adapt to environmental changes or accumulation of deleterious alleles. Habitat fragmentation may result in lower genetic diversity by disrupting gene flow between <b>subpopulations</b> caused by urbanization and development (e. g., roads, buildings, and agricultural fields). This study explored the effects of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the eastern red-back salamander (Plethodon cinereus). I collected tissue samples from 20 - 30 individuals from 1 - 3 different <b>subpopulations</b> within four larger forest sites that differed in their total area (i. e., 3 ̆e 1000 hectares or 3 - 60 hectares). Two sites were small fragments that are completely surrounded by suburban or agricultural areas in eastern Massachusetts (“fragmented” forest; three <b>subpopulations).</b> The other two sites were large, continuous forests located in western Massachusetts (“continuous” forest; four <b>subpopulations).</b> DNA was extracted and amplified at five to seven microsatellite loci. I calculated heterozygosity, allelic richness, and overall population differentiation. Two out of three fragmented <b>subpopulations</b> had significantly lower than average allelic richness, while one out of four continuous <b>subpopulations</b> had significantly higher than average allelic richness. I also found stronger differentiation (higher FST) between fragmented <b>subpopulations</b> than expected from simply isolation-by-distance, and evidence of secondary structure between the fragmented sites.

40|$|Colistin-susceptible {{isolates}} of Acinetobacter baumannii often contain <b>subpopulations</b> {{that are}} resistant to colistin.

Our objectives were to explore the susceptibility pattern of colistin-resistant <b>subpopulations</b> and investigate if combining colistin with a second antibiotic could prevent their selective growth. Four colistin-susceptible clinical isolates of A. baumannii and one reference isolate were used. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of colistin, i. e. the concentration required to block growth of all single-step-mutant <b>subpopulations,</b> was determined by plating an inoculum of 10 (9) CFU on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) -plates containing 2 -fold dilutions of colistin (0. 125 - 128 mg/L). Susceptibility testing of colistin-resistant <b>subpopulations,</b> obtained in the MPC assay, was performed with Etest. The MPC of colistin, in combination with rifampicin, was determined by plating an inoculum of 10 (9) CFU on MHA-plates containing colistin (0. 125 - 128 mg/L) and fixed concentrations of rifampicin (1. 1 mg/L or 4. 4 mg/L). The colistin-resistant <b>subpopulations</b> demonstrated increased susceptibility {{to a number of}} agents compared to their main populations. These <b>subpopulations</b> were even susceptible to agents that normally are inactive against gram-negative bacteria and all had rifampicin MICs of amp;lt; 0. 002 mg/L. The combination of colistin and rifampicin completely inhibited the growth of all colistin-resistant <b>subpopulations</b> and significantly lowered the MPC of colistin for A. baumannii. Combining colistin with rifampicin could be a way to prevent selective growth of colistin-resistant <b>subpopulations</b> of A. baumannii and possibly the emergence of colistin-resistant strains.
