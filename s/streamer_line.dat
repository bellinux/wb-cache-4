40|$|Based to a {{large degree}} on the {{precedent}} set by CCAMLR in 1991, the <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> has become the primary, and most commonly prescribed, seabird mitigation device in world longline fi sheries. This paper reviews CCAMLR <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> requirements (Conservation Measure 25 - 02 (2002), formerly Conservation Measure 29 /XIX) in light of a review of existing literature and available data on the effectiveness of single and paired (or multiple) streamer lines. Research to determine the optimal <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> design and confi guration is lacking and is identifi ed as a high priority. Future <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> research should compare the attack or dive rate of multiple southern hemisphere seabird species or foraging guilds as a function of distance astern in response to single and multiple streamer lines deployed according to specifi c performance and material standards. Improvements to <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> requirements set out in Conservation Measure 25 - 02 are discussed and proposed relative to recent Alaskan requirements. Proposed changes include: requiring that the <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> be deployed over the hookline within 100 m of the stern; increasing the height of th...|$|E
40|$|Longlining {{operations}} for Dissostichus eleginoides off South Georgia were assessed for interactions with seabirds {{and the effectiveness}} of measures employed by CCAMLR to mitigate seabird mortality. Following an agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Chile, a UK observer was placed aboard a Chilean longliner, the BF Cisne Verde, fishing in CCAMLR Subarea 48. 3 during the 1996 / 97 season. In this study 61 lines were laid from March to May 1997 using the Spanish double-line method. In accordance with CCAMLR conservation measures, lines were set at night, weights (6 - 7 kg) were set at 50 m intervals along the line, all deck lights were extinguished and no offal was discarded during setting. A <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> made to CCAMLR specifications was also used, except during an experiment that attempted to assess the effectiveness of the <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> in mitigating incidental mortality of seabirds during night-time setting. Data were recorded during hauling using a randomised cluster sampling method, developed to allow representative data to be collected when 100 % observer coverage could not be achieved: A total of 12 dead seabirds were recorded, giving an average mortality rate/night of 0. 099 birds/l 000 observed hooks, substantially lower than other vessels fishing around South Georgia during the same period. Mortalities consisted of nine white-chinned petrels, two black-browed albatrosses and one unidentifiable bird caught on hooks. One giant petrel was also killed as a result of flying {{into the side of the}} vessel. Generally, few birds were seen following the vessel during setting operations. During April, however, large numbers of white-chinned petrels were seen occasionally, and large numbers of black-browed albatrosses were seen when the moon was full. Live birds were observed to become caught on hooks during hauling on 23 occasions; all birds were released alive. Black-browed albatrosses concentrated on taking returning bait off the line and accounted for 18 birds caught; giant petrels concentrated on taking discarded offal, and accounted for five birds caught...|$|E
40|$|Streamer {{lines are}} the most {{commonly}} prescribed seabird bycatch mitigation measures for longline fisheries {{and one of the}} most effective (a primary measure). Streamer lines were an innovation of Japanese tuna fishermen to prevent bait loss to birds. They are inexpensive, simple and require no modification to fishing gear. What are streamer lines? A <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> (also called a tori or bird scaring line) is a line with streamers that is towed from a high point near the stern as baited hooks are deployed (Figure 1). As the vessel moves forward, drag on the line creates an aerial segment (extent) from which streamers are suspended at regular intervals. With streamer lines, the aerial extent is critical when attempting to scare birds away from baited hooks. A towed object is used to create additional drag to maximise the aerial extent. The goal is to maintain th...|$|E

40|$|Longlining {{operations}} for Dissostichus eleginoides off South Georgia were assessed for incidental mortality and interactions with seabirds. Twenty-seven line sets were observed and 98 deaths of seabirds were recorded over 20 sets; no deaths occurred during hauls. The 16 sets made at night contributed 15 % of overall mortality, all of white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis); the four day sets contributed 85 % of deaths, with giant petrels (Macronectes sp.), grey-headed albatrosses (Diomedea chrysostoma) and black-browed albatrosses (D. melanophrys) predominating. Grey-headed albatrosses, whose populations (at South Georgia are in serious decline, were disproportionately affected {{in relation to}} their numbers near the fishing vessel; giant petrels may be disproportionately affected in relation to the size of their breeding population at South Georgia when compared to albatrosses. The average mortality rate for the 20 sets was 0. 48 birds/ 1 000 hooks and maximum mortality 3. 12 birds/ 1 000 hooks. Mortality and interactions of birds with operations varied with site and time of day, and was affected by behavioural interactions between birds. Setting only at night would dramatically reduce the number of albatross deaths, and restrict mortality to white-chinned petrels. A <b>streamer</b> <b>line</b> made to CCAMLR specifications may reduce mortality but may be less effective during calm weather, intense feeding activity by seabirds, or when incorrectly constructed...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} about incidental capture of seabirds in various fisheries. Here, studies testing measures to prevent seabird bycatch in longline, trawl and gillnet fisheries are reviewed {{in order to identify}} the most efficient mitigation methods. There is potential for considerable reduction in mortality rates in most longline fisheries because effective measures have been developed. However, there is no single solution as the efficiency of a measure is specific to each fishery. In demersal longline fisheries where northern fulmar is the dominant seabird captured, <b>streamer</b> <b>lines</b> have been proven to virtually eliminate mortality. In the fishery for Patagonian toothfish where interactions with albatrosses occur, night setting has resulted in considerable bycatch reductions. Night setting has also been proven to be efficient in pelagic fisheries, but this measure should be used in combination with <b>streamer</b> <b>lines</b> and weighted longlines in areas inhabited by nocturnal and diving birds. The main cause of mortality in trawl fisheries is collision with warp and netsonde cables, but studies are fragmentary. Interactions between cables and seabirds {{have been shown to be}} rare at times of no offal discharge, suggesting that a no-discharge policy would virtually eliminate mortality. <b>Streamer</b> <b>lines</b> have been proven to effectively reduce cable strikes under offal discharge. Measures to prevent birds from diving into the trawl net meshes have not been tested. Efficient mitigation methods that maintain target fish catch still have to be identified for gillnet fisheries. Future research in longline fisheries should fine-tune the most promising measures for each specific fishery. Effective measures identified for trawl fisheries need to be expanded to and tested in other areas where seabird interactions occur...|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{longline}} fishing, used {{to catch}} finfish and sharks; thousands of seabirds are caught with a main line and hooks attached to branchlines, {{causing them to}} be pulled under the water {{by the weight of}} the line and drown. This threat can be reduced by modification of fishing practices and adaptation of bycatch mitigation measures. Such measures include the use of (sometimes paired) bird-scaring <b>lines</b> carrying <b>streamers,</b> weighted <b>lines</b> {{to reduce the amount of}} time baits are available to birds at and near the sea surface, setting lines at night, setting lines beneath the sea surface, and seasonal closures of fisheries to avoid fishing when birds are more susceptible to being caught, such as around nesting colonies during the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach to fishing is encapsulated in Article II of the CAMLR Convention. The {{ecosystem approach}} utilizes decision rules based on both population status targets and on limit reference points and incorporates uncertainty and ecosystem {{status in the}} calculation of these targets. Different reference points {{to account for the}} needs of dependent predators in the ecosystem are used depending on the location of the species in the food web. The ecosystem fisheries management approach by CCAMLR involves use of move-on rules to protect trophic interactions, and limit direct effects of fishing on fish bycatch, seabirds and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). There are annually reviewed mitigation measures such as <b>line</b> weighting and <b>streamer</b> <b>lines</b> to minimize seabird bycatch which have resulted in a substantial reduction in accidental seabird mortalities in the CAMLR Convention Area. The 50% (target) and 20% (limit) reference points used by the CCAMLR decision rules exceed the requirements for target and limit reference points set by almost all national and international fisheries management organizations, even for species longer lived than toothfish. A wide study of many fisheries generally indicated that most reach maximum sustainable yield at 30-35% of their pre-exploitation abundances. CCAMLR uses a more conservative reference level to allow exploitation at a level where toothfish recruitment and the ecosystem in general is not appreciably impacted. This is required by Article II of the CAMLR Convention. A common misunderstanding of the CCAMLR decision rules is an assumption that the decline in population size will follow a clear trajectory from the starting year to a point 35 years later when the stock size will reach 50% of pre-exploitation levels and an assumption that there is no feedback during each assessment. The catch limit however is re-calculated based on all updated or revised data at each annual or biennual assessment. This approach is used to ensure that the 50% level will be approached slowly and enables an ongoing readjustment of catch levels as knowledge improves.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown {{that in some}} months of the phase of minimum solar {{activity}} 1985 - 1987 as many as (80 - 90) % of a total number of CMEs occur near belts of <b>streamers</b> with neutral <b>line</b> (NL), and only (10 - 20) % of them appear near belts of streamers without NL. (Streamers without NL separate regions in the corona with the same direction of radial fields of magnetic tubes originating from adjacent coronal holes). With increasing solar activity, {{the center of gravity}} of the number of emerging CMEs is shifting toward belts of steamers without NL and reaches over 80 % of their total number in some months by the end of 1989. The CME position angle (PA) coincides, on average, with the angle of the portion of NL which straddles the CME. It is quite possible that this condition is satisfied not in the average but rigorously for each CME. The streamer observed on the limb does not disrupt if the CME in transit either only slightly overlaps with the streamer or lies at all outside it. If in the limb plane under consideration the steamer lies inside the CME, then it disrupts after CME passage...|$|R
40|$|Stealth coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are {{events in}} which there are almost no {{observable}} signatures of the CME eruption in the low corona but often a well-resolved slow flux rope CME observed in the coronagraph data. We present results from a three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of the 1 [...] 2 June 2008 slow streamer blowout CME that Robbrecht et al. (2009) called "the CME from nowhere. " We model the global coronal structure using a 1. 4 MK isothermal solar wind and a low-order potential field source surface representation of the Carrington Rotation 2070 magnetogram synoptic map. The bipolar streamer belt arcade is energized by simple shearing flows applied {{in the vicinity of the}} helmet <b>streamer's</b> polarity inversion <b>line.</b> The flows are large scale and impart a shear typical of that expected from the differential rotation. The slow expansion of the energized helmet streamer arcade results in the formation of a radial current sheet. The subsequent onset of expansion-induced flare reconnection initiates the stealth CME while gradually releasing the stored magnetic energy. We present favorable comparisons between our simulation results and the multiviewpoint SOHO-LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) and STEREO-SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation) coronagraph observations of the preeruption streamer structure and the initiation and evolution of the stealth streamer blowout CME.

40|$|The {{adaptation}} of 3 D techniques to very high resolution* shallow water studies has been progressing steadily {{over the last}} years. Cost-effective VHR 3 D seismics is of great interest both {{in the field of}} engineering geophysics as well as for geological and geotechnical site investigations. Still, no well established practice for VHR 3 D survey design seems to exist and few studies have been published on the relationship between acquisition parameters, processing costs {{and the quality of the}} processed data. (* the term "very high resolution" refers to mean source frequencies > 1 kHz and expected resolution in the sub-meter range). The design of VHR 3 D marine surveys does not simply reduce to a mere downscaling problem, it also requires specific strategies. The approach will not only depend on the geological target and the desired resolution, but will also be dictated by the field conditions and the available budget. The optimum acquisition strategy will necessarily be a compromise. On the one hand there is the need for high resolution and this requires the use of high frequencies. On the other hand there are the constraints placed on sampling - very high frequencies require very small sampling intervals. Working in shallow water environments will imply constraints on the acquisition geometry (trace interval, <b>streamer</b> spacing, <b>line</b> spacing, shot interval). Considering the frequency content of the seismic data and the desired resolution, accurate positioning is needed to prevent destructive stacking and obtain optimal imaging. Unfortunately, current navigation technology does not allow real-time positioning of the array elements with sufficient accuracy in a costeffective way, and additional geometry corrections may be needed. The compact, flexible acquisition system "Opus 3 D" developed at RCMG has allowed to further scale down the 3 D seismic method to ultra-high resolutions and dm scale in a modest and cost-effective way, without requiring complex field procedures and processing. The system is designed for studies in shallow water, providing limited penetration and aimed at target sites of limited lateral extent. Acquisition and positioning constraints limit the acquisition system to nearshore studies. In protected areas and on rivers, canals and lakes the array may also be used as a stand-alone system...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} coronal evolution of a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2005 August 22 using a 3 -D thermodynamics magnetohydrodynamic model, the SWMF. The source region of the eruption was anemone active region (AR) 10798, which emerged inside a coronal hole. We validate our modeled corona by producing synthetic extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, which we compare to EIT images. We initiate the CME with an out-of-equilibrium flux rope with an orientation and chirality chosen in agreement with observations of a H-alpha filament. During the eruption, one footpoint of the flux rope reconnects with <b>streamer</b> magnetic field <b>lines</b> and with open field lines from the adjacent coronal hole. It yields an eruption which has a mix of closed and open twisted field lines due to interchange reconnection and only one footpoint line-tied to the source region. Even with the large-scale reconnection, we find no evidence of strong rotation of the CME as it propagates. We study the CME deflection and find {{that the effect of}} the Lorentz force is a deflection of the CME by about 3 deg/Rsun towards the East during the first 30 minutes of the propagation. We also produce coronagraphic and EUV images of the CME, which we compare with real images, identifying a dimming region associated with the reconnection process. We discuss the implication of our results for the arrival at Earth of CMEs originating from the limb and for models to explain the presence of open field lines in magnetic clouds.

40|$|Context: The {{origin of}} the {{variable}} component of the solar wind is of great intrinsic interest for heliophysics and space-weather, e. g. the initiation of coronal mass ejections, {{and the problem of}} mass loss of all stars. It is also related to the physics of coronal neutral sheets and <b>streamers,</b> occurring above <b>lines</b> of magnetic polarity reversal. Filaments and prominences correspond to the cool coronal component of these regions. Aims: We examine the dynamical behaviour of these structures where reconnection and dissipation of magnetic energy in the turbulent plasma are occurring. The link between the observed oscillatory motions and the eruption occurrence is investigated in detail for two different events. Method: Two filaments are analysed using two different datasets: time series of spectra using a transition region line (He I at 584. 33 A) and a coronal line (Mg X at 609. 79 A) measured with CDS on-board SOHO, observed on May 30, 2003, and time series of intensity and velocity images from the NSO/Dunn Solar Telescope in the Halpha line on September 18, 1994 for the other. The oscillatory content is investigated using Fourier transform and wavelet analysis and is compared to different models. Results: In both filaments, oscillations are clearly observed, in intensity and velocity in the He I and Mg X lines, in velocity in Halpha, with similar periods from a few minutes up to 80 minutes, with a main range from 20 to 30 minutes, cotemporal with eruptions. Both filaments exhibit vertical oscillating motions. For the filament observed in the UV (He I and Mg X lines), we provide evidence of damped velocity oscillations, and for the filament observed in the visible (Halpha line), we provide evidence that parts of the filament are oscillating, while the filament is moving over the solar surface, before its disappearance.
