5000|$|Wilson Electrics {{were made}} by Partridge Wilson Engineering, who were {{manufacturers}} of charging equipment for accumulators, and were based in Leicester. In 1934 they produced their first electric van, suitable for a payload of 5-6 cwt. Speed control was arranged by switching of the motor fields and the battery cells, so that no <b>starting</b> <b>resistance</b> was needed. They produced several larger models, including a 20-25 cwt version of their MW vehicle, controlled by an accelerator which caused a number of relay contacts to close, at a preselected rate regulated by a fluid dashpot. In 1939 they were offering special deals for fleets of six vehicles, which were charged using a Davenset 3-phase group charger. Wilson Electric vehicles ceased to be produced in 1954, although the company continued to trade in Leicester until 1986. Other manufacturers included Smith's, Osborne, and Bedford. In 1941, Morrison-Electricar standardised three types of body which would become the basis for thousands of milk floats built after the war to deliver goods to the recovering population. [...] As of 2009, only Bluebird Automotive remained in the industry.|$|E
5000|$|Many Wilson Electric {{vehicles}} were classified by their payload, which {{was measured in}} hundredweights, and this usage has been retained in the article. A hundredweight is one twentieth of a long ton or 51kg, and is abbreviated to [...] "cwt". In 1934 Partridge Wilson produced their first electric van, suitable for a payload of 5-6 cwt, and branded the Wilson Electric. It was fitted with a 29-cell, 129 Amp-hour battery manufactured by Exide Ironclad, and had a range of 35 to 40 mi, with {{a top speed of}} 16 to 17 mph. Speed control was arranged by switching of the motor fields and the battery cells, so that a <b>starting</b> <b>resistance</b> to limit the initial current through the motor was not needed. Early customers included the West Ham Electricity Department, who bought two standard chassis in 1934, which were fitted with streamlined bodies by Tomlinson (Marylebone) Ltd. They had a capacity of 5-7 cwt, and were powered by a 24-cell battery made by D P Kathanode driving a Metropolitan-Vickers motor. This arrangement gave a top speed of about 20 mph and a range of 50 mi.|$|E

50|$|To {{accelerate}} the train still further, the traction motors are reconnected in series-parallel connection (2 parallel circuits with 2 series-connected traction motors in each). For this purpose, in starting notch #12 the controller closes {{a pair of}} parallel contactors and opens the bridge contactor. After this the controller moves to starting notch #13, which closes contactors #1 and #2 and opens both field-weakening contactors; this assembles 2 parallel circuits, each of which comprises 2 traction motors {{and a group of}} <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> connected in series and has a total resistance of 4.97 ohm. Further notching out of the controller shorts out the <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> in pairs until in starting notch #16 all of the <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> are shorted out; this corresponds to running notch #3 on the engineer's controller. Moving the controller to starting notch #17 weakens the traction motor field to 67%, and in starting notch #18 the field is weakened to 50%. Starting notch #18 corresponds to running notch #4 on the engineer's controller; this is the maximum notch and allows the train to reach top speed. To coast, the engineer moves the controller handle to 0; this opens the line contactors, thereby shutting off all power to the traction motors, and moves the controller into starting notch #1 (therefore if the traction motors are turned on again, they are connected in series and all the <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> are in the circuit).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Single-limb knee {{extension}} exercises {{have been}} found to be effective at improving lower extremity exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since the positive local physiological effects of exercise training only occur in the engaged muscle(s), should upper extremity muscles also be included to determine the effect of single limb exercises in COPD patients. Methods/design Trial design: a prospective, assessor-blind, block randomized controlled, parallel-group multicenter trial. Participants: stage II-IV COPD patients, > 40 [*]years of age, ex-smokers, with stable medical treatment will be included starting May 2011. Recruitment at three locations in Sweden. Interventions: 1) high-repetitive single limb exercise (HRSLE) training with elastic bands, 60 minutes, three times/week for 8 [*]weeks combined with four sessions of 60 minutes patient education, or 2) the same patient education alone. Outcomes: Primary : determine the effects of HRSLE on local muscle endurance capacity (measured as meters walked during 6 -minute walk test and rings moved on 6 -minute ring and pegboard test) and quality of life (measured as change on the Swedish version of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire). Secondary: effects on maximal strength, muscular endurance, dyspnea, self-efficacy, anxiety and depression. The relationship between changes in health-related variables and changes in exercise capacity, sex-related differences in training effects, feasibility of the program, strategies to determine adequate <b>starting</b> <b>resistance</b> and provide accurate resistance for each involved movement and the relationship between muscle fatigue and dyspnea in the different exercise tests will also be analyzed. Randomization: performed by a person independent of the recruitment process and using a computer random number generator. Stratification by center and gender with a 1 : 1 allocation to the intervention or control using random block sizes. Blinding: all outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. Discussion The results of this project will contribute to increase the body of knowledge regarding COPD and HRSLE. Trial registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 01354067.

25|$|Railways must {{operate at}} {{variable}} speeds. Until the mid 1980s {{this was only}} practical with the brush-type DC motor, although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion. Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, most early electrified railways used DC and many still do, particularly rapid transit (subways) and trams. Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations, by varying the traction motors' fields, and by inserting and removing <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> to limit motor current.|$|R
5000|$|The master {{controller}} had four positions: switching, full series, parallel, and full parallel. Control equipment shunted out <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> automatically as speed increased and current drawn fell.

The notching process produced a series of sharp clicks, and the units were nicknamed [...] "nutcrackers" [...] from this cause. The specified maximum running speed was 52 mph, although a maximum speed in service of 40 mph was imposed due to rough riding at higher speeds.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{shortcomings}} {{which led to}} its demise, the metadyne system as introduced in 1936 on the O Stock trains {{was the first in}} the world to provide regenerative braking on an electric multiple unit. Acceleration was smoother than on a train which switched <b>starting</b> <b>resistances,</b> and when braking the metadyne unit returned power to the tracks, which could be used by other trains if needed. However, conditions were not always ideal, and the substations were not really designed to cope with regeneration, which meant that often the train switched to rheostatic braking, where the power was dissipated in a resistance bank. The weight of the equipment was also a serious drawback.|$|R

5000|$|The engineer's {{controller}} has 18 starting notches, {{of which}} only 4 {{are classified as}} running notches (allowing prolonged operation of the motors in this notch). Acceleration is mainly controlled by means of resistances which are initially connected into the traction motor circuit and then incrementally notched out by means of shorting with special contactors. These contactors (19 in all) are grouped together in one drum controller. The ER2 uses an indirect control system: the engineer only has to place his (or her) controller handle in the desired notch, and the control system automatically notches out the drum controller to reach that notch. (The drum controller is pneumatically operated). For slow movement, as when shunting, the engineer places the controller in the first notch, designated M ("manevrovoe", i.e. [...] "shunting"); this closes both line contactors, the bridge contactor, and contactors #7 and #8, connecting all 4 traction motors in series and engaging all of the <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> (total resistance 17.66 ohm). Moving the controller handle to the next notch (running notch #1) initiates an incremental notching-out (shorting-out) of the starting resistances; unlike most Russian electric locomotives, on which the engineer directly controls {{the selection of the}} starting notches, in the ER2 the intermediate starting notches are switched automatically by means of an accelerating relay which regulates the train's acceleration (by monitoring the traction current's change, see also: Traction motor#Automatic acceleration), although the engineer can override it and select the intermediate notches manually. In starting notch #9, all of the <b>starting</b> <b>resistances</b> are shorted out, and only the series-connected traction motors remain in the circuit, their fields at 100% strength. This corresponds to running notch #1 on the engineer's controller. Further notching out of the controller weakens the traction motors' field: in starting notch #10, the field strength is reduced to 67%, and in starting notch #11 to 50%. Starting notch #11 corresponds to running notch #2 on the engineer's controller.|$|R

50|$|The metadyne-fitted {{locomotives}} had new bodies, but the bogies and motors {{were removed}} from redundant Metropolitan line stock and refurbished at Acton Works. Similarly, the metadyne equipment was removed from an experimental train and reused. A metadyne unit consists of a rotating machine, which converts the constant voltage supplied by the battery to a constant current, which feeds the motor. The metadyne system is more efficient than conventional <b>starting</b> <b>resistances,</b> particularly when the locomotive starts and stops frequently, or when it needs to run for long periods at slow speeds. For cable laying work, the metadyne-equipped locomotives could pull trains of 100 tons at 3 mph for considerable distances, without any sign of overheating.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the London Underground {{were aware of}} the {{development}} of the metadyne equipment taking place at Metropolitan-Vickers, and the potential for regenerative braking which it provided. Before committing to an untried system, they therefore built a test train, by converting six cars originally built between 1904 and 1907 for the Metropolitan Railway. The work was carried out at Acton Works in 1934. Since a single metadyne unit could be used to control four motors, and each motor car had two motors, they were formed into two-car units, with a driving cab at the outer ends. By coupling the units together, trials of a two-car, four-car and six-car train could be carried out. The metadyne unit weighed about 3 tons, and consisted of three rotating machines, an exciter, a regulator and the actual metadyne machine, which were linked together mechanically. Electrically, the traction supply was fed into the machine, and the output fed the motors, without the need for <b>starting</b> <b>resistances.</b>|$|R
