After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered The Lord of the Rings via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a [...] "brave and ambitious attempt." [...] In another interview, Jackson stated that he [...] "enjoyed [...] {{and wanted to know}} more." [...] Bakshi is quoted as saying [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> that he never saw the movie.

500|$|He {{immediately}} {{went back into}} the Bradford side, and added his second goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day. Darlington made a bid to sign Colbeck on a permanent basis during January 2008, but City chairman Julian Rhodes turned down the bid, and Colbeck was a regular player {{for the rest of the}} 2007–08 season. The run of games included the third goal in a 3–1 win against former side Darlington at the Darlington Arena. On 19 April 2008, he scored his sixth goal for the club, but first in a home game, when his last minute goal gave Bradford a 2–1 win over Grimsby Town. Three days later, Colbeck was announced as the club's player of the season, even though he had started just 26league games, 23 of which came in City's 26games since Colbeck returned on loan from Darlington. Colbeck was surprised to win the award, saying: [...] "If you'd <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the season that I would win this award, I'd have thought you were mad. I wasn't even a regular in the team." [...] However, in the following league game, Colbeck was sent off for the second time in his career, for a foul on Dean Lewington, as City lost 2–1 to Milton Keynes Dons, which meant he missed the final game of the season through suspension.|$|E

'The main task of the Harvards [...] has been bombing and machine-gunning Mau Mau and their hideouts in densely wooded and difficult country.' This included 'diving steeply into the gorges of [...] rivers, often in conditions of low cloud and driving rain.' Testing conditions, yes, but not much opposition from the enemy, the journalist in the exchange continued. Very few of the Mau Mau had guns that could land a blow on an aircraft." [...] Pullman responded to this new information, writing [...] "my father probably doesn't come out of this with very much credit, judged by the standards of modern liberal progressive thought" [...] and accepted the new information as [...] "a serious challenge to his childhood memory." [...] His mother remarried, and with a move to Australia came Pullman's discovery of comic books including Superman and Batman, a medium which he continues to espouse.|$|E

60|$|The {{speciality}} then of this man's {{wrong is}} that it is the only historic wrong that has in it the quality of nonsense.

It is the top point of that anarchy in the governing mind which, as I <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> is the main trait of modernity, especially in England. But if the first note in our policy is madness, the next note is certainly meanness. There are two peculiarly mean and unmanly legal mantraps in which this wretched man is tripped up. The first is that which prevents him from doing what any ordinary savage or nomad would do--take his chance of an uneven subsistence on the rude bounty of nature.|$|E

The heathens fell into sin just in proportion as their hearts were turned away from the life of God, and so shall we. And how shall we know whether our hearts are turned away, or whether they are right with God? Thus: What are the fruits of God's Spirit? what sort of life does the Spirit of God make man live? For the Spirit of God is God, and therefore the life of God is the life which God's Spirit makes men live; and what is that? a life of love and righteousness.|$|E

I judged from the tone of her letters {{that she did not}} care so much for gaiety as she had done, and that the constant whirl of dissipation in which she lived during the London season had greatly lost its charm for her.
