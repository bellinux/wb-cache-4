5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. <b>SOD</b> enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc <b>SOD</b> is present in the cytosol, while manganese <b>SOD</b> is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of <b>SOD</b> in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc <b>SOD</b> (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular <b>SOD</b> have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, <b>SOD</b> isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron <b>SOD</b> found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (<b>SOD)</b> appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. <b>SOD</b> quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus <b>SOD</b> activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Experiments were {{designed}} to determine whether endothelium isolated from adipose tissue and <b>sodded</b> onto expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts release endothelium-derived vasoactive factors. Methods: Thin-walled expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (6 mm internal diameter, 6 cm length, 30 μm pore size), one <b>sodded</b> with autogenous endothelial cells, the other unsodded, were implanted bilaterally in carotid arteries of 30 male mongrel dogs. Dogs were treated with 325 mg aspirin daily. After 6 weeks grafts were excised and perfused in a bioassay system. Effluent from the grafts stimulated with either acetylcholine, thrombin, adenosine 5 -diphosphate, or the calcium ionophore A 23187 was superfused over rings of canine femoral arteries without endothelium contracted with phenylephrine. Effluent from the grafts was analyzed by radioimmunoassay for thromboxane B 2, 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α, endothelin- 1, and C-type natriuretic peptide. Results: Ninety percent of the <b>sodded</b> grafts and 87 % of the unsodded grafts were patent after 6 weeks. Bioassay rings superfused with effluent from <b>sodded</b> grafts stimulated with acetylcholine relaxed significantly more than rings superfused with effluent from similarly stimulated unsodded grafts. Biochemical analysis of the effluent showed an increase in 6 -keto prostaglandin F 1 α and C-type natriuretic peptide {{and a decrease in}} endothelin- 1 and thromboxane B 2 release from the <b>sodded</b> compared with the unsodded grafts. Scanning electron microscopy showed a continuous layer of endothelial cells lining only the <b>sodded</b> grafts. Staining for α-actin and heavy-chain myosin showed a differentiated layer of smooth muscle below the endothelial layer on the <b>sodded</b> grafts. Finally, there was positive staining for C-type natriuretic peptide and endothelin- 1 in the endothelium of the <b>sodded</b> grafts. Conclusions: These results indicate that endothelial cells of <b>sodded</b> expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts produce endothelium-derived vasoactive factors. In addition, receptor-coupled synthesis/release of these factors is retained in <b>sodded</b> endothelial cells. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 187 - 97. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuperoxide dismutases (<b>SODs)</b> are {{involved}} in the protection of cells from oxygen toxicity. However, several papers have reported that the overexpression of CuZn-SOD causes oxidative damage to cells. We investigated a mechanism by which an excess of <b>SODs</b> accelerates oxidative stress. The presence of CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD or Mn(II) enhanced the frequency of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and Cu(II), and altered the site specificity of the latter: H 2 O 2 induced Cu(II) -dependent DNA damage with high frequency at the 5 ′-guanine of poly G sequences; when <b>SODs</b> were added, the frequency of cleavages at thymine and cytosine residues increased. <b>SODs</b> also enhanced the formation of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine by H 2 O 2 and Cu(II). We conclude that <b>SODs</b> may increase carcinogenic risks, e. g. of tumors in Down syndrome...|$|R
