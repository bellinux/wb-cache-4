40|$|A major hurdle to {{evolutionary}} engineering {{approaches for}} multigenic phenotypes {{is the ability}} to simultaneously modify multiple genes rapidly and selectively. Here, we describe a method for in vivo-targeted mutagenesis in yeast, targeting glycosylases to embedded arrays for mutagenesis (TaGTEAM). By fusing the yeast 3 -methyladenine DNA glycosylase MAG 1 to a tetR DNA-binding domain, we are able to elevate mutation rates > 800 fold in a specific ∼ 20 -kb region of the genome or on a plasmid that contains an array of tetO sites. A wide spectrum of transitions, transversions and single base deletions are observed. We provide evidence that TaGTEAM generated point mutations occur through error-prone homologous recombination (HR) and depend on resectioning and the error-prone polymerase Pol ζ. We show that HR is error-prone in this context because of DNA damage checkpoint activation and base pair lesions and use this knowledge to shift the primary mutagenic outcome of targeted endonuclease breaks from HR-independent rearrangements to HR-dependent point mutations. The ability to switch repair in this way opens up the possibility of using targeted endonucleases in diverse organisms for in vivo-targeted mutagenesis.

40|$|Since 2006 China’s central {{government}} {{has opened up}} its financial markets to foreign Microfinance Institutions (MFI). The idea is that by allowing MFI’s to operate, competition between Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCC), Postal Savings Banks, and Agricultural Banks would lead to increase access to credit, economic efficiencies and growth in rural agriculture, and efficiency within the financial system in underserved markets. Microfinance as it is understood today refers to {{a broad range of}} services-loans, savings, insurance, remittance transfers, and pensions offered to rural and urban poor through a variety of commercial banks, cooperatives, credit unions, specialized banks, post offices and retail chains (Meyer and Nagarajan 2006; Zeller 2006 provides a summary of the characteristics of different types of microfinance institutions). It is towards this broader definition that Chinese policy {{in the past few years}} has been directed. The formalization of microcredit in China started in 1994 when the Chinese Academy of Social <b>Sciences</b> <b>piloted</b> a Grameen-style NGO (Park and Ren, 2000; Tsai 2004). This quickly led to numerous new initiatives by at least 17 MFI reportedly making micro loans of 1, 000 Yuan or less and with none exceeding 4, 200 Yuan. The interes...|$|R
