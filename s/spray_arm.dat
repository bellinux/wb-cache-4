40|$|A {{dishwasher}} {{works by}} using water pressure {{to operate the}} Spray Arms. There are different types of wash systems with the most common being two spray arms, a lower and middle arm. These two spray arms operate independently {{from each other and}} can be powered individually. In this particular wash system, the subsystem of interest is the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> which is connected with the Bottle Blaster where both operate simultaneously. The Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> is used to clean the upper dishwasher rack while the Bottle Blaster is used to clean bottles, also in the upper rack. In order to have proper cleaning performance in the dishwasher, the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> needs to rotate with at least 20 revolutions per minute (RPM). Since the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> and Bottle Blaster are connected together, the flow rate requirement is 12 gallons per minute (GPM); which is higher than a system that doesn’t include a Bottle Blaster (approximately 8. 5 GPM). In order {{to reduce the amount of}} water usage and flow rate, a new system was configured that will independently operate the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> and Bottle Blaster. For that, three different designs were created and a Pugh Matrix was used to select the appropriate design. The selected design will operate using water pressure to block the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> port or the Bottle Blaster port and is attached to the Main Conduit before the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm.</b> This new system reduced the water consumption of the entire dishwasher due to the fact that is able to operate with a smaller pump. The new system provides 8. 53 GPM to the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm</b> and 6. 48 GPM to the Bottle Blaster compared to 9. 88 GPM and 7. 32 GPM respectively with the current system. This new system has a better cleaning performance due to the increased in RPM’s, now 25 RPM, on the Mid <b>Spray</b> <b>Arm.</b> Also, since a smaller pump can be used the new pump price will be $ 12. 38, which is approximately 17 % less expensive than the current pump. Another advantage is the reduction in noise by approximately 11 % from an initial 21. 3 dBa pump output...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMotion {{of water}} inside a {{household}} dishwasher has been characterised via Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT). The technique enables the visualisation {{of the motion}} of a radioactive tracer in three-dimensional and opaque systems. Results showed a periodic sequence of the water over time, encompassing the following steps: movement inside internal equipment and <b>spray</b> <b>arm,</b> ejection via jets, impact over walls and crockery, downfall (either over walls, crockery or free falling) and recirculation of the bulk water {{from the bottom of}} the dishwasher. This sequence was shown to occur within a few seconds and the highest velocities, and therefore, the highest kinetic energies, were found upon ejection. Jet paths were observed to follow a straight line. Increased pump speeds increased velocity ejection profiles, but the effect over the downfall step was negligible. In fully loaded dishwasher (with crockery), the tracer moved slower in these high packing zones, showing low velocity profile areas with higher residence times. Other stagnant areas were found at the edges of the bulk of water remaining at the bottom of the dishwasher. Use of detergent did not seem to affect water motion. Finally, data generated via CFD was compared with equivalent PEPT data, showing good agreement for the <b>spray</b> <b>arm</b> and ejection steps but disagreement in the free falling step. The divergences in the results can be explained by a combination of PEPT data processing and CFD model constraints. Information gathered is helping the development of more sustainable and efficient dishwashing systems...|$|E

50|$|Commercial dishwashers {{often have}} {{significantly}} different plumbing and operations than a home unit, {{in that there}} are often separate <b>spray</b> <b>arms</b> for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied {{until the end of}} the day's kitchen operations.|$|R
50|$|A mix {{of water}} and {{dishwasher}} detergent is pumped {{to one or more}} rotating <b>spray</b> <b>arms,</b> which blast the dishes with the cleaning mixture. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water is pumped in and a rinse cycle begins. After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a rinse aid is used to eliminate water spots for streak-free dishes and glassware resulting from hard water or other reasons.|$|R
5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long <b>spraying</b> <b>arms.</b> These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|R

25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable loadings, trickling filter beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated <b>spray</b> <b>arms.</b> The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content. The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|R
50|$|European {{dishwasher}}s {{almost universally}} use {{two or three}} <b>spray</b> <b>arms</b> which are fed from the bottom and {{back wall of the}} dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use more basic and old fashioned water distribution and exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines use a large cone or similar structure in the bottom dish rack to prevent placement of dishes {{in the center of the}} rack. The dishwasher directs water from the bottom of the dishwasher up through this structure to the upper wash <b>arm</b> to <b>spray</b> water on the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from Whirlpool and Kitchenaid, use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher, which allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model Frigidaire dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).|$|R

She displaced 118 tons; her engine was rated at 70-horsepower. In 1850, Daniel Ladd, a Newport, Florida, cotton and general mercantile businessman, purchased the Spray for $15,000. Spray handled most of the freight {{which had to be}} lightered between the river ports and Spanish Hole. With ships at the port averaging about 120 annually in the early 1850s and increasing steadily in number throughout the decade, the lightering business was a lucrative one. There was enough traffic to keep five pilots busy after 1846. Taken into Confederate service as a gunboat, CSS <b>Spray</b> was <b>armed</b> with two light guns; her complement was 25 officers and enlisted.

40|$|In {{order to}} spray onto {{the canopy of}} {{interval}} planting crop, an approach of using a target spray robot with a composite vision servo system based on monocular scene vision and monocular eye-in-hand vision was proposed. Scene camera was used to roughly locate target crop, and then the image-processing methods for background segmentation, crop canopy centroid extraction, and 3 D positioning were studied. Eye-in-hand camera was used to precisely determine spray position of each crop. Based on the center and area of 2 D minimum-enclosing-circle (MEC) of crop canopy, a method to calculate spray position and spray time was determined. In addition, locating algorithm for the MEC center in nozzle reference frame and the hand-eye calibration matrix were studied. The processing of a mechanical arm guiding nozzle to spray was divided into three stages: reset, alignment, and hovering spray, and servo method of each stage was investigated. For preliminary verification of the theoretical studies on the approach, a simplified experimental prototype containing one <b>spray</b> mechanical <b>arm</b> was built and some performance tests were carried out under controlled environment in laboratory. The {{results showed that the}} prototype could achieve the effect of “spraying while moving and accurately spraying on target. ...|$|R

60|$|Through the Toll House gap {{and over}} the near ridges on the other side, the deluge was immense.

Had this indeed been water (as it seemed so, to the eye), with what a plunge of reverberating thunder would it have rolled upon its course, disembowelling mountains and deracinating pines And yet water it was and sea-water at that--true Pacific billows, only somewhat rarefied, rolling in mid-air among the hilltops.|$|R

40|$|A new machine {{system has}} been designed, {{developed}} and evaluated for extensive circle spraying of oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{in an effort to}} overcome the inefficient spraying problem with the conventional spraying system. The machine system consists of a four-wheeled drive 4 WD prime mover with front mounted machine attachments for the circle spraying operation. The configuration of the circle spraying attachment consists of a hexagonal curved <b>spray</b> boom, lifting <b>arm,</b> opening-tilting mechanism unit, storage tank, spray pump, solid cone nozzles, and associate hydraulic system. Field performance tests on the machine system showed an average effective field capacity of 7. 89 ha per man per day and when compared to the earlier reported effective field capacity of the walking spray-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer; a difference of 1. 97 time for circle spraying of mature palms grove. Reduction in the human energy expenditure of 101. 28 kJ man- 1 h- 1 or 10. 68 % but an increase in the spraying cost of 1. 53 USD ha- 1 or 24. 9 % were obtained with the machine system against the walking spraying-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer. Justification for machine system to be cost effective could be satisfied if the present effective field capacity is increased to 1. 263 time with good skilled operator or if the current R&D cost is reduced to 0. 41 time. This is because the improved field capacity of new machine system could not rationalize its current R&D cost. Admittedly, the machine system has great potential to overcome the limitations with the current employed machine/equipment in the circle spraying operation of oil palms in the plantation...|$|R
40|$|Just-in-Time compilers offer {{substantial}} runtime performance benefits over traditional execution methods like interpretation; {{and they}} have enjoyed widespread deployment in the JavaScript engines found in nearly all modern web browsers. Unfortunately, security has taken the back seat to performance in many JIT compilers, despite the often untrusted nature of their inputs and the tremendous privilege {{that they have been}} granted to generate machine code on the fly. While the concerns regarding performance are understandable, the threat posed by blind JIT spraying has been underestimated. In this dissertation, we demonstrate the feasibility of blind JIT <b>spraying</b> on the <b>ARM</b> architecture against three modern JavaScript engines, despite many restrictions imposed by ARM such as coarse-grained instruction boundaries and limited space for encoding immediate operands. We find that useful instruction decoding ambiguity can be leveraged to create a blind JIT spraying payload using either intended ARM or Thumb instructions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that instruction decoding ambiguity is not necessary in the construction of a blind JIT spraying payload. We also introduce a technique for abusing JIT sprayed code called gadget chaining, which enables an attacker to exploit even limited control over JIT code. To better understand the state of JIT spraying mitigation research and deployment, we survey the literature and examine four open source JavaScript engines several years after the debut of JIT spraying on x 86. We find that all four engines cut corners in their implementations—often quite egregiously—in the name of reducing performance overhead. In order to form a consolidated picture of {{the costs and benefits of}} diversification defenses, we implement five diversification defenses, without cutting corners, on the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine for 32 -bit ARM and x 86 - 64 and empirically evaluate their overheads across a consistent set of benchmarks and hardware. We find that all five diversification defenses can be deployed in tandem with reasonable security parameters at a runtime overhead cost of < 5 %. Our analysis of the diversification defenses indicates that, in combination, they provide effective mitigation of the blind JIT spraying threat for less overhead than other effective options...|$|R
