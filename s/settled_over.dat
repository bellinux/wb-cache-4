5|$|Tropical Storm Dean {{originated}} from inside a frontal cloud band, which had moved off the Eastern Coast of the United States on September 22. During {{the next few}} days, the band became stationary from the Bahamas to beyond Bermuda. During this period, a 1035millibar (30.56inHg) high pressure cell had become <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the northeastern United States. This resulted in a strong pressure gradient and winds near gale force along the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{heatwave}} {{was caused}} by a slow moving high-pressure system that <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the Tasman Sea, with a combination of an intense tropical low located off the North West Australian coast and a monsoon trough over northern Australia, which produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed down over southeastern Australia.|$|E

Later {{he studied}} to become a Unitarian {{minister}} at Harvard Divinity School and graduated in 1869; he was <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the Unitarian churches of Littleton and Stow, Massachusetts. In February 1877 he was appointed overseer of the poor in Cambridge, Massachusetts and secretary of the board in May which offices he held until death. He introduced many innovations which proved beneficial to the department.|$|E
25|$|Bradgate Park and its {{surrounding}} areas were heavily overlain in the (geologically) recent past by glacial deposits of Boulder Clay. The Quaternary period includes the last ice age. As the ice melted, some 10,000 years ago, the solid material within the ice <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the 'natural' rocks below. This material includes unsorted clay and sand particles, small and large pebbles and large stones and boulders. It travelled great distances within the ice sheets and glaciers, so individual rocks, whether on the ground, or within the great lengths of stone walls of the Park, may be local stone, or may be a specimen from northern Britain or even from northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Because snow {{gradually}} <b>settles</b> <b>over</b> {{time under}} its own weight, {{the foundations of the}} building were designed to accommodate substantial differential <b>settling</b> <b>over</b> any one wing in any one line or any one column. If differential settling continues, the supported structure will need to be jacked up and re-leveled. The facility was designed with the primary support columns outboard of the exterior walls so that the entire building can be jacked up a full floor level. During this process, a new section of column will be added over the existing columns then the jacks pull the building up to the higher elevation.|$|R

25|$|The city {{began to}} face a series of {{problems}} generated by disorganized growth. Air pollution reached critical levels {{during the winter months}} and a layer of smog <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the city. The authorities adopted legislative measures to reduce industrial pollution and placed restrictions on vehicle use. The Metro was expanded considerably, current lines were extended and three new lines were built between 1997 and 2006 in the southeastern sector. A new extension to Maipú was inaugurated in 2011, at which point the metropolitan railway had a total length of 105 km. In the case of buses, the system underwent a major reform in the early 1990s. In 2007 master plan known as Transantiago was established. It has faced a number of problems since its launch.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, Syria {{accepted}} the proposal of the Arab League summit in Riyadh. This gave Syria {{a mandate to}} keep 40,000 troops in Lebanon as the bulk of an Arab Deterrent Force charged with disentangling the combatants and restoring calm. Other Arab nations were {{also part of the}} ADF, but they lost interest relatively soon, and Syria was again left in sole control, now with the ADF as a diplomatic shield against international criticism. The Civil War was officially ended at this point, and an uneasy quiet <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> Beirut and {{most of the rest of}} Lebanon. In the south, however, the climate began to deteriorate as a consequence of the gradual return of PLO combatants, who had been required to vacate central Lebanon under the terms of the Riyadh Accords.|$|E
25|$|Gallo-Roman culture <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> {{the region}} in the next few centuries, but as Roman power {{weakened}} in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, a Germanic tribe, the Franks, overran large areas that today form modern France. Under King Clovis I in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, Frankish dominions quadrupled as they managed to defeat successive opponents for control of Gaul. In 486 the Frankish armies under Clovis triumphed over Syagrius, the last Roman official in Northern Gaul, at the Battle of Soissons. In 491 Clovis defeated Thuringians east of his territories. In 496 he overcame the Alamanni at the Battle of Tolbiac. In 507 he scored the most impressive victory in his career, prevailing at the Battle of Vouillé against the Visigoths, who were led by Alaric II, the conqueror of Spain.|$|E
50|$|Often, in {{the winter}} months, cool or cold dry air <b>settles</b> <b>over</b> the land in the {{vicinity}} of the Great Basin where it builds into a high-pressure cell or anticyclone that moves across the United States with a cold front on its leading edge. After reaching the Atlantic Ocean, the moist environment brings on changes of the qualities of the air and the dissipation of the high-pressure cell or anticyclone as the cold air warms and becomes humid.In Europe, a portion of the North American/Canadian high usually over Greenland called the Greenland high which <b>settles</b> <b>over</b> Greenland affects northern European weather and may merge with the Scandinavian High.|$|R

25|$|The President {{resolved}} to dismiss Cameron when abolitionists in the North <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the controversy. Cameron would not resign {{until he was}} sure of his successor, and that he could leave the cabinet without damaging his reputation. When a vacancy in the post of Minister to Russia presented itself, Cameron and Lincoln agreed that he would fill the post when he resigned. As for a successor, Lincoln thought Joseph Holt best for the job, but his Secretary of State, William H. Seward, wanted Stanton to succeed Cameron. Salmon Chase, Stanton's friend and Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, agreed. Stanton had been preparing for a partnership with Samuel L. M. Barlow in New York, but abandoned these plans when he heard of his possible nomination. Lincoln nominated Stanton to the post of Secretary of War on January 13. He was confirmed two days following.|$|E
25|$|After two months, {{during which}} time the {{battalion}} undertook a period of basic training, the 3rd Battalion departed Australia, proceeding to Egypt, where they arrived on 2 December 1914. After undertaking another period of training in Egypt, the battalion was employed in the defence of the Suez Canal, before being committed to the Gallipoli Campaign. On 25 April 1915, the 3rd Battalion {{took part in the}} landing at Anzac Cove, going ashore with the second and third waves. As a stalemate <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> the peninsula the battalion was involved in the defence of the beachhead, before taking part in the Battle of Lone Pine in August. It was during this battle, at Sasse's Sap, that Private John Hamilton, performed the deeds that led to him receiving the Victoria Cross. For the next four months the battalion remained at Gallipoli, before being evacuated {{along with the rest of}} the allied forces, in December 1915.|$|E
25|$|Ewi’s Suzerainty in Ado-Ekiti Traditional Layout and 1800s Settlements: Ado-Ekiti and {{all other}} Ado {{communities}} consisted of a ‘large number of traditional rectangular compounds grouped into the quarters of the town’. Within the Ado-Ekiti township layout, the Ewi’s Palace lay in the middle, though it was first built at Oke-Ibon and then moved to Chief Arowa’s Palace strands beside the Erekesin (King’s Market) before it was moved into the vintage point of Oke Ewi where it has finally <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> 200 years ago. The sitting of Ewi’s Palace within Ado’s topography is discussed {{in the work of}} G.J.A. Ojo (1966:76) who noted that Yoruba palaces (aafin) are the residence of King (Oba) and sacred places that houses shrines and temples to all deities worshipped in the kingdom, together with a number of places reserved for ritual activities, oath taking etc. Llyod (1962:192) in similar manner justified the status of the Ewi as a scared ruler in the typical Yoruba fashion. Oral tradition further hinged the sacredness of Ewi and the location of Ewi’s Palace at the centre of the chief city (Ado-Ekiti) on the degree of his relationship and the latitude which his High Chiefs, Military Chiefs, Palace Chiefs and Royal Princes who acted as patron chiefs over hamlets and surrounding villages enjoy.|$|E

This request was connected to an-Nasir's rivalry with Aybak, as the title would be useful in future disputes with the Mamluks. However, the Mamluks had sent their envoys to Baghdad previously to precisely ensure that an-Nasir Yusuf would not gain the title, putting al-Musta'sim in a difficult position.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} large explosions on July 22 broke {{more than a}} month of {{relative}} quiet.

On 11 March 1927, however, El Sol was inbound to New York with a $1,000,000 cargo of pig iron, copper, and bales of cotton. When a heavy fog <b>settled</b> <b>over</b> New York Harbor, Captain Charles H. Knowles ordered his ship to anchor until the fog cleared. As El Sol was being maneuvered into {{position}} at about 07:45, the American Diamond Line ship Sac City hit a glancing blow to El Sol, bounced off and then struck El Sol a second time, ripping through El Sols plating. Sac Citys bow had some slight damage, but El Sol sank quickly in about [...] of water about a half-mile (800 m) south of the Statue of Liberty. Out of El Sols crew of 45 men, 44 were rescued; the ship's carpenter, who could not swim, was last seen clutching the ship's rail as it went below the surface.|$|E
