5|$|A wartime pyramid was {{constructed}} by Italian engineers {{at the site}} of Marseille's fall but over time it decayed. On 22 October 1989, Eduard Neumann and other JG 27 survivors in co-operation with the Egyptian government, erected a new pyramid that <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> to this day.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{remained}} {{much the}} same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop {{in the country at}} the time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the topmast of the , one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> serving as a flag pole.|$|E
25|$|With {{uncertainty}} abound after {{a disappointing}} playoffs on the field, {{and even more}} so in the <b>stands,</b> <b>there</b> were a great deal of questions surrounding the club and their future.

25|$|The Stadium {{does not}} have covered <b>stands,</b> <b>there</b> are no flood lights, the stadium does not even have a digital scoreboard. The stadium has no proper white screens instead it uses old school {{portable}} cloth screens. The pitch is not well-managed either, the curator uses a hand-rolled roller which makes pitch management even more difficult. There are no practical arrangements for video coverage of a match. The stadium has eight entrances and a well-built pavilion.|$|E
25|$|Borovansky's next ballet, The Black Swan, {{also had}} an Australian theme. It {{was based on a}} {{historical}} incident in 1697 when Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company was exploring Australia. He discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now <b>stands.</b> <b>There</b> were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. Thus, the main plot of the ballet was the story of the Captain entranced by a black swan, which symbolised a new land. The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} 1614 {{separation}} of the grounds between the two confessions, {{the upper part of}} the church grounds, including the peak of the Profitis Ilias and two small chapels on the mountain, was handed over to two brothers on the island, who founded the monastery of the Prophet Elijah, that <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> until today. In 1827, the new church in Fira, the main city on the island, was inaugurated, and the episcopal seat moved there. After the creation of the Kingdom of Greece in 1832, the property of the church was diminished step by step. Starting in 1850, the church sold its remaining lands, with the last vineyards being sold in 1902.|$|E
25|$|At first {{erected in}} the little village centre before the town hall, it was quickly dynamited off its {{pedestal}} by the priest, then successively kept in pieces behind a hair salon, repaired by welding, and at last moved several kilometres {{to the place where}} it still <b>stands.</b> <b>There,</b> it was once again torn off its pedestal by a tropical cyclone, then abandoned, face down on the ground, for twenty years before finally being found by chance during construction work in 1968. It was then put back in place, rehabilitated as a memorial to World War I dead, celebrated in magnificent public ceremonies, registered in the general inventory of historic monuments, and finally classified as such in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The ground barely {{changed from}} then until the mid-1980s. During {{this time the}} ground had a hump in {{the centre of the}} ground making only the top half of players visible {{from the other side of}} the ground. There was a shed for players located where the main {{pavilion}} now <b>stands.</b> <b>There</b> was a hill on the outer (where the hill now is) that could accommodate two rows of vehicles, the small scoreboard stood on the outer close to where the electronic scoreboard is now, and the time clock sat about halfway up a training light tower. The police booth sat, until very recently, in the north-east corner of the oval. A concrete cricket pitch served for local junior teams until the 1956/57 season, when it was replaced by a turf wicket.|$|E

25|$|Maryland Square, {{a mansion}} on the {{outskirts}} of Baltimore, Maryland, owned by the Steuart family until 1861, when, {{at the beginning of the}} American Civil War, it was confiscated by the United States Federal Government. In 1862 Jarvis Hospital was constructed on the grounds of the Steuart estate, built for the care of wounded Union soldiers, the house itself being used as the hospital's headquarters. The house was restored in 1866 to Brigadier General George H. Steuart after the war, but he never lived there again, choosing to live at Mount Steuart, his family estate on the Chesapeake in Anne Arundel County. The building was sold and became a school for boys, known as Steuart Hall, and in 1884 the mansion was demolished, to make way for the Bon Secours Hospital which <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> today.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, in Scotland, he gave $10 {{million to}} {{establish}} the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. It was created by a deed which he signed on June 7, 1901, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter on August 21, 1902. The establishing gift of $10 million was, then, an unprecedented sum: at the time, total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about £50,000 a year. The aim of the Trust was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university. He was subsequently elected Lord Rector of University of St. Andrews in December 1901. He also donated {{large sums of money}} to Dunfermline, the place of his birth. In addition to a library, Carnegie also bought the private estate which became Pittencrieff Park and opened it to all members of the public, establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust to benefit the people of Dunfermline. A statue of him <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> today.|$|E
25|$|The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Hammir {{defeated}} {{and captured}} Muhammad Tughlaq with the Bargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq {{had to pay}} a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar's lands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittorgarh for a few hundred years. The Rajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengal and north into the Punjab. The Tomaras established themselves at Gwalior, and Man Singh Tomar built the fortress which still <b>stands</b> <b>there.</b> During this period, Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state; and Rana Kumbha expanded his kingdom {{at the expense of}} the Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat. The next great Rajput ruler, Rana Sanga of Mewar, became the principal player in Northern India. His objectives grew in scope – he planned to conquer the much sought after prize of the Muslim rulers of the time, Delhi. But, his defeat in the Battle of Khanwa consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India. However, Maharana Pratap of Mewar, a 16th-century Rajput ruler, firmly resisted the Mughals. Akbar sent many missions against him. He survived to ultimately gain control of all of Mewar, excluding the Chittor Fort.|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} Megadeth and its {{underground}} metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums {{from this period}} were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and [...] "snarling" [...] vocals. When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: [...] "When {{you go to a}} show and see a guitar player who just <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." [...] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{believed}} that the motion control system in Fighters Uncaged did not work and that the fighting mechanic was poorly made. Mark Walton of GameSpot wrote that he {{found it to be}} [...] "immensely frustrating", saying that the controls were [...] "simply broken". Wyatt Fossett for Gamesradar abhorred the system, disparaging Ubisoft and AMA Studios for the poorly optimized game, saying that they [...] "didn’t [...] on this title; they weren’t even invited to the sport in which the ball exists". In regards to the motion detection, Fossett wrote that [...] "Every third punch thrown is recognized and every block you attempt is either exaggerated or completely ignored". Smith compared the combat to that of the luck in rock, paper, scissors, noting that [...] "90% of the time" [...] the attack will be avoided or blocked, while for the other 10%, the character [...] "just <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> like a lemon, refusing to acknowledge the command". Jack DeVries thought that when in a fight, the moves become a [...] "series of desperate flails" [...] in an attempt for the game to notice the player's actions.|$|E

500|$|The stadium {{features}} a [...] association football pitch, and eight all-weather running tracks, which surround the pitch. The tracks are certified for {{national and international}} athletic competitions. Also available at the stadium are areas on each short side of the pitch for the high jump, javelin throw, pole vault and shot put events. In front of the Southern Stand there are pits for long jump and triple jump. When the stadium is used for association football, two dugouts are placed {{at the edge of}} the pitch in front of the Southern Stand. Behind the two dugouts, on the other side of the running tracks, is the entrance and exit to the players' changing rooms, which are located in the Southern Stand. There are a total of 12 changing rooms inside the stand, as well as facilities for referees and media. There are reserved seats for officials and media in the Southern Stand. In the respective corridors behind the Southern and Northern Stands, as well as in the open area between the Northern and Western <b>Stands,</b> <b>there</b> are several vendors selling snacks, light meals, and beverages. The entrances to the stadium are located along the Southern and Northern Stands. A ticket office, formerly used for selling the tickets for Malmö FF home matches, is connected with the Southern Stand.|$|E
