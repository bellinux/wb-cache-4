40|$|The {{majority}} of teleost fish use suction feeding to capture prey, yet teleosts display a remarkable diversity of feeding morphology. It has been assumed that this diversity results in variation in <b>suction</b> feeding <b>performance,</b> and several {{attempts have been}} made to link morphology to behavioral performance as measured experimentally (Lauder and Clark, 1984; Norton and Brainerd, 1993; Webb, 1984; Werner, 1977) or interpreted through trophic ecology (Huskey and Turingan, 2001; Norton, 1995). However, these attempts have been largely observational in that they did not quantitatively describe the link between morphology and <b>suction</b> feeding <b>performance.</b> The lack of a general and quantitative understanding of the morphological basis of <b>suction</b> feeding <b>performance</b> limits the functional interpretation of fish morphological form, its ecological implications and its evolution. The objective of the present study was to use a biomechanical model of force transmission in the fish head to predict one aspect of <b>suction</b> feeding <b>performance,</b> subambient buccal pressure generation, from morphological parameters in five species of centrarchid fish. Suction feeding on elusive prey involves explosive cranial kinematics that incur hydrodynamic loading, measurable as subambient pressures inside the mouth (buccal) cavity (Alexander, 1969; Van Leeuwen and Muller, 1983). The magnitude of subambient buccal pressure indicates the strength of suction generated by the fish and is expected to increase with the velocity of water flow into the mouth (Muller et al., 1982). The magnitude of buccal pressure is known to increase with increasing speed of kinematic movement (Sanford and Wainwright, 2002; Svanback et al., 2002) or in situations where increased kinematic speed would be expected, such as increased predator motivation (Lauder, 1980) or increased prey elusivity (Nemeth, 1997).

Several types of cavitation occur inside the inducer, numerous experiments and CFD simulations are conducted.

In addition, low inlet pressure makes the flow to be cavitated {{not only at the}} inducer, but also at the impeller in real cases. Therefore, flow through an inducer and an impeller should considered simultaneously. In this study, LOX pump composed of an inducer and an impeller is analyzed by using commercial CFD code ANSYS CFX 13. 0.

The test goals include verification of <b>suction</b> <b>performance</b> against heritage J- 2 S data, head production, effects of thermodynamic suppression head (TSH), and evaluation of the inducer dynamic pressure caused by cavitation instabilities. Test facilities at both Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) and NASA s Stennis Space Center (SSC) are employed for the testing. The inducer only water test effort conducted at PWR established performance curves for <b>suction</b> <b>performance,</b> head production, and efficiency over a wide operating range.

The FTP testing performed at SSC provides these <b>suction</b> <b>performance</b> relationships as well as inlet duct dynamic pressures during liquid hydrogen operation. The test effort successfully confirms the heritage J- 2 S <b>suction</b> <b>performance</b> and establishes the amount of TSH between water and hydrogen operation at the design flow coefficient.

These instabilities {{should be avoided}} or settled for applying inducers widely in industrial fields. In the present study, the attempts to suppress the cavitation surge, which has been observed under partial flow conditions in our helical inducers, are made by installing the obstacle plates just upstream of inducer. Two kinds of obstacle plates were used; One {{of which is a}} ring-shaped axi-symmetric plate with blockage of 39 % passage at the maximum near tip region to suppress the growth of inlet back flow under partial flow conditions. The other is to block the flow axi-asymmetrically up to 69 % of flow passage and make the inlet distortion, being used to examine the suppressive effects of asymmetric inflow on the cavitation surge. In this paper, the effects of the proposed obstacle plates on the head-rise and <b>suction</b> <b>performances</b> of inducer are firstly reported.

40|$|The cerato-mandibular (c-md) {{ligament}} is a synapomorphy within Pomacentridae {{that creates}} a tight link between the lower jaws and the hyoid bars. However, this morphological trait has been secondarily lost in multiple lineages during evolution.

Ecomorphological interpretations suggested the loss of the c-md ligament has ultimately led to a new adaptive peak in zooplanktivory through an optimization of the ram feeding mode associated with a specialization in pelagic feeding. Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing functional and diet diversity between damselfish species with and without the c-md ligament. Although species lacking the c-md ligament presented a conserved kinematic pattern resulting from high ram and low <b>suction</b> <b>performances,</b> our results did not support an optimization of the ram feeding mode. Indeed, some species with the c-md ligament showed the same or exceeded the ram performance of species without the c-md ligament.

There are many ways of improving the <b>suction</b> <b>performance</b> of centrifugal pumps. Enlarging the inlet diameter or inlet angle {{are two of the}} most commonly used methods. However, this may increase the capacity at which inlet reverse flow begins. Inlet reverse flow normally starts to occur at about half of the shock-free inlet capacity, and this has no relation to the best efficiency flow.

40|$|Successful prey capture by aquatic suction feeders {{depends on}} the ability of the {{predator}} to generate a flow of water external to the mouth that overcomes any movements and forces that the prey uses to resist the suction flow. Elucidating the nature and magnitude of these forces is a key to understanding what limits <b>suction</b> feeding <b>performance.</b> We identify three potential forces produced by the suction flow field: drag, acceleration reaction and the fluid pressure gradient. Using a mathematical model parameterized with empirical data from feeding bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, we explore the relative magnitude of these forces under three encounter scenarios with a 5 mm diameter, spherical prey: an immobile mid-water prey, a similar prey that executes an escape response, and a prey item that grips a substratum. Contrary to the almost exclusive emphasis on drag in the suction feeding literature, drag made a minor contribution to the total forces in all three cases. In all three scenarios, the pressure gradient is the largest of the three forces.

In this study, epaxial activation and strain, hyoid depression, and intra-oral pressure were simultaneously measured during suction feeding in the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). A mechanical model of muscle force transmission between the neurocranium and oral cavity was used to estimate muscle stress, work, and power. The epaxials shortened from rest an average of 9 % of their length, with the highest efforts producing greater than 20 % strain. Onset of shortening was simultaneous with or shortly after (b 10 ms) onset of activation. Maximal net power for individual fish ranged from 17 to 137 W kg− 1. Muscle power was significantly correlated with rectified EMG area (r= 0. 80; pb 0. 0001). The power required for cranial expansion was significantly correlated with epaxial power (r= 0. 81; pb 0. 0001), and the power exponent of this relationship (∼ 1 for 3 of the 4 fish) implies that epaxial power accounts {{for most of the}} power of cranial expansion.

These undesirable consequences can, however, be avoided or at least moderated by modifications upstream of the impeller. The <b>suction</b> <b>performance</b> can also be improved by using double suction instead of single suction pumps.

We created a morphospace of 2, 939 species spanning 56 families of tropical Indo-Pacific reef fishes and established the primary axes of body shape variation, the phylogenetic consistency of these patterns, and whether dominant patterns of shape change can be accomplished by diverse underlying changes. Principal component analysis showed a major axis of shape variation that contrasts deep-bodied species with slender, elongate forms. Furthermore, using custom methods to compare the elongation vector (axis that maximizes elongation deformation) and the main vector of shape variation (first principal component) for each family in the morphospace, we showed that two thirds of the families diversify along an axis of body elongation. Finally, a comparative analysis using a principal coordinate analysis based on the angles among first principal component vectors of each family shape showed that families accomplish changes in elongation {{with a wide range of}} underlying modifications. Some groups such as Pomacentridae and Lethrinidae undergo decreases in body depth with proportional increases in all body regions, while other families show disproportionate changes in the length of the head (e. g., Labridae), the trunk or caudal region in all combinations (e. g., Pempheridae and Pinguipedidae).

This example demonstrates the deficiency in the standard modelling of the ?Acceleration Head? effect. A new method is proposed to better predict <b>suction</b> <b>performance</b> in the field based on traditional NPSHR testing and a ?Power Density Index? (PDI). Computer modelling is discussed that would be needed for pumps with a high PDI...|$|E
40|$|Wound {{filters are}} quite {{popular in the}} {{domestic}} water purification systems. The performance of these filters {{is based on the}} distinctive yarn and winding variables. Yarn used for filtration application is normally produced on DREF spinning system. Several researchers have reported the influence of DREF spinning variables on yarn properties. However none of them are in context of filtration application. Since elucidation of influence of winding parameters on the filter performance has already been reported; it thus becomes intriguing to explore the influence of spinning suction pressure on filtration behavior. Yarn spun at different suction pressures was used to produce wound filter cartridges, keeping winding variables unchanged. Filters wound using yarn spun at higher spinning suction pressure resulted in greater pressure drop but showed better micron rating. However the pressure drop encountered also affects the retention capacity of the wound filter. The outcome of this study helps in establishing the relation between spinning <b>suction</b> pressure and <b>performance</b> parameters of wound filters. Design expert® software was used to develop regression equations to predict performance of wound filter for the given spinning suction pressure which is of practical significance for yarn and filter manufacturers, without performing filter test...|$|R
40|$|Suction anchors may be {{subjected}} to quasihorizontal, quasivertical or inclined loading {{depending on the type}} of structure and the water depth. The loading conditions can give rise to horizontal and vertical loads, and moments. To achieve the best <b>performance,</b> <b>suction</b> anchors may be used in different ways. A single cylindrical unit is normally used for typical floaters, and to achieve higher load resistance a cluster of several attached cylinders may be installed. They may also be used with external wings to optimize the horizontal holding capacity by an enlarged projected area. The behaviour of the suction anchor subjected to lateral and pullout loading is presented in this paper. This is to observe the effects of the external wings on the failure mechanism and ultimate capacity of the foundation. The general-purpose finite element program DIANA is being used for this study. A nonlinear analysis was performed on a three dimensional model formed using eight-node isoparametric solid brick elements. The soil was modelled as an elastic perfectly plastic material with von Mises yield criterion for saturated clay. Both load control and displacement control analyses were used for this study...|$|R
40|$|Curved {{diffusers}} {{are used}} in pipe lines or in some fluid machineries, such as blades of impeller, a volute casing, or <b>suction</b> duct. The <b>performance</b> of the curved diffuser has a considerable effect on the energy conversion in the pipe lines or the machineries. Furthermore, the volute casing in the pumps or blowers is generally attached to the radial diffuser, so that the flow in the volute or scroll casing has usually very high complexities. The flow in the volute casing will be moderated by {{the combination of the}} single curved diffuser and the longitudinal side wall slit duct. However, the studies to the flow in the curved diffuser with the longitudinal slit, were merely conducted in the past ages. In this report, as a step of the study of the flow in the volute casing, experiments of flow in a two-dimensional curved diffuser, which has a small diverging angle and 90 ° turning angle, were carried out. The time average velocities and velocity fluctuations were measured using a constant temperature hot-wire or split film probe system. It is shown that the flow in the curved diffuser has velocity profiles with gradually variant gradients and attached to the outer side wall, and the profiles of velocity fluctuations have very interesting patterns concernig to the stall and the secondary flow...|$|R
