40|$|Currently, touch {{panels are}} used in many devices, {{and there have been}} many {{proposals}} to add tactile <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> panels, which require additional electro-mechanical components. In this paper, we propose a simple method of adding a tactile sensation of a ridge, using just a thin sheet. The sheet has ridges that are haptically imperceptible, but once a visual cue such as a line is presented, visuotactile cross-modal response induces a haptic ridge. We tested the effects of the visual cue and height of the ridge. The result showed that the visual cue definitely enhances feeling of a ridge...|$|E
40|$|This study compares sensory {{recovery}} after total {{lower lip}} reconstruction {{in a wide}} variety of flaps including bilateral depressor anguli oris flap, submental island flap, bilateral fan flaps, radial forearm flap, and pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps in a large number of patients. Spontaneous return of flap sensation was documented by clinical testing in the majority (3 %) of patients who underwent total lower lip reconstruction. Sensory recovery occurred more often in patients with fasciocutaneous free flaps than in those with musculocutaneous flaps. Flap <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch,</b> two-point discrimination, and temperature perception was correlated with age, smoking, and radiation treated patients. We conclude that reasonable sensory recovery may be expected in noninnervated flaps, provided that the major regional sensorial nerve has not been sacrificed, and also provided that the patients age is relatively young and that enough surface contact area of the recipient bed is present without marked scarring.

40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{evaluate}} immunotherapy {{as a means}} of improving peripheral blood flow in chronic leprosy patients. Design: this was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Materials: heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae 1 mg plus 0. 02 μg Tuberculin protein per 0. 1 ml dose in borate buffer, with saline as placebo. Those studied were 92 long-treated residents of a leprosy centre in Iran, 10 of their healthy children and 10 staff members. Evaluation employed the Perimed PF 2, Laser–Doppler Flowmeter, a platinum skin thermistor, and a thermal sensibility tester. Methods: single intradermal injections of test or placebo were given to 103 patients 18 months before the blinded evaluation. Fingerpulp blood flux was measured in controlled conditions and vasomotor reflexes and skin <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch,</b> pain and heat were evaluated in 45 and 47 patients in the placebo and M. vaccae groups, respectively, and in 20 healthy control persons. Results: Laser–Doppler flux, skin temperature, vasomotor reflexes and sensation were impaired in leprosy patients. Immunotherapy improved (p < 0. 05) Laser–Doppler flux, skin temperature and temperature sensation. Conclusions: immunotherapy, given 18 months earlier, significantly improved blood flow and temperature sensation, in fully-treated, chronic, leprosy patients. The same principles might be employed in other conditions of reduced peripheral blood flow...|$|E

25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> light <b>touch</b> and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|R

40|$|A {{cutaneous}} current perception threshold (CPT) sen-sory {{testing device}} measures {{both large and}} small di-ameter sensory nerve fiber function and may be useful in evaluating differential neural blockade. Eight sub-jects received both lumbar epidural saline and lumbar epidural lidocaine. Five milliliters of normal saline was administered and the CPTs were measured. After the saline, 10 mL of 2 % plain lidocaine was administered. CPTs, and <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch,</b> pinprick, and cold were subsequently measured. Saline had no effect on any measurements. Lidocaine caused an increase in all CPTs at the umbilicus and the knee reaching a statistical D ifferential epidural blockade is often used to evaluate chronic pain syndromes. The technique is used to differentiate sympathetic, somatic, and central pain. Because lidocaine is short-acting and has a rapid onset, it is usually the local anesthetic of choice for this procedure. Since the description of this technique by Winnie and Collins (l), it has generated much controversy. Both in vitro and in uivo studies have cast doubt on the existence of a differential effect of local anesthetics on varying sizes of nerve fibers. Although zones of differential sensory block after neuroaxial local anesthetics have been demonstrated in humans (2 - 5), both in viva and in vitro studies have produced conflicting results (6, 7). With the crude sensory measurements used in the human studies, {{it is difficult to determine}} which fibers are blocked. In addition, studies have demonstrated that the systemic administration of lidocaine will result in a selective depression of C fiber-evoked activity at plasma levels of < 5 pg/mL (8, 9). The injection of a local anesthetic into the epidural space may result in significant plasma levels which could have widespread effects on neural function.

40|$|Neuropathic pain {{has only}} {{recently}} been recognised as a complication of leprosy. We assessed 101 treated leprosy patients in Mumbai and found that 22 of them had neuropathic pain. The pain occurred as numbness 86 %, tingling 68 %, and decreased <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> light <b>touch</b> 81 %. This pain {{was significantly associated with}} nerve enlargement and tenderness, which suggests that ongoing inflammation may be important in causation. A questionnaire-based screening tool (Douleur Neuropathique 4) for detecting neuropathic pain has been developed and validated in other patients groups. We are the first group to have used the DN 4 as a screening tool in leprosy patients and found that it worked well, detecting 78 % of patients with no inappropriate diagnoses. There is also an increasing recognition that leprosy is associated with psychological morbidity. Neuropathic pain is also associated with psychological morbidity. We also assessed psychological morbidity using the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire and found that neuropathic pain and psychological morbidity are associated with leprosy patients. Leprosy patients with neuropathic pain thus have a double hit for psychological morbidity. Clinicians looking after leprosy patients should warn their patients about neuropathic pain and assess their patients for psychological morbidity...|$|R

She has experienced progressive difficulty in ambulating over the same time period, and today she cannot stand or walk without assistance. There is no history of trauma, loss of bowel or bladder control, or urinary retention, but she does have a history of chronic constipation. On physical examination, her temperature is 37. 1 °C (98. 8 °F), blood pressure is 120 / 72 mmHg, heart rate is 113 beats/min, and respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min. She has a dimple over the T 9 spinous process surrounded by mild erythema. She has exacerbated (4 þ) patellar and Achilles reflexes. The upper extremity reflexes are 2 þ bilaterally. Babinski sign is demonstrated bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3 / 5 in her lower extremities and 5 / 5 in her upper extremities. She cannot stand without support and can only take two steps before stating that her legs are tired. <b>Sensations</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> and pain are intact throughout the lower and upper extrem-ities. The rest of the physical examination findings are normal. Laboratory evaluation shows normal complete metabolic panel and complete blood cell count. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 9 mm/hr and C-reactive protein measures less than 2. 9 mg/L (27. 62 nmol/L).

2500|$|The aims {{at a new}} {{understanding}} of regionalism yet in a modern idiom materialised in the greater use of timber - the building material most associated historically with Finnish architecture. However, there lies a dichotomy in its use: between its inherent positive values and its use as symbolising nostalgia, not to mention exploiting its industrial potential by the pervading timber industry. Already in 1956 Alvar Aalto argued that the use of wood was not a nostalgic return to a traditional material; {{it was a case of}} its [...] "biological characteristics, its limited heat conductivity, its kinship with man and living nature, the pleasant <b>sensation</b> <b>to</b> the <b>touch</b> that it gives.". A special unit, the so-called Wood Studio - partly funded by the Finnish wood industry - was founded at Aalto University not only to research wood construction but also to build experimental structures in wood, often using computer-based parametric design principles. An early example of this is the Observation Tower at Helsinki Zoo (2002) by Ville Hara and the Wood Studio. Similarly, Kärsämäki Shingle Church (1999-2004) by Anssi Lassila, was the result of a student competition held by the University of Oulu Department of Architecture, based on the idea of a modern church built using 18th century timber construction techniques, as a reminder of a previous church on the same site. Other notable large-scale wooden constructions since 2000 include the Sibelius Concert Hall, Lahti (1997-2000), by APRT; the east stand roof of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2005) by K2S Architects; and Kilden Performing Arts Centre, Kristiansand, Norway (2012), by ALA Architects.

A biopsy study of the le-sion will show infiltration of the dermis by chronic inflammatory cells and inflamma-tion, and disorganization and partial de-struction of the dermal nerves. One or more AFB may be found inside the dermal nerves, the arrector pili muscles or in the subepithelial region (3).
