5|$|Since its {{creation}} as a breed, the <b>Selle</b> Français {{has been selected}} solely as a sport horse. Because of this, the breed has homogenized and refined, and since {{its creation}} has been a successful competitor in international equestrian sport. In July 2003, the Association nationale du <b>selle</b> français (ANSF or National Association of French Saddle Horses) was approved as the breed association. The ANSF plays an advocacy role with stakeholders and partners in the equine world and ensures a proper orientation of selection and genetic improvement within the breed. Breeding of <b>Selle</b> Français is centered in Normandy, mainly due to its origins in Norman-related bloodlines. As of 2009, there were 7,722 farms that reported breeding activity of <b>Selle</b> Français, although the vast majority (around 77 percent) were very small operations with only one mare. In 2008, there were 7,638 <b>Selle</b> Français foals born, which made up 57 {{percent of the total}} saddle horses bred in France. In 2009, over 13,500 <b>Selle</b> Français mares were bred, of which 11,830 were mated to approved stallions to produce <b>Selle</b> Français offspring. In the same year, there were 505 active <b>Selle</b> Français stallions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Selle</b> Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a <b>Selle</b> Français to be registered, it must be from two registered <b>Selle</b> Français parents or from {{a cross between a}} <b>Selle</b> Français and a facteur de <b>selle</b> français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as <b>Selle</b> Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the stud {{book was}} divided into two parts: a section for pure <b>Selle</b> Français from two {{registered}} parents and a section for horses with one facteur de <b>selle</b> français parent. In 2009, this distinction was abandoned and the two sections were recombined into a single stud book.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{the first}} Cairanoolithus fossils {{discovered}} outside of France were first reported by Albert G. <b>Selles</b> in his PhD thesis at Universitat de Barcelona, {{in which he}} also proposed that Cairanoolithus be moved into its own oofamily. Three years later, <b>Selles</b> and Angel Galobart published a comprehensive reanalysis of Cairanoolithus, in which they formally named the new oofamily, Cairanoolithidae, to contain Cairanaoolithus. Contrary to Cousin's conclusions, <b>Selles</b> and Galobart separated the oospecies C. dughii and C. roussetensis. Also, they demonstrated that Cairanoolithus was not the eggs of an ornithopod or sauropod and conjectured {{that it could be}} the eggs of a nodosaur.|$|R
5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the <b>Selle</b> Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses {{registered with the}} stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as <b>Selle</b> Français. <b>Selle</b> Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. <b>Selle</b> Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, several <b>Selle</b> Français rose to {{prominence}} in international competition. Quidam de Revel (b. 1982), {{was on the}} French bronze medal winning show jumping team at the 1992 Summer Olympics, ridden by Hervé Godignon, and Quito de Baussy (b. 1982) was a European champion, world champion and {{another member of the}} French team in 1992, ridden by Éric Navet. Rochet Rouge (1983–2008) was a show jumping European champion in 1999 and an individual bronze medalist at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The 2000s saw <b>Selle</b> Français among the world leaders in both show jumping and three-day eventing. Four stallions made up the champion show jumping team at the 2002 World Equestrian Games, while four more <b>Selle</b> Francais made up the winning three-day event team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2003, a <b>Selle</b> Francais became the European champion in vaulting, and another was named the world champion in competitive trail riding. The <b>Selle</b> Français continued to lead international show jumping competitions in the 2010s, with Swiss rider Steve Guerdat riding a member of the breed to individual gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Selle</b> Français is bred {{throughout}} France and abroad, {{and artificial}} insemination {{plays an important}} role in the dissemination of the breed. The <b>Selle</b> Français has also contributed to several other breeds in Europe, including the Holsteiner, Zangersheide and Oldenburg warmblood breeds. The ANSF has branches in several countries. The United Kingdom organization, called Equicours, led to the opening of a British stud book for the <b>Selle</b> Français, and the ANSF-US manages the stud book for the breed in the United States. Brazil, Argentina and Morocco have agreements with the French stud book to register horses bred in those countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, the Anglo-Norman {{studbook}} was {{combined with}} other regional warmblood saddle horses such as the Demi-sang du Centre and the Vendéen {{in order to create}} a unified national warmblood studbook for the <b>Selle</b> Français or French saddle horse. The French government actively supported the merger of regional types and breeds with a large financial appropriation. In spite of this merger, for decades afterwards, horses from Anglo-Norman bloodlines were clearly identifiable within the <b>Selle</b> Français due to differences in conformation.|$|E
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the <b>Selle</b> Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce <b>Selle</b> Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some <b>Selle</b> Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Institut français du cheval et de l'équitation (French Institute of Horse Riding), the École {{nationale}} d'équitation (National Riding School) and the Cadre Noir all use mainly <b>Selle</b> Français.

5|$|The <b>Selle</b> Français (SF) is a {{breed of}} sport horse from France. It is renowned {{primarily}} for its success in show jumping, but many {{have also been}} successful in dressage and eventing. An athletic horse with good gaits, it is usually bay or chestnut in color. The <b>Selle</b> Français was created in 1958 when several French riding horse breeds were merged into one stud book. The new breed was meant {{to serve as a}} unified sport horse during a period when horses were being replaced by mechanization and were transforming into an animal used mainly for sport and leisure.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Selle</b> Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the <b>Selle</b> Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the <b>Selle</b> Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a <b>Selle</b> Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Selle</b> Français is {{generally}} bay or chestnut in color, {{the latter being}} a legacy of its origins in the Anglo-Norman breed. Gray is much less common, with its origins in the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arabian horses {{that contributed to the}} breed. White markings, such as white on the lower legs, are fairly common within the breed, and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors. The temperament of the <b>Selle</b> Français is highly variable from one horse to another. This is due to the selection criteria for breeding stock, which {{since the beginning of the}} breed have been based on physical ability. In recent years, however, the ANSF and breeders have been working to create selection criteria that focus on temperament. The vast majority of <b>Selle</b> Français have good temperaments, quiet but energetic, patient and friendly. The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn.|$|E

5|$|Mares can be {{of several}} origins and be listed as facteur de <b>selle</b> français.

Mares belonging to other saddle horse breeds recognized by the European Union (EU) are also listed in this category. Pure and crossbred Arabians, saddle breeds not recognized by the EU and some other mares may be listed on an individual basis by performing at a high level in show jumping, three-day eventing or dressage competition. If mares come from countries or territories that {{do not have access to}} high-level competitions, they may be granted special listing status.|$|E
5|$|After the assault, the 33rd Division {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} German forces, while the 38th stayed close behind {{ready to take}} over the advance or assault strongly-held German positions as needed. On 9 October, Clary was liberated and the next day the divisional artillery was firing in support of the 33rd which had made contact with German forces. Over the next few days, the 33rd Division pursued the Germans to the River <b>Selle</b> and launched a bloody assault on the defended eastern bank during the opening stages of the Battle of the <b>Selle.</b> While a bridgehead was secured, it was abandoned due to losses and the 38th Division was moved forward. On the night of 13/14 October, the division took over the line near Troisvilles and Bertry. Over the next six days, the division prepared itself: conducting reconnaissance, constructing bridges and moving up heavy artillery. During these preparations, the Germans bombarded elements of the division's artillery with gas shells.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Norman {{was used}} to create several other breeds of horses {{throughout}} Europe and Asia. These included the Greek Andravida, which was created by crossing native Greek mares with Anglo-Norman stallions, and the Swiss Freiberger, a blend of Anglo-Norman lines with Thoroughbreds and native horses from the Jura Mountains. The Hungarian Nonius breed stems from an Anglo-Norman stallion named Nonius Senior, and Anglo-Norman blood was also used to add refinement to the German Oldenburg, through the stallions Condor (born 1950) and Furioso II, a <b>Selle</b> Français. The Anglo-Norman {{was used to}} create the Polish Sokolsky horse and the Chinese Heihe breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} reserve until April 1918, when German forces attacked {{as part of}} the Spring Offensive. During the Battle of the Lys, the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was effectively wiped out, leaving a two-mile wide gap in the British lines. The 33rd was ordered into position, and Pinney personally commanded the divisional machine-gun battalion, which—with the assistance of various stragglers from retreating units—helped turn back a heavy German attack at the Battle of Hazebrouck on 12 and 13 April. For his service in April, Pinney, along with the commanders of the 12th, 55th and 61st Divisions, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The 33rd was used to train the American 30th Infantry Division through the summer, but went over to the offensive in September, seeing action at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal, the Battle of Cambrai, and the Battle of the <b>Selle.</b> At the <b>Selle,</b> Pinney organised a dawn attack with improvised bridges, allowing the 33rd to force a bridgehead and successfully clear the opposing bank in a short time. The division finished the war in the Sambre valley, and began demobilisation. In February 1919, with the division mostly demobilised, Pinney retired from the army, aged fifty-six, after thirty-five years service.|$|E
