40|$|Recently it {{was shown}} that free recall {{consists}} of two stages: the first few recalls empty working memory and a second stage concludes the recall (Tarnow, 2015; {{for a review of}} the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974). Here I investigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40 - 1 (1962) free recall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the presence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement of the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large suppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls between 10 and 40 items away). The second <b>stage</b> <b>forward</b> subsequent recall is enhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls are concentrated at small distances. Thus both <b>stages</b> favor <b>forward</b> subsequent recalls. As in Tarnow (2015), the first stage is much more localized than the second stage. Working memory capacity is estimated in six ways to be about 4. 5 word items for the 40 - 1 word list...|$|R
