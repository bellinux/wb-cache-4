In both cases, anomalies in the strength of the SH <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> precede similarly signed anomalies in the tropospheric circulation that persist for more than 2 months.

It {{is essentially the}} same as the PUMA model described in Fraedrich et al. (1998), but is extended by non-equally spaced sigma levels to allow higher vertical resolution in the stratosphere, and by a modified diabatic forcing above the troposphere to generate an idealized winter time <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> The integrations have been performed at T 42 L 30 resolution, with the lowest 9 model levels being equally spaced in sigma (representing the troposphere) and the remaining 21 levels equally spaced in log(sigma) (with 9 levels falling into the stratosphere), and at a time step of 15 minutes. In order to prevent numerical instability by spurious wave reflection, a sponge layer is introduced in the upper most 12 model levels by linearly damping the horizontal wind. The diabatic forcing above the troposphere closely resembles that described in Polvani and Kushner (2002).

This study {{examines}} pre-industrial control simulations from CMIP 5 climate models in an effort to better understand the complex relationships between Arctic sea ice and the stratosphere, and between Arctic sea ice and cold winter temperatures over Eurasia. We present normalized regressions of Arctic sea-ice area against several atmospheric variables at extended lead and lag times. Statistically significant regressions are found at leads and lags, suggesting both atmospheric precursors of, and responses to, low sea ice; but generally, the regressions are stronger when the atmosphere leads sea ice, including a weaker <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>vortex</b> indicated by positive polar cap height anomalies. Significant positive midlatitude eddy heat flux anomalies are also found to precede low sea ice. We argue that low sea ice and raised polar cap height are both a response to this enhanced midlatitude eddy heat flux. The so-called “warm Arctic, cold continents” anomaly pattern is present one to two months before low sea ice, but is absent in the months following low sea ice, suggesting that the Eurasian cooling and low sea ice are driven by similar processes. Lastly, our results suggest a dependence on the geographic region of low sea ice, with low Barents–Kara Sea ice correlated with a weakened <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>vortex,</b> whilst low Sea of Okhotsk ice is correlated with a strengthened <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> Overall, the results support a notion that the sea ice, <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>vortex</b> and Eurasian surface temperatures collectively respond to large-scale changes in tropospheric circulation.

In line with recent reassessments of the HT effect, we find that an easterly QBO in the lower stratosphere leads {{to the formation of}} a midlatitude wave guide that enhances both the upward propagating planetary waves from the troposphere into the lower stratosphere (~ 35 – 50 °N, 30 – 200 [*]hPa) and the northward wave propagation in the upper to middle stratosphere (~ 35 – 60 °N, 20 – 5 [*]hPa). This enhanced poleward refraction of planetary waves results in a more disturbed <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> causing the HT effect. The weakening of the HT effect in 1978 – 1997 was associated with a broader and strengthened <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in November to January. The divergence of wave activity generated by eddies growing within the vortex provided the momentum source and allowed wave activity to propagate meridionally away from the vortex; this interfered with the QBO modulation of planetary wave propagation and led to a weakening of the HT effect during this period. The stronger than average <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in 1978 – 1997 was associated with a vertically coherent cooling signature over northeastern Asia in the stratosphere.

During the period of restabilization after the "minor breakdown," a small area of mean descent appears over the polar cap. During the amplification stage, the internal energy conversions are acting to increase the eddy kinetic energy. The mean meridional circulation is direct at higher latitudes, opposite to that occurring during a major breakdown.

A new set of teleconnection patterns was produced from low-pass-filtered daily 300 hPa height data of NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data 1958 - 1998. All teleconnections are meridional dipoles, which to a certain degree resemble the North Atlantic Oscillation based on surface pressure data. There are two distinct teleconnections (one over the eastern and one over the western North Atlantic) during episodes of weak <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> and only one, over the central North Atlantic, during strong <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> episodes. The teleconnections have periods of about two weeks. Stream function tendency analysis of the life cycles shows that the relatively simple resulting teleconnections evolve from very complex structures. During the growth phase of the teleconnection indices there are strong and systematic differences between the two <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> regimes. While in the weak vortex regime the anomaly growth is mainly driven by transient eddy vorticity fluxes from the low-frequency domain, in the strong vortex regime there is also low-frequency advection of relative vorticity resulting from the interaction of low-frequency eddies with stationary eddies.

An opposite pattern is {{observed in the}} tropical mesopause region. The observed upper-mesosphere cooling agrees with a climate model simulation. Analysis of the simulation suggests that enhanced planetary wave (PW) dissipation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high-latitude stratosphere during El Nino strengthens the Brewer-Dobson circulation and cools the equatorial stratosphere. This increases {{the magnitude of the}} SH stratosphere meridional temperature gradient and thus causes the anomalous stratospheric easterly zonal wind and early breakdown of the SH <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> The resulting perturbation to gravity wave (GW) filtering causes anomalous SH mesospheric eastward GW forcing and polar upwelling and cooling. In addition, constructive inference of ENSO and quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) could lead to stronger stratospheric easterly zonal wind anomalies at the SH high latitudes in November and December and early breakdown of the SH <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> during warm ENSO events in the easterly QBO phase (defined by the equatorial zonal wind at similar to 25 hPa).

In the Northern Hemisphere these events are {{often accompanied by}} the descent of anomalous flow regimes which can result in extreme surface weather. The focus of this thesis is to assess sudden stratospheric warmings and {{their place in the}} coupled climate system. Portions of this work are dedicated to algorithm development with the aim of quickly and accurately isolating and subcategorising events. A method is successfully created that is computationally cheap, easy to implement, based on dynamically relevant criteria and has error rates clearly outlined. Impacts on the surface and ocean are assessed with focus on specific subclasses of sudden stratospheric warmings. It is found that there is, on average, stronger surface and oceanic impacts following events that split the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> The ocean system is impacted via modifications to the implied Ekman heat transport and the net atmosphere-surface heat flux. Furthermore, there is a relationship between the initial location of the disturbed <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and the strength of anomalous flow regime at the surface. Analysis is conducted predominantly using general circulation model output, with direct comparison between an atmosphere-only model and a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. For the coupled model there is a {{reduction in the number of}} simulated sudden stratospheric warmings, a result of altered atmospheric wave dynamics. This is partially attributed to a cold bias over the equatorial Pacific. The frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings is found to be insensitive to North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies...|$|R
40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} {{that the state of}} the northern <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>vortex</b> in boreal winter influences tropospheric variability. Therefore, the main teleconnection patterns over the North Atlantic are defined separately for winter episodes in which the zonal mean wind at 50 hPa and 65 &deg; N is above or below the critical Rossby velocity for zonal planetary wave one. It turns out that the teleconnection structure in the middle and upper troposphere differs considerably between the two regimes of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> while {{this is not the case}} at sea level. If the &quot;polar vortex is strong&quot;, there exists &quot;one&quot; meridional dipole structure of geopotential height in the upper and middle troposphere, which is situated in the central North Atlantic. If the &quot;polar vortex is weak&quot;, there exist &quot;two&quot; such dipoles, one over the western and one over the eastern North Atlantic. Storm tracks (and precipitation related with these) are determined by mid and upper tropospheric conditions and we find significant differences of these parameters between the stratospheric regimes. For the strong <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> regime, in case of a negative upper tropospheric &quot;NAO&quot; index we find a blocking height situation over the Northeast Atlantic and the strongest storm track of all.

Excellent meteorological conditions prevailed in the troposphere and stratosphere at Thule. Surface weather was extremely clear {{over most of the}} period, facilitating measurements of the direct light from the moon. The lower <b>stratospheric</b> arctic <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> was located very near Thule throughout the observing period, and temperature at the 30 mbar level were typically below - 80 C above Thule, according to the National Meteorological Center daily analyses. Thus conditions were favorable for <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> cloud formation above Thule. Total column ozone abundances were about 350 to 400 Dobson units, and did not suggest a clear temporal trend over the observing period. Stratospheric nitrogen dioxide measurements were complicated by the presence of a large component of tropospheric pollution on many occasions. Stratospheric nitrogen dioxide could be identified on most days using the absorption in the scattered light from the zenith sky, which greatly enhances the stratospheric airmass while suppressing the tropospheric contribution. These measurements suggest that the total vertical column abundance of nitrogen dioxide present over Thule in February was extremely low, sometimes as low as 3 x 10 to the 14 th per sq cm. The abundance of nitrogen dioxide increased systemically from about 3 x 10 to the 14 th in late January to 1. 0 x 10 to the 15 th per sq cm in mid-February, perhaps because of photolysis of N 2 O 5 in {{the upper part of the}} stratosphere, near 25 to 35 km...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} stratospheric {{variability}} on the dynamical coupling between the stratosphere and the tro-posphere is explored {{in a relatively}} simple atmospheric general circulation model. Variability of the model’s <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> or polar night jet, is induced by topographically forced stationary waves. A robust relationship is found between {{the strength of the}} <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and the latitude of the tropo-spheric jet, confirming and extending earlier results in the absence of stationary waves. In both the clima-tological mean and on intraseasonal time scales, a weaker vortex is associated with an equatorward shift in the tropospheric jet and vice versa. It is found that the mean structure and variability of the vortex in the model is very sensitive to the amplitude of the topography and that Northern Hemisphere–like variability, with a realistic frequency of stratospheric sudden warming events, occurs only for a relatively narrow range of topographic heights. When the model captures sudden warming events with fidelity, however, the exchange of information both upward and downward between the troposphere and stratosphere closely resembles that in observations. The in-fluence of stratospheric variability on variability in the troposphere is demonstrated by comparing integra-tions with and without an active stratosphere. A realistic, time-dependent stratospheric circulation increases the persistence of the tropospheric annular modes, and the dynamical coupling is most apparent prior to and following stratospheric sudden warming events. 1...|$|E
40|$|Predictability {{characteristics}} of the wintertime <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> are examined through the systematic error and the ensemble spread of the predicted north polar temperature by the operational 1 -month ensemble forecast of the Japan Meteorological Agency during 7 winters. It is revealed that in early winter, the systematic error has significantly large positive values due to the underestimation of the equatorward propagation of planetary waves in the stratosphere. The estimated predictable period based on the ensemble spread according to Lorenz (1982) attains a maximum in early winter (more than 30 days) and gradually decreases with the seasonal march...|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{variability}} of the winter- and spring-time <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> {{has been shown}} to affect extratropical tropospheric weather. Therefore, reducing stratospheric forecast error may be one way to improve the skill of tropospheric weather forecasts. In this review, the basis for this idea is examined. A range of studies of different stratospheric extreme vortex events shows that they can be skilfully forecasted beyond five days and into the sub-seasonal range (0 - 30 days) in some cases. Separate studies show that typical errors in forecasting a stratospheric extreme vortex event can alter tropospheric forecasts skill by 5 - 7...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to discuss the altitude dependent interannual variability of ozone inside the southern <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>vortex</b> during spring. Trend of ozone mixing ratio as well as possible correlation to global forcing processes, and transient perturbations by volcanic aerosols are obtained by using balloon-borne ozone sonde data obtained at three Antarctic stations located at about 70 °S between 30 °E and 08 °W. For the period 1966 to 1995 negative trend in ozone mixing ratio is statistically significant with 99 % confidence between the 330 K and 670 K isentropic level. For the period 1985 to 1995 significant negative trends are recognized in three altitude ranges during spring. The interannual variability of ozone in the middle polar stratosphere is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For the period from 1985 to 1988 the pattern of year to year changes might be explained by a synergetic effect of ENSO and Quasi Biennial Oscillation of winds in the tropical stratosphere. Inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> the impact of volcanic aerosols on vertical ozone distribution shows a similar altitude dependency as found for mid-latitudes but downward displaced by about 5 km in altitude. In the lowest part of the polar stratosphere ozone is additionally removed when volcanic aerosol loading is extremely high. The intercomparison of balloon-borne ozone observations from Arctic and Antarctic stations shows significant differences in the recent mean annual pattern but also similarities in the seasonal behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{momentum}} {{budget of}} the Transformed Eulerian-Mean (TEM) equation is calculated using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA- 40) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis 2 (R- 2). This study outlines the considerable contribution of unresolved waves, deduced to be gravity waves, to the forcing of the zonal-mean flow. A trend analysis, from 1980 to 2001, shows that the onset and break down of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) <b>stratospheric</b> <b>polar</b> night jet {{has a tendency to}} occur later in the season in the more recent years. This temporal shift follows long-term changes in planetary wave activity that are mainly due to synoptic waves, with a lag of one month. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> shows a tendency to persist further into the SH summertime. This also follows a statistically significant decrease in the intensity of the stationary EP flux divergence over the 1980 – 2001 period. Ozone depletion is well known for strengthening the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> through the thermal wind balance. However, the results of this work show that the SH <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> does not experience any significant long-term changes until the month of December, even though the intensification of the ozone hole occurs mainly between September and November. This study suggests that the decrease in planetary wave activity in November provides an important feedback to the zonal wind as it delays the breakdown of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> In addition, the absence of strong eddy feedback before November explains the lack of significant trends in the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in the SH early spring. A long-term weakening in the Brewer-Dobson (B-D) circulation in the polar region is identified in the NH winter and early spring and during the SH late spring and is likely driven by the decrease in planetary wave activity previously mentioned. During the rest of the year, there are large discrepancies in the representation of the B-D circulation and the unresolved waves between the two reanalyses, making trend analyses unreliable.

40|$|The {{changes of}} {{atmospheric}} flow patterns related to Arctic Amplification have impacts {{well beyond the}} Arctic regional weather and climate system. Here we examine modulations of vertically propagating planetary waves, a major feature of the climate response to Arctic sea ice reduction by comparing the corresponding results of an atmospheric general circulation model with reanalysis data for periods {{of high and low}} sea ice conditions. Under low sea ice condition we find enhanced coupling between troposphere and stratosphere starting in November with preferred <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>vortex</b> breakdowns in February, which then feeds back to the troposphere. The model experiment and ERA-Interim reanalysis data agree well with respect to temporal and spatial characteristics associated with vertical planetary wave propagation including its precursors. The upward propagating planetary wave anomalies resemble a wave number 1 and 2 pattern depending on region and timing. Since our experimental design only allows influences from sea ice changes and there is a high degree of resemblance between model results and observations, we conclude that sea ice is a main driver of observed winter circulation changes...|$|R
