40|$|Benthic foraminiferal Cd/Ca from a Florida Current {{sediment}} core {{documents the}} history of the northward penetration of southern <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> within the surface return flow of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Cd seawater estimates (CdW) indicate that intermediate-depth southern <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> crossed the equator and contributed to the Florida Current during the Bølling-Allerød warm period of the last deglaciation, consistent with evidence of only a modest AMOC reduction compared to today. The CdW estimates also provide the first paleoceanographic evidence of a reduction in the influence of intermediate-depth southern <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> within the Florida Current during the Younger Dryas, a deglacial cold event characterized by a weak North Atlantic AMOC. Our results reveal a close correspondence between the northward penetration of intermediate-depth southern <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> and the influence of North Atlantic Deep Water, suggesting a possible link between intermediate-depth southern <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> and the strength of the Atlantic AMOC...|$|R
40|$|Disinfection {{by-products}} {{were determined}} in 15 water treatment plants in Beijing City. The effects of different <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> (surface <b>water</b> <b>source,</b> mixture <b>water</b> <b>source</b> and ground <b>water</b> <b>source),</b> seasonal variation and spatial variation were examined. Trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were the major disinfection by-products {{found in all}} treated water samples, which accounted for 42. 6 % and 38. 1 % of all disinfection by-products respectively. Other disinfection by-products including haloacetonitriles, chloral hydrate, haloketones and chloropicrin were usually detected in treated water samples but at lower concentrations. The levels of disinfection by-products in drinking water varied with different <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> and followed the order: surface <b>water</b> <b>source</b> > mixture <b>water</b> <b>source</b> > ground <b>water</b> <b>source.</b> High spatial and seasonal variation of disinfection by-products in the drinking water of Beijing was shown as a result.

40|$|Abstract. The {{safety of}} the <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area is the premise of urban safety and {{the basis for the}} {{sustainable}} urban development and urban-rural coordinated development. The contradiction between <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area protection and the development of towns in the <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area is increasingly prominent, and the restrictions of <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area protection on the towns in the <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area have seriously restricted the development of towns in <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area. Based on deep analysis of the principal contradictions and problems between urban <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area protection and the development of the towns in <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area, the paper has proposed the spatial planning pathways and the relevant public policy suggestions for the coordinated development of urban <b>water</b> <b>source</b> protection and the towns in <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area...|$|R
25|$|Cold brewing {{has some}} {{disadvantages}} compared to hot steeping. Firstly, if the leaves or <b>source</b> <b>water</b> contain unwanted bacteria, they may flourish, whereas using hot water has {{the benefit of}} killing most bacteria. This {{is less of a}} concern in modern times and developed regions. Secondly, cold brewing may allow for less caffeine to be extracted, {{which may or may not}} be desired.|$|E
25|$|Point <b>source</b> <b>water</b> {{pollution}} {{refers to}} contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, {{such as a}} pipe or ditch. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant, a factory, or a city storm drain. The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) defines point source for regulatory enforcement purposes. The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.|$|E
25|$|Contamination of {{drinking}} water supplies can not only occur in the <b>source</b> <b>water</b> {{but also in the}} distribution system. Sources of water contamination include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of water contamination are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.|$|E

25|$|The {{sources of}} the {{municipal}} water supply are various spring fed tanks located around the island. The three island communities supply water within a limited but expanding part of their jurisdictions. Homes outside the municipal water system use wells or cisterns to collect rain water. There are plans to construct an artificial lake {{in the area of}} Panormos to supply water to farmers. Private water wells supply some agricultural needs and water from these wells can be transported by lorry to outlying areas to refill cisterns or swimming pools. The municipal water is good quality. As most natural <b>source</b> <b>water</b> in limestone environments, the water has a high calcium content.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when {{outdoor air}} is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, {{depending}} on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, {{they use the}} ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground <b>source</b> <b>water</b> through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up {{the temperature of the}} ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen atoms easily {{separate}} from electronegative bonds such as hydroxyl bonds (O-H), nitrogen bonds (N-H), and thiol/mercapto bonds (S-H) on hour to day long timescales. This rapid exchange is particularly problematic for measurements of bulk organic material with these functional groups because isotope compositions {{are more likely}} to reflect the <b>source</b> <b>water</b> and not the isotope effect. For this reason, records of paleoclimate that are not measuring ancient waters, rely on other isotopic markers. Advancements in the 1990s held promising potential to resolve this problem: samples were equilibrated with two variations of heavy water and compared. Their ratios represent an exchange factor that can calibrate measurements to correct for hydrogen and deuterium swapping.|$|E
40|$|A {{blending}} {{evaluation is}} a planning tool {{that can be}} particularly helpful when considering introducing new or additional <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> to a water system. A blending evaluation is a systematic approach to addressing the likely water quality impacts of changing <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> and if necessary, potential mitigation approaches. This paper discusses two North American case studies and a blending methodology that could be applied by any water system to plan for and mitigate {{a wide range of}} potential water quality issues...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} develop a simple method for tracking the fate and transport of recycled water following recharge into a shallow brackish aquifer (caprock aquifer) in a coastal area on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Several naturally present chemical constituents including the boron isotopic signature (δ 11 B) were used to characterize each of the caprock aquifer <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> and the recycled water. Because {{of the influence of}} seawater, only δ 11 B could be used to clearly distinguish the recycled <b>water</b> from the <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> and the caprock aquifer water. Estimates of the mixing ratios of <b>source</b> <b>waters</b> in the aquifer were made and a method was developed to determine the fraction of wastewater present in a brackish water sample recovered from a monitoring well during recharge operations without addition of a tracer. This method can be adapted to monitor any other brackish aquifer subjected to wastewater recharge. © 2006 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|The largest use {{of ozone}} {{is in the}} {{preparation}} of pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and many other commercially useful organic compounds, where it is used to sever carbon-carbon bonds. It can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources. Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine. Ozone has a very high oxidation potential. Ozone does not form organochlorine compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen bromate in <b>source</b> <b>water</b> with high bromide concentrations. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual free chlorine in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where electrical power is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.|$|E
25|$|The main {{water source}} for {{terrestrial}} plants is soil water, which largely resembles the hydrogen isotope composition of rain water, but varies between environments and with enrichment by precipitation, depletion by evaporation, and exchange with atmospheric water vapor. There {{can be a}} significant offset between the δD value of <b>source</b> <b>water</b> and the δD value of leaf water {{at the site of}} lipid biosynthesis. No fractionation is associated with water uptake by roots, a process usually driven by capillary tension, with the one exception of xerophytes that burn ATP to pump water in extremely arid environments (with a roughly 10‰ depletion). However, leaf water can be substantially enriched relative to soil water due to transpiration, an evaporative process which is influenced by temperature, humidity, and the composition of surrounding water vapor. The leaf water hydrogen isotope composition can be described with a modified Craig-Gordon model, where ΔDe is the steady state enrichment of leaf water, εeq is the temperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation between liquid water and vapor, εk is the kinetic isotope effect from diffusion between leaf internal air space and the atmosphere, ΔDv is the leaf/air disequilibrium, ea is atmospheric vapor pressure, and ei is internal leaf vapor pressure.|$|E
