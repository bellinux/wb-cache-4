This, however, was just diversionary and the mine was a dummy.

A depth charge run was made which did not <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>killing</b> <b>the</b> submarine although it is suspected that it did <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> neutralizing one of the Kaitens.

25|$|Their {{fundamentally}} different beliefs {{in regards to}} science led the Alterans to hide their level of scientific belief {{so that they would}} not get into a conflict. Eventually, the Ancients decided to build a space ship and leave rather than to use their technology, like the Ark of Truth, to defeat the Ori. Though they had the ability to stop the Ori, they thought it to be philosophically and morally wrong. The film thus addresses the non-interference policy of the Ancients under the Ori threat, and how they act millions of years later, when SG-1 <b>succeeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>killing</b> <b>the</b> Ori.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "ultimately lethal" [...] program {{developed}} by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy. Once it successfully located {{the start of}} an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location. If it <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>killing</b> <b>the</b> enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters. If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance. Any new copies were initialized with a successful value. In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy.|$|R
