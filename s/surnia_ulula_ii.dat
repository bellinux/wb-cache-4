50|$|Ninox is a genus of true owls {{comprising}} about 30 species {{found in}} Asia and Australasia. Many species {{are known as}} hawk owls or boobooks. Note that the northern hawk-owl <b>Surnia</b> <b>ulula</b> is {{not a member of}} this genus. Molecular analysis indicates the genus is an early offshoot from the ancestors {{of the rest of the}} true owls, and are maybe best-classified in a subfamily Ninoxinae with the genera Sceloglaux and Uroglaux. The genus was introduced by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1837.|$|R

In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). [...] This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), {{as well as other}} ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (<b>Surnia</b> <b>ulula)</b> can be sighted in the boreal forests.

40|$|Abstract The {{goal with}} {{this study was}} to {{investigate}} the possibility for bird watching tourism in the northernmost national park in Sweden, Vadvetjåkka and to enhance the knowledge of bird species that occur in the area.   To find out which and how many species of birds that nest in Vadvetjåkka a field study in form of bird inventories and spontaneous bird watching was done in the period 1 - 12 / 7 2014. Line tax was chosen as a method of bird inventory. Together 43 species of birds and 248 individuals of birds were observed. The three most common bird species along the line transects were: brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis). During the spontaneous bird observations 20 bird species and 65 individuals were found and the three most common species there was: redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) and hawk owl (<b>Surnia</b> <b>ulula).</b> International studies on bird tourism indicate that bird watching is a very popular nature activity. In Sweden there is no research on bird tourism, but there is a variety of nature companies that engaged in birdwatching tourism in combination with other nature activities. There are attractive and rare species found in Vadvetjåkka national park, so the potential is there to attract birdwatchers. To promote nature tourism in Vadvetjåkka national park the Swedish government has decided to make it easier for nature companies to engage in commercial activities in Vadvetjåkka. If eco-tourism companies and nature conservation authorities work together to minimize the potential negative influence of tourism on birds and nature bird tourism can contribute to a positive development in the area. ...|$|R
40|$|Owls My {{exercise}} was {{a comparison of}} eleven owl species according to their body size differences between the male and the female. The body size data were reverse sexual dimorphism (male/female) in wing and the cube root of weight in Europen owl species. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify phylogenetic relatonships among owl species in the context of female biased body size using reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD). In the source article body size samples were selected with the following guidelines: that an adequate sample be obtained, where possible, weights from the breeding season were avoided because of the great changes that occur in the weights of females at this time, and where possible, weights and wing measurements were from the same locality or region because RSD in wing and weight appear to vary geographically. These samples were extracted from Cramp (1985). This article provides further information on female dominance in intra-pair interactions. The species listed in descending order of estimated relative female dominance: (1) Eurasian Pygmy-Ow (Glaucidium passerinum) : If the male is next to the nest without food when the young are hungry, the female will drive him away. In small cages, females will kill males. (2) Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) : When food deliveries are insufficient, the female will leave the nest and chase the male for minutes. (3) Northern Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) : No intersexual aggression has been recorded in the wild. But if only one female and male are in a cage, the female will kill the male. (4) Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) : No observations of intrapair aggression in the field, but in captivity the female will show a threat display to her male if he is slow to deliver food. (5) Northern Hawk-Owl (<b>Surnia</b> <b>ulula)</b> : Females react to courting males with aggressive vocalisations and with high intensity threat displays in captivity. (6) Little Owl (Athene noctua) : In small cages, a female strikes strangers of both sexes and will even strike her own male. (7) Eurasian Scops-Owl (Otus scops) : Females will strike strangers of both sexes, males will not attack strange females. Rankings for the female dominance (Mueller 1986) were correlated with RSD in weigh...|$|R
2500|$|Discreet habitat {{preferences}} may coincidentally spare many owls, as owls {{from the}} genera Strix, Glaucidium, Aegolius and the [...] northern hawk-owl (<b>Surnia</b> <b>ulula)</b> tend to restrict both nesting and their hunting forays to more enclosed areas of woodland than habitats inhabited by the eagle-owls. Meanwhile, Asio, Otus, Athene and barn owls owls tend to hunt in more open habitats than the edges favored by eagle-owls. However, habitat preferences are never enough to spare {{any of these}} genera from predation by the great eagle-owl. In the Italian Alps, despite differing habitat preferences and partially overlapping prey, several tawny owls were killed by eagle-owls. Woodland nesting owl species tend to nest in tree hollows, {{many of which are}} too small for an eagle-owl to access, so are somewhat less likely to be picked off at their nests. Open-country owls that tend to nest in open-access nesting sites like short-eared owls and little owls may be somewhat more vulnerable at the nest. The great numbers of long-eared owls taken, since it often nest in dense, protective thickets, are probably adult or immature owls attempting to hunt. In Europe, Eurasian eagle-owls are generally the only owls to regularly nest in rocky habitats. This is not the case in arid desert-like regions, where limited nesting options frequently force diverse owls to use rocky areas as nesting sites. However, the cliffs and other rocky areas preferred by Eurasian eagle-owls are also utilized by several species of diurnal raptor in Eurasia. In Spain, golden eagles, Bonelli's eagles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) most often nest on cliffs. Large scavenging birds such as cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus), bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), Eurasian griffons (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and common ravens also often nests on the same Iberian cliffs. While the two eagles nested at great distances from one another (they are known to be territorial towards each other), the eagle-owl nesting within [...] of the other species. In these cliff nests, the only considerable predatory interaction was the eagle-owls appearing to predate the peregrine falcons. In the Tibetan Plateau, upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius) also seem to favor similar habitats and both the eagle-owl and buzzard take similar prey there. In general, the eagle-owl can nest closer to diurnal raptors because, as a nocturnal animal, it will not actively compete for territories as it would with other members of its own species.|$|R
