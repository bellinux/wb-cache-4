It was not known, however, if these movement proteins are expressed from one or two subgenomic (sg) RNAs. Here we employ RNA ligase-mediated RACE to show that the Beet yellows virus (BYV), a prototype Closterovius, produces separate sgRNAs encoding p 6 and Hsp 70 h. This result is further supported by generation of the recombinant BYV in which the truncated variants of these <b>sgRNAs</b> <b>are</b> resolved by Northern analysis.

In nodaviruses, subgenomic RNA 3 (sgRNA 3) plays a {{critical}} role in viral replication and survival, as it coordinates the replication of two viral genomic RNAs (RNA 1 and RNA 2) and encodes protein B 2, which is a potent RNA-silencing inhibitor. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of nodaviral <b>sgRNA</b> 3 synthesis <b>is</b> still poorly understood. Here, we propose that sgRNA 3 of Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) is internally initiated from a promoter on the negative template of genomic RNA 1. Serial deletion and mutation analyses further revealed that the core promoter of WhNV <b>sgRNA</b> 3 <b>is</b> between nucleotide positions − 22 and + 6 of its transcription start site.

25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different <b>sgRNA</b> can subsequently <b>be</b> transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences.

40|$|Transcription of subgenomic RNAs (<b>sgRNAs)</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} {{strategy}} {{used by many}} positive strand RNA viruses {{of plants and animals}} to regulate viral gene expression. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) produces three nested 32 ̆ 7 -coterminal subgenomic RNAs in infected cells. SgRNA 1 serves as the messenger for the structural and movement proteins. sgRNA 2 encodes a small open reading frame (ORF 6), that appears not to be translated. The role of <b>sgRNA</b> 3 <b>is</b> unknown, as it encodes no ORFs. Neither sgRNA 2 nor <b>sgRNA</b> 3 <b>is</b> needed for BYDV RNA replication in oat protoplasts. However, sgRNA 2 does function as a riboregulator of viral translation in virus-infected protoplasts. This dissertation focuses on the control of synthesis of sgRNA 2, and the biological roles of sgRNAs 2 and 3 in plants.;The first aim is to determinine the primary and secondary structures in BYDV RNA required for synthesis of subgenomic RNA 2. The minimal promoter for <b>sgRNA</b> 2 <b>was</b> previously mapped to a 143 nt region (nt 4810 - 4952) just downstream of its putative transcription start site at nt 4809. This region encompasses the 32 ̆ 7 BYDV cap-independent translation element (BTE, nts 4814 - 4918) that is essential for virus replication. Deletion of the entire 32 ̆ 7 BTE from within a duplicated copy of the sgRNA 2 promoter did not affect sgRNA 2 synthesis from this promoter, confirming the functional independence of the sgRNA 2 promoter from the 32 ̆ 7 BTE. I also found that a small stem-loop containing the conserved hexanucleotide sequence GUGAAG at its 52 ̆ 7 end supports basal levels of sgRNA 2 synthesis. All functional sgRNA 2 promoter constructs retained potential base pairing between sequences flanking the BTE. This reveals that the <b>sgRNA</b> 2 promoter <b>is</b> split by the embedded 32 ̆ 7 BTE and that both the primary and secondary structures <b>are</b> required for <b>sgRNA</b> synthesis. Such an overlapping arrangement of translational and transcriptional control signals has not been observed in other viruses.;The second aim is to examine the roles of sgRNA 2 and sgRNA 3 in whole plant infections. Infectivity of viral RNA containing mutations that knock out synthesis of one or both of these RNAs <b>was</b> tested. All <b>sgRNA</b> knockout mutants infected oat plants and usually showed normal levels of viral RNA accumulation, disease onset, and symptoms. ELISA revealed that coat protein levels in plants infected with the mutants deficient in sgRNA 2 alone, or sgRNA 2 and <b>sgRNA</b> 3 <b>were</b> about double that observed in plants infected with wild-type virus. SgRNA 3 knockout mutant virus gave wild-type levels of coat protein. <b>SgRNA</b> 2 <b>was</b> found to modestly inhibit virion accumulation, while the absence of sgRNA 3 in virus infections had little effect on virus accumulation and disease development in infected oats. These surprising results are the first example of subgenomic RNAs that are apparently dispensible for virus infection. They indicate that sgRNA 2 must play only a minor role as a riboregulator of viral gene expression. However, absence of sgRNAs 2 and/or 3 may reduce virus fitness in subtle ways that were not detected in my experiments...|$|R

However, the efficacy of a specific <b>sgRNA</b> <b>is</b> not uniquely defined by exact sequence homology to the target site, thus unintended off-targets might additionally be cleaved.

We show that the predictions made with CRISTA are more accurate than other available methodologies. We further demonstrate that the occurrence of bulges is not a rare phenomenon and should be accounted for in the prediction process. Beyond predicting cleavage efficiencies, the learning process provides inferences regarding patterns that underlie the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas 9 system.

In this study, we show that neither sgRNA 2 nor <b>sgRNA</b> 3 <b>is</b> required for BYDV RNA replication. The promoters for sgRNA 2 and <b>sgRNA</b> 3 synthesis <b>were</b> mapped by using deletion mutagenesis. The minimal <b>sgRNA</b> 2 promoter <b>is</b> approximately 143 nt long (nt 4810 to 4952) and is located immediately downstream of the putative sgRNA 2 start site (nt 4809). The minimal sgRNA 3 core promoter is 44 nt long (nt 5345 to 5388), with most of the sequence located downstream of sgRNA 3 start site (nt 5348). For both promoters, additional sequences upstream of the start site enhanced sgRNA promoter activity. These promoters contrast to the sgRNA 1 promoter, in which almost all of the promoter is located upstream of the transcription initiation site. Comparison of RNA sequences and computer-predicted secondary structures revealed little or no homology between the three sgRNA promoter elements. Thus, a small RNA virus with multiple sgRNAs can have very different subgenomic promoters, which implie...|$|R
