50|$|The ship left Toulon for her fourteenth {{and final}} sea trial on 24 October 2000. During {{the night of}} 9-10 November, in the Western Atlantic while en route toward Norfolk, Virginia, the port {{propeller}} broke, and the ship {{had to return to}} Toulon to have a replacement fitted. The investigations that followed showed similar structural faults in the other propeller and in the spare propellers: bubbles in the one-piece copper-aluminium alloy propellers near the centre. Although the supplier, Atlantic Industries, was not believed to have intentionally been at fault, it was nevertheless blamed for poor-quality construction. To make matters worse, all documents relating to the design and fabrication of the propellers had been lost in a fire. As a temporary solution, the less advanced <b>spare</b> <b>propellers</b> of Clemenceau and Foch were used, limiting the maximum speed to 24 knots (44 km/h) instead of the contractual 27 knots (50 km/h).|$|R
50|$|This {{department}} {{received and}} issued all supplies except airplanes. It primarily handled aircraft engines, <b>propellers,</b> <b>spare</b> parts of all kinds, the hardware fasteners, mechanics tools, aircraft instruments, aviation clothing, photographic supplies, radio supplies and equipment {{and all kinds}} of oils and gasoline. Due to the wide variety of aircraft flown at the front, a great amount of spare parts were required to be kept in stock. In addition to the requirements of the combat squadrons, the Department {{had to take care of}} the various Departments of the 1st Air Depot.|$|R
50|$|The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat {{monoplane}} which {{retained the}} fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage {{of the earlier}} Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail-skid and the tandem open-cockpit were fitted with dual-controls. Behind the rear seat was a large luggage locker, the top decking at the rear could be removed to carry a <b>spare</b> <b>propeller</b> or skis.|$|E

50|$|Modular {{propellers}} offer boaters {{several advantages}} a fixed-pitch propeller. The {{ability to change}} blades allows boat to make adjustments in pitch for various performance needs or a change in altitude. Carrying spare blades for this purpose takes up considerably less space then carrying a complete <b>spare</b> <b>propeller.</b> The ability to replace blades also offers the advantage of replacing damaged blades while still on the water, and saves long term repair costs. Other options include adjusting pitch for altitude, water sports, cruising, and quick turnover time.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 August 1978, {{complete}} with a <b>spare</b> <b>propeller</b> and shaft, she left the Clyde for the Adriatic. In 1979, as Noce di Cocco ("Coconut"), she entered service between Trieste and Muggia, operated by Navigazione Alto Adriatico, but still in Caledonian MacBrayne livery. She spent {{less than a year}} on this run, before moving to the Bay of Naples, as Capri Express. At first she cruised between Capri and Positano, later as a car ferry between Naples and Sorrento and from 2000, between Pozzuoli and Procida, in the company of her old sister Ala (ex [...] ). Withdrawn in 2006, she was towed to Aliağa for scrapping and beached in March.|$|E
50|$|The circuit over Europe {{appeared}} to be quite difficult for aircraft and pilots. Only 36 crews out of 60 finished in time. Further 6 crews completed the circuit in spite of being disqualified due to time infringement or propeller repairs, in case of not carrying a <b>spare</b> <b>propeller.</b> Among those, who dropped out, were 9 German crews (3 of them completed the circuit), 8 Polish (3 completed the circuit), 4 French, 2 Spanish and 1 British (completed the circuit). After the rally, {{a leader in the}} general classification was Hubert Broad (DH-60G, 270 points), behind him: John Carberry (Monocoupe, 268 pts), Reinhold Poss (Klemm L.25E, 264 pts), fourth was Fritz Morzik (BFW M.23c, 263 pts). The fastest German pilot was Dietrich von Massenbach (151 km/h), but he lost 10 points for regularity.|$|E

50|$|The {{first was}} a trial of quick wings' folding, which was a feature to save place in hangars. The quickest were the crews flying DH-60s (Hubert Broad's crew folded and {{unfolded}} wings in mere 48 sec), awarded with 19 points. Crews of the German BFW M.23c scored 17-18 pts, of the Klemm L.25E - 16-17 (F. Morzik - 18 pts, O. Notz and W. Polte - 17 pts, R. Poss - 16 pts).John Carberry's Monocoupe, the Polish RWD's and the Avro Avian lost a number of points, not having folding or dismounting wings at all.The next was quick engine starting test, in which equipping with a starter was extra awarded. The best Klemm L.25Ia of Theo Osterkamp, with Salmson AD.9 engine, earned 11 points. The British aircraft were handicapped by lack of starters, and the best crews - Miss Spooner and Lady Bailey, got 6 points, while H. Broad got 4 points. On the other hand, F. Morzik and R. Poss got only 7 points. On August 3 there was a fuel consumption trial on a 304 km distance. The best in fuel consumption were light RWD-2s, then German Klemms and BFWs, but 17 aircraft scored maximum of 30 pts and point differences between most of other aircraft were not big. The German Walter Spengler (Klemm L.25) was disqualified for not carrying his <b>spare</b> <b>propeller</b> aboard during this trial. Hubert Broad was still the leader, but F. Morzik was only one point behind.|$|E
40|$|Enlarging {{the power}} {{capacity}} of a propulsion plant could also be performed by improving the overall efficiency of the propulsor. Many devices and measures are know, which enhance the propulsive efficiency. However, even the most optimum combination of devices would not reveal an efficiency gain in excess of 10 - 15 % based on an optimum ship design. Consequently the installed power has to be raised. Different concepts will be described in the following. Regardless of the propulsion system in use, {{the availability of the}} ship on her targeted service depends on the reliability of the components of the main drive. The most endangered component is the propeller. Therefore a solution has been developed in order to enhance the reliability of welded propellers and to extend the scope of repairable b lade damages in order to avoid long term restrictions until a <b>spare</b> <b>propeller</b> is available...|$|E
40|$|The safe {{operation}} of transportation vehicles such as ships and ferries requires {{inspection of the}} highly stressed parts and components. The same holds for other safety relevant constructions such as pipelines where emphasis is on quality assurance prior to the final installation. Failure of such components can lead to serious environmental {{as well as economic}} damage. In this contribution we concentrate on ultrasonic inspection and evaluation of welds in such large components. The most endangered part of ships is the propeller. Therefore a solution has been developed in order to enhance the reliability of welded propellers and to extend the scope of repairable blade damages in order to avoid long term restrictions until a <b>spare</b> <b>propeller</b> is available. The Synthetic Aperture Focusing Techni que (SAFT) has been modified to cope with the curved surfaces and the sound attenuation of cast Ni-Al bronzes. Using mechanized scanning ultrasonic evaluation has been optimized in view of the least detectable defect sizes. For weld inspection in steels the Time-of-Flight Diffraction technique (TOFD) can provide additional information for specific defect orientations. We have therefore combined both techniques in view of the determination of defect sizes and shapes in longitudinal welds of pipes with diameters of up to 48 inches. We present details on the inspection and evaluation concepts as well as experimental results obtained on test specimens during the validation process. For on-site inspection in dry-dock or at the manufacturing sites, mobile equipment has been design and build-up; respective inspection actions and results will be presented as well...|$|E
