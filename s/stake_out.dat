5000|$|Unlike croquet, both balls must be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> in {{the same}} turn in order to {{outright}} win the game. By necessity, this requires the first ball to be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> on a roquet shot and the second ball to be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> on the ensuing continuation shot. Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively [...] "stake-out" [...] an opponent's rover in roque.|$|R

5|$|The scenes at {{the marina}} where Dexter keeps his boat, Coral Cove, were filmed at the Leeward Bay Marina in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, {{in spite of}} the show's Miami setting. The episode opens in a coffee bar at Coral Cove Marina, which was filmed at Leeward Bay's {{floating}} diner, the Chowder Barge. One of the empty barns at Long Beach, California's Shoreline Village was set up as the comic book store. Doakes and LaGuerta discuss the homicide case while standing on the Shoreline Village boardwalk, and the Village car park was used to film Doakes and LaGuerta's <b>stake</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|As they <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> {{their territories}} and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E
5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not until}} the next day that the party {{returned}} to the creek and began to look up the Eclipse Mine once more. The landslide had cut across this, and it was not long before both Wumble and Slim Jim declared the ground to be full of good paying [...] "dirt," [...] to use their own term. The claim was <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> to the boys' satisfaction, and then Wumble <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> a claim just above Discovery, as it is called in mining laws, while Slim Jim <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> one for himself just below Discovery. All three claims ran to both sides of the creek, so that no one would suffer for water when mining operations should begin.|$|R

At the Bada Bing, Silvio and Paulie learn of the mistake when Murmur shows them a newspaper article on the murders. At Nuovo Vesuvio. Tony tells Carmela that he has quit therapy. The two put on a good face as they talk with Artie and Charmaine about their children.|$|E
25|$|Employers also {{organized}} {{during the}} building trades strike of 1900 and the (San Francisco) City Front Federation strike of 1901, {{which led to}} the founding of the Building Trades Council. The open shop question was at <b>stake.</b> <b>Out</b> of the City Front strike came the Union Labor Party, because workers were angry at the mayor for using the police to protect strikebreakers. Eugene Schmitz was elected mayor in 1902 on the party's ticket, making San Francisco the only town in the United States, for a time, to be run by labor. A combination of corruption and unscrupulous reformers culminated in graft prosecutions in 1907.|$|E
25|$|Ushikawa {{focuses on}} Tengo, Aomame, and the Dowager as {{suspects}} in his investigation. Since the Dowager's house is guarded well and since Aomame has disappeared without a trace, Ushikawa decides to <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> Tengo's apartment {{to see if}} he can find any information related to Aomame. He rents out a room in Tengo's apartment building and sets up a camera to take pictures of the residents. He witnesses Fuka-Eri, who has been hiding out at Tengo's apartment, coming and going from the building. Fuka-Eri seems to realize Ushikawa's presence, as she leaves a note for Tengo and takes off. Ushikawa later sees Tengo return home after a visit to see his dying father. Finally, Ushikawa spots Aomame leaving the building after she herself followed Ushikawa there in order to find Tengo.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographic}} Broken Hill, {{for which}} the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch) formed the Broken Hill Company to <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at {{the eve of the}} Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.|$|E
25|$|Following a lead, FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd), and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> two banks {{which are}} {{possibly}} the Charm School Boys' next target. The agents' lead comes from their math consultant and Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), who used probability theory and statistical analysis {{to predict the}} targets. The Charm School Boys, a pair of nonviolent and polite bank robbers, rob the bank which Terry and David have under surveillance. Terry and David's team attempt to arrest the pair, but Terry and David, and later Don, {{find themselves in the}} middle of a shootout with the bank robbers and a couple of the robbers' accomplices. After the firefight dies down, Don and Terry follow the ringleader into a nearby building. The bank robber overpowers Don, shoots Don with Don's own gun, and flees the scene with the gun. Charlie arrives at the scene and finds Don being treated for a minor gunshot wound to his arm.|$|E

Christopher waits inside Haydu's home and ambushes him as he returns from his party. Haydu vehemently denies murdering Christopher's father, but struggles to get away, yelling [...] "I'm sorry!" [...] when Christopher goes to shoot him.|$|E
60|$|Wodley {{had heard}} again from Tom Roland and Guardley. He said the gang, as he termed it, {{which they had}} joined had gone up Hunker Creek and <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> three claims somewhere above Discovery, as the first claim on a creek or gulch is called. The claims had {{overlapped}} some already <b>staked</b> <b>out,</b> and the miners in that section had had several fights and had threatened to drive out all the newcomers {{if they did not}} do what was right.|$|R

500|$|The {{territorial}} males, about 84% of the total, have strongly coloured {{black or}} chestnut ruffs and <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> and occupy small mating territories in the lek. They actively court females and display {{a high degree}} of aggression towards other resident males; 5–20 territorial males each hold an area of the lek about [...] across, usually with bare soil in the centre. They perform an elaborate display that includes wing fluttering, jumping, standing upright, crouching with ruff erect, or lunging at rivals. They are typically silent even when displaying, although a soft gue-gue-gue may occasionally be given.|$|E

[...] The Shadow Man (Terry O'Quinn), who appears to be the husband's boss, monitors Scully through surveillance.|$|E
500|$|The less {{fortunate}} or less well funded prospectors rapidly found themselves destitute. Some chose {{to sell their}} equipment and return south. Others took jobs as manual workers, either in mines or in Dawson; the typical daily pay of $15 ($410) was high by external standards, but low compared {{to the cost of}} living in the Klondike. The possibility that a new creek might suddenly produce gold, however, continued to tempt poorer prospectors. Smaller stampedes around the Klondike continued throughout the gold rush, when rumours [...] of new strikes would cause a small mob to descend on fresh sites, hoping to be able to <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> a high value claim.|$|E
