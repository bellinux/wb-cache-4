40|$|International audienceMerrifield and Wang resins were {{successfully}} converted to supported vinyl-functionalized solid supports with excellent yields by reacting the Cl or OH functionality with an α,ω-difunctional <b>spacer</b> <b>bearing</b> a carboxylic acid group and a terminal alkene. The ruthenium initiator (PCy 3) 2 Cl 2 Ru = CHPh (Grubbs I catalyst) was then immobilized on the resins via cross metathesis (alkylidene exchange) {{and was used}} to initiate ROMP of norbornene. Number-average molecular weight and polydispersity index of the grafted polymers were determined after cleavage of the ester link between the resin and the spacer. The results showed a competition between ROMP and intramolecular “ring-closing” metathesis and/or intermolecular “cross” metathesis, which leads to an overestimated ruthenium initiator loading...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear fuel {{assembly}} consists of {{large number of}} components. In a typical 500 MWe Pressurised Heavy Water (PHWR) {{fuel assembly}} consists of 1655 components in form of pellets, tubes, <b>spacer</b> pads, <b>bearing</b> pads, endcaps and endplates. As nuclear fuel has to perform under severe operating conditions, customers insist for 100 % inspection of all these components. Human based visual inspection for such large components is monotonous and expensive. In order to overcome these inherent drawbacks, vision systems were planned and developed indigenously for various visual inspection operations. The paper brings out details of various vision systems used for inspection of pellets, tubes, <b>bearing</b> pads, <b>spacer</b> pads and endcap weld evaluation. Nuclear Fuel Complex, Hyderabad, a constituent of Department of Atomic energy is sole manufacturer of nuclear fuel in the country. A typical 500 MWe Pressurised Heavy Water (PHWR) fuel consists of UO 2 pellets and various zirconium alloy components viz. tubes, <b>spacer</b> pads, <b>bearing</b> pads, endcaps and endplates.

50|$|Longboard {{bearings}} are {{all about}} reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt. Bearings connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including steel (which is most prevalent), titanium, or ceramics. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the ABEC scale. The ratings run from 1-9, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability. Optionally, longboarders add <b>bearing</b> <b>spacers</b> between the <b>bearings</b> in the wheels. This allows for the axle nut to be tightened {{all the way down}} eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.|$|R
50|$|Two {{bearings}} {{are used}} per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into {{each side of}} the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle <b>spacer</b> the <b>bearings</b> will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.|$|R

A new copolymer, poly[(4, 40 -dioctyldithieno[3, 2 - b: 20, 30 -d]silole- 2, 6 -diyl) -alt-{ 4, 7 -bis[2 -(3 -hexyl) thienyl]- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole- 5, 50 -diyl}] (PDTSDTBT) {{was designed by}} introducing a thiophene <b>spacer</b> <b>bearing</b> a hexyl chain at bposition in the main backbone and compared to its analog poly[(4, 40 -dioctyldithieno[3, 2 - b: 20, 30 -d]silole- 2, 6 -diyl) -alt-(2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole- 4, 7 -diyl) ] (PDTSBT). In PDTSDTBT, linear alkyl chains on silicon were chosen due to facile and cheap access and the inserted 3 -hexylthiophene units were chosen to increase solubility and molar mass, a weak point with PDTSBT. The two parameters are important to optimize photovoltaic performances. To compare characteristics, PDTSDTBT of molar masses greater than, and equal {{to a sample of}} PDTSBT, were prepared [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} {{preparation}} of cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives that {{are suitable for}} bonding on solid surfaces such as dopamine polymer and gold. The nucleophilic attack of 6 I -O-p-toluenesulfonyl--CD (6 -tosyl-β-CD) by dithiols created derivatives with substituents bound to CD skeleton {{by one of the}} sulphur atom while keeping a free terminal sulphanyl group. Despite initial problems caused by oxidation of the thiols to disulfides, CDs were modified by alkyl or oligoethylene glycol spacers prepared in 60 - 88 % yields. The same reaction was used for preparation of derivatives of β-CD with amino group {{at the end of the}} tether that was linked to CD by nitrogen atom. For these purposes were used corresponding diamines and reactions proceeded smoothly reaching up to 92 % isolated yield. Next, also the chemoselectivity of the reaction with an ambident <b>spacer</b> <b>bearing</b> both amino and sulphanyl functional group was studied and by 2 D NMR experiments was proved that substituent was bound to CD through sulphur atom. It was demonstrated on the case of preparation of CD derivative with dimethylene linker that was prepared in 84 % yield. A complete set of yet other CD-oligoethylene glycol derivatives with spacers linked to CD skeleton through the sulphur atom and terminated by amino group was prepared by [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} receptor {{consisting of}} a <b>spacer</b> <b>bearing</b> two cofacially disposed terpyridyl–palladium–ligand (terpy-Pd-L) units rigidly separated by about 7 Å has been investigated for molecular recognition of planar aromatic molecules. It is found that although the receptor forms stable 1 : 2 host–guest association complexes with 9 -methylanthracene (9 -MA), the guest undergoes very rapid site exchange within the receptor and with external free 9 -MA. A crystal structure of the 2 : 1 adduct shows one 9 -MA in the molecular cleft defined by the two terpy-Pd-L units and the other resides on an outside face of one terpy-Pd-L unit. To establish the site residency time of the guests, a number of tethered molecules were prepared. These involve an anthracene molecule tethered to a pyridine ligand bound to the palladium atoms to form intramolecular host–guest adducts. Rotating-frame Overhauser effects were used to infer the site residency of the anthracene guests in the receptor. Variable-temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy of the intramolecular host–guest complexes has revealed that the site residency time of the anthracene guests is 1. 6 × 10 − 5 sec at 20 °C and 1. 3 sec at − 90 °C in acetone solution. Whereas the guests are thermodynamically stable, they are kinetically very labile. A crystal structure {{of one of the}} tethered host–guest adducts reveals the expected structure which is the same as that determined in solution by 1 H rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments...|$|E

A block consists of a grooved wheel, known as a sheave (pronounced [...] "shiv"), steel side plates, <b>spacers,</b> shaft, flange <b>bearings,</b> mounting angles and clips, etc. Blocks are sized based on anticipated live loads, operating speeds, line type and other factors. Sheaves were traditionally fabricated of cast iron, but steel and nylon sheaves are now common.|$|R

The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust <b>bearings</b> between the <b>spacer</b> rings and <b>bearing</b> ring permit free rotation of the bearing ring while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{push-pull}} chromophores built around thiophene-based π-conjugating <b>spacers</b> and <b>bearing</b> {{various types of}} amino-donors and cyanovinyl-acceptors have been analysed by means of UV-Vis-NIR, IR and Raman spectroscopic measurements in the solid state {{as well as in}} solution. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of these π-conjugated systems has also been tested by analysing the ability of the solute molecules in undergoing shifts in their fluorescence emission maxima with increasing solvent polarity. These push-pull oligomers also display an attractive electrochemical behaviour since they generate stable species both upon oxidation and reduction. Oxidation mainly involves changes in the electron-rich aminooligothienyl half-part of the molecule and leads to the formation of stable cations. On the other hand, reduction to radical anions and dianions is mainly cyanovinyl-centered but also affects the π-conjugated electron-relay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to help the assignment of the most relevant electronic and vibrational features and to derive useful information about the molecular structure of these NLO-phores.

40|$|Six novel gemini {{cationic}} lipids {{based on}} aromatic backbone, bearing n-C 14 H 29 or n-C 16 H 33 hydrocarbon chains, differing in {{the length of}} oxyethylene type spacers −CH 2 -(CH 2 -O-CH 2) m-CH 2 − between each ammonium headgroups have been synthesized, where m varies from 1 to 3. Each of these lipids formed stable suspensions in aqueous media. Cationic liposomes were prepared from each of these lipids individually and as mixtures of each cationic lipid and DOPE. These were used as nonviral gene delivery agents. Transfection studies showed that among lipids bearing n-C 14 H 29 chains, the transfection efficacies decreased {{with the increase in}} the length of the spacer, whereas in case of lipids bearing n-C 16 H 33 chains, the transfection efficacies increased with the increase in the length of the <b>spacer.</b> Lipid <b>bearing</b> n-C 16 H 33 hydrocarbon chains with a [−(CH 2 -CH 2 -O-CH 2 -CH 2 -O-CH 2 -CH 2 -O-CH 2 -CH 2) −] spacer was found to be a potent gene transfer agent and its transfection was highly serum compatible even in the presence of 50 % serum conditions...|$|R
40|$|Photosystem II core complex (PSII CC) absorbs {{light energy}} and {{triggers}} {{a series of}} electron transfer reactions by oxidizing water while producing molecular oxygen. Synthetic lipids with different alkyl chains and <b>spacer</b> lengths <b>bearing</b> functionalized headgroups were specifically designed to bind the Q(B) site and to anchor this large photosynthetic complex (240 kDa) in order to attempt two-dimensional crystallization. Among the series of different compounds that have been tested, oxygen evolution measurements have shown that dichlorophenyl urea (DCPU) binds very efficiently to the Q(B) site of PSII CC, and therefore, that moiety has been linked covalently to the headgroup of synthetic lipids. The analysis of the monolayer behavior of these DCPU-lipids has allowed us to select ones <b>bearing</b> long <b>spacers</b> for the anchoring of PSII CC. Oxygen evolution measurements demonstrated that these long-spacer DCPU-lipids specifically bind to PSII CC and inhibit electron transfer. With the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), {{it was possible to}} visualize domains of PSII CC bound to DCPU-lipid monolayers. SNOM imaging has enabled us to confirm that domains observed by AFM were composed of PSII CC. Indeed, the SNOM topography images presented similar domains as those observed by AFM, but in addition, it allowed us to determine that these domains are fluorescent. Electron microscopy of these domains, however, has shown that the bound PSII CC was not crystalline...|$|R
40|$|Derivatization of biologically active {{peptides}} by conjugation with fluorophores or radionuclide-bearing moieties is {{an effective}} and commonly used approach to prepare molecular tools and diagnostic agents. Whereas lysine, cysteine and N-terminal amino acids have been mostly used for peptide conjugation, we describe a new, widely applicable approach to peptide conjugation based on the nonclassical bioisosteric replacement of the guanidine group in arginine by a functionalized carbamoylguanidine moiety. Four argininecontaining peptide receptor ligands (angiotensin II, neurotensin(8 - 13), an analog of the C-terminal pentapeptide of neuropeptide Y, and a neuropeptide FF analog) were subject of this proof-of-concept study. The Nω-carbamoylated arginines, <b>bearing</b> <b>spacers</b> with a terminal amino group, were incorporated into the peptides by standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. The synthesized chemically stable peptide derivatives showed high receptor affinities with Ki values in the low nanomolar range, even when bulky fluorophores had been attached.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hepatitis}} B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) {{that can be}} used as carrier of immunogenic peptides for the development of bivalent vaccine candidates. It is shown here that by respecting certain qualitative features of mammalian preS 1 and preS 2 protein domains upstream of HBsAg, foreign sequences can be inserted in their place while maintaining efficient secretion of VLPs. A polyepitope bearing HIV- 1 epitopes restricted to the HLA-A* 0201 class I allele was optimised for secretion as an HBsAg fusion protein by counterbalancing the generally hydrophobic class I epitopes with hydrophilic <b>spacers,</b> eliminating epitopes <b>bearing</b> cysteine residues, limiting the number of internal methionine residues to a minimum and adopting Homo sapiens codon usage. The optimised HIV- 1 polyepitope-HBsAg recombinant protein with up to 138 residues assembled into efficiently secreted recombinant VLPs. DNA immunisation in HLA-A* 0201 and HLA-A* 0201 /HLA-DR 1 transgenic mice resulted in the recovery of humoral response against the carrier and enhanced levels of HIV- 1 specific CD 8 (+) T lymphocyte activation.
