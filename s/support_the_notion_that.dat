The title of this section was meant to emphasize this, namely that plasticity and learning provide two perspectives—functional and structural—at the same phenomenon, a brain that changes over time.|$|E

25|$|Sulfur and {{chlorine}} may {{be derived}} from the crust, evaporites such as these found at Salar de Atacama, subducted lithosphere or the mantle.

25|$|Large {{and swift}} mammals are stalked and shot with bow and arrow. Smaller and {{burrowing}} mammals are usually captured by hand. Because Aché hunting {{has been extensively}} studied using focal follow and other systematic methods, the encounter rates with prey, the time required for a successful pursuit, and the expected energy gains from prey types, are all well known. This has allowed for numerous tests of specific decision models from Optimal Foraging Theory to be tested using Aché data. Results generally <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Aché hunters pursue only those prey types that would increase their energy return rates, and pass by some species (many small birds, rodents, reptiles, etc.) that would probably lower overall foraging returns if pursued.|$|E

Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as caesaropapism. On the other side was the Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the Pope claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such {{as was the case with}} Henry VIII of England and Henry III of Navarre.|$|E
25|$|The city of Ayodhya is a holy {{site for}} Hindus, who know {{it as the}} birthplace of the god-king Rama. Following the Mughal conquest of the region in 1528, a mosque was built in Ayodhya by the Mughal general Mir Baqi, who named it the Babri Masjid after the Mughal emperor Babur. According to hearsay, Baqi {{destroyed}} a pre-existing temple of Rama at the site. Limited historical evidence exists to support this theory, and the existence of the temple itself is a matter of controversy. Numerous historians have stated that there is limited evidence to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Rama was born at the precise location of the Babri Masjid, as well as that a temple to Rama once stood at the site. Additionally, the location of Ayodhya itself is a matter of dispute, since the city has shifted slightly over the millennia.|$|E

500|$|The {{choice of}} Kent and Æthelberht was almost {{certainly}} dictated {{by a number of}} factors, including that Æthelberht had allowed his Christian wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established,and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom. [...] Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium, or overlordship, south of the River Humber. Lastly, the proximity of Kent to the Franks allowed for support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish Church and not merely as a spiritual adviser to the queen. Archaeological remains <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> there were cultural influences from Francia in England at that time.|$|E
