60|$|The rise {{of geology}} had been rapid and brilliant. In {{the last century}} it had been almost universally {{believed}} that fossil organisms were the relics of submerged and destroyed worlds, strange remnants of successive terrible mundane catastrophes. Cuvier himself, who had rendered immense services to geological science by his almost unerring reconstructions of extinct animals, remained a partisan of the old theory of constant cataclysms and fresh creations throughout his whole life; but Lamarck, here as elsewhere the prophet of the modern uniformitarian concept of nature, had already announced his grand idea that the ordinary process of natural laws sufficed to account for all the phenomena of the earth's crust. In England, William Smith, the ingenious land surveyor, riding {{up and down on}} his daily task over the face of the country, became convinced by his observations {{in the first years of}} the present century that a fixed order of sequence could everywhere be traced among the various superincumbent geological strata. Modern scientific geology takes its rise from the moment of this luminous and luminiferous discovery. With astonishing rapidity the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> was everywhere noted, and the succession of characteristic fossils mapped out, with the result of showing, however imperfectly at first, that the history of organic life upon the globe had followed a slow and regular course of constant development. Immediately whole schools of eager workers employed themselves in investigating in separate detail the phenomena of these successive stages of unfolding life. Murchison, fresh from the Peninsular campaign, began to study the dawn of organic history in the gloom of the Silurian and Cambrian epochs. A group of less articulate but not less active workers like Buckland and Mantell performed similar services for the carboniferous, the wealden, and the tertiary deposits. Sedgwick endeavoured to co-ordinate the whole range of then known facts into a single wide and comprehensive survey. De La Beche, Phillips, and Agassiz added their share to the great work of reconstruction. Last of all, among those who were contemporary and all but coeval with Charles Darwin himself, Lyell boldly fought out the battle of 'uniformitarianism,' proving, with all the accumulated weight of his encyclop√¶dic and world-wide knowledge, that every known feature of geological development could be traced to the agency of causes now in action, and illustrated by means of slow secular changes still actually taking place on earth before our very eyes.|$|E

50|$|An {{intrusive}} dike is an {{igneous body}} with a very high aspect ratio, which means that its thickness is usually {{much smaller than the}} other two dimensions. Thickness can vary from sub-centimeter scale to many meters, and the lateral dimensions can extend over many kilometres. A dike is an intrusion into an opening cross-cutting fissure, shouldering aside other pre-existing layers or bodies of rock; this implies that a dike is always younger than the rocks that contain it. Dikes are usually high-angle to near-vertical in orientation, but subsequent tectonic deformation may rotate the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> through which the dike propagates so that the dike becomes horizontal. Near-horizontal, or conformable intrusions, along bedding planes between strata are called intrusive sills.|$|E

40|$|The Terror Rift is the {{youngest}} part of the West Antarctic rift system in the Antarctic interior. The Terror rift basin lies beneath the western Ross Sea near the Transantarctic Mountains. The rift has undergone multiple episodes of rifting, as evidenced by superimposed tilts of basin strata in fault blocks that define the rift. A younger tilt pattern has been superimposed on the rift around Ross Island, where the crust has flexed downward {{under the weight of}} young volcanoes. Mapping tilt directions provides a means to reconstruct the orientation of faults that produced tilt, and discriminate fault-induced tilt from younger flexure. This study is using seismic reflection profiles, imaging subsurface structure, to reconstruct tilts. Where two seismic lines cross, the true direction of tilt and the magnitude of tilt can be measured at multiple levels downward through the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata,</b> such that changes in attitudes of bedding with depth can be determined. Maps of tilt directions from multiple crossing profiles for the time period marked by each seismic reflector will allow us to infer the orientations of these surfaces in 3 D space.

40|$|Tectonically {{undisturbed}} {{sedimentary rocks}} deposited in a quiescent shallow marine environment often include a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> that may present significant lithological variety at {{the scale of}} an engineering structure. Such rock masses exhibit engineering properties that are significantly different from tectonically disturbed rock masses of similar composition. For example, molasse consists {{of a series of}} tectonically undisturbed sediments of sandstones, conglomerates, siltstones and marts, produced by the erosion of mountain ranges after the final phase of an orogeny. They behave quite differently from flysch which has the same composition but which was tectonically disturbed during the orogeny. The molasses behave as continuous rock masses when they are confined at depth and the bedding planes do not appear as clearly defined discontinuity surfaces. Close to the surface the layering of the formations is discernible and only then similarities may exist with the structure of some types of flysch. Therefore extreme care is necessary in the use of geotechnical classification systems for the selection of design parameters, in order to avoid penalizing the rock mass unnecessarily. A discussion {{on the use of the}} geological strength index (GSI) for the characterisation of such rock masses is presented. Two GSI charts are proposed for estimating the mechanical properties of these masses: one mainly for tunnels; and the second for surface excavations. An example is given to illustrate the process of tunnel design in molassic rocks. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identifies}} the relative magnitude of horizontal stress change below {{a series of}} parallel longwall panels {{as a consequence of}} multi-seam mining. The investigation method yields an upper bound to the horizontal stress change by assuming that the fractured and caved overburden above the supercritical longwall panels is not able to support any lateral load. Finite element modelling was conducted to consider the effects of the following variables on the horizontal stress redistribution: the ratio of the equivalent width of the extracted area to the overburden depth, the ratio of the original horizontal to vertical in situ stress components, and anisotropy in the rock mass behaviour. The key findings of this research are that the maximum horizontal stress induced as a consequence of extracting multiple supercritical longwall panels will be within approximately 10 % of the original in situ horizontal stress for the case of isotropic rock strata. The magnitude of this horizontal stress may be larger in a stiff stratum if the overall <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> consists predominantly of softer rocks. Anisotropy in the strata underlying the extracted longwall panels also causes an increase in the maximum horizontal stress induced into the immediate floor of the first extracted seam, and an increase in the rate of dissipation of horizontal stress change with depth. These findings indicate that a significant increase in horizontal stress relative to the original in situ horizontal stress should not be expected in multi-seam mining situations. The results from this study need to be considered in conjunction with predicted vertical stress distributions in order to accurately predict the overall stress environment likely to be encountered when conducting multi-seam mining...|$|E
