As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to determine how to behave.|$|E

The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the energy market in the north-east. The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957.

Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit.

Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E

However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
