50|$|Advantages include: They do not rot like timber <b>sleepers,</b> {{extra weight}} makes track more stable (particularly {{with changes in}} temperature), they can {{withstand}} fire hazards better than wooden <b>sleepers,</b> they give more retentivity to the track, they have a longer life than wooden <b>sleepers,</b> and they need less maintenance, resulting in lower ongoing costs and fewer track closures. Additionally, concrete <b>sleepers</b> are not soaked in creosote like most wooden <b>sleepers</b> (used mainly in Europe), therefore they are environmentally friendlier.|$|R
40|$|Homeostatic sleep {{regulation}} in habitual short <b>sleepers</b> (sleep episode 9 h, n = 7) was investigated by studying their sleep structure and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) during baseline conditions and after prolonging their habitual waking time by 24 h. In each sleep episode, total sleep time was > 3 h {{longer in the}} long <b>sleepers</b> than in the short <b>sleepers.</b> Sleep deprivation decreased sleep latency and rapid eye movement (REM) density in REM sleep more in long <b>sleepers</b> than in short <b>sleepers.</b> The enhancement of EEG slow-wave activity (SWA; spectral power density in the 0. 75 - 4. 5 Hz range) in non-REM sleep after sleep loss was larger in long <b>sleepers</b> (47 %) than in short <b>sleepers</b> (19 %). This difference in the SWA response was predicted by the two-process model of sleep regulation {{on the basis of}} the different sleep durations. The results indicate that short <b>sleepers</b> live under a higher "non-REM sleep pressure" than long <b>sleepers.</b> However, the two groups do not differ with respect to the homeostatic sleep regulatory mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese <b>sleeper</b> ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese <b>sleeper</b> ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless <b>sleeper</b> ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc.

40|$|The {{complaint}} of insomnia in older adults {{is associated with}} the use of hypnotics. This study was aimed at exploring possible differences between self-categorised good <b>sleepers</b> and poor <b>sleepers</b> on a range of variables, and the factors {{associated with the use of}} hypnotic medication amongst the elderly. Participants in the current study were aged 60 to 98 years old. A total of 74 (28 males, 46 females) older adult hostel residents participated in the current study. Twenty-two participants were self-reported good <b>sleepers,</b> and 52 participants were self reported poor <b>sleepers,</b> with 21 using benzodiazepine hypnotic medication regularly and 31 not using hypnotics. The measures used included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Sleep Beliefs Questionnaire (SBQ), and World Health Organisation Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQoL). The findings demonstrated that self-categorised good <b>sleepers</b> had significantly better sleep quality and habitual sleep efficiency, and significantly shorter sleep latency, regardless of hypnotic use. It was also found that good <b>sleepers</b> and poor <b>sleepers</b> taking benzodiazepines had significantly longer sleep duration than poor <b>sleepers</b> not taking benzodiazepine hypnotics. The prediction that self-classified good <b>sleepers</b> would have lower depressed mood than their self-classified poor sleeping counterparts, whether they were taking benzodiazepine hypnotics or not, was supported. The findings suggested that while self-classified good <b>sleepers</b> had lower anxiety levels than poor <b>sleepers</b> using hypnotic agents, these poor <b>sleepers</b> had significantly lower anxiety levels when compared to their counterparts not using benzodiazepines. Further variables of difference between good and poor <b>sleepers</b> included the psychological and social relationships domains of quality of life. Interestingly, the results indicated that the main role benzodiazepine hypnotic agents have for poor <b>sleepers</b> appears to be longer sleep duration. Benzodiazepine use did not have a significant ameliorative effect on any of the other sleep variables measured in the current sample of hostel dwelling, older adults. The findings indicated that sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency demonstrated good predictive validity for whether subjective poor <b>sleepers</b> take benzodiazepine hypnotics. It was concluded that an alternative to managing poor sleep needs to be education programs, such as education delivered by nurses or evidence based self-help programs (eg. Morawetz, 2003...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} ways in which the lives of rough <b>sleepers</b> are understood. In doing so, it considers {{the ways in}} which rough <b>sleepers</b> are positioned by services, {{the ways in which}} rough <b>sleepers</b> account for their own lives, and the ways in which rough <b>sleepers</b> negotiate and manage their day-to-day experiences. Analysing previous literature and policy, the research claims that lives might be better understood using a narrative approach alongside other methods. Therefore, it employs methods of life mapping and auto-photography with rough <b>sleepers,</b> alongside participant observation and semi-structured interviews with service providers. These methods aided the understanding of the ways in which each group understands rough sleepers’ lives. The research finds that in contrast to policy and service provider discourses, which often focus on deficits, discourses of poor decision making in ideas of causation, and dichotomies of deservingness, rough sleepers’ own accounts focus on the importance of context to develop an understanding of the importance of key life events. Furthermore, the research suggests that understandings of rough sleepers’ lives presented in policy and service provider discourses which see these lives as ‘chaotic’, ‘off track’ and ‘failed’ are in stark contrast to rough <b>sleepers</b> own accounts, which entail elements of order, success, and aspirations. In considering these alternative approaches to understanding the lives of rough <b>sleepers,</b> the study proposes that narrative approaches to engaging with rough <b>sleepers,</b> which recognise the agency that rough <b>sleepers</b> have, could provide a way to better understand the ways in which rough <b>sleepers</b> understand their own lives...|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] comparative analysis of the structural behaviour of prestressed concrete <b>sleepers</b> made with high performance concrete (HPC) and high performance recycled aggregate concrete (HPRAC) is presented in this study. Two types of HPRAC <b>sleepers</b> were tested, using 50 and 100 % of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in replacement of coarse natural aggregates. The RCA employed in this research was sourced from crushing rejected HPC <b>sleepers.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine through analysis if the HPRAC sleepers’ behaviour fulfilled the European minimum requirements standards for prestressed concrete <b>sleepers</b> and compare their experimental behaviour with that of the HPC <b>sleepers.</b> The three types of prestressed concrete <b>sleepers</b> were subjected to static load tests at rail-seat and centre section (positive and negative load). In the centre section tests a comparative study between the experimental results and the proposed values of four assessment methods of ultimate capacity was carried out. Dynamic load and fatigue tests were also performed at the rail-seat section. The HPRACs and HPC <b>sleepers</b> met all the structural requirements for prestressed concrete <b>sleepers.</b> The experimental results determined the satisfactory performance of the HPRAC- 50 and the HPRAC- 100, which was very similar to that of the HPC <b>sleepers.</b> The load–strain behaviour recorded via the use of strain gauges on the prestressing bars revealed slightly higher stiffness of the HPC <b>sleepers.</b> The values obtained from the four assessment methods of ultimate capacity were also accurate when applied to HPRAC.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} <b>sleepers</b> (or railroad ties) are {{structural members}} that distribute the wheel loads from the rails {{to the track}} support system. Over a period of time, the concrete <b>sleepers</b> age and deteriorate in addition to experiencing various types of static and dynamic loading conditions, which are attributable to train operations. Recent studies have established two main limit states for the design consideration of concrete sleepers: ultimate limit states under extreme impact and fatigue limit states under repeated probabilistic impact loads. It was noted that the prestress level has {{a significant role in}} maintaining the high endurance of the <b>sleepers</b> under low to moderate repeated impact loads. This experimental investigation was aimed at static and dynamic load rating of aged railway concrete <b>sleepers</b> after service. Fifteen <b>sleepers</b> were extracted from a heavy haul rail network for testing using experimental facilities at the University of Wollongong (UoW), Australia. The structural evaluation program included quasi-static bending tests, dynamic impact tests, and tests to establish the current level of prestress in the steel wires using the dynamic relaxation technique. Two of the <b>sleepers</b> were evaluated for the level of prestressing forces in accordance with Australian Standards. Through diagnostic tests, the results of quasi-static bending tests produced the in-track bending capacities of <b>sleepers</b> that can be combined with the moments and forces anticipated {{over the next ten years}} to predict performance of the <b>sleepers</b> on a heavy haul coal line. The dynamic tests simulating the ability of concrete <b>sleepers</b> to resist extreme loading events due to heavy impact loads demonstrated that the <b>sleepers</b> in-track are likely to be able to resist the planned increased traffic without catastrophic failure over the next decade. Final conclusions suggest that there should be a routine test program every five years to ascertain the load rating of clustered <b>sleepers</b> and their fastening system in the heavy haul track system...|$|R
