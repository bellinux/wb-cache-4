The player of the gu and ban, a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, Xipi and Erhuang, originally differed in subtle ways. In the Xipi style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In Erhuang, on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a <b>standard</b> <b>meter</b> of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including manban (a slow tempo), yuanban (a standard, medium-fast tempo), kuai sanyan ("leading beat"), daoban ("leading beat"), sanban ("rubato beat"), and yaoban ("shaking beat"). The xipi style also uses several unique tempos, including erliu ("two-six"), and kuaiban (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, yuanban, manban, and kuaiban are most commonly seen. The tempo {{at any given time}} is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational, and Xipi as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.|$|E

Only sinusoidal signals are accurately described by RMS meters, and dc or high-frequency components normally are lost in <b>standard</b> TRMS <b>metering.</b> This can lead to inaccuracies when electrical signals are not sinusoidal, contain dc components, or include fast risetime perturbations, {{as is the case}} with the electric signals from an electric arc furnace. Electric arc furnace electrical waveforms, observed in research carried out by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, show high-frequency components and significant deviations from sinusoids. These perturbations and distortions make <b>metering</b> difficult for <b>standard</b> power <b>meters.</b> The inaccuracies in metering can cause further problems if those sensors are used in control systems. For control strategies requiring rapid response, any averaging scheme loses information that can be used in control decisions. In order to obtain better signals for both monitoring and control, a study of instantaneous, RMS, and TRMS power monitoring devices was conducted. From this study it was concluded that precision integrated circuits should be used to obtain instantaneous power with a bandwidth of at least 25 kHz. The information from these devices is more representative than that of <b>standard</b> <b>meters</b> and can be used in predictive control...|$|R

5000|$|One problem {{remains for}} such views: if God's own {{essential}} goodness {{does not depend}} on divine commands, then on what does it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness. Alston offers the analogy of the <b>standard</b> <b>meter</b> bar in France. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the <b>standard</b> <b>meter</b> bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why God is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is [...] "the end of the line," [...] with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard. On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's will, it still depends on God, and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.|$|E
