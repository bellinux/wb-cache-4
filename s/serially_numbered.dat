The glass lens itself is an 81 mm diameter meniscus achromatic doublet, concave surface foremost, and has a focal length of 382 mm. The front of the brass lens barrel features a diaphragm with a fixed 27 mm diameter opening, giving the lens an effective working aperture of slightly over f/14. Attached to the diaphragm is a manually operated pivoting brass shutter, sufficient for its purpose because of the very long exposures required.|$|R

5000|$|The second {{key feature}} {{is that the}} bins are <b>numbered</b> <b>serially,</b> rather than being {{rastered}} as for an image. The total number of bits required for the bin numbers at level N is 2N + 3, where the three most significant bits are used for the face numbers and the remaining bits are used to number the bins within each face. The faces are numbered from 0 to 5: 0 for the north face, 1 through 4 for the equatorial faces (1 being on the meridian), and 5 for the south. Thus at a binning depth of 10, face 0 has bin numbers 0-1048575, face 1 has numbers 1048576-2097151, and so on. Within each face the bins are <b>numbered</b> <b>serially</b> from one corner (the convention is {{to start at the}} [...] "lower left") to the opposite corner, ordered {{in such a way that}} each pair of bits corresponds to a level of bin resolution. This ordering is in effect a two-dimensional binary tree, which is referred to as the quad-tree. The conversion between bin numbers and coordinates is straightforward: if four-byte integers are used for the bin numbers the maximum practical depth, which uses 31 of the 32 bits and results in a bin size of 0.0922 square arcminutes (7.80 nanosteradians).|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to growing interest by wealthy and great patrons, including {{several of the}} royal families of Europe, two great works on the art and science of turning were published in France:. Meanwhile, turning technology was being developed in England where the practice of arresting the work from point to point (by a division plate) and applying a revolving cutter (held in an improved slide rest) was employed. By {{the beginning of the}} 19th century John Jacob Holtzapffel had established his workshop in London and built a reputation as a maker of high-class lathes and tools. Many of his customers were among the monarchs and nobility of Europe and England became the world centre for the pastime of ornamental turning. The Holtzapffel firm continued to make lathes until 1927 by which time they had produced a total of 2557, <b>serially</b> <b>numbered,</b> many of which were equipped for ornamental turning. Other engineers copied or varied his designs but none were so prolific in their manufacture.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 the {{auditors}} of Touche Niven (Touche, Niven & Company) gave the rubber importer, Fred Stern and Company, an unqualified audit certificate, {{having failed to}} discover that management had falsified entries to overstate accounts receivable. The auditors knew that the accounts when certified {{would be used to}} raise money and for that purpose supplied 32 certified and <b>serially</b> <b>numbered</b> copies: p. 442. On the faith of one of those copies, given to it on its demand, the plaintiff, Ultramares Corporation, lent Fred Stern and Company money. Stern declared bankruptcy in 1925. Ultramares sued Touche Niven for the amount of the Stern debt, declaring that a careful audit would have shown Stern to be insolvent. The audit was found to be negligent, but not fraudulent. The judge set this finding aside based on the doctrine of privity, which protects auditors from third party suits. An intermediate appellate court reinstated the negligence verdict. The case then went to the New York Court of Appeals, Judge Benjamin Cardozo presiding.|$|E

50|$|At crowded {{stations}} on high-traffic lines, {{a platform}} track may {{be divided into}} two block sections so a following train can enter the track soon after the preceding train has departed. This signal is known as a No. 0 block signal. JR East treats this signal as a part of its home signals. At non-interlocking stations of JR West and other operators, the last block signal before the station is treated as a No. 0 block signal and known as the home signal equivalent block signal. This signal is not absolute, since (unlike home signals) non-blocking operation is permitted. On ATOS (Automated Transport Operating System) lines block signals are <b>numbered</b> <b>serially,</b> regardless of non-interlocking stations.

40|$|Background: The {{in-vitro}} {{reverse transcription}} of RNA to its complementary DNA, catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, {{is the most}} fundamental step in the quantitative RNA detection in genomic studies. As such, this step should be as analytically sensitive, efficient and reproducible as possible, especially when dealing with degraded or low copy RNA samples. While there are many reverse transcriptases in the market, all claiming to be highly sensitive, there is need for a systematic independent comparison of their applicability in quantification of rare RNA transcripts or low copy RNA, such as those obtained from archival tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed RT-qPCR to assess the sensitivity and reproducibility of 11 commercially available reverse transcriptases in cDNA synthesis from low copy number RNA levels. As target RNA, we used a <b>serially</b> known <b>number</b> of Armored HIV RNA molecules, and observed that 9 enzymes we tested were consistently sensitive to, 1, 000 copies, seven of which were sensitive to, 100 copies, while only 5 were sensitive to, 10 RNA template copies across all replicates tested. Despite their demonstrated sensitivity, these five best performing enzymes (Accuscript, HIV-RT, M-MLV, Superscript III and Thermoscript) showed considerable variation in their reproducibility {{as well as their}} overall amplification efficiency. Accuscript and Superscript III were the most sensitive and consistent within runs, with Accuscrip...|$|R
