5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages; and the relatively limited contact between the lacrimal and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves.</b> This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E

25|$|Shells are carved {{soon after}} the tree is felled, while the wood still retains some {{moisture}} and is softer. This makes the wood easier to carve and avoids radial splits that tend to develop in logs that are allowed to dry naturally.

A well-carved djembe {{does not have a}} smooth interior but a texture of scallops or <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> that influence the sound of the instrument.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of {{an impression of}} the skin covering the dorsal plates has implications for all possible functions of stegosaurian plates. Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) found that the skin was smooth with long, parallel, <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> indicating a keratinous structure covering the plates. The addition of beta-keratin, a strong protein, would indeed allow the plates to bear more weight, suggesting {{they may have been}} used for active defense. A keratinous covering would also allow greater surface area for the plates to be uses as a mating display structures, which could be potentially coloured like the beaks of modern birds. At the same time this finding implies that the use of plates for thermo-regulation may be less likely because the keratinous covering would make heat transfer from the bone highly ineffective.|$|E
500|$|Sphecomyrma ants can be {{distinguished}} from other ants by their extremely primitive body structure, small, narrow wasp-like mandibles, short scapes (the basal segment of the antenna) and the exceptionally long funiculus, which is four times longer than the scape. The suture (a pattern of <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> on the head) is well developed and the trochantellus (the [...] end of the femur) is absent. The node (a segment between the mesosoma, the middle part of the body, and gaster) of the petiole is noticeably dome-shaped and is separated from the propodeum, the first abdominal segment, {{and parts of the}} metasoma, the posterior part of the body, by several constrictions. The cuticle (outer exoskeleton of the body) is not sculptured and is covered with either scattered or spare setae, which are different types of bristle or hair-like structures. The body structure shows that Sphecomyrma ants were medium-sized formicids. Workers are known to have stingers.|$|E

500|$|The cap is [...] in diameter, and ranges {{in shape}} from conical to convex to bell-shaped. The surface has {{radially}} arranged <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> extending {{almost to the}} center of the cap. The cap surface is somewhat hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, and smooth. It is colored violet-brown when young, then becomes somewhat paler from the margin. The white flesh is up to 1mm thick, and lacks any distinctive odor or taste. The stem is long and slender compared to the size of the cap, typically [...] tall by [...] thick, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, and hollow. It is grayish-brown to violet-brown at the top, gradually becoming violet-brown on the lower portion. The stem surface is initially [...] (appearing to be covered with a fine whitish powder), but becomes smooth in age. The stem base bears large, bristle-like coarse white hairs. The gills are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), with between 23–27 reaching the stem. The gills are up to [...] broad, thin, and have a whitish or with a grayish hue; the gills edges are the same color as the gill faces.|$|E
500|$|The cap of Dendrocollybia racemosa is {{typically}} between [...] in diameter, {{and depending on}} its stage of development, may be conic to convex, or in maturity, somewhat flattened with a slight rounded central elevation (an umbo). The cap surface is dry and opaque, with a silky texture; its color in the center is [...] (a dusky brownish-gray color), but the color fades uniformly towards the margin. The margin is usually curved toward the gills initially; as the fruit body matures the edge may roll out somewhat, {{but it also has}} a tendency to fray or split with age. There may be <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> on the cap that correspond to the position of the gills underneath, which may give the cap edge a [...] (scalloped) appearance. The flesh is very thin (less than 1mm thick) and fragile, lacking in color, and has no distinctive odor or taste. The gills are relatively broad, narrowly attached to the stem (...) , spaced closely together, and colored gray to grayish-tan, somewhat darker than the cap. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend {{all the way to the}} stem; they are interspersed between the gills and arranged in up to three series (tiers) of equal length.

Around the umbo, the cap surface is smooth, but towards the cap margin, the surface is defined by fibrils running from the margin towards the umbo. The cap sometimes splits along these. The cap's colour varies from yellow-brown to pale brown, and is palest at the margins. The umbo contrasts to this somewhat, being a grey-brown or red-brown. The slender stem measures from [...] long by [...] thick. It thickens slightly towards the base, where it joins a large, well-defined [...] "bulb" [...] that can be up to [...] across. <b>Shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> run up the surface of the stem, which is covered in a fine white powder.

2500|$|Perikymata {{which are}} {{associated}} with the Striae are <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> noted clinically on the nonmasticatory surfaces of some teeth in the oral cavity.

Darker than the other incremental lines, the neonatal line is an incremental line that separates enamel formed before and after birth. The neonatal line marks the stress or trauma experienced by the ameloblasts during birth, again illustrating the sensitivity of the ameloblasts as they form enamel matrix. As one would expect, the neonatal line is found in all primary teeth and in the larger cusps of the permanent first molars. They contain irregular structures of enamel prisms with disordered crystal arrangements basically formed by the abrupt bending of the prisms towards the root; usually, the prisms gradually bent back again to regain their previous orientation.|$|E
