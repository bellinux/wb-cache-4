50|$|In the {{geometry}} of crystal nets, one can treat edges as line segments. For example, in a crystal net, it is presumed that edges do not “collide” {{in the sense that}} when treating them as line segments, they do not intersect. Several polyhedral constructions can be derived from crystal nets. For example, a vertex figure can be obtained by <b>subdividing</b> each edge (treated as a line segment) by the insertion of <b>subdividing</b> points, and then the vertex figure of a given vertex is the convex hull of the adjacent <b>subdividing</b> points (i.e., the convex polyhedron whose vertices are the adjacent <b>subdividing</b> points).|$|R

5|$|Municipalities {{have the}} right to decentralize {{themselves}} and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities will cease to exist in the near future {{to reduce the number of}} levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called stadsdelen, and Rotterdam, where the districts are called deelgemeenten, consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although they do not have the same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are <b>subdivided</b> into districts (wijken), which in turn are <b>subdivided</b> into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were <b>subdivided</b> into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E
