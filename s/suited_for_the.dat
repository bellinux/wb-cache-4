5|$|In 1977, the Mérens was {{introduced}} to the island of Réunion, where its breeding is now part of the local economy. It is used as a saddle horse and for hauling. The breed is also used for equestrian tourism on the mountains of the island, where it is particularly well <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> steep terrain and climate, taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash.|$|E
5|$|Marina Sirtis {{auditioned for}} the role of Macha Hernandez, while Denise Crosby auditioned for the part of Deanna Troi. They both gained the parts with the {{approval}} of Berman and Justman, but Roddenberry switched the roles of the actresses as he thought Sirtis would be better <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of the ship's counselor. Macha Hernandez was re-written to become Tasha Yar to better suit Crosby.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It is well <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> foundations of tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the {{grooming}} hypothesis {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing {{is found in}} exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more {{important role in the}} use of the toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|In May 1963 Menzies {{announced}} an A£200million increase in defence spending {{over the next}} five years, and proposed to send a team led by Hancock overseas to evaluate Canberra replacements. Early candidates were the French Dassault Mirage IV, the TSR-2, and the U.S. North American A-5 Vigilante, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the TFX. From June to August, Hancock's team visited France, Britain and the United States to evaluate the competitors, and determined that the TFX would be the aircraft best <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role. The Mirage IV had insufficient range and the A£108 million price was too expensive. The F-4 and the A-5 were immediately available, but the less expensive F-4 would need air-to-air refueling to reach Indonesia from Australia. The TSR-2 was behind schedule and over budget, was the most expensive at A£122 million for 24 aircraft, and British government support for the program was uncertain. While the TFX was also controversial in the United States, its promised performance specifications and per-aircraft cost were superior to that of the TSR-2. As he did not expect TFX to be available before 1970, however, Hancock recommended buying 36 A-5 aircraft for A£88 million to counteract the perceived imminent threat from Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Kubo {{said that}} Ichigo {{was created to}} replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role. His {{character}} has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Ichigo is often featured in Weekly Shōnen Jump character popularity polls. He was consistently ranked as the most popular character in Bleach. The 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine polls ranked Ichigo {{as one of the}} top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have praised his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical anti-hero. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has been released, including toys, clothing and action figures. In the animated adaptations of Bleach, Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. In the live-action film, he will be played by Sota Fukushi.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1942, Heydrich {{planned to}} meet Hitler in Berlin. German {{documents}} suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German-occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich {{would have to}} pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was well <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich's car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Instead of ordering his driver to speed away, Heydrich called his car to halt and attempted to confront the attackers. Kubiš then threw a bomb (a converted anti-tank mine) {{at the rear of}} the car as it stopped. The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš.|$|E
5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E

5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|Though the Teton Range {{was never}} {{permanently}} inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley {{to the east}} of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to {{the west side of the}} Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman.|$|E

25|$|Depopulation {{continued}} {{at the end}} of the 16th and early 17th centuries, and the monastery’s importance diminished. By the end of this time, the monastery was all but abandoned, as Cuautla grew and became the regional center. In the 17th century, those who had land rights under what were called “primordial title” began to struggle with Spanish owned haciendas over surface water. Much of the land in the municipality is not <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> growing of crops, but is instead <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> raising of livestock, especially cattle. For this reason, the area’s industry in providing beef and dairy products such as cream and cheese began relatively early in the colonial period. Orchards established in the very early colonial period were still important. There was another period of depopulation in the 18th century when many residents went to work in haciendas in Cuautla and other areas in Morelos.|$|E
