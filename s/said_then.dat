5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister <b>said,</b> <b>then</b> surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E

Their father Cosimo I, it was <b>said,</b> <b>then</b> murdered Garcia with his own sword, and Eleanor, distraught, died a week later from grief. The truth, proven by modern-day exhumations and forensic science, was that Eleanor and her sons, as the Medici family had always claimed, died together from malaria in 1562.|$|E

The secular-leftist Waad society said that instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp had been blocked by VIVA Bahrain telecommunications company. Several citizens also complained of loss of Internet for several hours in different locations during the day. They said the cut was at a time when protests were being held. Previously in February 2011, when the uprising began, a similar situation occurred during which the Internet became either slow or was lost completely.

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine {{on the floor by}} his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. [...] "I could see the barrel of the rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Then,</b> she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled [...] "Get the fuck out of here" [...] and [...] "May the blood of [...] be on your [...] ". The captain dove for cover to his left as she yelled [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; [...] "she shout in English that she wanted to kill Americans" [...] and then lost consciousness.|$|E
