Two good seasons followed in 1857 and 1858 with pastoralists reporting permanent freshwater lakes on their runs. Stations were required to stock 50 sheep per square mile (19 per square kilometre) but soon properties such as Nonning were <b>shearing</b> <b>flocks</b> of 90,000.

50|$|In {{countries}} where {{large numbers of}} sheep are kept for wool, sometimes many thousands in a <b>flock,</b> <b>shearing</b> sheds are vital to house the necessary shearing equipment, {{and to ensure that}} the shearers and /or crutchers have a ready supply of dry, empty sheep. The shed also provides space where the wool is classed and pressed into approved wool packs and stored to await transport to market.|$|R
60|$|The Scribes and Pharisees, it seems, {{taught them}} nothing. They may have taught {{the people in}} Jerusalem, and in the great towns, something: but they seem, from all the gospels, to have cared little or nothing for the poor folk out in the wild {{mountain}} country. They liked to live in pride and comfort in the towns, with their comfortable congregations round them, admiring them; {{but they had no}} fancy {{to go out into the}} deserts, to seek and to save those who were lost. They were bad shepherds, greedy shepherds, who were glad enough to <b>shear</b> God's <b>flock,</b> and keep the wool themselves: but they did not care to feed the flock of God. It was too much trouble; and they could get no honour and no money by it. And most likely they did not understand these poor people; could not speak, hardly understand, their country language; for these Galileans spoke a rough dialect, different from that of the upper classes.|$|R
40|$|Value added tax (VAT) {{is a type}} of {{indirect}} tax that is imposed on goods and services. Sometimes, when the government operates on a budget surplus or wants to increase its revenue in order to finance its budget deficit. A question that arises is whether value added tax has been a boon or misery for a developing country like India. Around 136 countries in Asia have recognized the importance of value added tax. In one of the most large scale reforms of the country’s public finances in over the past 50 years, India has finally agreed the launch of its much delayed value added tax from 1 st April, 2005 at a rate of 12. 5 %. The tax rate is fixed by meeting of different state level Finance Minister, in New Delhi, designed to make accounting more transparent, to cut short trade barriers and boost tax revenues. According to Chanakya, “A government should tax its people like a shepherd <b>shears</b> a <b>flock</b> or a bee gets nectar from a flower”. The tax is levied not only on products but services that is the source of revenue for the government to plan for development activities in the country. Since, India is a developing country, the main source for revenue is generated through tax levied on the individual on the purchase of goods or services. The government imposes taxes and duty charges on the fellow people for fulfilling the infrastructural, technological, entrepreneurial demand of the country. Whether the imposition of high tax on the society is favorable or unfavorable in the present scenario to meet th...|$|R
40|$|Irregular pagination: missing page 99 Samples from {{different}} body regions {{were obtained from}} the birthcoat, first, second and third fleeces of sheep in two Drysdale flocks. Fibre type arrays of birthcoat samples were analysed and various wool traits were assessed and measured in samples obtained at three shearings. Sampling position was the main source of variation in most traits studied. Sex, birth rank, and age of dam generally made little contribution to the total variance. <b>Shearing,</b> <b>flock</b> and sire effects were also important sources of variation for many traits. The interaction of shearing X position and the interactions of sire with each of shearing, sex and birth rank were significant for many traits. Phenotypic correlations among fleece traits were estimated from shoulder and mid-side positions as well as among fleece averages calculated from all positions. Correlations among fleece averages showed that higher kemp score (KS) was associated with higher bulk; BUL (0. 24 to 0. 64), resilience; RES (0. 03 to 0. 48) and tristimulus colour values; X, Y and Z (0. 08 to 0. 46). Softer handle grade tended to be correlated with lower BUL (- 0. 22 to - 0. 66) and RES (- 0. 16 to - 0. 53) and higher lustre; LG (0. 10 to 0. 62). Higher medullation index (MI) was generally associated with higher BUL (- 0. 15 to 0. 49) and tristimulus colour values (- 0. 01 to 0. 60) and lower LG (- 0. 65 to 0. 08). Correlations among tristimulus colour values were the highest between X and Y reflectances (0. 93 to 1. 00). Greasy and clean wool per unit area (GWA and CWA) were highly correlated (0. 93 to 0. 96). Heavier first greasy fleece weight (GFW 1) correlated positively with GWA (0. 59) and CWA (0. 56). Staple length (STL) tended to be longer as GWA (0. 37 to 0. 60), CWA (0. 39 to 0. 60) and GFW 1 (0. 64) inceased and as BUL decreased (- 0. 01 to - 0. 54). BUL and RES were highly correlated (0. 82 to 0. 95). LG was negatively correlated with BUL (- 0. 12 to - 0. 66) and RES (- 0. 10 to - 0. 41). Very few sickle fibres were found in Drysdale materials; most arrays were plateau. Coarser arrays were associated with higher proportions of hairy-tip curly-tip fibres (HTCT). GFW 1 increased as HTCTs increased (0. 33 to 0. 46). Generally, the correlations among birthcoat and third fleece traits were not strong which implies that birthcoat traits are not reliable indications to selection for various traits in later fleeces of Drysdale sheep. Higher MI was associated with coarser arrays (- 0. 07 to - 0. 55) and higher proportions of super-sickle A fibres (0. 22 to 0. 41). Finer arrays were associated with higher yield (0. 01 to 0. 38). In one flock, sheep with a higher proportion of halo-hair (HH) fibres had higher GWA (0. 25 to 0. 33), CWA (0. 17 to 0. 30) and heavier third fleece weights (0. 09 to 0. 33) while sheep with coarser birthcoat arrays showed a slight tendency to have more bulky fleeces (- 0. 22 to - 0. 29). Medullation index of the third fleece (MI 3) as well as greasy and clean third fleece weights (GFW 3 and CFW 3) can be predicted, with limited accuracy (R 2 = 0. 50) from the first shearing shoulder (SH 1) traits by using the following multiple regression equations: Within flock-sex groups MI 3 = 9. 15 + 0. 45 MI (SH 1) + 1. 84 KS (SH 1) For rams GFW 3 = - 1. 47 + 0. 04 HH% (SH 1) + 0. 14 X (SH 1) - 0. 09 Z (SH 1) CFW 3 = - 1. 53 + 0. 03 HH% (SH 1) + 0. 14 X (SHI) - 0. 09 Z (SH 1) It appeared that the shoulder is the best position from which to sample fleeces when a number of traits are to be assessed for ranking Drysdale sheep...|$|R
40|$|In Mediterranean areas {{shearing}} {{is commonly}} performed during late spring and, therefore, ewes may {{be exposed to}} cold stress especially during the night. Short-term periods of cold exposure can increase hepatic glucose production, decrease insulin secretion and increase fat catabolism and plasma non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) concentration. These metabolic adaptations to cold exposure can increase the mammary uptake of long-chain fatty acid from plasma. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic response of dairy ewes to shearing by monitoring their milk fatty acid (FA) profile. Twelve 2 - 4 -year-old Sarda ewes, in mid-late lactation, were used. The trial lasted from 30 th May to 9 th June 2006. The pre-experimental period (pre-shearing, PrS) was from 30 th May to 5 th June (shearing day), being followed by the experimental period (post-shearing, PoS) until 9 th June. On <b>shearing</b> day, the <b>flock</b> was divided in two groups (6 ewes each) which were then managed differently: non-confined group (NCG) and confined group (CG) which was kept in a sheepfold during the night. Four samplings during PrS and other four during PoS periods were performed. During the trial, ewes were fed concentrate at 1000 g/d per head, during the two daily milking, and hay ad libitum, and grazed on green clover (3 h/day). Daily milk production was recorded and daily milk samples were collected for analysis of fat content and FA profile. Shearing did not influence milk yield but increased significantly milk fat content (6. 37 vs. 6. 94...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of ewes management during the post-shearing period on milk production and quality. Forty-eight 2 - 4 -year-old Sarda ewes, in mid-late lactation, were used. The trial lasted from 30 th May to 9 th June 2006. The pre-experimental period was from 30 th May to 5 th June (shearing day), followed by the experimental period until 9 th June. On <b>shearing</b> day, the <b>flock</b> was divided in two groups (24 ewes each) which then received a different management: non confined group (NCG) and confined group (CG) kept in a sheepfold during the night. Four samplings during pre-shearing (PrS) and other four during post-shearing (PoS) periods were performed. During the trial, ewes were fed 1000 g/head/d of concentrated food, provided during the two daily milking, and hay ad libitum, and grazed on green clover (3 h/day). Daily milk production was recorded and daily milk samples were collected for fat, total nitrogen, SCC, casein and urea analyses. Data were analysed by PROC MIXED of SAS software, using management (M), shearing (S) and their interaction as fixed factors, ewes within group as random factor and the first sampling of the PrS period as covariate. Environmental conditions during the trial were variable, especially during PrS when rainfall occurred 2 days before shearing. Maximum and minimum temperatures were, on average, 23 ± 3. 3 °C and 9 ± 1. 6 °C, respectively. Sheep confinement after shearing did not influence milk yield and quality. On the contrary, shearing influenced fat, casein and urea content within each management group. Indeed, fat and casein were higher (P< 0. 01) and urea was lower (P< 0. 01) during the PoS than during the PrS period: for NCG, fat (...|$|R
60|$|He also {{assisted}} his neighbours in haymaking and <b>shearing</b> their <b>flocks,</b> and in {{the performance}} of this latter service he was eminently dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a haycock, or a fleece; less as a recompence for this particular service than as a general acknowledgment. The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the Church were also duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every week in the year, he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind; not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon, when he indulged himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine. The frugality and temperance established in his house, were as admirable as the industry. Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was there known; {{in the latter part of}} his life, indeed, when tea had been brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof, and had been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his wife ever partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and decent, but as simple as their diet; the home-spun materials were made up into apparel by their own hands. At the time of the decease of this thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning. And it is remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit, remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands. It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours, consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour. The lights by which, in the winter evenings, their work was performed, were of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes, dipped in any unctuous substance that the house affords. White candles, as tallow candles are here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were perhaps produced upon no other occasions. Once a month, during the proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the year, was salted and dried for winter provision: the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoes.--By these various resources, this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he affectingly says, 'from wanting the necessaries of life;' but affording them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in society. In this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their father's example, his precepts, and injunctions: he was aware that truth-speaking, as a moral virtue, is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions; and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family, that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged, he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought.|$|R
