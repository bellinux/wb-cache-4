40|$|The {{problem of}} Surface Reconstruction arises in many real world situations. We {{introduce}} {{in detail the}} problem itself and then take a brief look into its applications and existing techniques, particularly learning based techniques, developed for its solution. Having presented the context, we closely examine one such learning based technique – the Neural Mesh algorithm for Surface Reconstruction. Despite being relatively recent, the Neural Mesh algorithm has already undergone several revisions, thus giving rise to several variants of the original algorithm. We study the algorithm and each of its variants in detail. All variants rely in varying degrees on a specific aspect of the algorithm – a <b>signal</b> <b>counter.</b> We observe that algorithmic reliance on the <b>signal</b> <b>counter</b> impedes performance and propose an alternate way of performing the same functionalities – using a list. Additionally, on the practical side, we identify areas where inhouse implementations of the algorithms were wanting in efficiency and revise those areas. Changing over from the <b>signal</b> <b>counter</b> to the list represents a change in approach from the exact learning of the original algorithms to a comparative learning framework. We show empirically that this change in approach does not produce any {{significant difference in the}} quality of the algorithms’ output, while performance, in terms of running time, increases dramatically...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss two methods for obtaining derived, noise-evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} (NEOAEs). The first, originally proposed by Maat et al. [1], utilises the polynomial correlation functions. The application of linear compensation on {{the estimation of}} these functions is investigated in a more formal manner than in earlier publications, by looking at {{its effect on the}} statistical estimators. The second, related but novel, approach of obtaining derived-NEOAEs is based on rescaling the H 1 -estimator. Then moving {{back and forth between the}} time and frequency domains, separating the response into short and long latency temporal regions, in order to perform linear compensation. The errors on this second method are discussed, and two sources are highlighted; one due to random error on the estimates themselves; and the other due to numerical artefacts from the use of band-limited excitation. It is observed that the highest level excitation <b>signal,</b> <b>counter</b> intuitively, produces the noisiest estimate. A method of reducing noise-induced artefacts in the output spectra for the derived-NEOAEs is proposed that takes into account redundancy in the time series...|$|E

40|$|Antiferromagnets (AFs) are {{remarkable}} magnetically ordered {{materials that}} due {{to the absence of}} a net magnetic moment do not generate dipolar fields and are insensitive to external magnetic field perturbations. However, it has been notoriously difficult to control antiferromagnetic moments by any practical means suitable for device applications. This has left AFs over their hundred years history virtually unexploited and only poorly explored, in striking contrast to the thousands of years of fascination and utility of ferromagnetism. Very recently it has been predicted and experimentally confirmed that relativistic spin-orbit torques can provide the means for efficient electrical control of an AF. Here we place the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics on the map of non-volatile solid state memory technologies. We demonstrate the complete write/store/read functionality in an antiferromagnetic CuMnAs bit cell embedded in a standard printed circuit board communicating with a computer via a USB interface. We show that the elementary-shape bit cells fabricated from a single-layer AF are electrically written on timescales ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds and we demonstrate their deterministic multi-level switching. The multi-level cell characteristics, reflecting series of reproducible, electrically controlled domain reconfigurations, allow us to integrate memory and <b>signal</b> <b>counter</b> functionalities within the bit cell.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{scattering}} of a soliton-like propagating particle with {{a wall of}} bound particles, in several strongly interacting one-dimensional lattice models with discrete degrees of freedom. We consider spin-polarized fermions (anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain), the fermionic Hubbard model, and the Bose Hubbard model, using precise numerical time dependent Density Matrix Renormalization Group techniques. We show that in all integrable models studied, there is no reflection. Instead, an incoming particle experiences particle-hole transmutation upon entry and exit of the wall, and travels inside the wall as a hole, analoguous to Klein tunneling, even though the dispersion is highly nonlinear {{and there is no}} external potential. Two particles are added to the wall on the incoming side and removed on the opposite side. For spin-polarized fermions a single transmitted particle thus shifts the wall by two lattice sites, in complete contrast to classical physics. For both Hubbard models, the wall shifts by one doubly occupied single site. In the nonintegrable models studied, the same process occurs in linear superposition with backscattering events. We demonstrate a corresponding fermionic quantum Newton's cradle and a metamaterial with "tachyonic" modes travelling faster than in an empty system. We present a possible atomic scale <b>signal</b> <b>counter</b> for spintronics. Our scenario should be realizable in future cold atom experiments...|$|E

40|$|Eukaryotic genome {{integrity}} is maintained via a DNA damage checkpoint that recognizes DNA damage and halts the cell cycle at metaphase, allowing time for repair. Checkpoint signaling is eventually terminated {{so that the}} cell cycle can resume. How cells restart cell division following checkpoint termination is poorly understood. Here we show that the SUMO protease Ulp 2 is required for resumption of cell division following DNA damage-induced arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{although it is not}} required for DNA double-strand break repair. The Rad 53 branch of the checkpoint pathway generates a <b>signal</b> <b>countered</b> by Ulp 2 activity following DNA damage. Interestingly, unlike previously characterized adaptation mutants, ulp 2 Δ mutants do not show persistent Rad 53 phosphorylation following DNA damage, suggesting checkpoint signaling has been terminated and no longer asserts an arrest in these cells. Using Cdc 14 localization as a cell cycle indicator, we show that nearly half of cells lacking Ulp 2 can escape a checkpoint-induced metaphase arrest despite their inability to divide again. Moreover, half of permanently arrested ulp 2 Δ cells show evidence of an aberrant mitotic spindle, suggesting that Ulp 2 is required for proper spindle dynamics during cell cycle resumption following a DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest...|$|R
40|$|The Arf tumor {{suppressor}} acts as {{a sensor}} of oncogenic <b>signals,</b> <b>countering</b> aberrant proliferation in large part via activation of the p 53 transcriptional program, though a number of p 53 -independent functions have been described. Mounting evidence suggests that, in addition to promoting tumorigenesis via disruptions in the homeostatic balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis of overt cancer cells, genetic alterations leading to tumor suppressor loss of function or oncogene gain of function can also incite tumor development via effects on the tumor microenvironment. In a transgenic mouse model of multi-stage pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinogenesis (PNET) driven by inhibition of the canonical p 53 and Rb tumor suppressors with SV 40 large T-antigen (Tag), stochastic progression to tumors is limited {{in part by a}} requirement for initiation of an angiogenic switch. Despite inhibition of p 53 by Tag in this mouse PNET model, concomitant disruption of Arf via genetic knockout resulted in a significantly accelerated pathway to tumor formation that was surprisingly not driven by alterations in tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis, but rather via earlier activation of the angiogenic switch. In the setting of a constitutional p 53 gene knockout, loss of Arf also accelerated tumor development, albeit to a lesser degree. These findings demonstrate that Arf loss of function can promote tumorigenesis via facilitating angiogenesis, at least in part, through p 53 -independent mechanisms...|$|R

25|$|The key to {{the ability}} of a {{frequency}} synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually {{in the form of a}} digital counter, with the output signal acting as a clock <b>signal.</b> The <b>counter</b> is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system.|$|R

40|$|Most {{territorial}} songbirds live {{in communication}} networks where eavesdropping on vocal interactions may constitute an important option for gathering {{information regarding the}} relative dominance, condition and quality of individuals being eavesdropped upon.

Special eavesdropper strategies that facilitate eavesdropping (how best to eavesdrop) may therefore have evolved together with strategies for interacting that either co-facilitate (public <b>signaling)</b> or <b>counter</b> eavesdropping directly (private signaling) or indirectly by preventing any subsequent negative consequences of being eavesdropped upon (anonymity).

40|$|A multi-input counter; or {{accumulative}} parallel counter; {{represents a}} true generalization of a sequential counter {{in that it}} incorporates the memory feature of an ordinary counter; i. e., it adds {{the sum of its}} inputs to a stored value. In this paper; we present eficient designs for simple multi-input counters and their modular versions, which keep the accumulated count modulo an arbitrary constant. 1 Introdiction In its simplest form, a counter is a sequential circuit that stores an integer value and can increment (and, in the case of up/down counters, also decrement) it by 1 upon the receipt of a special “enable ” or “count ” <b>signal.</b> <b>Counters</b> are among the most widely used components in digital systems, with applications in computer systems, communication equip-ment, scientific instruments, and industrial process control, to name a few. A vast variety of counter designs have been proposed in the literature [3, 6, 12], patented [1, 2, 4], and/or used in practice. Although techniques are available for designing high-speed counters with conventional number representations [S], the-speeds that can be achieved are limited by the re-quirement for carry propagation. Even with advanced de-signs based on redundant number representations [6] or hi-erarchical incrementation using small blocks at the right end and increasingly wider blocks toward the left [11, 151, speeds will be limited by the basic switching characteristics of components and, perhaps, by the need for final conver-sion of the redundant count into a conventional binary num-ber. Even when no conversion is needed, to count the num-ber of Is among many thousands of bits by feeding them se-quentially to a high-speed counter would imply delays well in excess of several microseconds and such a delay is unac-ceptable in certain applications. Some form of parallelism in handling the large number of input bits is needed to achieve higher speeds.

40|$|Abstract only. A {{major problem}} {{affecting}} world fisheries today is overcapacity of which overfishing {{is both a}} cause and a consequence. Subsidies are now widely perceived as an underlying cause of overcapacity, the negative environmental, social and economic effects {{of which can be}} masked by increasing support from the government. Subsidies that reduce the costs of fishing and increase profits for the industry can insulate fishers from economic <b>signals,</b> <b>countering</b> the economic incentive to stop fishing when it is unprofitable. Subsidies can thus be a major impediment to achieving economically productive fisheries, particularly in the absence of effective management systems. It is thus ironic that the dual crisis of overfishing and overcapacity is usually generated by the management system itself. Despite continued effort, fleet overcapacity continues to be the fundamental problem of the European Unions Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Capacity reduction schemes, such as buy-back programs, have not been very effective since generally only the least efficient vessels are bought up, leaving total fishing capacity largely intact. On the other hand, vessel construction subsidies and modernisation schemes are also particularly damaging, helping to reduce operating costs and further increase the economic incentives underlying overcapacity. Fuel price support is another type of subsidy reducing the operating costs particularly since fuel constitutes a significant component of fishing costs, contributing up to 60 percent in some fisheries. By reducing operating costs and thus enabling an increase in fishing effort, fuel subsidies are contributing to increasing fishing pressure and overexploitation of fish stocks. As a result, fuel subsidies support economically unprofitable practices that undermine future economic benefits. A long-term approach is needed that encompasses more fundamental changes than using more efficient engines that initially reduce fuel consumption but in the long-run worsen the situation by contributing to increasing fishing effort on already overexploited stocks. In this view and on account of the global fisheries crises and highly subsidised fisheries, this study aims at estimating the impact of eliminating cost-reducing and capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies on the Azorean economy. In particular, this study sets out to measure the impact of such a shock on various macro and micro variables pertaining to the regional economy using a dynamic CGE model based on a SAM for the Azores...|$|R

For example, an increase in melanin {{is associated with a}} reduction of feather wear due to abrasion (Burtt, 1979, 1986; reviewed in Bonser, 1996). It follows that melanin {{is more likely to be}} found in feathers more exposed to wear, such as those in the wing tips of gulls or gannets (Gill, 1995). Decreased feather surface area and length was observed on the albino side of a partially albino yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronara auduboni; Barrowclough and Sibley, 1980). Similarly, white spots on barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) wings showed more breakage than was expected by chance (Kose and Møller, 1999). Furthermore, increased wear was seen in an albino greater shearwater (Puffinus gravis), resulting in lower wing area, lower maneuverability and slower speed than pigmented conspecifics (Lee and Grant, 1986).
