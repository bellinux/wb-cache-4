5|$|On May 3, 2007, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Nancy Reagan {{hosted the}} first 2008 Republican primary {{debate in the}} library's Air Force One Pavilion. The {{candidates}} present included Kansas senator Sam Brownback, former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, representative Duncan Hunter of California, senator John McCain of Arizona, representative Ron Paul of Texas, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, and Tommy Thompson, former governor of Wisconsin and President George W. Bush's first secretary of Health and Human Services. Mrs. Reagan, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Fred Ryan, chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation were among those in attendance. Candidates discussed the Iraq War, the War on Terror, taxes, healthcare, abortion, <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> gay rights, illegal immigration, and made at least 20 references to Ronald Reagan and his presidency.|$|E

50|$|This book is {{the result}} of a {{research}} developed in the group of Theological Ethics and Society, and the line of study is entitled “contemporary theology in latin-american perspective”, by the Superior School of Theology (Escola Superior de Teologia - EST), São Leopoldo/RS. This work's thesis is that modern science is an expression of religion, for it carries within fundamental dimension which are present in Christianity, such as: salvation and hope for eternal life. Health has been transformed as a form of salvation. The search for longevity through ways of cloning and embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>researches</b> is founded in the promise for longevity and eternal life. It has also made approaches in connection to ethical and bioethical questions in the Brazilian social-political context, such as decision about anencephalic fetus, stem cell research and ethics in public health parting from a critical point of view from iluminism. The author presents a critical approach about science from Werner Heisenberg and Stephen Hawking in a dialogue with Hannah Arendt. This approach has the objective of surpassing the dichotomies between religion and science. It is necessary to rediscover the converging structures between nature´s book, science, and revelation´s book, the Scriptures. Modern Science, though critic towards the Christian tradition, was born and developed on traditional Christian soil. Particularly the Protestant tradition. This work contemplates the view on research with human beings in a dialogue with the philosopher Jürgen Habermas and Emmanuel Lévinas. In the discussion between science, philosophy and theology the pursuit is to establish relationships of mutual and critical learning, as well as consider the respect to differences between the scientific statutes of the different areas of the human knowledge.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Human {{embryonic}} <b>stem-cell</b> (hESC) <b>research</b> offers substantial {{potential benefits}} but has generated politically influential controversies and, in the United States, funding restrictions. Some observers fear the United States has been falling behind nations more permissive in this field, but policy debate has remained largely anecdotal. This study reports citation data {{indicating that the}} share of hESC research publications credited to the United States in the six years following the introduction of key technologies was significantly less than in five less contentious biomedical-research areas. The United States share of hESC publications fell sharply in 2003 and remained near this reduced level in 2004. Putative explanations are reviewed and several implications discussed. E ver since James Thomson and colleagues in 1998 reported isolating them from blastocysts, 1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have gen-erated great wonder but intense controversy — and scant scientometric data. Conditions suitable for hESC growth and differenti...|$|R
50|$|The country's first <b>stem-cell</b> {{translational}} <b>research</b> centre {{was established}} in Vellore in December 2005. The central government's biotechnology department selected the Christian Medical College (CMC) as {{the first in a}} series of centers, since it already had world-class clinical hematology and biochemistry departments. The college has made a breakthrough which attracted the attention of the country's medical and scientific community: the Centre for Stem Cell Research at the Christian Medical College succeeded in reprogramming cells from adult mice to make them function like stem cells found in the human embryo. The agricultural research station at Virinjipuram is in the Northeastern Zone of Tamil Nadu. It is one of 32 research stations of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). The Government of India-sponsored National Watershed Development Project for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA) scheme has been in operation since October 1997, with the main objective being trials of conservation measures conducted in water and soil of 18 watersheds in the Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts.|$|R

25|$|Another debate {{took place}} between Steele and Cardin on Sunday, October 29, 2006 {{as a part of}} the Meet The Press Senatorial debate series. Moderated by Tim Russert, the debate focused {{primarily}} on the Iraq War and <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> amongst other issues.|$|E
25|$|Lecture topics have {{included}} the sacrament of reconciliation (commonly referred to as confession), Christian values, faith and work, relationship issues, small faith communities, decision making or discernment, embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> religious fundamentalism, {{the relevance of the}} church in the modern world and to public policy, and women's role in the church.|$|E
50|$|Haruko Obokata (born 1983) is {{a former}} <b>stem-cell</b> {{biologist}} and <b>research</b> unit leader at Japan's Laboratory for Cellular Reprogramming, Riken Center for Developmental Biology. She claimed to have developed a radical and remarkably easy way to make stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cells that could be grown into tissue for use anywhere in the body. Riken, however, eventually launched an investigation in response to allegations of irregularities in images appearing in several articles she authored, including the paper announcing the discovery of STAP cells.The ensuing scandal over STAP cells has since {{become one of the}} world's best-known scientific frauds alongside the Schön scandal and Hwang Woo-suk's cloning experiments.|$|R
50|$|In July of 2005, the Bay Area Council’s {{efforts to}} reassert {{control over the}} region’s housing future began to bear fruit. Thanks {{in part to the}} {{advocacy}} of members who sent in a storm of faxes and e-mails to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, commissioners unanimously agreed to put millions of transportation dollars behind the concept of “transit villages” in the Bay Area. The Council pushed for housing near transit as the most cost-effective and ridership-generating way to accommodate impending Bay Area population growth without increasing sprawl, pollution and highway congestion. Also in 2005, Wunderman and the Bay Area Council {{played a critical role in}} gaining regional support for the Bay Area’s bid to “home-port” the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Because biotechnology had become one of the region’s key growth industries, the choice would help crown the Bay Area as the world leader in <b>stem-cell</b> and related <b>research.</b> In a region still reeling from the dot-com collapse, the positive psychological boost of winning the statewide contest for the headquarters was not lost on Wunderman. As the choice came down to the wire, the Council began a campaign to enlist its powerful network of regional allies and supporters for the San Francisco site. The avalanche of support from a wide range of business associations as well as from more than 60 supervisors, mayors, and council members from all nine Bay Area counties, proved decisive in the final choice.|$|R
25|$|FRC {{promotes}} what {{it considers}} traditional family values, by advocating and lobbying for socially conservative policies. It opposes and lobbies against {{equal rights for}} LGBT people (such as same-sex marriage, same-sex civil unions, and LGBT adoption), abortion, divorce, embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> and pornography. FRC is affiliated with a 501(c)(4) lobbying PAC known as FRC Action. In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center classified FRC as an anti-gay hate group, which generated some controversy.|$|E
25|$|The {{candidates}} presented differing {{opinions of}} President George W. Bush, with McCain and Huckabee criticizing Bush's mismanagement of the Iraq War while Giuliani and Romney praised Bush, Ron Paul said Bush {{was a poor}} conservative. The candidates also presented different opinions on contentious issues such as abortion and <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> but were united in calling for further tax cuts. All candidates opposed a pullout from Iraq except for Ron Paul, who spoke and voted against the resolution to authorize war on Iraq in 2002 {{and has been a}} vocal critic of the war.|$|E
25|$|The Medical School gained 143 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 144 points in its six subject areas in the Teaching Quality Assessment, and was also the first institution in Europe, second in the world, to receive permission to pursue <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> in human embryos. According to UCAS, Cambridge, Oxford and Newcastle are the most academically selective universities for entry to study medicine in the United Kingdom. The BMC Medicine journal reported medical graduates from Oxford, Cambridge and Newcastle performed better in postgraduate tests than any other medical school in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Newcastle Medical School {{consistently}} {{ranks as}} one of the top medical schools in the UK due to high levels of teaching and research; it is ranked in the top 10 UK medical schools by the Complete University Guide (8th), the Guardian (6th) and the Sunday Times (7th). It is the first institution in the UK to be given permission to pursue <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> The BMC Medicine journal reported medical graduates from Oxford, Cambridge and Newcastle performed better in postgraduate tests than any other medical school in the UK.|$|E
25|$|In {{his legal}} career Montgomery has, in {{addition}} to teaching law, practiced law in California, been admitted to the English bar as a barrister, is also licensed in France, taken higher degrees in ecclesiastical law at Cardiff University, and served as Director of Studies for the International Institute of Human Rights, Strasbourg (1979–81). He has written on legal-moral problems such as cryonics, <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> euthanasia, abortion and divorce, as well as arguing for a transcendental perspective in international human rights and jurisprudence. He has successfully represented clients in religious liberty cases before the Court of Appeals (1986) in Athens, Greece, and the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg (1997 and 2001).|$|E
25|$|In {{the party}} {{there was also}} a group named Ethic-Religious Council, whose board members {{included}} Gaetano Rebecchini (founder, ex-DC), Riccardo Pedrizzi (president), Franco Tofoni (vice president), Luigi Gagliardi (secretary-general), Alfredo Mantovano, Antonio Mazzocchi and Riccardo Migliori. This was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. Sometimes the group criticized Gianfranco Fini for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination and <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> which led some notable ex-DC members as Publio Fiori to leave the party. Some members of the Council, such as Pedrizzi and Mantovano were described as members of an unofficial Catholic Right faction.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2006, Kagen, a {{first time}} candidate, won the Democratic Party {{nomination}} for Wisconsin's 8th District. The seat was left open by the four-term incumbent Republican, Mark Green, who unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Wisconsin. On November 7, Kagen narrowly defeated Wisconsin Assembly Speaker John Gard of Peshtigo {{in the most}} expensive Congressional race in Wisconsin history, a race dominated by attack ads, mainly created by third-party 527 issue ad groups, outside {{the control of the}} candidate or parties. Some of the issues where Kagen and Gard disagreed were President George W. Bush's direction in the Iraq War, <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> and tax policy.|$|E
25|$|Social progressivism {{is another}} common feature of modern leftism, {{particularly}} in the United States, where social progressives {{played an important role}} in the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights and multiculturalism. Progressives have both advocated prohibition legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in the West include opposition to the death penalty and the War on Drugs, as well as support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage, cognitive liberty, distribution of contraceptives, public funding of embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> and the right of women to choose abortion. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives, such as Lester Frank Ward and John Dewey, who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.|$|E
25|$|Obama's {{developing}} presidential {{agenda was}} divided into {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues. In most cases, this agenda involved addressing crises already underway. His principal strategic decisions concerned how quickly to move bills through Congress. Some of his advisors suggested moving quickly, as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in 1933, under the belief that a more moderate approach would waste valuable time early in his presidency, when his political capital will be strongest. Others suggested moving more slowly, as Bill Clinton did before his attempt to enact a national healthcare program, based on the notion that rapid change could quickly wear down any bipartisan consensus. He was expected, in any case, to issue a series of executive orders within days of his inauguration, including a reversal of Bush-era executive orders restricting funding to family planning (including abortion) services and <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> There was also a possibility that a new cabinet level advisory post would be created overseeing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
500|$|Pitt {{visited the}} University of Missouri campus in October 2004 to {{encourage}} students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which he supported John Kerry. Later in October he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> [...] "We {{have to make sure that}} we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find," [...] he said. In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{suffered}} a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001, {{resulting in a}} broken hip. The fracture was repaired the following day and the 89-year-old Reagan returned home later that week, although he faced difficult physical therapy at home. On February 6, 2001, Reagan {{reached the age of}} 90, becoming the third former president to do so (the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover, with Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter later reaching 90). Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife Nancy. Nancy Reagan told CNN's Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that [...] "Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was." [...] After her husband's diagnosis and death, Nancy Reagan became a <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> advocate, urging Congress and President George W. Bush to support federal funding for embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> something Bush opposed. In 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for lifting restrictions on such research. Nancy Reagan said that she believed it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{powerful}} and talked about political advertisements in years" [...] and polls indicated that the commercial had a measurable impact on the way voters voted, in an election that McCaskill won. His second book, Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist, describes his life between 1999 and 2009, with much of the book centred on how Fox got into campaigning for <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> On March 31, 2009, Fox appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with Mehmet Oz to publicly discuss his condition as well as his book, his family and his prime-time special which aired May 7, 2009, (Michael J. Fox: Adventures of an Incurable Optimist).|$|E
500|$|Affleck is a {{supporter}} of the A-T Children's Project. While filming Forces of Nature in 1998, Affleck befriended ten-year-old Joe Kindregan (1988–2015), who had the rare disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), and his family. He became actively involved in fundraising for A-T, and he and Kindregan testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education in 2001, asking senators to support <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> and to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health. In 2007, Affleck was the keynote speaker at Kindregan's high school graduation ceremony in Fairfax, Virginia. Kindregan appeared as an extra in Argo (2012). In 2013, in celebration of Kindregan's 25th birthday and [...] "15 years of friendship with Joe and his family," [...] Affleck and Garner matched donations made to the A-T Children's Project. Affleck appeared in CinemAbility (2013), a documentary film which explores Hollywood's portrayals of people with disabilities.|$|E
500|$|The United States Catechism for Adults devotes {{a section}} to in vitro fertilization, <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> and cloning in its {{explanation}} of the fifth commandment, because these often involve the destruction of human embryos, {{considered to be a}} gravely sinful form of murder. Embryonic stem cell research is called [...] "an immoral means to a good end" [...] and [...] "morally unacceptable." [...] Citing the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's Instruction on Respect for Human Life in its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation, the US Bishops quote: [...] "No objective, even though noble in itself, such as a foreseeable advantage to science, to other human beings, or to society, can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses, whether viable or not, either inside or outside the mother's body." [...] The Bishops note that adult stem cell research, using cells obtained with informed consent, is a promising field of research that is morally acceptable.|$|E
500|$|On May 3, Gilmore {{participated in}} the first {{televised}} GOP debate featured on MSNBC at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. The first question he received regarded the Iraq War, which he defended, stating that it represented the [...] "entire Middle East issue" [...] which he described as a [...] "fundamental problem" [...] that he connected to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. During an exchange with California Representative Duncan Hunter, Gilmore expressed the responsibility to capture Osama bin Laden and to fight terrorism with the help from allies and to use diplomacy to end the [...] "sea of hostility" [...] that he believed existed from [...] "Morocco, {{all the way through}} the Middle East, [...] all the way to the Philippines." [...] Later in the debate, he announced his disagreement with a possible constitutional amendment to give naturalized citizens such as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the ability to run for president. On abortion, Gilmore confirmed his support for a woman's right to an abortion in the first eight to twelve weeks of pregnancy, but commented that he operated as a pro-life governor. He affirmed his opposition to <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> At the end of the debate, Gilmore asserted his attributes as a [...] "consistent Conservative" [...] while surprising many when he stated that he would not pardon Scooter Libby. He established his opposition to a National Identification Card, and highlighted the need to be [...] "vigorous on the war on terror", focus on homeland security, and become energy independent in the next presidency.|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{supports}} <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> generically, {{as evidenced}} by his authoring the Cures Can Be Found Act of 2007 (H.R. 457; H.R. 3444 in 2005), a bill [...] "to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide credits against income tax for qualified stem cell research, the storage of qualified stem cells, and the donation of umbilical cord blood". However, Paul believes {{the debate over the}} embryonic category of <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> is another divisive issue over which the federal government has no jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|Wyden {{voted for}} the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, which would change federal law to allow federal money to fund {{embryonic}} <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> ending a federal ban. Wyden urged President George W. Bush to sign it, stating that [...] "I {{see no reason why}} embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> should be treated any differently than other research" [...] in terms of federal grant funding. Bush vetoed the act twice. In 2007, Wyden, with fellow Oregon Senator Gordon Smith, again supported the bill.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, he {{publicly}} {{spoke out}} against taxpayer-funded embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> that involves the cloning and destruction of human embryos. In March 2005, he condemned {{the outcome of the}} Terri Schiavo case, referring to Schiavo's death as [...] "state-sanctioned murder".|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{reports that}} some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members {{that it would}} be a sin to vote for a {{candidate}} like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> What is your reaction to that? ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. John Green of University of Akron, [...] "There isn't a Catholic vote anymore; {{there are}} several Catholic votes." [...] A survey {{conducted}} by the Gallup organization in 2009 revealed that, despite the opposition of the Church to abortion and embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> there is {{no significant difference between the}} opinions of Catholics and non-Catholics on these questions.|$|E
2500|$|During his 2002 campaign, Romney had {{expressed}} broad support for {{embryonic stem cell}} research, {{and said he would}} lobby President Bush (who the year before had banned most federal funding for such research) to support it. [...] In particular, Romney stated that he supported the use of surplus embryos from fertility clinics for <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research.</b> [...] In early 2005, Romney announced his position on therapeutic cloning for the first time, saying he was against it, but was still in favor of research on unused embryos from fertility treatments. [...] Per this stance, he vetoed a Massachusetts bill to fund <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> because the legislation allowed such cloning of human embryos. [...] "I am not in favor of creating new human embryos through cloning," [...] said Romney, calling the practice [...] "a matter of profound moral and ethical consequence". Romney also opposed the legislation because of its assertion that life does not begin until an embryo is implanted in a uterus. [...] "It is very conceivable that scientific advances will allow an embryo to be grown for a substantial period of time outside the uterus," [...] Romney {{said in an interview with}} the Boston Globe. [...] "To say that it is not life at one month or two months or four months or full term, just because it had never been in a uterus, would be absurd." [...] The state legislature overrode Romney's veto, with many legislators feeling that <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> will be important in the future to the state's biotech industry.|$|E
2500|$|The 2012 Synod of Bishops meeting {{focused on}} [...] "The New Evangelization". In written {{comments}} to the synod, Burke criticized [...] "antinomianism"- the belief that grace exempts Christians from obedience to moral law, stating that it is [...] "among the most serious wounds of society today," [...] and {{is responsible for the}} legalization of [...] "intrinsically evil" [...] actions such as abortion, embryonic <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research,</b> euthanasia, and same-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The Council opposes legalized abortion, <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> which {{involves}} {{the destruction of}} human embryos [...] and funding thereof (instead advocating research using adult stem cells), legal recognition of same-sex domestic partnerships {{in the form of}} marriage or civil unions, and all forms of gambling. The Council has questioned whether humans are mainly or completely responsible for climate change, and has opposed other evangelicals who have affirmed their belief in global warming.|$|E
2500|$|When Sheryl Crow, an {{embryonic}} <b>stem-cell</b> <b>research</b> advocate, {{was scheduled}} to perform at a benefit concert for the Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Burke stated that to have the hospital host Crow would give [...] "the impression that the Church is somehow inconsistent in its teaching."
