5000|$|The <b>sabre</b> <b>saw</b> (also saber saw) is a {{hand-held}} powered reciprocating saw. It is similar to, but larger than, a jigsaw. The <b>sabre</b> <b>saw</b> uses a toothed blade, chiefly {{to cut through}} wood and other soft materials. The term 'sabre saw' is occasionally also {{used to refer to}} Sawzall style hand-held reciprocating saws.|$|E

5000|$|The SSSR and Germany {{dominated}} the championships, especially in foil and <b>sabre.</b> Épée <b>saw</b> several surprises, notably {{the victory of}} Spain's Manuel Pereira, who had never placed in the Top 8 of an international tournament before, and who never reached that level again. Women's épée was still a young weapon, allowed by the FIE at the 1988 World Criterium as a demonstration event. It made its first official apparition in Denver. An outsider, Switzerland's Anja Straub, prevailed over Germany's Ute Schäper and Italy's Annalisa Coltorti, while the women's team event saw {{the beginning of the}} Hungarian domination.|$|R
5000|$|IPW:UK's second show of 2008 {{took place}} on 27 January and <b>saw</b> <b>Sabre</b> make his debut in Orpington, which is {{considered}} by many as the home of IPW.

50|$|The <b>sabre</b> <b>saw</b> {{extensive}} military use in {{the early}} 19th century, particularly in the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoleon used heavy cavalry charges to great effect against his enemies. Shorter versions of the sabre were also used as sidearms by dismounted units, although these were gradually replaced by fascine knives and sword bayonets as the century went on. Although there was extensive debate over the effectiveness of weapons such as the sabre and lance, the sabre remained the standard weapon of cavalry for mounted action in most armies until World War I. Thereafter it was gradually relegated {{to the status of}} a ceremonial weapon, and most horse cavalry was replaced by armoured cavalry from 1930 on.|$|E
5000|$|Publisher Dean Mullaney {{recalled}} in 2008, ...Back then all we needed were fans starved for something good, and storeowners {{willing to pay}} up front {{in order to get}} new comics to sell. I also published a Sabre poster in December 1977, partially to appease people for the delay in the graphic album, but also to generate more working capital. Then I with Phil Seuling, the only distributor to the comics market at the time. Phil put his reaction to my pitch on paper and handed it to me: a cartoon of Phil's head, hair standing straight up, saying, '$5.00 sic for a comic book!!!!' ... He agreed to take 200 copies and sent a solicitation out to his stores. A short time later, I got a call from Phil telling me to get over to his office. I thought he wanted his money back, but as it turned out, the reaction to his solicitation was so good that he wanted to double his order. Before <b>Sabre</b> <b>saw</b> print, Phil had upped his order several more times, and based on the strength of his continuing orders, we went into a second printing!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} <b>Sabres</b> {{first season}} <b>saw</b> the {{departure}} of some key players.

Forward Ben Moss along with defenders Toni Brook and Louisa Bellis also departed the team after completing their final year at the university.|$|R

After playing in 64 games in his first full season for the club in 1991-92, he {{registered}} career highs in goals (46), assists (43), and points (89) in 1992-93.

He was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in January 1998 and a little over a month later was sent to the Buffalo <b>Sabres.</b> He <b>saw</b> the most playoff action of his career during his three seasons with Buffalo, making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1998-99.|$|R
2500|$|The British 1796 Heavy Cavalry Trooper's Sword was {{a direct}} copy of the Austrian pallasch sword pattern of 1769 for heavy cavalry (it later {{received}} an iron scabbard (1775), in which form it {{was adopted by the}} British). John Le Marchant, a cavalry officer who designed the curved 1796 pattern light cavalry <b>sabre,</b> undoubtedly <b>saw</b> the Austrian weapon in use during the Low Countries Campaign of 1793-95, when he also made many drawings of Austrian cavalry equipment. [...] His initial intention was that his own sword design should be adopted by all the cavalry; however, this was denied by the decision of the board of general officers to arm the heavy cavalry with a straight sword. It is probable, once a straight sword had been decided upon, that he then suggested the Austrian sword as a model.|$|R

60|$|Three Uhlans were at {{the mouth}} of the main street, their horses tethered, and they gossiping together, each with a pipe as long as my <b>sabre.</b> I <b>saw</b> them well in the light of an open door, but of me they could have seen only the flash of Violette's grey side and the black flutter of my cloak. A moment later I flew through a stream of them rushing from an open gateway. Violette's {{shoulder}} sent one of them reeling, and I stabbed at another but missed him. Pang, pang, went two carbines, but I had flown round the curve of the street, and never so much as heard the hiss of the balls. Ah, we were great, both Violette and I. She lay down to it like a coursed hare, the fire flying from her hoofs. I stood in my stirrups and brandished my sword. Someone sprang for my bridle. I sliced him through the arm, and I heard him howling behind me. Two horsemen closed upon me. I cut one down and outpaced the other. A minute later I was clear of the town, and flying down a broad white road with the black poplars on either side. For a time I heard the rattle of hoofs behind me, but they died and died until I could not tell them from the throbbing of my own heart. Soon I pulled up and listened, but all was silent. They had given up the chase.|$|R
