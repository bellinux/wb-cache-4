If located next to a differential or transaxle, waste heat from the brakes may overheat the differential or vice versa, particularly in hard use, such as motor racing.

50|$|Although not {{necessarily}} sharing any general <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics,</b> these designs all share a certain structural benefit. Because the connecting links are so short, the floating link {{comes in the}} form of a rigid rear triangle big enough to encompass the rear wheel. This allows the rear triangle on both sides of the wheel to be rigidly connected together as one piece, before attaching to the connecting links of the four-bar. This significantly increases lateral and torsional stiffness of the rear, often a weakness of four-bar designs, and reduces the load on the pivots, connecting links and joint between rear axle and frame.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a simulation study into effects of compliant (flexible) components (such as the engine subframe {{and the lower}} control arm) and their deflections {{on the characteristics of}} a vehicle experiencing steering drift during straight-line braking. The vehicle front and rear suspension are modelled using multi-body dynamic analysis software. The front suspension model represents theMacPherson strut design of the vehicle and includes a rack and pinion steering system, brake system, engine subframe, and a powertrain unit. The model has been analysed under two steering control methods: fixed and free control. <b>Suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> and the effect of deflections arising from the subframe and the lower control arm on these <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> have been analysed. The simulations confirmed that variation of component stiffness and interactions within components give rise to side-to-side deflections that could affect lateral drift during braking. It is concluded that side-to-side variation of <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> can have a detrimental effect on lateral drift during braking and that compliant components whose stiffness varies from side to side can cause different side-to-side deflections that can induce and influence variation in <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as toe steer angle that can lead the vehicle during braking...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of suitable ethanol-based suspensions, using polyelectrolytes, for the controlled shaping of functionally graded Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 materials by means of electrophoretic deposition. Literature reports mainly focus on the relationship between the optimum amount of charging agent, the suspension stability and the electrophoretic deposition behaviour. However, due to the complexity of physical and chemical phenomena involved, a general rule cannot be established. Aqueous suspensions of Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 powders, stabilized with a polyelectrolyte are well understood. Because aqueous suspensions present some limitations in the EPD process, due to the electrolysis of water at higher voltages, an organic environmentally friendly solvent with high dielectric constant is investigated. The minimum amount and type of charging agent and polyelectrolyte as well as their addition sequence is investigated by means of zeta potential measurements. The usefulness of the investigated suspensions is evaluated by shaping symmetrically graded alumina-zirconia discs, using a macroscopic model for the EPD process that allows to predict the final gradient in the sintered disc based on the powder <b>characteristic,</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristic</b> and experimental EPD, parameters. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Heavy {{off-road}} vehicle suspension systems face unique challenges. The ride comfort versus handling compromise in these vehicles has been frequently investigated using mathematical optimisation. Further challenges exist {{due to the}} large variations in vehicle sprung mass. A passive suspension system can only provide optimal isolation at a single payload. The designer of such a suspension system must therefore make a compromise between designing for a fully-laden or unladen payload state. This work deals with suspension optimisation for vehicle structural life. The paper mainly addresses two questions: (1) What are the <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> required to ensure optimal isolation of the vehicle structure from road loads? and (2) If such optimal <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be found, how sensitive are they to changes in vehicle payload? The study aims {{to answer these questions}} by examining a Land Rover Defender 110 as test vehicle. An experimentally validated non-linear seven degree-of-freedom mathematical model of the test vehicle is constructed for the use in sensitivity studies. Mathematical optimisation is performed using the model in order to find the <b>suspension</b> <b>characteristics</b> for optimal structural life for the vehicle under consideration. Sensitivity studies are conducted to determine the robustness of the optimal characteristics and their sensitivity to vehicle payload variation. Recommendations are made for suspension characteristic selection for optimal structural life. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|In many European towns, {{the demand}} for fast and {{efficient}} mobility is frequently satisfied by means of two-wheeled vehicles. The improvement of comfort of two-wheeled vehicles used by tired and busy workers can increase safety in ground transport. Nowadays, multibody codes {{make it possible to}} predict the ride comfort of two-wheeled vehicles by means of time-domain or frequency-domain simulations. Comfort indices can be developed by post-processing the results of numerical simulations. This task is difficult, because the indices should depend on vehicle characteristics and should be independent of road quality and vehicle speed. Poor quality roads may generate nonlinear effects. Speed influences the trim of the vehicle and the wheelbase filtering, which takes place because the same road unevenness excites the front and rear wheel with a time delay which depends on the vehicles speed. In this paper, the comfort of two-wheeled vehicles is studied by means of a frequency-domain approach. The wheelbase filtering is averaged considering typical missions of the vehicle. The missions are journeys with a forward speed that assumes different values according to a probability density function. Indices of comfort are calculated taking into account the human sensitivity. The examples show that the proposed comfort indices depend on <b>suspensions</b> <b>characteristics</b> and, hence, are useful design tools. Finally, some time-domain calculations are carried out to give emphasis to nonlinear effects and to show the limits of the frequency-domain analysis...|$|R

Firstly, an experimental investigation was carried out at pilot scale and a phenomenological model was implemented.

In operating continuous crystallizers the main objectives are to assure a high purity and a suitable size distribution of the crystal product. An efficient control strategy cannot be applied unless reliable methods for measuring the crystal size distribution (CSD) are available. Many attempts have already been made to measure the crystal size distribution on-line. However, even though some of the proposed measuring techniques have proved to work successfully on laboratory scale, their transfer to industrial scale still appears troublesome.
