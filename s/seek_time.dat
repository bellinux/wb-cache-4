5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
25|$|Large {{databases}} {{have historically}} been kept on disk drives. The time to read a record on a disk drive far exceeds {{the time needed to}} compare keys once the record is available. The time to read a record from a disk drive involves a <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> and a rotational delay. The <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> may be 0 to 20 or more milliseconds, and the rotational delay averages about half the rotation period. For a 7200 RPM drive, the rotation period is 8.33 milliseconds. For a drive such as the Seagate ST3500320NS, the track-to-track <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> is 0.8 milliseconds and the average reading <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> is 8.5 milliseconds. For simplicity, assume reading from disk takes about 10 milliseconds.|$|E

Logic Pro and Express share many functions {{and the same}} interface. Logic Express is limited to two-channel stereo mixdown, while Logic Pro can handle multichannel surround sound. Both can handle up to 255 audio tracks, depending on system performance (CPU and hard disk throughput and <b>seek</b> <b>time).</b> Logic Pro can work with MIDI keyboards and control surfaces for input and processing, and for MIDI output. It features real-time scoring in musical notation, supporting guitar tablature, chord abbreviations and drum notation.|$|E

25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost {{is that a}} {{flash memory}} (e.g. a USB flash drive or an SSD) have a much faster <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 {{enables the use of}} up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and Firewire (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Seek</b> <b>time</b> is {{a measure}} of how long it takes the head {{assembly}} to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. The first HDD had an average <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> of about 600ms;. [...] Some early PC drives used a stepper motor to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80–120ms, but this was quickly improved by voice coil type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20ms. <b>Seek</b> <b>time</b> has continued to improve slowly over time. [...] The fastest server drives today have a <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> around 4 ms. The average <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> is strictly the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.|$|E

2500|$|At Shoshinkai of 1995, Nintendo {{announced}} its {{development of the}} complementary 64DD, a rewritable magnetic disk based peripheral with several times faster transfer rates and <b>seek</b> <b>time</b> than competing CD-ROM consoles. [...] In 1997, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, [...] "CD {{holds a lot of}} data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [...] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres. ... I think we’ll make the game on a cartridge first, then ... finish it up as a full-out 64DD game." [...] Many Nintendo 64 games were developed in a way that depended upon or were expanded by that device. [...] However, after the device's launch had been delayed several years until 1999 and restricted to Japan, it was discontinued early as a commercial failure.|$|E

50|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the disks and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, increasing density has become the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Areal density (the number of bits that {{can be stored in}} a certain area of the disk) has been increased over time by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk, and the number of sectors per track. The latter will increase the {{data transfer}} rate for a given RPM speed. Improvement of {{data transfer rate}} performance is correlated to the areal density only by increasing a track's linear surface bit density (sectors per track). Simply increasing the number of tracks on a disk can affect <b>seek</b> <b>times</b> but not gross transfer rates. According to industry observers and analysts for 2011 to 2016, “The current roadmap predicts no more than a 20%/yr improvement in bit density”. <b>Seek</b> <b>times</b> have not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.|$|R
