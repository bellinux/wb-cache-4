5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E

30|$|Responding {{adequately}} {{to global}} <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> {{is a challenge}} for a world society where national interests, different cultures, and lack of adequate concepts conflict {{with the need to}} find common answers to global challenges. Governance of <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> requires strategies that address the complexity, scientific uncertainty, and sociopolitical ambiguity of the relationships underlying them. However, national as well as international attempts to address <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> have not used much of what has been accomplished in complexity science {{over the last two decades}} (Bloesch et al. 2015). In the end, risk management and communication need to address key properties of <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> that we have outlined, and develop appropriate instruments and institutions to deal with global, interconnected, stochastic, and nonlinear risks.|$|R
40|$|<b>Systemic</b> <b>risks</b> are {{a product}} of {{profound}} and rapid technological, economic and social changes that the modern world experiences every day. They are characterised by high complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity, and ripple effects. Due to these characters <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> are overextending established risk management and creating new, unsolved challenges for policy making in risk governance. Their negative effects are often pervasive, impacting fields beyond the obvious primary areas of harm. The article relates to an integrative risk concept including evaluation criteria, different risk classes and corresponding management strategies for the handling of <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b> We argue that a deliberative approach is needed for risk management and policy making in risk governance to prevent, mitigate or control <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b> URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 060133...|$|R

25|$|The European System of Financial Supervision is an {{institutional}} {{architecture of the}} EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the crisis two {{solutions}} have been proposed. One, repeatedly supported over the long term by the GAO and others is to consolidate the U.S. financial industry regulators. A step along this line has been the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to address <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> issues that have in the past, as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above, fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators. Proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have also been made.|$|E

30|$|Until this day, we lack an {{adequate}} {{understanding of the}} structure and dynamics of <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b> The lack of a well-defined event space and sufficiently defined preferences impedes the application of conventional risk assessment methods, based on the combination of probability distributions and utility functions. This raises significant empirical, mathematical, and logical issues (Jaeger 2016), but as mentioned in the introduction, with this article {{we did not want}} to address the important and thorny issue of preference formation in the face of <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b> The relevant preferences will need to transcend national interests without negating them. How this can be achieved is one of the great open questions of our times. What our inquiry into causal mechanisms involved in <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> does show, however, is that a framework where a single idealized agent optimizes the expected value of actions with uncertain outcomes will be insufficient to tackle <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Act {{changes the}} {{existing}} regulatory structure, {{by creating a}} number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> amending the Federal Reserve Act, promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded bailouts of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession. The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how {{institutional}} {{factors and}} <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> (driven by macroeconomic conditions) prevalent in emerging economies may impact market discipline among banks (traditionally understood as market responses to bank fundamentals). First, we discuss how certain institutional features of emerging economies (underdeveloped capital markets, pervasive government ownership of banks, greater guarantees, inadequate disclosure and transparency) may affect market responses to bank risk. Second, using the recent Argentine crisis as an illustration, {{we argue that}} <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> may exert an overwhelming impact on market behavior, overshadowing {{the link between the}} latter and bank fundamentals. Thus, market discipline, while missing in the traditional sense, may be indeed quite robust once <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> are factored in. We conclude that in emerging economies the analysis of market discipline should take into account the importance of institutional and systemic factors. ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> {{refers to}} the risk of {{instability}} across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company. Such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity. Organizations such as the National Bureau of Economic Research and the European Central Bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector, and following the failure of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998 there was widespread concern about the potential for <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties. (As it happens, no financial assistance was provided to LTCM by the US Federal Reserve, so there was no direct cost to US taxpayers, but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{concern is}} the size of the CDS market. Because naked credit default swaps are synthetic, there is no limit to how many can be sold. The gross amount of CDSs far exceeds all “real” {{corporate}} bonds and loans outstanding. [...] As a result, the risk of default is magnified leading to concerns about <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, counterparties became {{subject to}} a risk of default, amplified with the involvement of Lehman Brothers and AIG in {{a very large number}} of CDS transactions. [...] This is an example of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> risk which threatens an entire market, and a number of commentators have argued that size and deregulation of the CDS market have increased this risk.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{although}} {{hedge funds}} {{go to great}} lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward, inevitably a number of risks remain. <b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is increased in a crisis if there is [...] "herd" [...] behaviour, which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades. In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy. [...] The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. [...] The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> and {{financial}} dollarization on real interest rates in emerging economies. Higher <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> induce both higher real interest rates and increased dollarization. Using appropriate instru-ments for the dollarization ratio, the study overcomes the simultaneous equation problem and correctly estimates a negative coefficient for the dollarization ratio in the interest rate equation. It confirms the theoretical prediction that a strat-egy of “dedollarizing ” the economy will raise the equilibrium domestic real interest rate if the strategy fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks. Even so, it also finds that this effect is small, after controlling for the risks of dilution and default. The results bring to light the systemic-risk reasons for high interest rates in emerging economies—and contribute to evaluating the difficulties of dedollarization policies.
