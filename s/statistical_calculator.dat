Identification of factors leading to poor clinical skill development in undergraduate medical students. Settings and Design. This is an observational study. Methods and Material. The study population comprised the undergraduate students and teachers of the Department of Medicine. All were provided with structured questionnaires who responded anonymously which were then interpreted {{with the help of}} software <b>statistical</b> <b>calculator.</b> Results. Of the 145 students, only 57 (39. 3 %) actually attended medicine ward. The major factors that the students reported were large groups of students around a patient (94. 74 %[*][*]± 4. 67), inadequacy of information in books of clinical medicine (78. 9 %[*][*]± 8. 53), overcrowded unclean wards (73. 7 %[*][*]± 9. 2), lack of practice of clinical methods at home (50. 8 %[*][*]± 10. 4), and timing of classes (42. 1 %[*][*]± 10. 3).

40|$|Background: Infection {{with human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 and its end stage, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the major public health challenge of modern time. A variety of exogenously acquired infectious agents appear to influence the pace of HIV replication, the destruction of CD 4 + T cells, and HIV transmission to infants and sexual partners. More persistent elevations in plasma HIV levels have been seen in patients with chronic infections (such as those with tuberculosis and herpes and hepatitis viruses), and such co-infected patients have a more rapid loss of CD 4 + T cells and an increased rate of progression to AIDS and death. Within India, variable co-infection rates have been reported from region to region. With the above background, {{the present study was}} undertaken to study the seroprevalence of hepatotropic viruses (Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus) in HIV-positive individuals attending the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in Mayo hospital of Nagpur city, Maharashtra, India. Methods: The current prospective study was conducted in the department of microbiology, Indira Gandhi government medical college and Mayo general hospital, Nagpur (Maharashtra) from August 2005 to August 2007. All the patients attending ICTC were included in the study. 300 HIV negative matched controls were also included in the study. All the individuals who were positive for HIV infection were selected for this study and further tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibodies. Data was compiled in MS excel. Then it was analyzed using online <b>statistical</b> <b>calculator</b> and chi square test were applied with value of P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant for interpretation of finding. Results: Maximum numbers of HIV positive patients (38. 8 %) were in age group of 31 - 40 years. Present study showed male preponderance in HIV positive patients. Males showed a slightly high seroprevalence of HBsAg (9. 21 %) compared to females (7. 57 %) among HIV positive patients. The difference in positivity of two viral agents studied in HIV positive patients was highly significant as compared to HIV-negative individuals (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: On the basis of the findings that the co-infection of hepatotropic viruses (HBV and HCV) were significantly higher in HIV positive cases than controls, the study concludes that the chronic viral hepatitis is a serious concern in HIV-infected patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure the screening of the same in HIV-infected patients. [Int J Res Med Sci 2015; 3 (3. 000) : 543 - 550...|$|E

40|$|There is {{substantial}} {{interest in the}} field of applied deposition modeling to predict the position a sprayed or spread pesticide will land. Modeling is pursued because it allows multiple scenarios to be run relatively quickly and at low cost. Though modeling will never replace data collection, its use as an analytical tool in training, planning, regulation and post-spray analysis is apparent. However, various types of models are utilized and it is critical for the user community to be familiar with the available tools {{and to be able to}} recognize the limitations of the various modeling approaches. Deposition modeling of pesticide sprays presents a substantial challenge in detail. The position of deposition of a sprayed material is critically dependent on the drop size distribution of the released material but atomization remains a very difficult problem to model generically. Most of the models therefore depend on look-up tables, user input, or based on more recent work, <b>statistical</b> <b>calculators</b> for drop size input. Beyond the nozzle, the releasing vehicle may have an important effect on the position of droplets. Finally, transport through the atmosphere beyond the effects of the release mechanism and machinery must be addressed.

40|$|Calculators {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} required tools at home, school and work, however, people with disabilities may have difficulty using standard calculators. Buttons on most calculators are smooth, and offer few or no tactile clues to allow a person with a visual impairment to orient him or herself to the keypad. People with visual impairments may not be able to see the appropriate buttons. Modern calculators generally have an LCD output screen, but these are often difficult to see as character size is generally small, and the contrast between the numerals and background is low. People with mobility impairments or tremor are often unable to touch individual buttons accurately on compact calculators with small buttons. Calculators may perform basic calculations or be suitable for statistical, scientific, or financial calculations. Scientific calculators compute logarithms, sine, cosine, tangent, pi, square root, and exponents. Algebraic calculators and graphing calculators can simplify algebraic expressions; differentiate, integrate, and plot functions; solve equations; and manipulate matrices. <b>Statistical</b> <b>calculators</b> compute <b>statistical</b> equations, including means, variances, covariance, and correlation and regression coefficients. Financial calculators compute present value and internal-rate-of-return, depreciation, and schedules such as amortization and future value. Use requirements vary from simple direct keystroke calculation to complex multi-keystroke combinations. Calculators are available with features that range from simple to complex, and which are offered in a variety of combinations. Features include adjustable angle display, large numbers, large buttons, printing capability in black or color and speech output in a range of voices.

40|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century {{statistical}} methods have increasingly become part of experimental research. In particular, statistics has made quantification processes meaningful in the soft sciences, which had traditionally relied on activities such as collecting and describing diversity rather than timing variation. The thesis explores this change in relation to agriculture and biology, focusing on analysis of variance and experimental design, the statistical methods developed by the mathematician and geneticist Ronald Aylmer Fisher during the 1920 s. The role that Fisher’s methods acquired as tools of scientific research, {{side by side with}} the laboratory equipment and the field practices adopted by research workers, is here investigated bottom-up, beginning with the computing instruments and the information technologies that were the tools of the trade for statisticians. Four case studies show under several perspectives the interaction of statistics, computing and information technologies, giving on the one hand an overview of the main tools – mechanical <b>calculators,</b> <b>statistical</b> tables, punched and index cards, standardised forms, digital computers – adopted in the period, and on the other pointing out how these tools complemented each other and were instrumental for the development and dissemination of analysis of variance and experimental design.

40|$|Abstract: Graphic calculators were {{introduced}} into the Malaysian New Curriculum for Secondary Schools to {{enhance the quality of}} teaching and learning of mathematics in the classrooms. This is also in line with its new revised curriculum. A number of schools were selected to receive graphic calculators (TI- 83 Plus) to be incorporated into the teaching of mathematics and science subjects. A project on exploration of graphing calculators has been carried out at a rural school. The students involved were in Form 4 (16 years old) at the secondary school. They come from low income families and have limited access to the new technology. Because of that, their interests in mathematics are questionable and they thought mathematics is a very difficult subject in school. Two topics (Statistics and Straight Line) from the syllabus of their mathematics curriculum were chosen. In addition to the traditional way of teaching, the students were also exposed to the graphic calculators to help them understand mathematical concepts. Their perception after learning the topics were noted before and after using the graphic calculators to see whether their interest has changed due to the usage of graphic calculators. Their preferences towards the topics in the syllabus were also noted to see whether graphic calculators could change their preferences on certain topics. At the end of their learning process, a test was given to this group of students and their scores were compared to the control group (not exposed to graphing <b>calculators).</b> <b>Statistical</b> analyses show that their interest in the Statistic topic have been altered by the usage of graphic calculators. There is also a tendency for certain topics to be preferred over others due to graphic calculators. The t-tes...|$|R
