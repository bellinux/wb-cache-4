Seven concrete mixes with water/cement (w/c) ratios ranging from 0 - 35 to 0 - 45 and fine/total (F/T) aggregate ratios ranging from 0 - 40 to 0 - 60 were designed and 42 batches of concrete containing different dosages of <b>superplasticiser</b> were produced. The workability, passing and filling abilities, and segregation stability of the concrete produced were measured using the slump flow, U-box, and sieve segregation tests respectively. For each concrete mix designed, the <b>superplasticiser</b> dosages for maximum slump flow without segregation and maximum filling height were determined. It was found that the maximum performance of the concrete mix and the respective required <b>superplasticiser</b> dosage are dependent on the w/c and F/T aggregate ratios. In general, increasing the F/T aggregate ratio would improve the maximum performance but would also increase the <b>superplasticiser</b> dosage needed. Lastly, the robustness of each concrete mix was evaluated quantita-tively as the range of <b>superplasticiser</b> dosage or slump flow satisfying all requirements for SCC Based on these results, the optimum <b>superplasticiser</b> dosage for maximum robustness of each concrete mix was determined. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Superplasticisers are used to improve the flow properties of fresh cement and offer undoubted benefits to the construction sector. There is concern in the nuclear industry, however, that organic additives may increase the solubility of radionuclides when in contact with cementitious grouts or backfill. The research presented in this thesis describes {{the effect of a}} commercial polycarboxylated poly ether comb type <b>superplasticiser</b> on the behaviour of U (VI), Th (IV), Eu (III) and Ni (II) in blended cements. Both Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) and Pulverised Fly Ash (PFA) blends with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) were investigated. Solubility experiments approached from oversaturation were conducted in a range of high pH aqueous solutions that are representative of the respective cement pore waters. Results show that the as received <b>superplasticiser</b> is responsible for an increase in solubility of all the metals investigated, however, the extent of solubility enhancement is dependent on the metal investigated {{and the nature of the}} high pH solution. U (VI) and Eu (III) display solubility enhancement over several orders of magnitude while Ni (II) and Th (IV) solubility is enhanced to a lesser extent. Batch experiments of Ni (II) and Eu (III) uptake onto BFS:OPC and PFA:OPC cement were investigated from two view points i. 	By regarding the <b>superplasticiser</b> as a ligand where batch experiments of metal uptake on crushed cement are carried out with increasing concentrations of free <b>superplasticiser</b> in solution. ii. 	By investigating metal uptake in cements prepared with <b>superplasticiser</b> already present. Results of the batch experiments show that the presence of free <b>superplasticiser</b> in solution reduces uptake of Ni (II) and Eu (III) by both BFS:OPC and PFA:OPC. Further, metal bound in the presence of free <b>superplasticiser</b> is readily remobilised on exposure to fresh cement solution.

The main objectives of the project were to investigate the effects of <b>Superplasticisers</b> on structural concrete with the addition of short-fibres, which vary from the most commonly used steel fibres, to polypropylene and fibre mesh. The behaviours of <b>Superplasticisers</b> on plain and fibre-reinforced concrete are compared. Lastly, data for the fresh and harden properties of the concrete were collected and analysed. The scope of this project is based on the usage of <b>Superplasticisers</b> in steel short-fibres, fibre mesh and polypropylene short-fibres. To evaluate the effects of <b>Superplasticisers</b> on the workability of fresh short-fibre reinforced concrete, several tests were carried out.

The underlying mechanisms that account for the action of <b>superplasticisers</b> are nowadays not well understood. The increasing variety of <b>superplasticisers</b> currently {{on the market and}} the complexity of cementitious systems do not help alleviate incompatibilities and unexpected problems.

Additives {{are used in the}} cementitious wastes to further enhance them for example <b>superplasticisers</b> are used in general cement industry to increase fluidity, resulting in large reductions of water required for mixing, giving high early strength development, a decrease in permeability and ultimately significant reduction in costs. However <b>superplasticisers</b> contain molecules that can complex insoluble radioelements such as plutonium and uranium increasing their solubility and in turn mobility. This can be problematic while the cementitious wastes are stored. The standard storage conditions in the UK are that a cement is stored in a steel canister, then a backfill cement such as NRVB (Nirex Reference Vault Backfill cement) is poured over this cement, allowed to set after which the container is sealed. These conditions expose the waste forms to potential contact with ground water in the event of damage to the container. It is therefore important to study the leaching behaviour of these cementitious waste forms and simulate any resultant degradation that would occur over the very long durations they are expected to be stored.

Concrete and mortar admixtures are designed substances {{with the aim of}} influencing their fresh and hardened properties by their physical or chemical action. For example, in the case of fresh concrete the flow, the cohesiveness and the setting behaviour are controlled; but also the hardened concrete properties such as strength, impermeability, shrinkage, or freeze thaw resistance can be positively influenced by the use of a concrete admixture. The general trend towards "green " buildings and sustainability leads to a demand for environmental friendly construction chemicals. In addition the environmental behaviour of a newly developed chemical is usually unknown and bears public awareness and legal risks to the producer, distributor and/or buyer of the product. Therefore, understanding the movement and fate of new construction chemicals is a crucial step in state of the art risk management procedures (product stewardship). Moreover, analysing the mass flows and the risks of a chemical product enables the producer to understand the risk profile over the entire life-cycle of buildings and addressing the risks by appropriate measures. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the fate and risk of polycarboxylate (PCE) type <b>superplasticisers</b> during production and use throughout the entire life-cycle in Switzerland based on a mass flow analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Shrinkage is the {{time-dependant}} {{decrease in}} concrete volume {{compared with the}} original placement volume of concrete. Shrinkage potential of a high performance concrete {{is perhaps the most}} important consideration which affects the long-term strength and durability, and hence efforts are being made to reduce the shrinkage and shrinkage cracks. The main objective of this experimental work was to investigate the shrinkage properties of concrete made with granite powder as fine aggregate and partial replacement of cement with combination of admixtures. The granite powder, one of the byproducts in stone crushing process, not being used for any applications other than filling-up low lying areas was identified as a replacement material for river sand in concrete. Admixtures such as silica fume, fly ash, slag and <b>superplasticiser</b> have the inherent ability to contribute to continued strength development and very high durability. In the present work, concrete made with 25 % of granite powder as a replacement of sand and with 10 % of Fly ash, 10 % of ground granulated blast-furnace slag, 7. 5 % of silica fume and 1 % of <b>superplasticiser</b> as a replacement of cement were considered. The results indicated that concrete specimens produced with admixture and granite powder has lesser shrinkage parameters like maximum length of crack, minimum width of crack, total number of cracks as compared with conventional concrete specimens. The test results also indicated that the values of both plastic and drying shrinkage strains of concrete in the granite powder with admixture concrete specimens were greater than those of ordinary concrete specimens...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between the early-age hydration of cements blended with micronized zeolitite and quartzite powders. The Portland cement replacement in the mixes was 30 %, {{and the effect of}} introducing a <b>superplasticiser</b> to lower the required water to solid ratio was assessed. The cement pastes were hydrated at 40 °C and monitored in situ by time-resolved synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction combined with Rietveld quantitative phase analysis. The quantitative evolution of phase weight fractions showed that the addition of the zeolite tuff accelerated the hydration rate of the main C 3 S cement component. Blending with the quartzite powder of similar fineness did not affect the C 3 S hydration rate. Reduction of the water to solid ratio by introduction of the <b>superplasticiser</b> had a retarding effect on the hydration of the zeolitite-blended cement over the early hydra- tion period up to 3 days. The AFt or ettringite reaction products, formed promptly after the addition of water to the mixtures, underwent a crystal structural modification over the induction period up to 4 to 6 hours of reaction. The con- tinuous contraction of the c-cell parameter and expansion of the a-cell parameter towards the ideal values for AFt or ettringite reflects the structural adaptation of the AFt to the changing availability of sulphate {{over the course of the}} first hours of hydration. The observed structural changes were less pronounced in the zeolitite blended cement. This is related to the dilution of the overall sulphate content in the blended cement and highlights the need to control and optimise sulphate additions in blended cements. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{demand of}} {{concrete}} is increasing {{day by day}} for satisfying the need of development of infrastructure facilities. It is well established fact that the production of OPC not only consumes significant amount {{of natural resources and}} energy but also releases substantial quantity of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Therefore, it is essential to find alternatives to make the concrete environment friendly. Geopolymer is an inorganic alumino-silicate compound, synthesized from fly ash. The fly ash, one of the source materials for geopolymer binders, is available abundantly in India, but to date its utilization is limited. Hence it is essential to make the efforts to utilize this by-product in concrete manufacturing {{in order to make the}} concrete more environmental friendly. This paper describes the experimental work conducted by casting 20 geopolymer concrete mixes to evaluate the effect of various parameters affecting its the compressive strength in order to enhance its overall performance. Various parameters i. e. ratio of alkaline liquid to fly ash, concentration of sodium hydroxide, ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, curing time, curing temperature, dosage of <b>superplasticiser,</b> rest period and additional water content in the mix have been investigated. The test results show that compressive strength increases with increase in the curing time, curing temperature, rest period, concentration of sodium hydroxide solution and decreases with increase in the ratio of water to geopolymer solids by mass & admixture dosage, respectively. The addition of naphthalene based <b>superplasticiser</b> improves the workability of fresh geopolymer concrete. It was further observed that the water content in the geopolymer concrete mix plays significant role in achieving the desired compressive strength...|$|E
40|$|The overall solid packing see {{mix design}} method of Brouwers and Radix was {{modified}} by developing an optimisation tool, facilitating the proportioning normal weight SCCs (NWSCCs) and L WSCCs. The method comprised two concepts: filling the voids within the loosely packed aggregate fraction with appropriate paste and comparing the overall {{particle size distribution}} (PSD) of solids in the mix with the model PSD. To implement this method, the influence of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), fillers and chemical admixtures on the paste properties was investigated; moreover, physical properties and packing of normal and lightweight aggregates (L W As) were studied. The influence of two L WAs, three <b>superplasticisers</b> and three SCMs/fillers on the fresh properties and compressive strength of LWSCCs was evaluated, followed by a detailed study on L WAs and SCMs/fillers effect on engineering and durability properties of L WSCCs. The proposed mix design modification yielded highly flowable, strong and durable L WSCCs for structural precast applications. Successful LWSCCs required carefully optimised paste composition and paste/aggregate content. L W As water absorption characteristics and cement-superplasticiser compatibility strongly influenced workability and workability retention of LWSCCs. The effect of aggregate composition and aggregate/paste content on fresh, hardened and durability properties of structural NWSCCs was studied. The proposed mix design allowed manufacturing NWSCCs with moderate workability, high strength and paste content lower than typically reported. Most of NWSCCs properties correlated with the average spacing between the aggregate particles, allowing for engineering of NWSCC properties by its adjustment.

40|$|Lignosulphonates are by‐products {{from the}} {{sulphite}} pulping {{process for the}} manufacture ofspecialty dissolving pulps and paper. During the liberation of the cellulose, the lignin isfractionated and solubilised through covalent addition of sulphonic acid groups at variouspositions in the structure. The formed sulphonated lignin, lignosulphonate is then furtherisolated and refined. The amphiphilic nature of lignosulphonates has enabled them {{to be used as}} additives to varioussuspensions to improve their dispersion and stability. The by far largest utilisation oflignosulphonates is as dispersants in concrete. Here, lignosulphonates act by dispersing cementparticles to prevent flocculation, un‐even particle distribution and reduced strengthdevelopment. The dispersion is achieved through steric and electrostatic repulsion of the cementparticles by the lignosulphonate polymer. This behaviour is intimately linked with the overallsize and amount of charged groups in the dispersing polymer. Traditional modifications oflignosulphonates have been limited to removal of sugars, filtration and fractionation. Thesemodifications are not sufficient for utilisation of lignosulphonates in high‐strength concrete. Heresynthetic dispersants and <b>superplasticisers</b> are used which are considerably more efficient evenat low dosages. To compete with these, additional modifications of lignosulphonates are likely tobe necessary. The molecular weight and functional group composition have been identified anddescribed as the most interesting parameters that can be modified. Currently, no suitable method exists to increase the molecular weight of lignosulphonates. Oxidation by the natural radical initiating enzyme laccase is an interesting tool to achieve suchmodifications. In this thesis several aspects of the mechanism through which this enzyme reactswith lignin and lignosulphonate structures have been elucidated through model compoundstudies. Further studies showed that laccase alone was a highly efficient tool for increasing themolecular weight of commercial lignosulphonates at low dosages and in short incubation times. Immobilisation of the laccase to a solid support to enable re‐utilisation was also investigated. Modification of functional group composition of lignosulphonates was achieved throughozonolysis and the Fenton’s reagent, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron(II) acetate. Introduction of charged carboxylic groups was achieved through opening of the benzyl rings oflignosulphonates. It was found that a two‐stage process consisting of laccase oxidation followedby ozonolysis was an efficient technique to create a polymer enriched with carboxylic acidgroups with a sufficient molecular size. Oxidation by the Fenton’s reagent was shown to yield similar modifications as the combinedlaccase/ozonolysis treatment albeit with less pronounced results but with a large level of controlthrough variation of a number of reaction parameters. The Fenton’s reagent can therefore be aninteresting alternative to the aforementioned two‐stage treatment. These modifications are interesting for large‐scale applications not only because of theirsimplicity in terms of reaction parameters but also because of the ubiquity of the used enzymeand the chemicals in the pulp and paper industry.

40|$|Self-compacting concrete’s (SCC’s) {{particular}} {{need for}} self-compacting, i. e. {{to achieve a}} high passing and filling ability, deformability capacities and a high resistance to segregation, necessarily requires {{the reduction of the}} volume of coarse aggregate and the increase of the volume of ultrafine materials and admixtures (mainly <b>superplasticisers).</b> The increase in the volume of ultrafine materials mentioned, achieved exclusively at the cost of the cement, would have, as main effects, the significant increase of the overall cost of SCC, of its hydration heat and potential effects on properties such as shrinkage and cracking. Consequently, significant amounts of mineral additions are usually incorporated, in replacement of part of the cement to improve the workability properties, reduce the production of hydration heat and reduce the overall cost. Mainly because it needs to incorporate significant quantities of ultrafine materials (cement and mineral additions), SCC has great potential for the use of these sub-products, such as fly ash (FA), or other commercial products, such as limestone filler (LF), as partial replacement of cement. However, the use of significant quantities of mineral additions (also necessary to ensure self-compactability), with the consequent increase in the paste volume and decrease in the coarse aggregate, will alter the SCC’s microstructure and lead to a change in shrinkage and mechanical properties. It is therefore essential to investigate and demonstrate the applicability of large quantities of these additions (in both binary and ternary mixes), mainly due to the existing regulation limitations related to their use in blended cements and as direct replacement of cement in the production of concrete mixes. To this end, an experimental programme was conducted to evaluate the effect of large quantities of FA and LF in binary and ternary mixes on the mechanical properties and shrinkage of SCC. This study focuses essentially on the evaluation of compressive strength in cubic and cylindrical moulds, splitting tensile strength, the secant and dynamic elastic modulus and, finally, shrinkage. A detailed analysis of the results and their comparison with both reference values and with results of other authors is performed. For that purpose, a total of 11 SCC mixes were produced: 1 with cement (C) only; 3 with C + FA in 30, 60 and 70 % replacement by volume (fad); 3 with C + LF in 30, 60 and 70 % fad; and finally, 4 mixes with C + FA + LF in combinations of 10 – 20, 20 – 10, 20 – 40 and 40 – 20 % fad. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
