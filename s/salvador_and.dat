5|$|On June 16, 2007, {{a rematch}} was {{scheduled}} between El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Hungary, {{the latter of}} which had delivered the biggest defeat to El Salvador in the national team's history. Many of the same players that had played the match between El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Hungary in the 1982 FIFA World Cup played again at the Estadio Cuscatlán. The stadium that filled 22,000 spectators saw a match tied at 2–2 with goals from Lázár Szentes and Ferenc Csongrádi for Hungary and two goals from Luis Ramírez Zapata for El Salvador.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to making}} {{landfall}} near the El SalvadorGuatemala border as a tropical depression, the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over Nicaragua, which later spread into El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Guatemala. Many rivers {{in the region}} burst their banks after five days of rainfall, causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides. Throughout Central America, at least 1,432people were killed, {{with most of the}} fatalities occurring in El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Guatemala. Another 225deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern Mexico. In addition, Paul was responsible for moderate damage and 24fatalities in northwestern Mexico, where it made landfall at hurricane strength.|$|E
5|$|In 1529, El Salvador became {{embroiled in}} a {{jurisdictional}} dispute with neighbouring Nicaragua. Pedrarias Dávila sent Martín de Estete {{at the head of}} an expedition to annex the territory to Nicaragua. Estete captured the leader of a rival Spanish expedition in eastern El <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> marched on San Salvador, before being repulsed by a relief force sent from Guatemala. In 1530, Pedro de Alvarado ordered the establishment of a new settlement at San Miguel, in the east of the country, to protect against further incursions from Nicaragua, and to assist in the conquest of the surrounding area. Indigenous uprisings against the invaders continued, spreading from neighbouring Honduras. The general uprising across the two provinces was put down by the end of 1538, and by 1539 the province was considered pacified. The conquistadores discovered that there was little gold or silver to be found in El <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> it became a colonial backwater with a small Spanish population, within the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|The conquistadors were {{accompanied}} by a great many indigenous allies. These included Tlaxcaltecs, Mexicas, Cholutecs, Xochimilcos, Texcocanos, and Huejotzincas that accompanied Pedro de Alvarado from central Mexico, Zapotecs and Mixtecs that joined him as he marched south towards Guatemala and El <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> Kaqchikels that joined him in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|A red alert {{was also}} issued in El <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> 3,000people were evacuated; eight people {{drowned in the}} country. The Río Negro in Nicaragua washed away a bridge, and two bridges were {{destroyed}} along the Pan-American Highway. A state of emergency was issued in the country. Damage was estimated at $10million (96million pesos), and there were 11deaths. Further south in Costa Rica, the floods damaged 31bridges and caused 1,600people to evacuate. Across Central America, the rainfall caused about $40million (385million pesos) in crop damage.|$|E

5|$|Although Panama and Costa Rica {{were not}} in the direct path of Hurricane Beta, storm {{warnings}} were issued for the two countries on October27 as heavy rains, up to 20in (508mm), from the outer bands of Beta were possible. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides from the outer bands of Beta.|$|E
5|$|As the {{precursor}} to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides. Four {{people died in}} various incidents related to the system: three in El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180residents. Sandra's effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall; some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited.|$|E

5|$|During the Bahia campaign, {{high-ranking}} officers mutinied against Labatut, who {{was taken}} prisoner and {{sent back to}} Rio de Janeiro. It is unlikely that Luís Alves was involved, but his uncle, Joaquim de Lima, was almost certainly part of the conspiracy and was chosen by the officers to replace Labatut. The campaign resumed, and the Portuguese withdrew from <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> set sail back to Portugal. On 2 July, the victorious Brazilians entered the city. The Emperor's Battalion returned to Rio de Janeiro, and Luís Alves was later promoted to captain on 22 January 1824.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot up for grabs. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by El <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, El <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E

Guatemala was placed under a warning on October 24. In addition, new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 24 and 25, respectively.

5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
