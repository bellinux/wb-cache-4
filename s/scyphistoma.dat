40|$|Scyphistomae show {{different}} modes of propagation, occasionally allowing the sudden release of great numbers of medusae through strobilation leading to so-called jellyfish blooms. Accordingly, factors regulating asexual reproduction strategies will control <b>scyphistoma</b> density, which, in turn, may influence blooming potential. We studied 11 <b>scyphistoma</b> species in 6 combinations of temperature and food supply {{to test the}} effects of these factors on asexual reproduction strategies and reproduction rates. Temperature and food availability increased reproduction rates for all species and observed reproduction modes. In all cases, starvation was the most important factor constraining the asexual reproduction of scyphistomae. Differences in <b>scyphistoma</b> density were found according to the reproductive strategy adopted by each species. Different Aurelia lineages and Sanderia malayensis presented a multi-mode strategy, developing up to 5 propagation modes. These species reached the highest densities, mostly through lateral budding and stolons. Cassiopea sp., Cephea cephea, Mastigias papua and Phyllorhiza punctata adopted a mono-mode reproductive strategy, developing only free-swimming buds. Lychnorhiza lucerna, Rhizostoma pulmo and Rhopilema esculentum also presented a mono-mode strategy, but they only developed podocysts. These 3 species had the lowest reproduction rates and polyp densities; not only their reproduction rates but also the need for a 2 -fold set of environmental stimuli to produce new polyps (one for encystment, another for excystment) made this reproduction mode the slowest of those observed to be utilized for propagation. We conclude that blooms may be defined phylogenetically by the specific asexual modes each species develops, which, in turn, is regulated by environmental conditions.

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Ecohidrologia, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2015 Jellyfish blooms are {{increasingly}} being reported in coastal areas and have been related to both climate changes and anthropogenic impacts. However, several questions underlying such blooms remain understudied, particularly during their benthic phase (polyps). Salinity {{is one of the}} environmental variables that has been linked with blooms occurrence. Reports in Guadiana estuary have correlated high precipitation and high freshwater input to low medusa occurrence. Therefore, we hypothesize that using freshwater pulses from a hydrotechnical structure (Dam) could be a promising ecohydrological approach for controlling jellyfish blooms. To explore this idea, the present study aimed to assess different short term salinity concentrations effects on benthic stages and ephyrae larvae of Aurelia aurita. It also explored the feeding ecology of such stages. It had two set of experiment designs. The first set of experiments focuses on responses of scyphistomae (Experiment I, II) and ephyrae larvae (Experiment III) under low salinity treatments (3, 10, 17 and 35 (control)). The analyzed variables were survival, asexual reproduction and ecophysiological response (feeding rate and number of swimming pulses). It was found significant difference on scyphistomae survival between control and salinity 3 treatment (p-value < 0, 05); on budding reproduction, number of <b>scyphistoma</b> actively budding and feeding response between control and salinity 10; on ephyrae survival between control and salinities 3 and 10; and ephyrae swimming pulses between control and salinity 17. It did not present significant difference on the number of strobilating <b>scyphistoma</b> and produced medusa. The second set of experiments investigated diet and feeding strategy of scyphistomae (Experiment IV) and ephyrae (Experiment V). It was used Costello plot method.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} potential environmental controls of the asexual phases of reproduction by measuring the rates of asexual reproduction (budding and strobilation) and mortality in naturally occurring populations of Aurelia sp. <b>scyphistomae</b> at diVerent spatial and temporal scales. The percentage cover, density of colonies of Aurelia sp. <b>scyphistomae,</b> and density of the population of two naturally occurring colonies of Aurelia sp. <b>scyphistomae</b> were examined over 2 years in southern Tasmania. ArtiWcial substrates were also deployed to investigate colony dynamics when density dependent eVects were reduced. Clear spatial and temporal diVerences in the population dynamics of the colonies were observed. Density dependent eVects controlled budding and recruitment of new <b>scyphistomae</b> to the substrate when populations were dense and space limiting. In contrast, environmental controls of budding and strobilation were more apparent in a colony with signiWcantly greater area of bare substrate and hence room for expansion. Water temperature and rainfall (as a proxy for salinity) were linked to changes in population size. Annual and seasonal diVerences in population dynamics were not observed in a colony limited by space but were apparent in a colony where space was not limited. When space was removed as a limiting factor by deploying artiWcial substrates, a seasonal environmental eVect on the rate of growth of the colony was observed. These studies suggest that the growth, survival and reproduction of the sessile colonial phase of Aurelia sp. is regulated by a combination of density dependent factors and environmental conditions, which are consequently important to the formation of jellyWsh blooms...|$|R

30|$|Though one protein {{analysis}} {{is not enough}} to distinguish the species, at least two of them could be expected due to our data. Most of the contemporary animal groups appear {{for the first time in}} the fossil record some 545 million years ago (MYR) on the geological time scale in a relatively short period of time known as the Cambrian explosion (Benton and Harper 2009). Cnidaria could be even older for they could not leave the fossil record. Cnidaria do not disappear in the Permian extinction (~ 300 MYR) but continue their evolution. Aurelia’s complex life cycle consists of several stages including alternating generations of sexual adult-stage medusa and asexual-stage polyp (<b>scyphistoma)</b> sitting at the sea bottom. Medusas also prefer coastal waters (Naumov 1961; Tardent 1978). So, the history of the Earth coasts is important for medusa evolution. At the board of the Jurassic and Cretaceous in Mesozoic about 150 MYR ago, the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions occurs. The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic, climate and evolutionary activity, which leads to the separation of the two oceans—Atlantic and Pacific. These two groups of genus Aurelia are clearly visible both in the current research and previously published (Greenberg et al. 1996; Schroth et al. 2002). BsA also belongs to the Atlantic population.|$|E
40|$|The benthic life stage (polyp or <b>scyphistoma)</b> of the bloom-forming jellyfish, Aurelia aurita (Linnaeus, 1759), {{also known}} as the moon jellyfish, {{contributes}} to the seasonal occurrence and abundance of medusa blooms via asexual reproduction.

While the physiology of the visible medusa is largely understood, understanding of the physiology of the perennial benthic life-stage is scarce. To measure the physiological tolerance of A. aurita, the scyphistoma’s temperature sensitivity across its distributional range was investigated. Respiration rates of polyps from three northern European locations exposed to 11 temperatures between 2 and 22 °C were measured. There was a significant difference in respiration rate among the three polyp populations, which may reflect on differences in their thermal tolerance window. A critical temperature was reached at 14 °C with the metabolic rate decreasing below and above that temperature. This pattern was less pronounced in the Norwegian population but polyps were able to survive, at least temporarily, those temperatures exceeding their natural range. While polyps collected from northern Norway, with a narrow environmental thermal window, displayed a low baseline metabolism with a Q 10 value of 1. 2, polyps from southern England and Scotland had Q 10 values of 1. 6 and 2. 5, respectively.

50|$|Lychnorhiza lucerna has {{a complex}} life cycle with an {{alternation}} of sexual and asexual stages. An adult jellyfish {{is known as}} a medusa and is gonochoristic, which means that it is either male or female. The fertilized eggs hatch into planula larvae. These soon settle and undergo metamorphosis into sessile polyps, known as a <b>scyphistomae,</b> with four tentacles. These grow larger, and after a series of moults have twenty-two tentacles. They develop cysts from which new polyps known as ephyrae grow. These develop transverse constrictions and separate from the original polyp by strobilation.

Then, a subsequent induction of metamorphosis and full differentiation into ephyrae is believed to occur when the symbionts are acquired by the <b>scyphistomae.</b> Although strobilation induction and differentiation into ephyrae can be accomplished in various ways, a controlled, reproducible metamorphosis induction has not been reported. Such controlled metamorphosis induction is necessary for an ensured synchronicity and reproducibility of biological, biochemical, and molecular analyses.

Two experiments were conducted examining the effects of different levels of CO 2 and food quality (experiment 1) and the effect of food quality and quantity (experiment 2) on the growth and respiration of scyphozoan polyps.

40|$|Large {{population}} fluctuations of jellyfish occur over {{a variety}} of temporal scales, from weekly to seasonal, inter-annual and even decadal, with some {{regions of the world}} reported to be experiencing persistent seasonal bloom events. Recent jellyfish research has focussed on understanding the causes and consequences of these population changes, with the vast majority of studies considering the effect of changing environmental variables only on the pelagic medusa. But many of the bloom-forming species are members of the Scyphozoa with complex metagenic life cycles consisting of a sexually reproducing pelagic medusa and asexually reproducing benthic polyp. Recruitment success during the juvenile (planula, polyp and ephyrae) stages of the life cycle can have a major effect on the abundance of the adult (medusa) population, but until very recently, little was known about the ecology of the polyp or <b>scyphistoma</b> phase of the scyphozoan life cycle.

Both species exhibited a shared pattern of budding mode (Directly Budded Polyps: DBP; Stolonal Budded Polyps: SBP), with DBP favoured under low food supply (9. 3 μg C ind - 1 week- 1) and low temperature (14 °C), and SBP dominant under high temperature (21 °C). However, A. coerulea showed an overall higher productivity than A. relicta, in terms of budding and podocyst production rates. Further, A. coerulea exhibited a wide physiological plasticity across different temperatures and salinities as typical adaptation to ecological features of transitional coastal habitats. This may {{support the hypothesis that}} the invasion of A. coerulea across coastal habitats worldwide has been driven by shellfish aquaculture, with <b>scyphistoma</b> polyps and resting stages commonly found on bivalve shells. On the contrary, A. relicta appears to be strongly stenovalent, with cold, marine environmental optimal preferences (salinity 37 ppt, T ranging 14 - 19 °C), corroborating the hypothesis of endemicity within the highly peculiar habitat of the Mljet lake. By exposing A. relicta polyps to slightly higher temperature (21 °C), a previously unknown developmental mode was observed, by the sessile polyp regressing into a dispersive, temporarily unattached and tentacle-less, non-feeding stage. This may allow A. relicta polyps to escape climatic anomalies associated to warming of surface layers and deepening of isotherms, by moving into deeper, colder layers.

Chapter 4 reports on the effects of temperature and salinity on growth of newly released ephyrae of each of the above mentioned species, as well as the effects of starvation on survivorship on ephyrae of A. aurita originating from two distinct populations of <b>scyphistomae.</b> In Chapter 5 I provide a brief summary of significant findings for each life history stage, their theoretical implications when taken together, and next steps for future research. I also offer recommendations for ecosystem managers with an eye toward affecting the numbers of near-shore jellyfish medusae generated each season in the waters surrounding the British Isles...|$|R
40|$|Scyphozoan {{jellyfish}} are seasonally conspicuous {{in coastal}} waters, but relatively {{little is known}} about the factors that control their distribution and population dynamics. Cyanea sp is a seasonally abundant medusa in the Niantic River, Connecticut, U. S. and appears to maintain a population entirely within the estuary. To better understand the factors controlling their occurrence, we examined the temporal and spatial distribution of settled <b>scyphistomae</b> in relation to that of the medusae. Planula settlement patterns mirrored the presence of mature female medusae. The planulae settled primarily near the bottom. After settlement, planulacysts and polyps on the settlement plates were out competed by large barnacle and ascidian larvae, resulting in a sharp decline in cyst and polyp abundance. This stage-specific mortality may represent a population bottleneck in the life cycle of scyphozoans...|$|R
40|$|Stauromedusae are cnidarians {{that have}} {{attracted}} relatively little ecological study, {{especially in the}} southern hemisphere. They are Scyphozoa that develop directly from the <b>scyphistoma,</b> and each consists of a calyx and {{a more or less}} distinct aboral peduncle that attaches to the substratum by an adhesive disc. The animals are mobile on the substratum, but have no pelagic phase. The present note originates from observations made on stauromedusae living in intertidal and shallow subtidal waters at Husvik Harbour, South Georgia (54 ° 11 ′S 38 ° 40 ′W) in early 1994. The species concerned was identified from Kramp (1961), Carlgren (1930) and Pfeffer (1889) as Haliclystus antarcticus Pfeffer, 1889. This species has attracted little previous study. The most detailed anatomical description was given by Carlgen (1930), while distributional details are given in O'Sullivan (1982) who followed Pfeffer (1889); at present {{there is no evidence that}} the species occurs other than at South Georgia. Medusae were found on two substrata. Large animals (30 mm high, inconspicuous dark brown in colour) were found on the underside of boulders at extreme low spring tide level in a bay on the north of Husvik Harbour about 1 · 2 km from the whaling station and close to Brain Island. Locally they were common, often being close enough to touch one another. Smaller animals (pink-orange in colour; cryptic on the macroalga) were found attached to the brown macroalga Desmarestia menziesii J. Aghardh (Phaeophyceae) collected at low-water spring tide level from Kanin Point on the southern shore of the harbour. Medusae on boulders were briefly emersed on particularly low tides: they collapsed, hanging from the peduncle, when out of water, but did not risk desiccation as their habitat was wet and not exposed to the sun. ...|$|E
40|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} on distribution, abundance, and ecology of scyphozoans in the Northern California Current (NCC). This thesis is divided into four chapters, each of which contributes {{to our understanding of}} a different stage of the scyphozoan life history. The first study describes the settlement preferences of Chrysaora fuscescens planulae in the laboratory. Planulae were found to respond to the interaction of substrate and orientation. Artificial substrates were identified as viable habitat for C. fuscescens. In the second chapter, a population of <b>scyphistomae</b> in Charleston, Oregon were identified to species-level using DNA barcoding techniques. The third and fourth chapters focus on the medusa stage of the life history. Using surveys mailed to fishers in the Pacific Region, this study provides baseline data on the types and magnitudes of economic damages caused by jellyfish on different fisheries and helps assess fishers' perceptions of jellyfish population trends in the NCC. This thesis includes previously unpublished co-authored material...|$|R
40|$|Algal-invertebrate {{associations}} demonstrate specificity {{in their}} establishment and persistence. The determinants of specificity are unknown. One hypothesis states that receptor-ligand interactions are involved. A competing hypothesis states that "ecological factors {{given by the}} environment" inside the host determine specificity rather than "recognition" processes. Yet, all known cellular interactions are in some way receptor mediated. The symbiosis between the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum and the mangrove jellyfish Cassiopeia xamachana was employed as a model to investigate the molecular basis of recognition in algal-invertebrate associations. In order to complete its polyphasic life history, the host must establish a stable association with an appropriate species of microalgae. Aposymbiotic C. xamachana remain in developmental arrest as <b>scyphistomae</b> (asexually reproductive polyps). Numerous species of symbiotic dinoflagellates are maintained in culture in the laboratory. The cell walls of the algae contain cellulose as well as species-specific SDS-extractable proteins/glycoproteins which could serve as signals in cellular interactions between host and symbiont. In addition, all of the algae studied exude water-soluble high molecular weight glycoconjugates to the growth medium. The proteins/glycoproteins associated with the cell walls may be intrinsic cell wall macromolecules or exudates in transit. These molecules are also possible candidates as molecular signals (ligands). The exudates are heterogeneous and include proteins/glycoconjugates of Mr 200 kDa to 14 kDa as determined by SDS­ PAGE. HPLC analyses of the sugar and amino acid composition of exudates from five species of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae demonstrated the presence of glucose, galactose, and their respective amines, fucose, ribose, and mannose, and virtually all the essential amino acids. The uronic acid content of exudates from three algal species that infect <b>scyphistomae</b> of the jellyfish C. xamachana were {{higher than those of}} two species which did not infect. Highly specific polyclonal antibodies directed against exudate from S. microadriaticum, were produced in a rabbit. Using the antibodies as probes, an immunohistochemical study at was done at both the LM (light microscopic) and EM (electron microscopic) levels. The results show that nitrogen-rich macromolecules released by symbiotic dinoflagellates in culture, are also released in hospite. These previously undetected molecules have the potential to serve as molecular signals, structural molecules, and/or a rich nutritional source of high quality nitrogen, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and carbohydrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and magnitude}} of coastal scyphozoan jellyfish blooms can only be predicted with knowledge of how the environment influences every stage of the life cycle. This study provides the first information {{on the effects of}} food and temperature on the settlement of Aurelia aurita planulae. Planulae from mature medusae collected in southern England (50 ° 48 ? 3. 86 ? N, 1 ° 25 ? 23. 06 ? W) were used for experiments. They were introduced to six different treatments: three temperatures (6 °C, 12 °C, 18 °C) at both high and low food feeding regimes. Although settling rate was faster at higher temperatures, significantly fewer planulae settled at the highest temperature. Four types of asexual reproduction were observed in the high food treatments at higher temperatures. Temperature had a significant positive effect on somatic growth of <b>scyphistomae.</b> Food had a significant positive effect on the somatic growth of those with four and more tentacles, and the interaction of the two had a significant positive effect on those with eight and sixteen tentacles...|$|R
40|$|The {{ingestion}} and fate of {{four types}} of particles by endodermal cells of the <b>scyphistomae</b> of Cassiopeia xamachana were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Fer-ritin was endocytosed pinocytotically by invagination of the plasmalemma. These small pinocytotic vesicles fuse with other similar vesicles to form larger ferritin-containing vacuoles, which eventually fuse with lysosomes. Such secondary lysosomes exhibit acid phosphatasc activity. The co-occurrence of acid phosphatase activity and ferritin in secondary lysosomes achieved maximum frequency within 2 h of uptake of ferritin and was evident for at least 4 h following uptake. Artemia particles, live freshly isolated symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium microadriaticum), and heat-killed 5. microadriaticum are phagocytosed by endodermal cells. Ferritin-labelled lysosomes fused with food vacuoles containing particles of Artemia. Vacuoles containing heat-killed S. microadriaticum also showed evidence of phago—lysosome fusion. S. microadriaticum in situ (i. e. in host cells) after 3 days exposure to the photosynthetic inhibitor, 3 -(3 - 4 -dichlorophenyl) -l, 1 -dimethylurea, appeared degenerate, and were found in loose-fitting host vacuoles, many in mid and apical portions of the host cell. More than 70 % of these vacuoles with moribund algae contained the ferritin label, indicating that lysosome fusion had occurred. In contrast, live 5. microadriaticum in control animals were almost always found {{at the base of}} the host cell in individual tight-fitting vacuoles with no evidence of lysosome fusion. Live S. microadriaticum apparently escape host digestion by prohibiting the fusion of lysosomes with the vacuole in which they reside. Vacuoles containing defunct algal symbionts, in contrast, were subject to lysosomal attack...|$|R
40|$|Aurelia polyps (<b>scyphistomae)</b> and ephyrae {{were exposed}} to {{microgravity}} for nine days aboard the space shuttle during the SLS- 1 mission. During strobilation, polyps segment transversely and each segment develops into an ephyra. Polyps were induced to strobilate at 28 C, using iodine or thyroxine, at L(Launch) - 48 h, L- 24 h, and L+ 8 h. Ephyrae developed in the groups tested in space and on Earth. The number of ephyrae formed per polyp was slightly higher in the L+ 8 h groups as compared with those induced at L- 24 h and L- 48 h. On Earth, iodine is used by jellyfish to synthesize jellyfish-thyroxine (Jf T(sub 4)), needed for ephyra production. Since iodine-treated polyps strobilated and formed ephyrae in space, it appears that jellyfish can synthesize Jf-T(sub 4) in space. Indeed, two groups of polyps not given inducer formed ephryae in space, presumably due to enhanced Jf-T(sub 4) synthesis, utilization or accumulation. Some ephyrae that formed in space were also fixed in space on Mission Day (MD) 8; others were fixed post-flight. Examination of living ephyrae with the light microscope and fixed ones with the Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopes revealed that those which developed in space were morphologically {{very similar to those}} which developed on Earth. Quantitation of arm numbers determined that {{there were no significant differences}} between space and Earth-developed ephyrae. Pulsing abnormalities, however, were found in greater number (18. 3 %) in space-developed ephyrae than in Earth-developed controls (2. 9 %). These abnormalities suggest abnormal development of the graviceptors, the neuromuscular system, or a defect in the integration between these systems in apparently microgravity-sensitive animals...|$|R
