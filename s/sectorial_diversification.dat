30|$|Two studies {{conducted}} on the Aberdeen oil cluster, which is also approaching maturity, have addressed issues relevant to the subsea oil and gas cluster {{in the region of}} Bergen. Chapman et al. (2004) found that upstream specialist suppliers were more likely to favour a geographical diversification strategy, i.e., moving into overseas oil fields. In contrast, suppliers engaged in the more generic downstream activities of manufacturing, engineering or business services favoured <b>sectorial</b> <b>diversification</b> in the home country. Raines et al. (2001) found that key specialist technology suppliers to foreign investors in the oil sector acquired knowledge, networks and credibility through their investors that accelerated their internationalization process, both through piggybacking, i.e., indirect export through local system providers (cf. Terpstra and Chwo-Ming 1990), and eventually direct exports.|$|E

Hence banks can be over- or-under diversified. In this paper, we investigate how Canadian bank efficiency {{is affected by}} regional, industrial portfolio concentration as well as concentratio in banks ’ business lines and financing sources. Acharya et. al. find that (industrial and broad <b>sectorial)</b> <b>diversification</b> in loans portfolio reduces bank returns while concurrently producing a riskier bank portfolio for a sample of Italian banks. For Canadian banks, similar tests indicate that while industry diversification reduces returns, it also reduces risk. The framework employed Acharya et. al. thus cannot evaluate whether Canadian banks should focus or diversify. This paper measures the efficiency of financial institutions using a portfolio-allocation approach, which derives an efficient (risk-return) frontier for the ‘big- 5 ’ banks over 4 risky activities using quarterly financial statements between 1997 Q 1 and 2003 Q 2. The distance of an observed bank portfolio’s risk-return combination from the tangency portfolio on the efficient frontier {{is a measure of}} bank inefficiency. We analyze the determinants of bank inefficiency...|$|E

A metodologia ?? baseada na an??lise de estat??stica descritiva, com dados secund??rios relacionados ?? taxa de crescimento, taxa de desemprego, infla????o, bem como ??s taxas de c??mbio, no intuito de avaliar o desvio e correla????o dessas vari??veis nas integra????es. De 1999 a 2011, os resultados apontaram significativa volatilidade nas economias do Mercosul e as flutua????es observadas na taxa de crescimento, no emprego, pre??os e taxas de c??mbio s??o minimamente correlacionadas dentro da regi??o do Mercosul, os n??veis de correla????o no per??odo de 2000 a 2011 foram muito inferiores aos verificados na d??cada de 90. Os resultados indicaram um grau de abertura da economia baixo na Uni??o Monet??ria Europeia e um pouco maior no Mercosul neste mesmo per??odo, o que indica maiores custos em abandonar a pol??tica cambial dom??stica e ingressar em uma uni??o monet??ria; a diversifica????o setorial no ano de 2011 foi verificada tanto nas economias do Mercosul quanto na UME; e a plena mobilidade do fator trabalho ainda ?? uma realidade distante para as integra????es econ??micas diante da baixa mobilidade na Uni??o Monet??ria Europeia e redu????o do percentual de migrantes intra sul-americanos no bloco latino. O Mercosul apresentou n??tidos retrocessos quanto as excessivas medidas restritivas adotadas pelos pa??ses participantes e a dificuldade em implementar a livre circula????o de bens e servi??os entre os pa??ses. Na UME, a rigor os crit??rios de converg??ncia n??o tem sido sistematicamente cumpridos pelos pa??ses aderentes ?? unifica????o monet??ria no ano de seu ingresso e essa flexibiliza????o no que tange a converg??ncia monet??ria da integra????o europeia permanece no per??odo recente, pois as economias europeias ainda n??o conseguiram se recuperar. The {{main goal}} of this master {{dissertation}} is analyzing the economical integration between Mercosur and European Monetary Union. The methodology selected is descriptive statistics using secondary data, which are related to growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation as well as exchange rate in order to evaluate the deviation and correlation among these variables in the economical integration. From 1999 to 2011 the results have shown significantly volatility in the Mercosur???s economies. The observed flotation on growth rate, employment, prices as well as exchange rates were minimally correlated within Mercosur???s region and the correlation level from 2000 to 2011 were lower than the nineties. The results indicated a lower grade of economic openness in the European Union and slightly better in the Mercosur during 2000 - 2011 period, indicating higher costs to abandon the domestic cambial policy and commence in a monetary union; the <b>sectorial</b> <b>diversification</b> in 2011 was verified in both economies and the full labor mobility still is a distant reality for economic integration considering the lower mobility presented by European Union and the reduction of South American immigrants in the Latin bloc. The Mercosur has presented regression regarding restrictive measures adopted by the participating countries and the obstacles to implement the free circulation {{of goods and services}} among the countries. In the European Union, the convergence criteria have not been systematically fulfilled bythe countries, which adhered the monetary unification in the year of their admission. This flexibility in the monetary convergence in the European Union remains until nowadays, because the European economies could not retrieve from the financial crisis...|$|E
