500|$|Part of the {{original}} design of the Riverlore is the distinctive river boat theme of the house. [...] There is a glassed-in pilothouse with a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> {{that serves as the}} entrance to the roof. [...] The roof was designed to be flat and resemble the deck of a steamboat, so that Halliday could view the river and reminisce about his early days working as a steamboat captain while standing on his roof. [...] Captain Halliday lived at the Riverlore for 34 years.|$|E
500|$|The smokebox had an {{inherent}} problem in maintaining a constant vacuum. This {{was a result}} of another Bulleid labour-saving innovation, a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> controlled from the front cab, that enabled ash to be cleaned out via a chute onto the track when the locomotive was on the move. The problem lay with ash gathering {{around the edges of the}} slide, allowing air to leak into the smokebox, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of the locomotive. The fierce blast from the exhaust also meant that ash and embers were ejected into the atmosphere, creating a potential lineside fire hazard.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{changes to}} the ship were made in {{converting}} her to a seaplane tender, with the superstructure, funnel, and propulsion machinery moved aft and a working deck occupying the forward half of the ship. The deck was not intended as a flying-off deck, but for starting and running up of seaplane engines and for recovering damaged aircraft from the sea. The ship was equipped with a large aircraft hold, [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high along with extensive workshops. Two [...] steam cranes {{on the sides of}} the forecastle lifted the aircraft through the <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> of the hangar onto the flight deck or into the water. She carried [...] of petrol for her aircraft in standard commercial [...] tins.|$|E
50|$|An-2PF - Soviet {{production}} An-2 aircraft configured for photo-mapping/survey tasks with camera <b>hatches</b> {{protected by}} <b>sliding</b> <b>hatches</b> on the undersurface of the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|An-2PF - A joint {{request from}} the Polish State mapping Agency (Państwowe Przedsiębiorstwo Kartografii) led to Polish {{production}} of eight 'An-2PF' aircraft configured for photo-mapping/survey tasks with camera <b>hatches</b> protected by <b>sliding</b> <b>hatches</b> on the undersurface of the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The gunner optics, {{which can}} be {{completely}} protected with a <b>slide</b> <b>hatch,</b> are mounted coaxially to the main gun. The gunner has a thermal vision camera and laser range finder (identical to those on the PERI) and an optronic day sight, rounded off with a vision- and a glass block. The driver has three of them, {{as well as an}} image intensifier and one display for optronic image feeds. Even the passenger cabin has a hatch and three vision blocks on the rear right side of the vehicle, one of them in a rotary mount. The rear cabin also has two electronic displays.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, another {{officer of the}} Italian special unit, Lieutenant Licio Visintini, himself a veteran of {{previous}} submarine incursions against the “Rock”, learned about Olterra and conceived {{the idea of a}} secret mother ship for the maiali. Maiale (literally “pig”) is the Italian nickname for the human torpedoes. Under the pretext of raising the ship to sell it to a Spanish owner, a team of members of the Decima, disguised as Italian civilian workers, took control of the tanker. The ship was towed to Algeciras, where “repairs” were started. The Italian Navy personnel were helped by two civilian members of the crew. They had remained on board the half sunken oiler along with a Spanish guard for more than two years, {{in order to protect the}} rights of the Italian company which owned Olterra. Once at docks, some of Olterras cargo holds and a boiler room were modified by Visintini men into a workshop for the assembling and maintenance of human torpedoes. An improvised observation post was also mounted on the forecastle to watch the Bay of Gibraltar and the Allied ships at anchor there. A scene of civilian sailors working to overhaul the ship was meanwhile set up for the outsiders, in order to deceive both British and Spanish authorities. The torpedoes (in spare parts) and other equipment were smuggled into Spain by men of the Decima under the pretense of being materials for the ‘works’ on board Olterra. [...] Finally, a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> was opened with a cutting torch six feet below the waterline. This would be the exit door of the manned torpedoes, which would launch their attacks from the flooding bilge, right beneath the workshop. The special unit in charge of the operations was dubbed Squadriglia Ursa Major, after the constellation of the same name.|$|E
60|$|Marston {{wanted to}} run up on deck, but did not. Since his {{adventure}} on the flat had rather shaken his nerve, he meant to use some control. For a few moments they heard nothing and then the <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> rattled, as if somebody pulled it back. Marston thought it significant {{that none of the}} crew had challenged the stranger. The hatch opened and the old mulatto came down. He did not squat on the deck, as he had done before, but sat, like a white man, on the side locker.|$|E
50|$|The Defender (later the Gazelle) was {{an armored}} Suburban. It {{included}} a roof-mounted machine gun under a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miriam had {{got away}} in the afternoon, since he had so much farther to go to reach his station. Stephan, of the Kappa, started with me; but, of course, we {{realized}} that we must work independently, and that from that moment when we shut the <b>sliding</b> <b>hatches</b> of our conning-towers on the still waters of Blankenberg Harbour it was unlikely that we should ever see each other again, though consorts in the same waters. I waved to Stephan from the side of my conning-tower, and he to me. Then I called through the tube to my engineer (our water-tanks were already filled and all kingstons and vents closed) to put her full speed ahead.|$|R
25|$|The MORCEE has a {{self-bailing}} cockpit {{with the}} cockpit {{an integral part}} of the deck. The cuddy cabin is enclosed with a <b>hatch</b> <b>slide</b> arrangement. The liner in the cabin is a separate moulding and contains two berth cushions and a sink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi!" [...] With a yell from Manuel {{the work}} began again, and never stopped till the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop rolled aft {{to the cabin}} with his brother; Manuel and Long Jack went forward; Tom Platt only waited long enough to <b>slide</b> home the <b>hatch</b> ere he too disappeared. In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the cabin, and he was staring blankly at Dan and Penn.|$|R
50|$|ARK-3-2:The second {{prototype}} ARK-3 {{with more}} powerful engines, longer hull, increased wing chord and manual guns fitted in a manual gun turret in the bows and a dorsal <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Experimental version, H8K2 modified. Equipped with {{retractable}} floats in wingtips, fowler flaps, <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> side gun {{locations in}} place of the blisters and a retractable dorsal turret, all in an effort to increase speed, two prototypes only (work number 596 and 597).|$|E
50|$|While being {{designed}} for roll-on roll-off operations the ships {{can also be}} loaded using dockside cranes. For this purpose {{there is a long}} <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> cover above the bow section for access to the vehicle deck. There are no facilities for helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|The Leopard 2 Imp {{was then}} {{developed}} into the A5. There were also some {{improvements in the}} main armour composition. The interior received spall liners to reduce fragments if the armour is penetrated. The frontal [...] "heavy" [...] third of the side skirts was replaced with a stronger type. The commander's sight was {{moved to a new}} position behind the hatch and it received an independent thermal channel. The gunner's sight was moved to the turret roof as opposed to the cavity in the front armour in previous models. A heavier <b>sliding</b> driver's <b>hatch</b> was fitted. Turret controls went all-electric, increasing reliability and crew safety, as well as weight savings. The gun braking system was improved to prepare for the later mounting of the new L55 gun tube and to enable firing of more powerful ammunition, such as the DM-53 APFSDS. The A5 entered service in German tank battalions in mid-1998.|$|R
2500|$|... (MORCEE Model Only) The {{cabin is}} fully {{enclosed}} {{and has two}} fixed lights in the cabin top for visibility and interior illumination. The companionway closes with teak <b>hatch</b> <b>slides.</b> Forward a double V berth is raised a few inches above the cabin sole and is fitted with two 3" [...] foam cushions in a choice of colours. To port, supplied as standard, is a galley unit with sink and integral water tank filled through a plug located in one corner. To starboard, provision has been made for installation of a marine head (optional). Two forward utility shelves are moulded above the berths. There is a small hatch in the cabin sole top access the bilge.|$|R
5000|$|The A5 {{introduced}} a wedge-shaped, spaced add-on armour to the turret {{front and the}} frontal area of the sides. These armour modules defeat a hollow charge prior to reaching the base armour. The spaced armour is also designed to affect kinetic-energy penetrators by forcing them to change direction and eroding them in the process; it does not form a shot-trap since it doesn't deflect the penetrators outwards to hit the hull or turret ring. The gun mantlet was redesigned to accept the new armour. There were also some improvements in the main armour composition. The tank interior received spall liners to reduce fragments if the armour is penetrated. The frontal [...] "heavy" [...] third of the side skirts was replaced with a new, stronger type. The commander's sight was {{moved to a new}} position behind the hatch and it received an independent thermal channel. The gunner's sight was moved to the turret roof as opposed to the cavity in the front armour in previous models. A new heavier <b>sliding</b> driver's <b>hatch</b> was fitted.

50|$|Behind {{the hoop}} shop is the swine house, a one-story frame saltbox {{building}} with metal roof and board-and-batten siding. Each {{of the many}} pens inside has an upward <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> door {{to the west and}} north controlled from the inside by rope and pulley. On the north is a raised bluestone terrace with stone retaining wall on the outside.|$|E
50|$|These boats have a {{relatively}} small mainsail compared to other yachts of their size. They use a large headsail to increase sail area. The boom is relatively high {{from the bottom of}} the cockpit, and the end is more forward. Mainsail controls are achieved through a cabin-top mounted winch, leading to a traveler car system running across the deck in front of the main cabin's <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Proposed by a Canadian {{engineer}} as {{a result}} of experience from the Dieppe Raid, the Assault Vehicle Royal Engineers was a Churchill Mark III or IV equipped with the [...] "Mortar, Recoiling Spigot, Mark II" [...] (or Petard), a 290 mm spigot mortar which throws the 40 lb [...] "Flying dustbin" [...] demolition bomb with a 28-pound high-explosive warhead. The Petard, developed by MD1, was designed for the quick levelling of fortifications. The Petard was reloaded by traversing the turret to point front, slightly to the left, with the barrel directly over the co-driver's <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch.</b> The regular two piece co-driver's hatch was plated over, and a small <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> was installed to allow access to the Petard. The Petard barrel would then be' broken' vertically, and the co-driver would slide open his hatch. The co-driver would then push the nom into the barrel. The barrel would then be closed, the Petard traversed back down, and the turret rotated back to its original position. The co-driver's hands were briefly exposed during the process.|$|E
2500|$|The vessel had an {{increased}} baking and a midship deckhouse with underlying engine room. The longitudinal-framed hull was ice-reinforced. Built as a closed shelter-decker, Adele had a grain capacity of [...] and an internal volume of [...] ball steerage. Two {{of the four}} cargo holds were arranged {{in front of the}} bridge structure, two were behind it. The two front rooms were accessible by three hatches, the aft rooms had one hatch each. The cargo consisted of 12 normal light derricks on all hatches and a 25-ton heavy lift on hold 2. The 12 AEG-type winches, manufactured under license by Kampnagel Schaerffe, Hamburg, were designed to lift 3 tons at /min in single gear, or 5 tons at that speed in double gear. Each was driven by an 18.4-kW electric motor. The derricks between the two forward hatches were attached to double post, which served simultaneously as a cargo space ventilation of 20 changes of air per hour, the second front and aft cargo gear was on conventional central derricks. The hatches were fitted with a <b>sliding</b> steel <b>hatch</b> cover, and the main deck was lined with [...] thick Oregon pine to prevent heat radiation, assumably to carry fruits. However, no refrigeration plant was fitted, hence the carriage of any fruit had been restricted to short sea trade, such as from Spain or Canary Islands to North Europe. Besides the shaft tunnel there were cargo tanks.|$|R

50|$|The VL2C also {{featured}} an upgraded processor board, to better handle the demands made by extra features offered in later {{versions of the}} Series 200 operating system software, such as the application of timing values (rather than a simple speed) to the various functions. The VL2C can be outwardly distinguished {{by the presence of}} ventilation louvres {{to the rear of the}} top and bottom head covers and by a smaller, hinged colour / gobo access hatch, secured by a quarter-turn Zeus clip (previous versions featured a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Personnel Carrier is {{the base}} vehicle of the line, with two hatches {{in the front}} deck for the {{commander}} and gunner, a center hatch with a weapon mount directly behind those hatches for the gunner, and a large <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> on the rear deck for the passengers. In addition, there are six firing ports, two on each side {{and one in the}} rear, as well as a door in either side of the passenger compartment. Among other roles that the Carrier can be used for is basic APC, reconnaissance, command, base security, convoy escort and Command and Control vehicle.|$|E

50|$|It {{was never}} clear {{what caused the}} ship to list in the first place. Another steamer, George Stephenson out of Pittsburgh, had passed Cyprus that {{afternoon}} and had noted that Cyprus was trailing a red wake, indicating that water was mixing with iron ore dust in its cargo hold before being pumped out. Speculation on {{the source of the}} leak has centered on the type of Mulholland <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> cover the nearly new ship had been outfitted with. With a steel on steel seal, this type of hatch was prone to allowing water past unless special tarpaulins were fitted on the hatches. It was not clear if Huyck had ordered these tarpaulins deployed or not.|$|E

Two 3 LT steam cranes {{on the sides of}} the forecastle lifted the aircraft through the <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> of the hangar onto the flight deck or into the water. She carried 4000 imp gal of petrol for her aircraft in standard commercial 2 imp gal tins.|$|E
50|$|The 5-megapixel back camera has an {{autofocus}} feature, dual LED flash, 4:3 and 16:9 {{aspect ratio}} options, and 3× digital zoom. The focal length of this camera is 5.2 mm, the aperture is f/2.8, {{and the focus}} range is 10 cm to infinity. It is capable of video recording at up to 848 × 480 pixels at 25 fps. The lens, while not in use, is protected by a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch.</b> Opening the hatch launches the camera application. Although the 0.3-megapixel front camera is capable of video recording at up to 640 × 480 pixels and pre-production units {{could be used for}} video calls over IP using Google Talk, the retail version was delivered without any software enabling video calling or video chatting. In update PR1.2 OTA (over-the-air) Skype video calling was added, enabling the fascia camera. With some software updates the phone becomes capable of play/record/stream 720p video.|$|E
5000|$|Baker built MK 1's. Baker owned Fibreglass Yachts in NSW. These MK1's {{were built}} from around 1965-72 {{and had a}} hand laid up Glass-reinforced plastic hull and are {{considered}} to be a little stronger than the latter models. The MK1's did not have a <b>sliding</b> <b>hatch</b> above the companionway as did the timber models but had a [...] "key-hole" [...] entry (semi elliptical shaped cabin top above companionway). Above sat the main sheet traveller, which was a raised stainless steel tube following the contour of the cabin while some were later fitted with a conventional horizontal traveller. The cabin profile had a step down to the mast the main sheet winches mounted on steel struts. For accommodation the original standard timber boat had four berths, a centrally located galley and a large chart table as Illingworth placed great importance {{on the role of the}} navigator, whilst with many of the MK1's the interior layout was often left up to the individual. However, most were built with an enclosed head, vee-berths forward, central galley and settee berths port and starboard.Formit Fibreglass brought the moulds from Fibreglass Yachts and produce eight MK1's in 1972.|$|E
