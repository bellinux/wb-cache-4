6000|$|Dinner was announced; {{they went}} in. At the round {{table in a}} dining-room, all black oak, with many candles, and terrible portraits of {{departed}} ancestors, Anna sat between the magistrate and Gordy. Mark was opposite, between a quaint-looking old lady and a young girl {{who had not been}} introduced, a girl in white, with very fair hair and very white skin, blue eyes, and lips a little parted; a daughter evidently of the faded Mrs. Doone. A girl like a <b>silvery</b> <b>moth,</b> like a forget-me-not! Anna found it hard to take her eyes away from this girl's face; not that she admired her exactly; pretty she was--yes; but weak, with those parted lips and soft chin, and almost wistful look, as if her deep-blue half-eager eyes were in spite of her. But she was young--so young! That was why not to watch her seemed impossible. [...] "Sylvia Doone?" [...] Indeed! Yes. A soft name, a pretty name--and very like her! Every time her eyes could travel away from her duty to Squire Trusham, and to Gordy (on both of whom she was clearly making an impression), she gazed at this girl, sitting there by the boy, and whenever those two young things smiled and spoke together she felt her heart contract and hurt her. Was THIS why that something had gone out of his eyes? Ah, she was foolish! If every girl or woman the boy knew was to cause such a feeling in her, what would life be like? And her will hardened against her fears. She was looking brilliant herself; and she saw that the girl in her turn could not help gazing at her eagerly, wistfully, a little bewildered--hatefully young. And the boy? Slowly, surely, as a magnet draws, Anna could feel that she was drawing him, could see him stealing chances to look at her. Once she surprised him full. What troubled eyes! It was not the old adoring face; yet she knew from its expression that she could make him want her--make him jealous--easily fire him with her kisses, if she would.|$|E
5000|$|Eilistraee {{prefers not to}} act {{openly and}} only rarely {{directly}} intervenes in her people's lives. But she is known to watch over them and help and assist any creature that she favors (even if not her worshiper) in immediately useful ways. For example, {{the sound of her}} hunting horn can be heard when her faithful are in danger (or when people needing help are nearby) heartening them and scaring away dangerous creatures. Her silvery radiance or <b>silvery</b> <b>moths</b> guide drow who are lost in the darkness to a safe place, or lighten childbirths that occur in the dark. Hers is the force that brings a stag within the reach of hungry drow. Eilistraee also manifests, usually through her light, in the moments when her [...] "children" [...] need her visible blessing and support or comfort. Overall, Eilistraee believes that individual drow have to find their own paths to redemption, and that her forcefully interfering would prevent this. Nevertheless, she is not unwilling to retaliate when her followers are threatened.|$|R
60|$|At Monkland, {{that same}} hour, {{in the little}} {{whitewashed}} 'withdrawing-room' of a thatched, whitewashed cottage, two men sat talking, one {{on either side of}} the hearth; and in a low chair between them a dark-eyed woman leaned back, watching, the tips of her delicate thin fingers pressed together, or held out transparent towards the fire. A log, dropping now and then, turned up its glowing underside; and the firelight and the lamplight seemed so to have soaked into the white walls that a wan warmth exuded. <b>Silvery</b> dun <b>moths,</b> fluttering in from the dark garden, kept vibrating, like spun shillings, over a jade-green bowl of crimson roses; and there was a scent, as ever in that old thatched cottage, of woodsmoke, flowers, and sweetbriar.|$|R
