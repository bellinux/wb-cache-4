50|$|Over {{time the}} term Blunt came to {{describe}} any cigar {{wrapped in a}} <b>single</b> continuous <b>leaf.</b> However, in the 1970s a new manner of producing cigars was invented. This manner is known as spiral binding. No longer did cigars have to be rolled in a continuous <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> but instead a continuous spiral wrap from base to tip could be employed. The basic shape of a blunt remained unchanged although the burn characteristics of a spiral wrapped cigar {{is not the same}} as a <b>single</b> continuous <b>leaf.</b> However spiral wrapping is much less expensive than using a full <b>single</b> tobacco <b>leaf.</b> Spiral wrapping gives a better seal than a <b>single</b> continuous <b>leaf</b> as overlapping can be done (much like wrapping an arm in a bandage, spiral wrapping is easier to seal than a single continuous bandage).|$|R

Tests of the Suits vegetative canopy reflectance model for the full hemisphere of observer directions as well as the nadir direction show moderate agreement for the visible channels of the MSS and poor agreement in the near infrared channel. Temporal changes in the spectral characteristics of the single leaves were seen to occur as a function of maturity which demonstrates that the absorptance of a soybean <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> is more a function of thetransmittancee characteristics than the seasonally consistent <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> reflectance...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> Asarum himalaicum on the renal function of rabbits. Methods: Rabbits were divided into three groups. Asarum himalaicum, Asarum heterotropoides and normal saline were intravenously administered to the rabbits of one group respectively. The urine volume per minute, urine pH, urine glucose, protein and red blood cells, BUN, SCr, TXB 2, 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, TXB 2 / 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, endothelin, p-aminohippuric acid clearance rate and phenolsulfonphthalein excretion rate were tested {{before and after the}} administration. Results: A certain dosage of <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> Asarum himalaicum caused acute renal failure in rabbits. The indices tested were significantly diffrent between rabbits administered Asarum himalaicum and normal saline. As compared with the rabbits administered Asarum heterotropoides,the results of indices tested decreased, but without statistical significance, except for SCr. Conclusion: The <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> Asarum himalaicum can cause renal damage to rabbits. Its renal toxicity is lower that that of Asarum heterotropoides...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLeaf area {{index is}} one of the most {{important}} parameters in ecological and environmental studies. This paper presents a method for <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> area measurement based on the counting of the leaf pixels in digital leaf image. Initially, the target leaf is put on a piece of white paper on which four endpoints of an equal-length and orthogonal cross are printed. A background color threshold is then set to separate the white background pixels from the leaf pixels. After the removal of the background pixels, the leaf pixels are left; and the ratio of the number of leaf pixels to the number of pixels of the reference facet formed by the four control endpoints is equal to that of their areas. The <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> area can then be computed easily based on this proportional relation. Analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed method is an efficient and precise method for <b>single</b> <b>leaf</b> or leaf-like object area measurement...|$|R
