2500|$|Peter Drucker saw Frederick Taylor as {{the creator}} of {{knowledge}} management, because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes. Although the typical application of scientific management was manufacturing, Taylor himself advocated scientific management {{for all sorts of}} work, including the management of universities and government. For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to [...] "the work of our salesmen". [...] Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using Taylorism for [...] "sales engineering" [...] (Person was talking about what is now called sales process engineering—engineering the processes that salespeople use—not about what we call <b>sales</b> <b>engineering</b> today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate marketing.|$|E

50|$|The {{essence of}} the <b>sales</b> <b>engineering</b> role can be called by various names. Which name is most apt can even depend on which {{industry}} it is used in. Some common job titles that involve the essence of <b>sales</b> <b>engineering</b> include Sales Engineer, Solutions Engineer, Systems Engineer, Customer Engineer, (pre-sales) consultant, Technical Account Manager; Applications Engineer or Field Applications Engineer, and others. The term systems engineering has various shades of meaning, however, as it is often more or less synonymous with industrial engineering; but in any market economy, industrial engineers will often end up providing some <b>sales</b> <b>engineering</b> as a necessary portion of their work. Service technicians in industrial fields may also find that their work challenges them to provide some <b>sales</b> <b>engineering,</b> to whatever extent {{they are capable of}} providing it, because they interface with customers having problems with equipment (or lacking the right equipment) and seeking solutions (anywhere from diagnosis and repair, to identifying entirely different systems that could be used instead).|$|E
