500|$|Pugs are one {{of several}} breeds that are more {{susceptible}} than other dogs to demodectic mange, also known as [...] "demodex". This condition is caused when parasitic mites, that are often present in a dog's skin without causing symptoms, are allowed to do damage because their host has a weakened immune system.

This vulnerability is thought to be genetic and breeders will avoid producing puppies from adults who have this condition. In 2008, an investigative documentary carried out by the BBC found significant inbreeding between pedigree dogs, with a study by Imperial College, London, showing that the 10,000 Pugs in the UK are so inbred that their gene pool is the equivalent of only 50 individuals.|$|E

2500|$|IgA {{nephropathy}} is {{the most}} common glomerulonephritis worldwide. Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus.

40|$|We {{examine the}} roles of episodic and <b>systemic</b> <b>forms</b> of power in radical {{organizational}} change. Drawing on a study of three attempted transformations in professional service firms from traditional professional partnerships into managed professional businesses – one relatively complete and two incomplete – we identify two key mechanisms that link episodic and <b>systemic</b> <b>forms</b> of power and show how those mechanisms affect the likelihood that organizations {{will be able to}} successfully undergo radical change. We find that episodic power is able to initiate and energize radical change when it represents a significant break from traditional authority structures and is legitimated through appeals to traditional organizational values. We also find that systemic power is able to institutionalize radical change when the systems associated with it are legitimated by the skilled use of language by key actors and then left to operate independently by those actors. By articulating the specific mechanisms that link episodic and systemic power our study provides a more complete model of the role of power in radical change, enabling better prediction of the likelihood of successful transformation and a fuller theoretical explanation for change outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{proposed}} Anti-Racism Strategy established {{within a}} framework of the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s multicultural policy, People of Australia, identifies ‘youth engagement’ {{as one of the}} key areas that needs to be promoted and supported. Young people have been invited to join youth councils and youth forums and work with national, state and local policy-makers. Some have taken up this challenge and became public faces and active members of anti-racism campaigns. Others, however, either remained silent about the discrimination they face, or organised their own grassroots youth-based and youth-led initiatives. This paper discusses individual and collective responses to racism among young people in Australia, focusing on Melbourne, and examines possibilities in which racism, as a common experience among migrant youth, can be utilised to form alternative spaces for political action, challenging not only interpersonal, but also <b>systemic</b> <b>forms</b> of racism. By drawing attention towards institutional and <b>systemic</b> <b>forms</b> of racism, and the historical perpetuation of racist practices, these youth initiatives rely on legal measures, and argue that racism should be discussed {{in the context of the}} broader Australian society, not only in relation to minority groups...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of porphyrins by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) as a contributing pathogenic {{factor in the}} aetiology of acne {{is the object of}} this investigation. High–performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis was used to investigate in vivo samples of porphyrins produced by P. acnes from comedones prior to treatment of a set of 55 patients with a variety of <b>systemic</b> <b>forms</b> of treatment. For all patients mainly coproporphyrin III was identified, but also coproporphyrin I and protoporphyrin at considerably lower concentrations. Polar porphyrins could not be detected. Wide variations of porphyrin concentrations between individual patients were found. Collective evaluation showed that only systemic isotretinoin monotherapy for more than three months led to a reduction of porphyrins. Other <b>systemic</b> <b>forms</b> of therapy, such as minocycline, a combination of oral isotretinoin with local treatment or various combinations of local therapy (benzoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide and retinoids, benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid) had no persistent effect on porphyrin production. When the porphyrin {{production of}} individual patients was analysed repeatedly over time, clinical improvement was associated with lowered concentrations of porphyrins with local forms of therapy. An unchanged or worsening skin condition was associated with increased porphyrin production. The reduction of coproporphyrin III production by P. acnes where there is improvement as a result of therapy supports the pathogenetic significance of P. acnes and of the porphyrin fractions it produces for the emergence of acne...|$|R
