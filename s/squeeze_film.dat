The authors {{have worked for}} more than 25 years researching, experimenting, and applying this subject matter to all types of turbomachinery. Major strides {{have been made in}} advancing the state-of-the-art by accounting for the fluid inertia effects in the analysis of <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> dampers.

A comprehensive discussion is provided of <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> dampers, outlining their major advantages and the proper use of these components. Since <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> dampers are more complex to design and analyze than other machinery elements, they have often been used in the process industry as a last resort to reduce vibration or improve the rotordynamic characteristics of a machine.
