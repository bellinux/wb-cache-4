No shell-lac hemisphere was then in the apparatus, and therefore the loss would be principally from dissipation, and not from absorption: hence it would be nearer {{to the degree of}} loss shown by the numbers 304° and 297°, and being assumed as 6° would reduce the divisible charge to 284°. In that case the air would have lost 170°, and communicated only 113° to the shell-lac; and the relative <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> of the latter would appear to be 1.50, which is very little indeed removed from 1.47, the expression given by the second experiment when corrected in the same way.|$|E
6000|$|... 1262. The {{difference}} of 1.55 and 1.37 as {{the expression of}} the capacity for the induction of shell-lac seems considerable, but is in reality very admissible under the circumstances, for both are in error in contrary directions. Thus in the last experiment the charge fell from 215° to 204° by the joint effects of dissipation and absorption (1192. 1250.), during the time which elapsed in the electrometer operations, between the applications of the carrier ball required to give those two results. Nearly an equal time must have elapsed between the application of the carrier which gave the 204° result, and the division of the charge between the two apparatus; and as the fall in force progressively decreases in amount (1192.), if in this case it be taken at 6° only, it will reduce the whole transferable charge at the time of division to 198° instead of 204°; this diminishes the loss of the shell-lac charge to 80° instead of 86°; and then the expression of <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> for it is increased, and, instead of 1.37, is 1.47 times that of air.|$|E
6000|$|... 1281. Oil of {{turpentine}} rectified.--I {{filled the}} lower half of app. i. with the fluid: and as it would not hold a charge sufficiently to enable me first to measure and then divide it, I charged app. ii. containing air, and dividing its charge with app. i. by a quick contact, measured that remaining in app. ii.: for, theoretically, if a quick contact would divide up to equal tension between the two apparatus, yet without sensible loss from the conducting power of app. i.; and app. ii. were left charged to a degree of tension above half the original charge, it would indicate that oil of turpentine had less specific inductive capacity than air; or, if left charged below that mean state of tension, it would imply that the fluid had the greater inductive capacity. In an experiment of this kind, app. ii. gave as its charge 390° before division with app. i., and 175° afterwards, which is less than the half of 390°. Again, being at 176° before division, it was 79° after, which is also less than half the divided charge. Being at 79°, it was a third time divided, and then fell to 36°, less than the half of 79°. Such are the best results I could obtain; they are not inconsistent with the belief that oil of turpentine has a greater <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> than air, but they do not prove the fact, since the disappearance of more than half the charge {{may be due to the}} conducting power merely of the fluid.|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 b {{displays}} the first charge–discharge profiles of four different Si electrodes: Si NP, c-Si NP, SiRH, and c-SiRH. Whereas all electrodes showed consistent lithiation and delithiation plateaus at around 0.1 and 0.4  V vs. Li/Li+, they delivered different gravimetric capacities. It is first {{noted that the}} carbon-coated derivatives exhibited larger <b>specific</b> <b>capacities</b> {{than those of the}} bare Si counterparts, indicating that the low conductivity of intrinsic Si is needed to be compensated for efficient Li storage. Also, both types of Si NPs showed clearly higher <b>specific</b> <b>capacities</b> than those of the SiRH counterparts, which {{can be explained by the}} fact that the porous structure of SiRH does not allow for as much volume expansion as Si NP, resulting in a smaller amount of Li storage in the given voltage range. The inevitable residue of silica in SiRH is another reason for the smaller <b>specific</b> <b>capacities.</b> Considering the <b>specific</b> <b>capacities</b> of both SiRH and c-SiRH electrodes are far higher than those of typical commercial cathodes, the smaller <b>specific</b> <b>capacities</b> of SiRH and c-SiRH electrodes compared with those of the Si NP counterparts are unlikely to be a critical issue in practical cell design.|$|R
