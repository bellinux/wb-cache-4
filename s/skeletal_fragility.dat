40|$|International audienceBackgroundThe greater {{susceptibility}} to contraction-induced <b>skeletal</b> muscle injury (<b>fragility)</b> {{is an important}} dystrophic feature and tool for testing preclinic dystrophin-based therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, how these therapies reduce the muscle fragility is not clear. MethodsTo address this question, we first determined the event(s) of the excitation-contraction cycle which is/are altered following lengthening (eccentric) contractions in the mdx muscle. ResultsWe found that the immediate force drop following lengthening contractions, a widely used measure of muscle fragility, was associated with reduced muscle excitability. Moreover, the force drop can be mimicked by an experimental reduction in muscle excitation of uninjured muscle. Furthermore, the force drop {{was not related to}} major neuromuscular transmission failure, excitation-contraction uncoupling, and myofibrillar impairment. Secondly, and importantly, the re-expression of functional truncated dystrophin in the muscle of mdx mice using an exon skipping strategy partially prevented the reductions in both force drop and muscle excitability following lengthening contractions. ConclusionWe demonstrated {{for the first time that}} (i) the increased {{susceptibility to}} contraction-induced muscle injury in mdx mice is mainly attributable to reduced muscle excitability; (ii) dystrophin-based therapy improves fragility of the dystrophic skeletal muscle by preventing reduction in muscle excitability...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{usefulness}} of the inbred rat model for studies of genetic influences on <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility.</b> We characterized bone mass, geometry, and skeletal biomechanics in 11 inbred strains of rats. This study showed that considerable variation exists in bone structure, areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and fragility phenotypes among inbred strains of rats. Interestingly, the variability in skeletal phenotypes in rats was site specific, suggesting that no single gene regulates <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> at all sites. For instance, the Copenhagen 2331 (COP) strain had the greatest biomechanical properties in the femoral neck but only modest bone strength at the femoral midshaft, compared with other strains. Consequently, COP rats appear to have alleles that specifically enhance femoral neck biomechanical properties and may serve as a model for studying genetic influences on hip strength. The Brown Norway (BN) and Fischer 344 (F 344) strains may provide models for vertebral fragility because each has relatively fragile lumbar vertebrae. The F 344 rats also had the most fragile femora and, thus, appear to carry alleles that cause overall <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility.</b> We identified two inbred rat crosses that will facilitate the study of genetic influences on <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> at clinically relevant skeletal sites: Lewis (LEW) with F 344 (primarily for vertebral fragility) and COP with DA (primarily for femoral neck fragility).

40|$|Background. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> is a {{complication}} of phenylketonuria (PKU). A diet containing amino acids compared with glycomacropeptide reduces bone {{size and strength}} in mice. Objective. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid medical foods (AA-MF) provide a high dietary acid load, subsequently increasing urinary excretion of renal net acid, calcium, and magnesium, compared to glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MF). Design. In a crossover design, 8 participants with PKU (16 – 35 [*]y) provided food records and 24 -hr urine samples after consuming a low-Phe diet in combination with AA-MF and GMP-MF for 1 – 3 [*]wks. We calculated potential renal acid load (PRAL) of AA-MF and GMP-MF and determined bone mineral density (BMD) measurements using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results. AA-MF provided 1. 5 – 2. 5 -fold higher PRAL and resulted in 3 -fold greater renal net acid excretion compared to GMP-MF (p= 0. 002). Dietary protein, calcium, and magnesium intake were similar. GMP-MF significantly reduced urinary excretion of calcium by 40 % (p= 0. 012) and magnesium by 30 % (p= 0. 029). Two participants had low BMD-for-age and trabecular bone scores, indicating microarchitectural degradation. Urinary calcium with AA-MF negatively correlated with L 1 –L 4 BMD. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of bone are dictated by its amount, distribution and ‘quality’. The {{composition of the}} mineral and matrix phases is integral to defining ‘bone quality’. Exercise can potentially increase resistance to fracture, yet the effects of exercise on <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility,</b> and how alterations in fragility are modulated by the amount, distribution and composition of bone, are unknown. In this investigation, the effects of exercise on the size, composition, {{mechanical properties}} and damage resistance of bones from mice of various ages, background strains and genetic makeup were assessed, {{as a means of}} testing the hypothesis that mechanical loading can improve <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> via compositional alterations. C 57 BL/ 6 mice (4 -month-old males) ran on a treadmill for 21 days. Tibiae from exercised and control mice were analyzed for cross-sectional geometry, mechanical properties, microdamage and composition. Exercise significantly increased strength without increasing cross-sectional properties, suggesting that mechanical stimulation led to changes in the bone matrix, and these changes led to the improvements in mechanical properties. Consistent with this interpretation, the mineral/matrix ratio was significantly increased in exercised bones. The number of fatigue-induced microcracks was significantly lower in exercised bones, providing evidence that exercise modulates fatigue resistance. The ratio of nonreducible/reducible cross-links mirrored the damage data.

Glycomacropeptide (GMP), a low-phe whey protein, provides a palatable alternative to AA formula. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> is a poorly understood chronic complication of PKU. We sought to characterize {{the impact of the}} PKU genotype and dietary protein source on bone biomechanics. PROCEDURES: Wild type (WT; Pah(+/+)) and PKU (Pah(enu 2 /enu 2)) mice on a C 57 BL/ 6 J background were fed high-phe casein, low-phe AA, and low-phe GMP diets between 3 to 23 weeks of age. Following euthanasia, femur biomechanics were assessed by 3 -point bending and femoral diaphyseal structure was determined. Femoral ex vivo bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Whole bone parameters were used in principal component analysis. Data were analyzed by 3 -way ANCOVA with genotype, sex, and diet as the main factors. FINDINGS: Regardless of diet and sex, PKU femora were more brittle, as manifested by lower post-yield displacement, weaker, as manifested by lower energy and yield and maximal loads, and showed reduced BMD compared with WT femora. Four principal components accounted for 87 % of the variance and all differed significantly by genotype. Regardless of genotype and sex, the AA diet reduced femoral cross-sectional area and consequent maximal load compared with the GMP diet. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Skeletal</b> <b>fragility,</b> as reflected in brittle and weak femora, is an inherent feature of PKU. This PKU bone phenotype is attenuated by a GMP diet compared with an AA diet...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In {{the past}} years, several cases of unusual {{fractures}} {{have been reported}} among bisphosphonate-treated woman at sites, such as subtrocanteric or diaphyseal femoral regions, that arenot included in osteoporotic fractures. Previous thigh pain, lack of trauma prior to fracture and specific radiological characteristics have also been reported. Suppression of bone turnover and long term use of bisphosphonates can potentially result in increased fracture risk. Material and Methods: We report 9 cases of atypical metadiaphyseal femoral fractures after long term oral bisphosphonate therapy. All patients were treated with weekly oral alendronate for 6 – 11 yr and only one patient was administered oral ibandronate in the last year. In 5 patients diaphyseal fracture occurred {{with little or no}} trauma and 4 of them reported preceding pain. Fractures were stabilized by intramedullary nailing. Evaluation for secondary causes of <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> was undertaken. Results: We found low levels of serum and urinary calcium in all patients. In 6 patients serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels were < 20 ng/ml and 3 patients had a secondary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had subclinical hyperthyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis. Three patients had normal BMD measured by DXA. In 4 patients X-rays showed a bilateral femoral involvement consisting of thickening of the diaphyseal cortex and of an abnormal area of increased uptake of controlateral femur at bone scintigraphy. Three of them underwent stabilization of contralateral femur by intramedullary nail fixation. In all patients we found a marked suppression of bone turnover markers. Conclusion: Our data indicate that concomitant circumstances may affect bone remodelling, beyond the effect of bisphosphonates alone.

40|$|Fractures are a {{major public}} health concern {{and there is an}} urgent need to {{identify}} high-risk individuals. This study used novel approaches in bone imaging to characterize optimal skeletal development in girls and enhance our understanding of the structural and functional deficits that contribute to <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> and fracture risk during growth. The findings indicate that fracture in girls is associated with lower trabecular bone density, but not bone macro-architecture at metaphyseal regions of weight-bearing bones, which is consistent with findings reported in children at the distal radius. These findings suggest that lower trabecular density at metaphyseal regions of long bones track throughout the appendicular skeleton and may be an early marker of <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility.</b> Obese children are overrepresented in childhood fracture cases. Nevertheless, the effects of fat on bone during growth remain unclear. This study showed that skeletal muscle was a stronger determinant of bone parameters in girls than total body adiposity, although fat mass had a persistent, albeit weak association with bone parameters. Furthermore, fatty infiltration of skeletal muscle, which is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, was inversely associated with bone strength in girls. These findings are consistent with the proposed functional model of bone development which posits that forces from muscle contractions are the main mechanical challenges to which bones adapt. Physical activity during growth is critical for optimal bone development. The findings from this study support this premise and suggest that regular physical activity enhances bone strength in girls. Nevertheless, for exercise to be accepted as an important public health osteoporosis prevention strategy, lasting adaptations must be shown. Plausible biological explanations have been offered in support of the peri-pubertal years as a "window of opportunity" for maximizing the response to exercise. Findings from this study suggest that a two year school-based high-impact jumping intervention was not an effective means to enhance bone parameters in girls. Controlled dose-response trials will be necessary to test questions regarding the types, bouts, and durations of exercise required to define the "dose" of exercise needed to elicit meaningful skeletal adaptations during growth...|$|E

Bone mineral density (BMD) testing in these populations is performed in conjunc-tion with careful evaluation of the disease state contributing to bone loss and increased fragility fracture risk, as well as assessment of other contributing risk factors for fracture. The presence of secondary causes of bone loss may further {{increase the risk of}} fracture independently of BMD and may necessitate earlier pharmacologic intervention.

The BMD testing in this population may be normal in the presence of <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility,</b> and quantitative bone histomorphometry is bette...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The genetic architecture of skeletal biomechanical performance has tremendous potential to advance our knowl-edge {{of the biological}} mechanisms that drive variation in <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> and osteoporosis risk. Research using tradi-tional approaches that focus on specific gene pathways is increasing {{our understanding of how}} and to what degree those pathways may affect population-level variation in fracture susceptibility, and shows that known pathways may affect bone fragility through unsuspected mechanisms. Non-traditional approaches that incorporate a new appreciation for the degree to which bone traits co-adapt to functional loading environments, using a wide variety of redundant compensatory mechanisms to meet both physiological and mechanical demands, represent a radical departure from the dominant reductionist paradigm and have the potential to rapidly advance our understanding of bone fragility and iden-tification of new targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|E

However, previous studies have mainly focused on its roles in osteoblasts, while its specific function in osteoclasts is unknown. This is a clinically important question because neutralizing antibodies against Wnt antagonists are promising new drugs for bone diseases. Here, we show that in osteoclastogenesis, β-catenin is induced during the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) -mediated quiescence-to-proliferation switch but suppressed during the RANKL-mediated proliferation-to-differentiation switch. Genetically, β-catenin deletion blocks osteoclast precursor proliferation, while β-catenin constitutive activation sustains proliferation but prevents osteoclast differentiation, both causing osteopetrosis. In contrast, β-catenin heterozygosity enhances osteoclast differentiation, causing osteoporosis. Biochemically, Wnt activation attenuates whereas Wnt inhibition stimulates osteoclastogenesis. Mechanistically, β-catenin activation increases GATA 2 /Evi 1 expression but abolishes RANKL-induced c-Jun phosphorylation. Therefore, β-catenin exerts a pivotal biphasic and dosage-dependent regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, {{these findings suggest that}} Wnt activation is a more effective treatment for <b>skeletal</b> <b>fragility</b> than previously recognized that confers dual anabolic and anti-catabolic benefits...|$|E
