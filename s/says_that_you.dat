500|$|Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com {{said that}} despite the {{controversy}} the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations [...] "silly", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an [...] "inverted racism which <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't have scary people who are black." [...] It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed [...] "black men" [...] dragging off a screaming white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was [...] "not obviously black". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, [...] "There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [...] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa {{it is hardly surprising}} that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case there is no issue around racism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two key {{concepts}} for understanding Amish practices are their rejection of Hochmut (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) {{and the high}} value they place on Demut (humility) and Gelassenheit (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as [...] "submission" [...] or [...] "letting-be". Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Amish's willingness {{to submit to the}} [...] "Will of Jesus", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on community. Modern innovations like electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity. Electricity lines would be going against the Bible, which <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall not be [...] "Conformed to the world" [...] (Romans 12:2).|$|E
2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson <b>says,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
