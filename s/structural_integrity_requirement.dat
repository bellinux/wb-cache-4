40|$|Engineering design {{based on}} damage {{tolerance}} criteria requires assuming {{the presence of}} flaws that are not detected in production and life-cycle maintenance operations [1, 2]. <b>Structural</b> <b>integrity</b> is assured during service life by material selection and design load control to accommodate flaws that cannot be, or are not detected during final inspection and acceptance. Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is the primary basis for the assumed detection capability (no flaws present that are larger than the assumed size) and {{it is necessary to}} quantify to applied NDE detection capabilities to assure that design / <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>requirements</b> are met. NDE methods involve multiple application parameters and the resultant detection capability varies with each application. For critical structures, it is necessary to quantify detection capabilities for each application and to maintain rigid process control to assure that the detection capability is constant. The smallest flaw detected is not important. The largest flaw missed is the parameter of primary concern...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} structures may {{be vulnerable}} to progressive collapse {{due to lack of}} sufficient continuous reinforcement. In most guidelines, general <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>requirements</b> to reduce progressive collapse have been introduced, but the design of structures against progressive collapse has not been a major consideration. A mitigation scheme is proposed to increase resistance against progressive collapse. This involves the provision of additional reinforcement bars in the mid-layer of reinforced concrete beams. In the research reported here, four specimens were designed and tested subject to quasi-static loading conditions for a column removal scenario. One test specimen was made with conventional steel reinforcement and three specimens were made with additional steel reinforcement at the mid depth of the beam. The quasi-static behaviour of the test specimens were converted to a dynamic representation using an energy balance approach to obtain the progressive collapse load. Test results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the ductility and collapse load of concrete beams subject to a column removal scenario...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMost large wind {{turbines}} currently installed use self-supporting steel tubular towers. The present study aims to per-form a structural {{analysis of a}} 100 kW wind turbine tower, taking into consideration several <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>requirements.</b> Among many requirements of {{the design of a}} tower, the analysis of free vibration has been performed. Details of static and elas-tic stability analysis are also presented. The integrity analysis was performed using the commercial software ANSYS. The height of the tower was defined as 24 m. The tower has been designed as an assembly of four 6 m height modules connected by bolted joints. A special consideration of the module connections will be presented. Flanges are adopted to strengthen the tower modules end, having also the purpose of attaching the modules extremities by pre stressed bolts. Contact elements were adopted for the joint model. A distinct tool provided by ANSYS is the possibility of applying a preload to the connecting bolts. Under the condi-tion of a load produced by the turbine blades thrust, the connected flanges tend to separate at the outer edge. One may obtain the state of deformation of the opened joint. Results of the stress analysis of the joints reveal a major stress concentration {{at the base of the}} bolts heads...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{directly}} {{addressing the}} question, ‘can flax replace E-glass as a reinforcement for structural composites?’, this manuscript adopts a novel comparative case study approach {{to investigate the}} manufacture and mechanical testing of full-scale 3. 5 -m composite rotor blades (suitable for 11 kW turbines) built from flax/polyester and E-glass/polyester. The resin transfer moulded flax blade is 10 % lighter (fibre mass saving of 45 %) than the identical construction E-glass blade. Static flap-bending tests, conducted in accordance to certification standards, confirm that like the E-glass blade, the flax blade satisfies the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>requirements</b> under ‘normal operation’ and ‘worst case’ loading. It is consequently claimed that flax is a potential structural replacement to E-glass for similar composite small wind turbine blade applications. The failure root bending moment and corresponding tip displacement of the flax blade are 11. 6 kNm and 2300 mm, respectively. The blades exhibit distinctly different load–deflection curves and failure modes. The mean flexural rigidity of the flax and E-glass blades {{are estimated to be}} 24. 6 kNm 2 and 43. 4 kNm 2, respectively. It is interesting to find that although flax fibres and their composites are generally recognized for their stiffness, a flax blade cannot compete against an E-glass blade in terms of stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{is unique}} in that two materials, reinforcing steel and concrete (includes in-situ RC, precast, pre and post stressed) are used together to satisfy the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> design <b>requirements</b> in terms of bending and torsion and allowing flexible design layouts. Many structures in built environment particular in Civil Engineering are built from reinforced concrete: bridges, viaducts, buildings, retaining walls, tunnels, tanks, conduits, airport runways etc. However, these structures are continuously being challenged by aggressive external environments and contamination which there are exposed to, such as salts, carbonation, polluted air and acid rain. Invariably, the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> is compromised through rapid deterioration and allowing the concrete to break down, reinforcements to corrode and costs the operator huge amounts for rectification works and in many instances a complete replacement of the concrete structure. With this background, this paper undertakes a forensic investigation of failure of steel reinforcements particularly within the transportation structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{theme of}} the Ninth International Conference on NDE in Relation to <b>Structural</b> <b>Integrity</b> for Nuclear and Pressurised Components was {{the link between the}} {{information}} provided by NDE and the use made of this information in assessing <b>structural</b> <b>integrity.</b> In this context, {{there is a need to}} determine NDE performance against <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>requirements</b> through a process of qualification. There is also a need to develop NDE to address shortcomings revealed by such qualifications or otherwise. Finally, the links between NDE and <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> require strengthening in many areas so that NDE is focussed on the components at greatest risk and provides the precise information required for assessment of integrity. These were the issues addressed by the papers presented at the conference. The level of interest in the subject matter of the conference was maintained from previous events and over 150 suitable papers were submitted for presentation at the conference. This required the programme to be organised in three parallel sessions, each on a specific theme, to provide each paper with sufficient time for presentation and to accommodate all of them within the overall time allocated. A major conference theme was related to the links between NDE and <b>structural</b> <b>integrity.</b> One of the three sessions contained all the qualification and <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> papers, including those on risk-informed inspection. This session also included papers on NDE reliability, material properties measurement and mathematical predictions of inspection performance through modelling. A second session was devoted to the theme of development of new inspection methods. The third session was concerned with inspections of specific reactor components. Two developments noted at the previous conferences in Budapest, San Diego, Yokohama and Berlin were the increased number of papers on the subjects of austenitic and bi-metallic weld inspection and also the use of phased arrays. These were also well represented in the programme of the conference in Seattle and are clearly topics which continue to arouse a high level of international interest. Seventeen countries were represented in the final programme from Europe, America, Asia and Africa. In the event, the conference was highly successful. The 156 presented papers maintained the high promise suggested by the written abstracts and the programme was chaired in a professional and efficient way by the session chairmen who were selected for their international standing in the subject. The number of delegates, at 312, was also highly gratifying, showing the high level of international interest in the subject. This is also indicated by the large number of countries, 17, represented by the delegates. These Proceedings provide the permanent record of what was presented. They indicate the state of development at the time of writing of all aspects of this important topic and will be invaluable to all workers in the field for that reason. JRC.

50|$|A {{principal}} aim {{of a cultural}} conservator {{is to reduce the}} rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for <b>structural</b> <b>integrity,</b> or cultural <b>requirements</b> for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdditive Manufacturing (AM) {{technology}} {{is capable of}} building 3 D near-net-shaped functional parts directly from computer models, using unit materials, such as powder or wire. AM offers superior geometrical flexibility with significantly reduced manufacturing lead time, energy, and material waste. These benefits make AM desirable for critical transportation applications, providing that <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> and performance <b>requirements</b> are met or exceeded. In this study, structural materials fabricated by two AM techniques were investigated: Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM). Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys were produced using both methods and various processing conditions, which resulted in different microstructures and mechanical properties given their unique thermal histories. Characteristic microstructures were determined for all cases.

40|$|Aircraft {{structural}} components {{may have}} known “hot spots ” where any initial damage is anticipated to occur or has consistently {{been observed in}} the field. Automated inspection of these areas, or hot spot monitoring, may offer significant time and cost savings for aircraft maintainers, particularly when the hot spots exist {{in areas that are}} difficult to access or where traditional NDE inspection methods will not work. This paper discusses the development of a hot spot monitoring system for a metallic lug component using ultrasonic elastic waves generated by piezoceramic elements. The development process utilizes a formal SHM system design framework developed by Boeing and AFRL and uses a multi-step approach progressing from simple coupon tests to the full scale component for system validation. A Probability of Detection (POD) approach is being developed to quantify the performance of the SHM system based on the selected operation scenario and demonstrate the capability relative to current Aircraft <b>Structural</b> <b>Integrity</b> Program (ASIP) <b>requirements.</b> Further POD verification and validation plans to address system reliability and operational conditions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} Low Impact Docking System (iLIDS) {{provides a}} structural arrangement {{that allows for}} visiting vehicles to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) (Fig 1). The iLIDS docking units are mechanically joined together {{by a series of}} active and passive latch hooks. In order to preserve docking capability at the existing Russian docking interfaces, the iLIDS latch hooks are required to conform to the existing Russian design. The latch hooks are classified as being fail-safe. Since the latch hooks are fail-safe, the hooks are not fracture critical and a fatigue based service life assessment will satisfy the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>requirements.</b> Constant amplitude fatigue testing to failure on four sets of active/passive iLIDS latch hooks was performed at load magnitudes of 10, 11, and 12 kips. Failure analysis of the hook fatigue failures identified multi-site fatigue initiation that was effectively centered about the hook mid-plane (consistent with the 3 D model results). The fatigue crack initiation distribution implies that the fatigue damage accumulation effectively results in a very low aspect ratio surface crack (which can be simulated as thru-thickness crack). Fatigue damage progression resulted in numerous close proximity fatigue crack initiation sites. It was not possible to determine if fatigue crack coalescence occurs during cyclic loading or as result of the fast fracture response. The presence of multiple fatigue crack initiation sites on different planes will result in the formation of ratchet marks as the cracks coalesce. Once the stable fatigue crack becomes unstable and the fast fracture advances across the remaining ligament and the plane stress condition at a free-surface will result in failure along a 45 deg. shear plane (slant fracture) and the resulting inclined edge is called a shear lip. The hook thickness on the plane of fatigue crack initiation is 0. 787 ". The distance between the shear lips on this plane was on the order of 0. 48 " and it was effectively centered about the mid-plane of the section. The numerous ratchet marks between the shear lips on the fracture initiation plane are indicative of multiple fatigue initiation sites within this region. The distribution of the fatigue damage about the centerline of the hook is consistent with the analytical results that demonstrate peak stress/strain response at the mid-plane that decreases {{in the direction of the}} hook outer surfaces. Scanning electron microscope images of the failed sections detected fatigue crack striations in close proximity to the free surface of the hook radius. These findings were documented at three locations on the fracture surface : 1) adjacent to the left shear lip, 2) adjacent to the right shear lip, and 3) near the centerline of the section. The features of the titanium fracture surface did not allow for a determination of a critical crack size via identification of the region where the fatigue crack propagation became unstable. The fracture based service life projections where benchmarked with strain-life analyses. The strainrange response in the hook radius was defined via the correlated finite element models and the modified method of universal slopes was incorporated to define the strain-life equation for the titanium alloy. The strain-life assessment confirmed that the fracture based projections were reasonable for the loading range of interest. Based upon the analysis and component level fatigue test data a preliminary service life capability for the iLIDS active and passive hooks of 2 lifetimes is projected (includes a scatter factor of 4) ...|$|R

40|$|Modular {{construction}} {{is a relatively}} {{a new form of}} high-rise construction, which involves the assembly of prefabricated structural modules. In contrast to traditional on-site construction methods, it allows for parallel processes to occur where the modules can be manufactured offsite, before or during preliminary on-site works, and then be transported to the site and assembled progressively. However, modular construction raises some concerns, such as load bearing capacity and <b>structural</b> <b>integrity,</b> in comparison to traditional in-situ construction. Hybrid construction processes may also be required in order to satisfy load capacity requirements, particularly for high-rise buildings. <b>Structural</b> <b>integrity</b> must be fully engineered into the modules during the early design processes and include consideration of manufacturing, handling, transportation and lifting issues as well as their long-term post-assembly <b>integrity.</b> <b>Structural</b> <b>integrity</b> may also need to encompass the capacity to resist seismic forces for buildings constructed in earthquake-prone areas.
