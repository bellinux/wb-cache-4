25|$|Seal skins {{have been}} used by {{aboriginal}} people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make fur coats.

One high-end fashion designer, Donatella Versace, has begun to use seal pelts, while others, such as Calvin Klein, <b>Stella</b> <b>McCartney,</b> Tommy Hilfiger, and Ralph Lauren, refrain from using any kind of fur.|$|E
