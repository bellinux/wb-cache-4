She entrusts the two with guarding her Princess Plant. However, when she departs, Finn and Jake party too hard with the plant, killing it. They then decide on a way to journey into the Land of the Dead and to reclaim the flower's soul from Death himself. For an unspecified price, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) teaches the two how to get into the Underworld, and he instructs Finn and Jake also to tell Death that he <b>said</b> <b>hello.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Spokespeople for Sanrio have <b>said</b> that <b>Hello</b> Kitty {{does not}} have a mouth because they want people to [...] "project their {{feelings}} onto the character" [...] and [...] "be happy or sad together with Hello Kitty." [...] Another explanation Sanrio has given for her lack of a mouth is that she [...] "speaks from the heart. She's Sanrio's ambassador to the world and isn't bound to any particular language". Representatives for Sanrio have <b>said</b> they see <b>Hello</b> Kitty as a symbol of friendship, and they hope she will encourage friendship between people across the world. While there has been some speculation that Hello Kitty has its origins in Maneki Neko, and that the name Hello Kitty itself is a back-translation of Maneki Neko, which means beckoning cat in English (others disagree).|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, [...] "Don't Lose My Number", {{a single}} that Collins only {{released}} in the US, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 charts during late September 1985, and the B-side of the single was [...] "We <b>Said</b> <b>Hello</b> Goodbye". Collins had difficulty conceptualising a plot for the corresponding music video. He decided to create a gag video based on this difficulty. In the video, he talks to clients and directors, all giving him crazy conceptual ideas. Collins parodies several other videos, including those by Michael Jackson, David Lee Roth, Elton John, The Cars, and The Police. The singer also filmed parodies of Mad Max, western films, and samurai movies.|$|E
500|$|... "We <b>Said</b> <b>Hello</b> Goodbye" [...] {{appeared}} as a B-side to [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and [...] "Don't Lose My Number" [...] originally, and as an [...] "extra track" [...] on the CD release of the album. Producer Arif Mardin composed the beginning portion of the song. A remix of the song with additional guitars and without an orchestra was released the following year (1986) on the soundtrack for the movie, Playing for Keeps. This remixed version received some radio airplay {{around the time of}} the soundtrack's release (which coincided with the No Jacket Required period), though it did not chart. Collins has mused that the song is unfairly classed as a [...] "second class citizen", stating that the song would have been looked at differently if it were added to the album. According to The New York Times reviewer Caryn James, the song is [...] "a straightforward comment on leaving home".|$|E
2500|$|Gus van Go {{was known}} for having helmed the debut album by the Stills, whom he managed and whose success felt reassuring for Priestess. Heppner told the Montreal Mirror in December 2005 that he trusted van Go's {{judgment}} and that the producer [...] "had every drum sound and guitar sound already figured out before he even pressed 'record'". The producer employed such things as shakers, tambourines, and vocal treatments, and Heppner has also stated that piano was occasionally used on the album for its [...] "percussive" [...] quality. In particular, cowbell was used on [...] "Run Home". Even though the polished sound of the record was initially welcomed by the band as being something [...] "different" [...] for a hard rock record, the result of van Go emulating the sounds of well-known older metal records, the group came to be rather dissatisfied with it over time. While initially liking the idea, Heppner later described the album as merely being twelve of their songs in recorded form, and not actually intended to represent the group's live sound; the band pride themselves on their concert performances the most. In comparison to Prior to the Fire, the next album Priestess recorded, he <b>said</b> <b>Hello</b> Master is [...] "a really weird sounding album [...] everything is so tight and really produced." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hello Kitty's {{popularity}} began waning in Japan {{before the}} year 2000. In 2002, Hello Kitty lost her place as the top-grossing character in Japan in the Character Databank popularity chart and has never recovered. In a 2010 survey, she was in third place behind Anpanman and Pikachu from Pokémon. In 2010, The New York Times described Hello Kitty's characterization as [...] "not compelling enough to draw many fans" [...] and wrote that analysts called the characterization [...] "weak." [...] They also <b>said</b> that <b>Hello</b> Kitty not having a mouth has dampened her success as an animated TV character.|$|R

A 1989 {{description}} of the couple's life in the 1980s said, ...On Jan. 17, 1981, ... D'Arbanville ... met Johnson at an L.A. restaurant. [...] "I saw this gorgeous guy," [...] she says, [...] "and I ran after him. saying, 'Hey you.' It {{turned out to be}} Donny. I said, 'So, Donny, {{how many times have you}} been married?' He said, 'Three.' I <b>said,</b> 'Say <b>hello</b> to No. 4.'...." [...] Johnson ditched his date, Tanya Tucker, and spent the night with Patti. [...] "One month later," [...] she says, [...] "I was pregnant." [...] The couple planned to marry that fall, but D'Arbanville changed her mind. [...] "I didn't see the point," [...] she says. [...] "Besides, there were areas in which we didn't get along." [...] Drinking was one of them. Shortly after becoming pregnant, Patti sobered up. [...] "Donny didn't," [...] she says [...] "and we grew further apart." ... Johnson eventually stopped drinking with D'Arbanville's help.... Miami Vice took Johnson to Florida in 1984, and the couple split a year later....|$|R

40|$|Translation begins] Tuesday My Darling, Well, {{another day}} has gone by- I didn’t mail {{the letter that}} I wrote you last night so I’ll mail it with this. Anyway, today I got three dresses – 2 for me and 1 for mother. One is red + white print. The other is {{a black and white}} western print top with a black crepe skirt. Hope you like them but it’s too late now. Darling, only {{nineteen}} more days, golly, and we’ll be married. It’s snowing madly out. What a night! Just as the weather gets nice and the snow is melting + you can walk all night. Then it snows again- what a life. I’ll sure be glad to get down South. But then I’ll probably wish it were cold again. Gee, honey, 19 days isn’t very long. It seems years but when you think it’s less than three weeks, it doesn’t seem so long. This week will go pretty fast for me because I’m not working and have something planned for every minute. Bobbie leaves for Texas day after tomorrow. Tomorrow I’m going to see her + Mom. They’re bringing Ricky to Mrs. Nisou’s house to stay until Bobbie gets home from Texas. Then mom + Bobbie are coming over to see my things. Then we’re going up to their house, I guess. It’s too bad that Bobbie can’t see my wedding dress but it isn’t finished being fitted yet. She wants us to send her a picture right away. I sure hope they come out well. You take such marvelous picture and I always take a horrible one. Honey, I’m so angry most of the dresses that I wanted aren’t being cut. What a time I’ve been having trying to get them. Golly, honey, you’ve sure {{been doing a lot of}} flying, haven’t you? I hope you’re not too tired when we get down there. When are you going to start instruments? Wish that they’d get that over with, darling, so that you’d have that off your mind. How come they have changed your address? Are you in a different sqdrn or what? I didn’t know they let you fly two cross countries at once. How many hours have you now darling. Not too many more to go. As you probably know by now Charlotte’s not coming down with us. So now you don’t need to get her a date. I like my hair better in those pictures than the way I’ve been wearing it lately. And I don’t like the way it was when you were at Stewart. What else decides whether you’re going to be a 2 nc Lieutenant? When do you find out what you’ll be, not until 10 days before graduation? What is the deciding factor? No, honey, I didn’t see Winged Victory. It wasn’t playing. It was “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” and we didn’t get to see it. “Winged Victory is coming this weekend and we’ll probably see it Friday, Woody and I. It’s really a shame that Mona isn’t given a chance to look as beautiful as she is. If they’d only let her act her age- oh, well. She’s had pretty good parts so far. I’ll have to see “Roughly Speaking” when it comes. It’s such a relief to know that I don’t have to work in that place any more. Golly, it really was getting me down. Yeah, I think all men are babies! Yes, women act their ages. Well, you haven’t me the right people yet. What am I saying. Well, you may be glad that I’ve gained some weight but I’m furious. What “spots” could I have used some. It was the wrong ones that I gained it in! I feel much better since I’ve had my tonsils out + as soon as I begin losing weight again I’ll feel real good. But as soon as I gain I feel awful. Now that I’m not working any more my mind will be more at ease too. Well, honey, Woody has complete faith in Steve. She hasn’t heard from him in two weeks now. He sure is handing her a line. I just hope he means it. Woody really would feel awful if she thought he didn’t’ mean it. The cigarette shortage is really bad around here. People stand in line for everything! You should see them at a store. It’s really pitiful. Honey, gee, I miss you so. It seems so darned long since the last time we were together- I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you but I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying. It won’t be long, now, honey til we’re together again. Oh honey, I think it would be better for mother if we spent Thursday night in Atlanta- she’s not in any condition to travel. Rode home with Dick Eddington and Dick Molke and Mike Romeo. They all <b>said</b> to say <b>hello</b> + wish you luck. Started to say send their love then I realized what I was saying. Oh, have you seen “To Have And Have Not”? What a picture! It was wonderful. I like Lauren Bacall. She was really good- she’s a very good actress. Went to the same dramatic school that Woody is going to now. Well, darling, I’ve got to get to bed. Bob Hope will be on soon + I never can write when he’s on. I love you so. It won’t be long until we’re together. I’ll love you, Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R
