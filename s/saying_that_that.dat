25|$|Bernhardt {{was earning}} a {{substantial}} amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from Parc Monceau. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater impresario named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances {{in the homes of}} wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie. When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of Phédre on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, Le Misantrhope and Les Précieuses.|$|E

The new quests drew praise from reviewers, though the puzzle sections were criticized. In particular, Dan Stapleton (IGN) expressed admiration for the new quests but said that the puzzle rooms were [...] "so hard to fail I'm not sure why Bethesda bothered". He also mentioned that the Far Harbor expansion contained some of the strongest quest content in Fallout 4. Peter Brown (GameSpot) commended the addition of [...] "hours of side quests driven by curious characters", and the staff at Game Central agreed. Matt Wittaker (Hardcore Gamer) appreciated the quests: he praised the main questline for its focus on [...] "moral ambiguity and tough choices", <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was what Fallout fans were seeking. The reviewers for Game Revolution and GameCentral disliked the puzzles, as did Jack de Quidt (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) who regarded them as very frustrating even though he felt they were [...] "a {{small part of the}} release". Both de Quidt and the Game Revolution reviewer considered the engine insufficient for the intricate puzzle sequences. Several reviewers made comparisons to the video game Minecraft when talking about the block-related content added in the expansion.|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR BROTHER,--It was {{at least}} two weeks before I left New York, that I {{received}} my last letter from home: and since then, not a word have I heard from any of you. And now, since I think of it, it wasn't a letter, either, but the last number of the [...] "Daily Journal," [...] <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> paper was sold, and I very naturally supposed from that, that the family had disbanded, and taken up winter quarters in St. Louis. Therefore, I have been writing to Pamela, till I've tired of it, and have received no answer. I have been writing for {{the last two or three}} weeks, to send Ma some money, but devil take me if I knew where she was, and so the money has slipped out of my pocket somehow or other, but I have a dollar left, and a good deal owing to me, which will be paid next Monday. I shall enclose the dollar in this letter, and you can hand it to her. I know it's a small amount, but then it will buy her a handkerchief, and at the same time serve as a specimen of the kind of stuff we are paid with in Philadelphia, for you see it's against the law, in Pennsylvania, to keep or pass a bill of less denomination than $5. I have only seen two or three bank bills since I have been in the State. On Monday the hands are paid off in sparkling gold, fresh from the Mint; so your dreams are not troubled with the fear of having doubtful money in your pocket.|$|E
6000|$|But how {{tolerant}} was his temper, and how humble his spirit; for {{though he}} was so great, he both honoured exceedingly the canon of the Church, and wished to put every ecclesiastic before himself in honour. For to the bishops and presbyters he was not ashamed to bow his head; and if a deacon ever came to him {{for the sake of}} profit, he discoursed with him on what was profitable, but in prayer he gave place to him, not being ashamed even himself to learn from him. {65} For he often asked questions, and deigned to listen to all present, confessing that he was profited if any one said aught that was useful. Moreover, his countenance had great and wonderful grace; and this gift too he had from the Saviour. For if he was present among the multitude of monks, and any one who did not previously know him wished to see him, as soon as he came he passed by all the rest, and ran to Antony himself, as if attracted by his eyes. He did not differ from the rest in stature or in stoutness, but in the steadiness of his temper, and purity of his soul; for as his soul was undisturbed, his outward senses were undisturbed likewise, so that the cheerfulness of his soul made his face cheerful, and from the movements of his body the stedfastness of his soul could be perceived, according to the Scripture, [...] "When the heart is cheerful the countenance is glad; but when sorrow comes it scowleth." [...] . And he was altogether wonderful in faith, and pious, for he never communicated with the Meletian {66a} schismatics, knowing their malice and apostasy from the beginning; nor did he converse amicably with Manichaeans or any other heretics, save only to exhort them to be converted to piety. For he held that their friendship and converse was injury and ruin to the soul. So also he detested the heresy of the Arians, and exhorted all not to approach them, nor hold their misbelief. {66b} In fact, when certain of the Ariomanites came to him, having discerned them and found them impious, he chased them out of the mountain, saying that their words were worse than serpent's poison; and when the Arians once pretended that he was of the same opinion as they, he was indignant and fierce against them. Then being sent for by the bishops and all the brethren, he went down from the mountain, and entering Alexandria he denounced the Arians, <b>saying,</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was the last heresy, and the forerunner of Antichrist; and he taught the people that the Son of God was not a created thing, neither made from nought, but that he is the Eternal Word and Wisdom of the Essence of the Father; wherefore also it is impious to say {{there was a time when}} he was not, for he was always the Word co-existent with the Father. Wherefore he said, [...] "Do not have any communication with these most impious Arians; for there is no communion between light and darkness. For you are pious Christians: but they, when they say that the Son of God and the Word, who is from the Father, is a created being, differ nought from the heathen, because they worship the creature instead of God the Creator. {67} Believe rather that the whole creation itself is indignant against them, because they number the Creator and Lord of all, in whom all things are made, among created things." [...] All the people therefore rejoiced at hearing that Christ-opposing heresy anathematized by such a man; and all those in the city ran together to see Antony and the Greeks, {68a} and those who are called their priests {68b} came into the church, wishing to see the man of God; for all called him by that name, because there the Lord cleansed many by him from daemons, and healed those who were out of their mind. And many heathens wished only to touch the old man, believing that it would be of use to them; and in fact as many became Christians in those few days, as would have been usually converted in a year. And when some thought that the crowd troubled him, and therefore turned all away from him, he quietly said that they were not more numerous than the fiends with whom he wrestled on the mountain. But when he left the city, and we were setting him on his journey, when we came to the gate a certain woman called to him: [...] "Wait, man of God, my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil; wait, I beseech thee, lest I too harm myself with running after thee." [...] The old man hearing it, and being asked by us, waited willingly. But when the woman drew near, the child dashed itself on the ground; and when Antony prayed and called on the name of Christ, it rose up sound, the unclean spirit having gone out; and the mother blessed God, and we all gave thanks: and he himself rejoiced at leaving the city for the mountain, as for his own home.|$|E

6000|$|I wrote you a scrabbly {{note from}} Ravenna {{a few days}} since--but I must follow it up, without delay, with {{something}} better. I came on here an hour afterwards, and shall remain till June 1st or 2nd. I find Rome deliriously cool and empty, and still very pleasing {{in spite of the}} [...] "ruining" [...] which has been going on so long and of which one has heard so much, i.e., the redemption and cockneyfication of the ruins. This [...] "changes" [...] immensely--as everyone says; but I find myself, I am afraid, so much more changed--since I first knew and rhapsodized over it, that I am bound in justice to hold Rome the less criminal of the two. I am thinking a little about going down--if the coolness lasts--for three or four days to Naples; but I haven't decided. I feel rather hard and heartless to be prattling about these touristries to you, with the sad picture I have had these last weeks of your--William's--state of suffering. But it is only a way of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> state makes one feel it to be the greater duty for me to be as well as I can. Absit omen! Your so interesting letter of the 6th dictated to Alice speaks of the possibility of your abscess continuing not to heal--but I trust the event has long ere this reassured, comforted and liberated you. Meanwhile may Alice have smoothed your pillow as even she has never smoothed it before.... As regards the life, the power, the temper, the humour and beauty and expressiveness of the Diary in itself--these things were partly [...] "discounted" [...] to me in advance by so much of Alice's talk during her last years--and my constant association with her--which led me often to reflect about her extraordinary force of mind and character, her whole way of taking life--and death--in very much {{the manner in which the}} book does. I find in its pages, for instance, many things I heard her say. None the less I have been immensely impressed with the thing as a revelation of a moral and personal picture. It is heroic in its individuality, its independence--its face-to-face with the universe for and by herself--and the beauty and eloquence with which she often expresses this, let alone the rich irony and humour, constitute (I wholly agree with you) a new claim for the family renown. This last element--her style, her power to write--are indeed to me a delight--for I have had many letters from her. Also it brings back to me all sorts of things I am glad to keep--I mean things that happened, hours, occasions, conversations--brings them back with a strange, living richness. But it also puts before me what I was tremendously conscious of in her life-time--that the extraordinary intensity of her will and personality really would have made the equal, the reciprocal, life of a [...] "well" [...] person--in the usual world--almost impossible to her--so that her disastrous, her tragic health was in a manner the only solution for her of the practical problem of life--as it suppressed the element of equality, reciprocity, etc. The violence of her reaction against her British ambiente, against everything English, engenders some of her most admirable and delightful passages--but I feel in reading them, as I always felt in talking with her, that inevitably she simplified too much, shut up in her sick room, exercised her wondrous vigour of judgment on too small a scrap of what really surrounded her. It would have been modified in many ways if she had lived with them (the English) more--seen more of the men, etc. But doubtless it is fortunate for the fun and humour of the thing that it wasn't modified--as surely the critical emotion (about them,) the essence of much of their nature, was never more beautifully expressed. As for her allusions to H.--they fill me with tears and cover me with blushes.... I find an immense eloquence in her passionate [...] "radicalism"--her most distinguishing feature almost--which, in her, was absolutely direct and original (like everything that was in her,) unreflected, uncaught from entourage or example. It would really have made her, had she lived in the world, a feminine [...] "political force." [...] But had she lived in the world and seen things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions. However, what comes out in the book--as it came out to me in fact--is that she was really an Irishwoman; transplanted, transfigured--yet none the less fundamentally national--in spite of her so much larger and finer than Irish intelligence. She felt the Home Rule question absolutely as only an Irishwoman (not anglicised) could. It was a tremendous emotion with her--inexplicable in any other way--but perfectly explicable by [...] "atavism." [...] What a pity she wasn't born there--and had her health for it. She would have been (if, always, she had not fallen a victim to disgust--a large [...] "if") a national glory! But I am writing too much and my late hindrances have left me with tremendous arrears of correspondence. I thank you, dear Alice, caramente, for your sweet letter received two or three weeks before William's. I crudely hope you won't let your house--so as to have it to go to in the summer. Otherwise what will become of you. I dig my nose into the fleshiest parts of the young Francis. Tell Peggy I cling to her--and to Harry too, and Billy not less.... I haven't sent you [...] "The Yellow Book"--on purpose; and indeed I have been weeks and weeks receiving a copy of it myself. I say on purpose because although my little tale which ushers it in ("The Death of the Lion") appears to have had, for a thing of mine, an unusual success, I hate too much the horrid aspect and company of the whole publication. And yet I am again to be intimately, conspicuously associated with the 2d number. It is for gold and to oblige the worshipful Harland (the editor).
