Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s.

Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E

40|$|Small lounge area in {{foreground}} {{is available}} for all key-holders to the Faculty Lounge. Doane Library’s Storage and Space Committee has announced {{the opening of a}} pleasant new reading and study space for faculty. Located on the 4 th floor in the West Wing Study Tower this room is graced with a wall of southern exposure windows for bright afternoon lighting. With sixteen oak study carrels and small lockers for personal belongings this is a perfect space for faculty to “get away from it all ” and work without interruption. The room is wired for computer connectivity and a telephone {{is available for}} faculty use. Since there are limited spaces available they are being assigned on a first come first served basis. The environmental conditions in the previous Faculty Reading Room have continued to deteriorate over time. Its location above the heating/air conditioning mechanical room and near ground level contributed to its musty atmosphere. Because the doors had to be kept closed and locked at all times the resulting stale air and dampness made for very unpleasant work space. The second floor West Wing Study Tower area has been opened, painted and cleaned. It will now be used as muchneeded student study space in New faculty lounge in the 4 th floor West Wing Study Tower (note the lockers in the background). the Periodicals area. The doors will be kept open for proper air circulation. We believe these changes will benefit both faculty and students.

40|$|First of all, I {{thank my}} {{supervisor}} David Hsu for his guidance and support during my studies. His dedication to research has {{inspired me to}} work harder on becoming a better researcher. I am grateful for the time and attention he has generously given. I thank my thesis comittee Alan Cheng, Leow Wee Kheng, and the external examiner for reading this thesis. Alan has introduced me to David when I {{was looking for a}} research supervisor. I am also grateful for his inputs on the WIS strategy. Wee Kheng has provided a space for me in his lab. His advises I often overheard in the lab has broaden my view on research. In the beginning of my graduate studies, I had a chance to work with Gilardo Sánchez-Ante. I thank him for being an unofficial co-supervisor, a senior, and a colleague, when I need them most. Furthermore, it is always fun to listen to his stories on life and research. I am grateful for the chance to work with Jean-Claude Latombe. His insights and comments have significantly improved this thesis and have encouraged me to dig deeper. I spent a semester in INRIA Rhône-Alpes under the supervision of Thierry Fraichard. The experience has broaden my view on various research in motion planning. I thank Thierry for the opportunity and guidance he has given me while I was in INRIA. Financial support for my graduate studies have been provided by NUS and INRIA International Internship program. Most part of this thesis was written in a <b>study</b> <b>carrel</b> of the NUS science library. For that, I am grateful to the librarians and cleaners that have kept the study carrels neat and clean...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of various auditory metronomic rates on addition performance of selected second-graders in Lindsay, California, and thereby test the theory that when such rates "approach and reach personal tempo the individual enjoys an optimal circumstance for learning" (Barsch, 1974, p. 5). Sixty second-grade students were placed in six groups (ten in each group) based on sex and performance on the mathematics section of the Primary I Metropolitan Achievement Test (High-, Medium-, and Low mathematics levels). Each subject was then individually tested on eight, one-minute, equivalent Addition Computation Tests under different auditory environments (metronome beating at 40 beats per minute (b/m), 80 b/m, 120 b/m, 160 b/m, a self-selected Individual Rate, White Noise, and Reduced Auditory Environment). The Classroom Noise condition was produced from a cassette recorder, while all other conditions reached subjects via headsets. Each completed test was given four different scores: 1) total number of addition responses, 2) number of correct addition responses, 3) number of incorrect addition responses, and 4) adjusted correct addition response score (20 glut twice the number of correct responses minus the number of incorrect responses). For each of the four sets of data, a three-way analysis of variance and F values were computed. An analysis of the data revealed no significant differences (other than those which were a product of the design) for any of the four sets of data, under each of the three null hypotheses: HO₁: There are no significant mean score differences between groups. HO₂: There are no significant mean score differences between auditory stimuli conditions. HO₃: There is no significant interaction between group levels and auditory stimuli conditions. The conclusion that an "optimal circumstance for learning" (Barsch, 1974, p. 5) was not provided is supported by the analysis of variance which reveals that the metronomic rates presented to subjects did not in any predictable fashion affect addition performance. Subjects were able to screen-out their immediate auditory environments and perform the task at hand. It is possible that this screening-out process may have been aided by increased visual and tactile stimulation (looking around the room, at the experimenter, up and down the <b>study</b> <b>carrel,</b> and using their fingers as counters [...] touching them to their chins, cheeks, chests, and arms). It is also possible that the exposure times (30 seconds prior to testing and 60 seconds during testing) for each auditory stimuli condition may not have been long enough to affect performance. None of the experimental conditions proved to significantly affect group performance; however, large standard deviations in the scores obtained by groups (small standard deviations would be expected because of the high correlations between the Addition Computation Tests and the attempt which was made to place subjects into somewhat homogenous mathematics performance levels), under each of the auditory stimuli conditions, suggest that individual differences may be hidden by groupings, or that other groupings might reveal significance...|$|E
