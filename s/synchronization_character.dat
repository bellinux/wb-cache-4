40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for combining {{a plurality of}} 8 B/ 10 B encoded DVB-ASI input streams into an aggregate output data stream allows a receiving device to synchronize to the aggregate output data stream by mapping a <b>synchronization</b> <b>character</b> to a unique character if the <b>synchronization</b> <b>character</b> occurs in a first timeslot of the aggregate output data stream. This unique character allows a receiving device to synchronize to the aggregate output data stream. If the <b>synchronization</b> <b>character</b> occurs in a timeslot other than the first timeslot, the <b>synchronization</b> <b>character</b> is mapped to another special character that denotes that no data {{is present in the}} timeslot. In addition, if the <b>synchronization</b> <b>character</b> occurs in a timeslot after the last timeslot in which data may be placed in the aggregate output data stream, the <b>synchronization</b> <b>character</b> can be mapped to yet another special character denoting that no data is available in the timeslot.

5000|$|In some {{communication}} systems, {{a receiver}} can achieve <b>character</b> <b>synchronization</b> from an undifferentiated bit stream, or start-of-header synchronization from a byte stream, without the overhead of an explicit syncword. For example, the FSK441 protocol achieves <b>character</b> <b>synchronization</b> by synchronizing on any [...] "space" [...] {{characters in the}} message in effect, every [...] "space" [...] character in the message does double duty as a syncword. For example, CRC-based framing achieves <b>character</b> and start-of-header <b>synchronization.</b>|$|R

500|$|For the remake Maken Shao, {{gameplay}} remains {{mostly the}} same, {{but with several}} added mechanics and a shift to a third-person perspective focused behind {{the back of the}} character. Combat options remain the same, but character abilities are now increased through combat by gaining [...] "Image points", experience points earned from defeated enemies. After gathering enough Image points, new skills are unlocked for the current character, with the Maken's compatibility or [...] "synchronization" [...] with that character increasing alongside it; increased <b>synchronization</b> with a <b>character</b> raises their basic attributes such as health and attack power.|$|R

5000|$|All frame formats {{begin with}} at least two SYN bytes. The binary form of the SYN byte has the {{property}} that no rotation of the byte is equal to the original.This allows the receiver to find the beginning of a frame by searching the received bit stream for the SYN pattern. When this is found, tentative byte synchronization has been achieved. If the next character is also a SYN, <b>character</b> <b>synchronization</b> has been achieved. The receiver then searches for a character that can start a frame. Characters outside of this set are described as [...] "leading graphics". They are sometimes used to identify the sender of a frame. Long messages have SYN bytes inserted approximately every second to maintain synchronization. These are ignored by the receiver.|$|R
50|$|Bit-oriented {{protocols}} are synchronous protocols {{that view}} the transmitted data as {{a stream of}} bits with no semantics, or meaning. Control codes are {{defined in terms of}} bit sequences instead of <b>characters.</b> <b>Synchronization</b> is maintained on an idle line by transmitting a predefined sequence of bits. Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) specifies that a station continue transmitting a sequence of '1' bits on an idle line. Data to be transmitted on an idle line is prefixed with a special bit sequence '01111110'b, called a flag. SDLC was the first bit-oriented protocol developed, and it was later adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC). Other examples of bit-oriented protocols are Logical Link Control (LLC) - IEEE 802.2, and ANSI Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP).|$|R

The ability to interactively edit human motion data is essential for character animation. We present a novel motion editing technique that allows the user to manipulate synchronized multiple character motions interactively. Our Laplacian motion editing method formulates the interaction among multiple characters {{as a collection of}} linear constraints and enforces the constraints, while the user directly manipulates the motion of characters in both spatial and temporal domains. Various types of manipulation handles are provided to specify absolute/relative spatial location, direction, time, duration, and <b>synchronization</b> of multiple <b>characters.</b> The capability of non-sequential discrete editing is incorporated into our motion editing interfaces, so continuous and discrete editing is performed simultaneously and seamlessly. We demonstrate that the synchronized multiple character motions are synthesized and manipulated at interactive rates using spatiotemporal constraints...|$|R
5000|$|The {{final game}} mode in Kinect Star Wars is Galactic Dance-off. Here players control {{one of several}} famous Star Wars {{characters}} {{through the use of}} the Kinect. Gameplay is similar to the Dance Central series in which players must dance in synchronization with the on-screen character. Cues to upcoming dance moves are shown to the player to ensure they can stay in <b>synchronization</b> with the <b>character.</b> The song selection consists of parodies with title and lyrics rewritten in a Star Wars theme. For example, Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] is rewritten as [...] "Hologram Girl", and Village People's [...] "Y.M.C.A." [...] is rewritten as [...] "Empire Today". Dance locales are themed to the character and a particular moment for them in the Star Wars saga story; for example, Princess Leia's dance takes place in front of Jabba the Hutt, and Han Solo's dance takes place in the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method to {{reconstruct}} 3 D charac-ter models from video. The main conceptual contribution {{is that the}} reconstruction can be performed from a sin-gle uncalibrated video sequence which shows the charac-ter in articulated motion. We reduce this generalized prob-lem setting to the easier case of multi-view reconstruction of a rigid scene by applying pose <b>synchronization</b> of the <b>character</b> between frames. This is enabled by two central technical contributions. First, based on a generic charac-ter shape template, a new mesh-based technique for accu-rate shape tracking is proposed. This method successfully handles the complex occlusions issues, which occur when tracking the motion of an articulated character. Secondly, we show that image-based 3 D reconstruction becomes pos-sible by deforming the tracked character shapes as-rigid-as-possible into a common pose using motion capture data. After pose synchronization, several partial reconstructions can be merged {{in order to create}} a single, consistent 3 D character model. We integrated these components into a simple interactive framework, which allows for straightfor-ward generation and animation of 3 D models for a variety of character shapes from uncalibrated monocular video. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the perceived eeriness of a virtual character with the perception of human-likeness for some attributes of motion and sound. 100 participants were asked to rate 13 video clips of 12 different virtual characters and one human. The results indicate that attributes of motion and sound do exaggerate the uncanny phenomenon and how frightening that character is perceived to be. Strong correlations were identified for the perceived eeriness for a character with how human-like a character's voice sounded, how human-like facial expression appeared and the <b>synchronization</b> of the <b>character's</b> sound with lip movement; characters rated as the least synchronized were perceived to be the most frightening. Based on the results of this study, this paper seeks to define an initial set of hypotheses for the fear-evoking aspects of character facial rendering and vocalization in survival horror games that can be used by game designers seeking to increase the fear factor in the genre and that will form the basis of further experiments which, it is hoped, will lead to a conceptual framework for the uncanny...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine inbreeding depression in S 1 maize lines for reproductive and yield related traits, at NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar, Pakistan, in two successive seasons during 2002. Maize variety"Pahari" was selfed for one generation and 63 S 1 lines were evaluated using "lattice square design" with two replications along with the parental population. Days to mid silking and mid pollen shed (anthesis), plant height and ear height (cm), and 200 grain weight (g) showed inbreeding depression with varying degrees. Severe inbreeding depression was observed for yield with the average of 709 kg ha- 1. Inbreeding depression for 200 grains weight averaged 19 g, while for plant height and ear height it was calculated as 33 and 16 cm. Inbreeding depression for days to mid silking and pollen shed was lower as compared to morphological and yield components. Silking and pollen shed were delayed by 1. 8 and 1. 5 days on the average, respectively, {{as compared to the}} parental variety. Yield was significantly correlated with all maturity and morphological characters. Maturity characters were positively and significantly correlated with each other, showing good <b>synchronization</b> in maturity <b>characters,</b> while they were negatively and significantly correlated with yield components...|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} layer scheme of ECMA- 368 adopts preamble-based mode, therefore, synchronization in MB-OFDM-based UWB systems is data-aided. Schmidl and Cox [17] defined a preamble structure with two identical parts. Timing synchronization is implemented by finding out {{the peak of}} pilot correlation, which introduces the timing synchronization idea that bases on preamble design. Studies [18 – 20] are {{on the basis of}} Schmidl's approach. The algorithms they proposed could realize timing synchronization, but are restricted by multipath effect. The above researches have solved timing issue for a great deal. Since the preamble structure for MB-OFDM-based UWB systems has been defined in literature [6] already, corresponding schemes are in need to improve system synchronization capability. Adaptive timing synchronization estimators are proposed in [21, 22], which are implemented by using energy ratio of received symbols. Peak detection [23], based on literature [17], and maximum likelihood estimator [24], based on literature [15], are applied to the systems. Some researchers consider implementing timing synchronization for MB-OFDM-based UWB systems by a defined operation (e.g., energy difference operation [25], or correlation difference operation [26]) to work out threshold contrast. Those types of estimators mitigate the multipath effect restrict, and make synchronization with an acceptable synchronization probability, but have some serious threshold limitation. The first sample that exceeds the threshold may not be the right timing sample. What's worse, the threshold set for the current SNR environment may not suit for other SNRs. Therefore, the threshold setting {{plays an important role in}} the performance of timing synchronization for the systems. Besides, if the samples exceeding the threshold are all taken into account, the consequence of running the algorithms would conclude more than one timing index when the threshold is a small one. Otherwise, none of timing index would be obtained when the threshold is relatively big. They both do not make sense for timing <b>synchronization.</b> The <b>characters</b> of correlation are also widely used in the design of timing synchronization estimators [27, 28]. Concerning the work of timing synchronization of MB-OFDM-based UWB systems, a majority of estimators proposed are of great performance for TFC 1 (or equivalently 2), but the performances for TFC 3 (or equivalently 4) are ignored, which should be taken into consideration, for they are also widely used.|$|R
