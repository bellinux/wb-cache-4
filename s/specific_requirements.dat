5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has <b>specific</b> <b>requirements</b> for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more <b>specific</b> <b>requirements.</b> The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic plants can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, {{where he}} married Greta Knutson, {{with whom he}} had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A former student of painter André Lhote, she was known for her {{interest}} in phenomenology and abstract art. Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara, built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's <b>specific</b> <b>requirements</b> and decorated with samples of African art. It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.|$|E

If the thesis has not been defended by this date, the Aggie Ring will be held until the qualification is met. A Ph.D. student may receive their Ring if they have completed all formal coursework in the degree plan, has a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above, has successfully completed the residency requirement, has successfully passed the preliminary exam, and has an approved research proposal on file. A Ring may be purchased upon graduation if a student, either undergraduate or graduate, did not meet these criteria while pursuing the degree.|$|E
