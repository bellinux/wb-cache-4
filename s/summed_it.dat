The two [...] "weren't disappointed." [...] Blackhurst said [...] "The fast-paced tale of courage and dreams kept both entertained with plenty of hilarious moments {{for the children and}} a sprinkle of gags which flew over younger fans' heads but brought a wry smile to mums and dads' faces."

500|$|Arsenal were by {{no means}} the only team to have come up with the idea of {{dropping}} the centre half into defence – Newcastle United beat Arsenal 7–0 that season employing such a system with Charlie Spencer at centre-half; Queen's Park and Tottenham Hotspur had also adopted similar systems. Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence. Chapman himself <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up by saying: [...] "the most opportune time for scoring is immediately after repelling an attack, because opponents are then strung out in the wrong half of the field." ...|$|E
500|$|After Bryant and Scott {{departed}} the project, director Philip Kaufman {{tried to}} re-write the story, with the resulting treatment heavily inspired by Olaf Stapledon's books Last and First Men and Star Maker. He later described this version as being [...] "less 'cult-ish' {{and more of}} an adult movie, dealing with sexuality and wonders rather than oddness". He intended this version to feature Spock facing off against a Klingon nemesis, A role for whom Kaufman wanted Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Kaufman explained {{that it would have}} featured the two undergoing a psychedelic experience and <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up by saying that [...] "I'm sure the fans would have been upset, but I felt it could really open up a new type of science fiction."

Maçek III, {{while writing}} for the website PopMatters, {{described}} [...] "Marauders" [...] as forming {{the first part of}} a loose trilogy of episodes within the second season focusing on re-introducing the Klingons to the series. The following episodes in the group were said to be [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave the episode two out of four, said that there was nothing exciting in [...] "Marauders" [...] and that the action sequences towards the end were unrealistic because despite all the apparent violence, not a single person even gets injured during the scene. He called the general premise [...] "classic trek", but that it lacked depth and didn't pose any interesting questions. He <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up by saying it was [...] "a bloodless, light-as-a-feather action show with handsome production values but absolutely and positively no edge." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] for Tor.com, and {{admitted}} that he hadn't seen the episode since the original broadcast. He said that it was a [...] "trainwreck" [...] and even worse than he remembered, because other shows such as [...] and Stargate SG-1 had since done much better clip shows. DeCandido <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up by saying that [...] "In all honesty, they’d have been better off doing one fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike anyhow — and upping the budget on one of the other 21. Just an awful, awful episode." [...] He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten. Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, describing the script as [...] "god-awful" [...] and the episode as [...] "forced".|$|E
500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up, saying [...] "We've seen all of this before, and it was barely interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not sure what the reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E

She would have preferred to see more of Mars, but was pleased with the glimpse of the Carl Sagan Memorial Station. She <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up by saying that the two episodes were [...] "no means perfect episodes, but they're reaching very earnestly for what Star Trek was in the beginning". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] said that while there were plot holes in the story, and that elements were clumsy such as the showdown towards the end, the overall story was [...] "sound". He said that the episode was a [...] "much more satisfying as a send-off for the Enterprise crew" [...] than [...] "These Are the Voyages...". He gave [...] "Terra Prime" [...] a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|On 11 November 1996, Oasis {{relocated}} {{to the rural}} Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey. Though the band reconvened with more energy, the early recordings were compromised by the drug intake of all involved. Morris recalled that [...] "in the first week, someone tried to score an ounce of weed, but instead got an ounce of cocaine. Which kind of <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] Noel was not present during any of Liam's vocal track recordings, typifying the high drama surrounding the sessions. Morris thought that the new material was weak, but when he voiced his opinion to Noel he was cut down: [...] " [...] I just carried on shovelling drugs up my nose." [...] Morris expressed regret at being unable to simply transfer the Mustique demos and overdub drums, vocals, and rhythm guitar, as the 8-track mixer he had employed required him to bounce tracks for overdubs, leaving him unable to remove the drum machine from the recordings.|$|E

In the season six review by Dreamwatch, [...] "Tsunkatse" [...] was given a rating of three out of five. The fight scenes in the episode were reviewed by Robert W. Young for Black Belt magazine. Young described it as being [...] "uncharacteristically cool from a martial arts perspective" [...] and that [...] "it was nice to see a value-judgement-free depiction of no-holds-barred competition on such a respected TV series." [...] He thought that the combat itself was believable and that Seven may have been using moves taken from Jeet Kune Do, a style founded by Bruce Lee.

500|$|The {{match was}} a see-saw five setter with Nadal {{prevailing}} 9–7 {{in the fifth}} after 4 hours and 37 minutes. [...] Analyst Steve Tignor <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up: [...] "This epic was {{a mirror image of}} their last one, in the 2012 Australian Open final. That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near-death experience in the fourth set, won it in a tiebreaker, and taken a 4–2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title. Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3–4 in the fourth and again at 5–6, grabbed that set in a tiebreaker, and led 4–2 in the fifth before watching Nadal take it all away. In each of those matches, the loser was haunted by a stunning, crucial lapse. In Australia, with a chance to go up 5–2 in the fifth, Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots. In Paris, serving at 4–3 in the final set, Djokovic gave away a point when he ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{received}} {{moderate to}} poor reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times termed it [...] "a pleasant, lazy romance... Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein {{in a minor}} key".

[...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing."

Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the Strokes as [...] "a great groove band", and noted that [...] "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity". In a perfect 10 review, NME reviewer John Robinson indicated that Is This It {{was one of the}} best debut LPs by a guitar band during the past 20years. In contrast, Jon Monks of Stylus commented that its shallowness prevents it from ever being called a [...] "classic". In his favorable A– review, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly conceded that he did not know whether the Strokes would have a long-term impact, but noted that, at the time, the record [...] "just feels right, and sometimes that's enough".|$|E
