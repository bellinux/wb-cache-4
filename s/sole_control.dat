5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed <b>sole</b> <b>control</b> of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

5|$|Historian Tracy Adams {{describes}} Isabeau as {{a talented}} diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. Charles had been crowned in 1387, aged 20, attaining <b>sole</b> <b>control</b> of the monarchy. His first acts included {{the dismissal of}} his uncles and the reinstatement of the so-called Marmousets—a group of councilors to his father, Charles V—and he gave Orléans more responsibility. Some years later, after Charles' first attack of illness, tensions mounted between Orléans and the royal uncles—Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Forced to assume {{a greater role in}} maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was to persist for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as peacekeeper among the various court factions.|$|E
5|$|Ron Springett was the goalkeeper for England as Banks rose to prominence, {{but after}} the 1962 World Cup in Chile, a new coach was {{appointed}} in former England right-back Alf Ramsey. Ramsey demanded <b>sole</b> <b>control</b> of the team and began looking towards the next World Cup. Banks won his first cap on 6 April 1963 against Scotland at Wembley, after Springett was dropped following a poor performance. England lost 2–1, though Banks was blameless as Scotland's goals came firstly from an error by Jimmy Armfield and then secondly from the penalty spot. He was picked for the next match against Brazil, which ended in a credible 1–1 draw after Bryan Douglas cancelled out Pepe's opener. Banks continued to play consistently to become established as England's first-choice goalkeeper. In 1963, he was picked to play against the Rest of the World, in a celebration match to mark 100 years of The Football Association.|$|E
5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding <b>sole</b> <b>control</b> to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E

5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming <b>sole</b> <b>control</b> over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{socio-economic}} development place an increasing pressure on essential natural resources, such as arable land and freshwater. The international food trade can save water globally by redistributing commodities produced relatively more water-efficiently. We {{focus on the}} global virtual water trade network associated with international staple food trade from 1986 – 2008. This study aims to determine which variables control the network's structure and temporal evolution, and to estimate changes in the network under future scenarios. Our fitness model reproduces both the topological and weighted characteristics of the network for the whole period. Undirected and directed network properties are well reproduced in each year, assuming as <b>sole</b> <b>controls</b> each nation's GDP, mean annual rainfall, agricultural area and population. The future structure of the network is estimated using climate and socio-economic projections, showing that volumes of virtual water traded will become increasingly heterogeneous {{and the importance of}} dominant importing nations will further strengthen...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the early}} stages of the electrocrystallization of lead dioxide onto a vitreous carbon electrode is studied via the analysis {{of the early}} rising portion of the current–time transients (CTT's). The CTT's are recorded when the rate of charge-transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface is the <b>sole</b> <b>controlling</b> mechanism for crystal growth. Induction times for the nucleation of the 3 D growth centres are determined as a function of the applied potential. A possible controlling mechanism for the onset of the nucleation of the 3 D growth centres is thus considered to be the need for the formation of at least a monolayer of deposit and/or adsorbed layers. It has been shown that CTT's that are recorded during the charge-transfer controlled growth processes allows the possibility of observing the formation of two distinct phases of a deposit, a phenomenon that would not be observed if CTT's are recorded when diffusion is the controlling mechanism for growth. The electrocrystallization of lead dioxide is shown to proceed, at least initially, via the formation of two distinct phases of PbO 2...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent or ephemeral water {{shortages}} are a crucial global challenge, in particular {{because of their}} impacts on food production. The global character of this challenge {{is reflected in the}} trade among nations of virtual water, i. e. the amount of water used to produce a given commodity. We build, analyze and model the network describing the transfer of virtual water between world nations for staple food products. We find that all the key features of the network are well described by a model that reproduces both the topological and weighted properties of the global virtual water trade network, by assuming as <b>sole</b> <b>controls</b> each country's gross domestic product and yearly rainfall on agricultural areas. We capture and quantitatively describe the high degree of globalization of water trade and show that a small group of nations {{play a key role in}} the connectivity of the network and in the global redistribution of virtual water. Finally, we illustrate examples of prediction of the structure of the network under future political, economic and climatic scenarios, suggesting that the crucial importance of the countries that trade large volumes of water will be strengthened.
