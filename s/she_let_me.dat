500|$|I {{spent a lot}} of {{time after}} [...] left the studio {{tightening}} up the rough. In fact, I'm sure <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> mix it just because I loved the track so much! I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals â€” but a lot of it was about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.|$|E
60|$|Without {{more words}} <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> cover her; which as I {{was doing in}} the darkness, I let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost like an embrace.|$|E
6000|$|... "She mostly {{let me talk}} to her," [...] confessed Mr Powell. [...] "I don't {{know that}} she was very much interested--but still <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> She, never cut me short." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{saw that}} I {{had made an}} {{impression}} on her, from those very words. 'If <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> into the house to-morrow,' said I, 'she is mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> {{in again}} I shall be glad they're not there! They're right, pourtant, they're right," [...] Gaston went on, passing {{out of the}} studio with his friend.|$|R
60|$|May 3. Three quiet days. This hell fiend {{is like a}} {{cat with}} a mouse. <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> loose only to pounce upon me again. I am never so frightened as when every thing is still. My {{physical}} state is deplorable--perpetual hiccough and ptosis of the left eyelid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doggone it, why can't <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone? Why can't women ever learn {{a fellow}} hates to be bulldozed? And they always take {{advantage}} of you by yelling how lonely they are.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Camilla {{has been}} very kind in giving me much more freedom than I expected, and pacifying papa. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go every Friday evening to help Lady Susan Strangeways at her mothers' meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not! I {{should want}} to kill anybody that was by when {{such a thing as}} that came out, and I should despise Sue Northwick if <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get away alive. I must go at once!" ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. She {{wants me}} to go and be fitted. <b>She</b> never <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> go out in Peking alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! George {{knows he}} can't have {{one without the}} other, and has not {{suggested}} {{such a thing as}} parting us. There is always room in my house for Becky, and <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> do as <b>she</b> would if she was in my place," [...] answered Bess, with a look which her friend answered by a smile.|$|R
5000|$|... "After {{she had a}} {{miscarriage}} Claudette would always tell me she was sorry <b>she</b> had <b>let</b> <b>me</b> down. I would explain that <b>she</b> had not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> down because <b>she</b> was there, she was alive; I wanted the babies, but I didn't know them. I wrote 'More Love' {{to let her know}} how I felt about her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go then, and I {{went away}} well pleased. I fancied that I was holding my own with Madame. And I {{had left the}} way clear for my next visit, which was no small thing.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know as soon as, {{round the}} corner of the house, she loomed again into view. [...] "What in the name of {{goodness}} is the matter--?" [...] She was now flushed and out of breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes!--oh, yes, my Lord! You are at Montemar. Everything here is yours. The bar-tailed hawk {{is quite}} well, {{and my mother}} will be here this evening; <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ride on the instant we heard the news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I 'm disappointed. <b>She</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in. <b>She</b> has {{locked the}} door, and I 'm afraid {{to make a}} noise." [...] I suppose {{there might have been}} {{something}} ridiculous in a confession of this kind, but I liked my new friend so much that for me it did n't detract from his dignity. [...] "She tells me--from behind the door--that <b>she</b> will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know if he is worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But she doesn't. Mamma isn't {{afraid of}} anything. That's why <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> play out here alone when I want. Why, {{we had a}} robber once. Mamma got right up and found him. And what do you think! He was only a poor hungry man. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and {{afterward}} she got him work to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sorry!' {{he said in}} the offhand way {{of younger}} days, 'I apologise. Fact is, I was angry that <b>she</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's my last fight, Sir Charles," [...] {{said the}} smith. [...] "You heard the missus {{say that if}} <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> off this time I was never to ask again. I must try {{and make it a}} good one." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{gave his}} equine snort, {{as if the}} sense of his power could best vent itself so. [...] "Why can't <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone? That girl bothers me worse {{than all the other}} women in Leatherwood put together. She won't let me let her alone." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told her}} that she was wrong then. She ought to have been {{thinking}} of her life, and not only of her life but {{of the life of the}} man who was speaking to her too. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> finish, then shook her head impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Uncle. I {{thought of}} staying another month or two, before I go off again. Mother says <b>she</b> cannot <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go before that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but the three-thousand-year gag did not work! She spotted you, cher ami, on the instant. And <b>she</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{take her}} with my kodak." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{she laid}} a hand on his, saying, [...] "I have longed to talk openly to you ever since we met in the cow-shed; but I could not make any advance to any of you, because," [...] she whispered in haste, [...] "I thought it my duty to hold back from Frank. And now, till we go away, Camilla watches me and {{occupies}} me every minute, will not even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ride out with papa. I wonder <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> talk to you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, my dear child, why can't <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone?"--this time Sir Claude unmistakeably blushed. Before Maisie, however, {{could answer}} his question, which would indeed {{have taken her}} long, he went on in another tone: [...] "Mrs. Beale thinks she has {{probably}} quite broken her down. But she hasn't." ...|$|E
60|$|Then my mother, sorely vexed over my adventures--which {{in truth}} were but sorry ones for a child--took me home. Nor would <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> keep Alicia's chain, but made away with it, how I knew not and little cared, for {{the sight of}} it was loathsome to me.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{said that}} I only {{came to see}} how Miss Havisham was, Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in, and {{presently}} brought the sharp message that I was to [...] "come up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here {{are some}} ribbons that I {{bought in the}} town [...] For my son's wife--but <b>she</b> will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> give them [...] To tie up that wild hair the winds have tumbled.|$|R
60|$|So when Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby came, Tom asked her; for {{he thought}} {{in his little}} head, She is not so strict as her sister, and perhaps <b>she</b> may <b>let</b> <b>me</b> off more easily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it so much! But I forgot my debt to Mrs. Flint; perhaps <b>she</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go," [...] said Christie, with an anxious cloud coming over her {{brightening}} face.|$|R
6000|$|XXXIII [...] And {{that the}} very truth it is which I [...] Now say--in such belief I'll live and die; [...] And Cuckoo, do thou so, by my advice. [...] Then, quoth <b>she,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> never hope for bliss, [...] If with that counsel I do e'er comply. [...] 165 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am come, my father," [...] {{she said}} in a sweet clear voice, [...] "though of a truth it was not easy to escape the revels at the palace yonder. But I told the Queen that the sun and the riot in the streets had made me sick, and <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{believe if}} I had spoken French {{she would not}} have {{admitted}} me; but, as I spoke English, she concluded I was a foreign teacher come on business connected with the pensionnat, and, even at that late hour, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in, without a word of reluctance, or a moment of hesitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before we {{get away}} she'll wish <b>she</b> hadn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go, but <b>she</b> won't know {{any way to}} get around it now. After what she's said, her pride won't let her take it back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want ye for a witness. If <b>she</b> winna <b>let</b> <b>me</b> aff, weel and guid; {{and if she}} will, it's {{better to}} hae a witness in case she should go back on her word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{a lovely}} girl," [...] said Madame Grandoni. [...] "There {{is a great deal}} there. I have taken a great fancy to her, and <b>she</b> must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> make a friend of her." ...|$|R
