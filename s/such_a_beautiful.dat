5|$|There are {{two stories}} about how {{the name of this}} altar came about. The first states that those {{condemned}} by the Spanish Inquisition were brought to the altar to ask for forgiveness in the next world before their execution. The second relates to painter Simon Pereyns, who despite being the author of many of the works of the cathedral, was accused of blasphemy. According to the story, while Pereyns was in jail, he painted <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> image of the Virgin Mary that his crime was forgiven.|$|E

Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

Later, when talking with his friend Frankie (Lady Frances Derwent), Bobby remembers that Pritchard did have last words and writes to the Caymans to tell them.|$|E

25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E

5000|$|... : Some {{have viewed}} this novel to be a modern retelling of Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded as it shares many key {{elements}} with the novel, <b>such</b> as <b>a</b> young, <b>beautiful</b> woman being taken by an arrogant man. However, Amis claimed afterwards {{that he had}} little interest in classic fiction, which makes this proposition less likely.|$|R
500|$|Dubbing [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of her career, singer Heidi Mollenhauer described the experience in an interview with South Pasadena High School as [...] "very exciting, a little terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming". On recording the song, Mollenhauer said, [...] "The challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel. I get choked up every time I talk about it because I think it's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> moment." [...] Because Esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses, it was mandatory that Mollenhauer's singing voice blend with actress Demi Moore's husky speaking voice [...] "seamlessly." [...] Mollenhauer's performance of [...] "Someday" [...] is featured on the re-release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.|$|E
500|$|The formal {{engagement}} of marriage was announced on 3 January 1878, a day Rosebery forever afterwards regarded as sacred. Writing {{to a friend}} in January 1878, Rosebery described his wife as [...] "very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy... I never knew <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> character." [...] The marriage was celebrated in London on 20 March 1878 at the Board Room of Guardians in Mount Street, and also in a Christian ceremony at Christ Church in Down Street, Piccadilly. To show [...] "official" [...] disapproval, no male member of the Rothschild family attended the ceremonies. However, any shortcomings in the guest list were compensated for by the guest of honour—the Prince of Wales—and Disraeli, who gave the bride away.|$|E
500|$|Robbie Daw of Idolator {{appreciated}} the plot twist of the video, commenting, [...] "We really expected Nicki to waste that other warrior-in-training hater. The {{fact that she}} dies—and does so in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> way here—kind of makes us love her all the more." [...] Daw also inferred that the fancy attire from the [...] "No More I Love You's" [...] video inspired Minaj's in the [...] "Your Love" [...] video. Nicole Sia of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the video resembles Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in its fight scene. Sia also commented on Minaj's appearance stating [...] "the camera cuts to Ms. Young Money soloing in front of billowing one-million-thread-count satin sheets, just to remind us how damn FINE she is." [...] Tray Hova of Vibe gave {{a list of the}} best and worst parts of the music video, stating the best were Minaj chopped through the blocks of cement, her crazy faces, silk sheets and headgear, and that the worst part was the [...] "melodramatic ending" [...] and [...] "the return of those Freddy Krueger fingers." ...|$|E
25|$|Fournier {{introduced}} {{some new}} characters <b>such</b> as Ororéa, <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> girl reporter with whom Fantasio was {{madly in love}} with (in contrast with his loathing for Seccotine); Itoh Kata, a Japanese magician; and an occult SPECTRE-like criminal organisation known as The Triangle. None of these were reused by later artists until some thirty years later when Itoh Kata appeared in Morvan and Munuera's Spirou et Fantasio à Tokyo.|$|R
5000|$|The critic Léon Blum {{said of the}} book, [...] "Nouvelles mondaines, histoires tendres, vers mélodiques, {{fragments}} où la précision du trait s'atténue dans la grâce molle de la phrase, M.

[...] Google translates this as, [...] "New worlds, tender histories, melodic verses, fragments {{in which}} the precision of the line is attenuated in the soft grace of the phrase, M.

40|$|It is {{practically}} persuasive that {{the eruption of}} the ethical interrupts and postpones the epistemological—the undertaking to construct the other as object of knowledge, an undertaking never to be given up. Lévinas is the generic name associated with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> position. <b>A</b> <b>beautiful</b> passage from Otherwise than Being lays it out, although neither interruption nor postponement is mentioned. That connection is made by Derrida [Adieu 51 - 59]. Here, then, is Lévinas, for whom Kant's critical perspectivization of the subject and the rigorous limits of pure theoretical reason {{seem to have been}} displaced by the structuralist hermeneutics of suspicion. For Lévinas, structuralism did not attend to what in Kant was the mechanism that interrupted the constrained and rigorous workings of pure reason: "The interests that Kant discovered in theoretical reason itself, he subordinated to practical reason, become mere reason. It is just these interests that are contested by structuralism, which is perhaps to be defined by the primacy of theoretical reason" [Otherwise than Being 58; trans. modified]...|$|R
500|$|Gaga's {{cover of}} [...] "White Christmas" [...] is a [...] "jazzy rendition" [...] and {{features}} an extra verse about a snowman. Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, [...] "So {{as you can}} tell, I'm very outgoing {{and a little bit}} shy, but I've decided that this song is just too short. It's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> Christmas song but it's only one verse, so I added an extra one." [...] "You and I" [...] is devoid of the musical arrangements from the version in Born This Way, and features instrumentation from a piano and a trumpet, which is played halfway through the song. From time to time, Gaga shouts the word [...] "America" [...] while singing the song. Her acoustic version of [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] begins with a monologue, explaining her dedication of the song to her grandfather: [...] "It's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him, so here it is. So Grandma, if you're watching at home, this one's for you." [...] Following the first chorus, Gaga stops playing her piano and tells a story about Italian cookies. A recurring theme for the songs is Gaga stopping midway through singing to engage in conversation with the listeners.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Druckenbrod, of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, {{reviewing}} Evancho's 2011 Pittsburgh Opera concert, {{stated that}} [...] "what was most impressive ... was how musical she was ... her focus on phrasing {{and an understanding}} of the emotion in the ... musical numbers." [...] The review also praised [...] "her reverberant chest voice [...] her head voice, hitting the highest register with intonation and purity" [...] and echoed Janis: [...] "That she continues to be greeted with skepticism is unfair. ... Yes, the concert showed that Jackie is a young girl, yet one with artistry to be appreciated now without debating about what her future might hold." [...] Antony Walker, Pittsburgh Opera's music director, said: [...] "she has a very sincere way of singing. ... Her voice has a lovely quality to it. It's very simple singing but it comes from the heart. You rarely hear someone so young with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> voice". Nekesa Mumbi Moody, writing for Associated Press, commented that, although [...] "there is a youthful quality in Jackie's voice, it's hardly childlike: It's a soprano that deftly traverses the musical scales". Mark Kanny, in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called her voice [...] "beautifully in tune and well supported. ... Evancho's sincerity of delivery was affecting".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} {{pulled back in a}} sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers on the scene in various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd like to ask everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful,</b> beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. God bless you all. Thank you so much for having me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E
60|$|With <b>such</b> sentiments, upon <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> day in {{the latter}} end of harvest, the King mounted his horse; and, {{indifferent}} that he was looked upon rather {{as a part of}} the pageant of a victor, than in the light of an independent Sovereign surrounded by his guards and his chivalry, King Louis sallied from under the Gothic gateway of Peronne, to join the Burgundian army, which commenced at the same time its march against Liege.|$|R
