50|$|Bomb liner {{material}} received from Plant 5 in mobile hoppers was emptied at an unloading station and elevated to a surge hopper. Material as needed was sent from the surge hopper through a jaw crusher {{and into a}} shelf type oxidation furnace. Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into carbon brick digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a <b>scrap</b> <b>dump.</b> Uranium in the filtrate {{was sent to a}} precipitation tank and precipitated with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), in presence of phosphoric acid to form UAP (uranyl ammonium phosphate). The resulting slurry was filtered and the uranium bearing cake was introduced to a drying furnace. The dried UAP was sent to the refinery. In addition to the wet system described, several furnaces were installed in the plant for massive metal oxidation, pyrohydrolysis, drying, chip and sludge combustion, etc. Most of the furnaces can be used for more than one of the above operations.|$|E

50|$|Essentially a more {{advanced}} version of 1898's WB class, the eighteen members of the WD class were ordered in 1901 and most entered service that year, though three were not introduced until the start of 1902. Based in locations all around the country, from Auckland in the north to Dunedin in the south, the WD class were suitable {{for a variety of}} trains from freight to suburban passenger services. Withdrawal of the class began with WD 356 in January 1933, with the final three, 327, 359, and 360, written off in March 1936. A number were not actually <b>scrapped</b> or <b>dumped,</b> but were sold to work on private industrial lines.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the findings from}} {{a study on the}} consumption of recycled materials and recycling practices in the plastics manufacturing industry and recycling companies in Malaysia. The findings were obtained from a survey conducted in twenty plastic manufacturing companies and detailed case studies in three recycling companies. The survey conducted in the plastic manufacturing companies’ shows that the consumption rate for poly-olefins (PP and PE) is the highest among the resin types and the industrial sector that consumes the most plastic materials is the electrical and electronics sector. The consumption of recycled materials is high among the local manufacturing companies (80 %) which are largely due to cost savings; about 20 % of these companies conducted in-house recycling. The study has also shown that the medium scale industry consumes the most recycled materials as compared to the large and small scale industry. The rate of disposal for plastic materials in the local industry is approximately 5 %. The detailed case studies conducted in the recycling companies have successfully identified the main processes involved in plastic recycling namely manual sorting, cleaning, drying, meshing/pelletising and packaging. These recycling companies obtained recycled materials from various sources including industrial <b>scrap,</b> <b>dumping</b> sites, local producers as well as imported sources. Pricing of recycled materials were based on classification according to grade and quality of the recycled materials. The study has reflected the extent of in-house recycling trends in the local plastic manufacturing companies and their dependency on the supply from the local recycling companies...|$|R

30|$|From the Table  2, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that the fresh leachate sample possesses very high concentration of chemical parameters except pH, when compared to stabilized leachate samples. The pH value of the fresh samples was observed {{in the range of}} 6.96 – 7.77, but the older samples were amber colored and alkaline with pH range from 7.68 to 8.33. This may be attributed to the decrease in the concentration of free volatile acids due to anaerobic decomposition, as fatty acids can be partially ionized and contribute to higher pH values. Alkaline pH is normally encountered at landfills, 10  years after disposal (El-Fadel et al. 2002). The relatively high value of electrical conductivity (57, 000  μ mho/cm) indicates the presence of dissolved inorganic materials in the samples. The concentration of TDS (60, 970  mg/L) also fluctuates widely. Other inorganic contaminants also follow the trend of decreasing concentrations with increasing leachate age and stability. In general, leachate generated from young acidogenic landfills are characterized by high concentrations of organic and inorganic pollutants (Calli et al. 2005). The presence of Magnesium in the leachate is due to the disposal of construction waste along with MSW (Al-Yaqout 2003). The calcium and magnesium concentrations exhibited typical trends of constituents affected by the biological activity in the dumping site. A reduction with time is attributed to the depletion of these compounds and to the increase in pH, thus reducing their solubility in leachate, and enhancing precipitation. The initial concentrations of these parameters are on the higher side (1, 200 – 3, 000  mg/L, 250 – 1, 500  mg/L). A decrease in concentration was observed in stabilized leachate samples. The chloride concentration in the leachate varied from 1, 000 to 8, 000  mg/L for young leachate samples and 1, 000 – 6, 500  mg/L for stabilized samples. The possible anthropogenic sources of chloride are kitchen wastes from households, restaurants, and hotels. TA varies between 4, 500 and 26, 000  mg/L. The presence of high BOD (43, 328  mg/L) and COD (75, 840  mg/L) indicates the high organic strength. This indicates that majority of the organic compounds is biodegradable (Fatta et al. 1999). The presence of Fe (400  mg/L) in the leachate sample indicates that steel <b>scraps</b> are also <b>dumped</b> in the landfill. The dark brown color of the leachate is mainly attributed to the oxidation of ferrous to ferric form and the formation of ferric hydroxide colloids and complexes with fulvic/humic substance (Chu et al. 1994).|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{investigations}} of subsurface lithologic units in regions of thick, unsaturated, and poorly consolidated sediments {{have always been}} a problem in exploration geophysics. An experimental high-resolution seismic refraction profile and four geoelectric surveys were acquired in a problem area of this nature near Orchard, Idaho. The objective was to test the viability of using these techniques to do detailed subsurface mapping of sedimentary/volcanic interfaces underlying this portion of the western Snake River Plain. Although only standard methods were employed, the refraction and geoelectric surveys produced results which are internally consistent and consistent with information obtained from nearby boreholes. The refraction survey was conducted at a location locally referred to as Orchard Ranch. Eight 24 -channel geophone spreads, with a 5 -m station interval, were used to acquire the data resulting in 920 m of subsurface coverage. A buried explosive energy source was utilized at inline offsets of 100 m and 0 m from both ends of each receiver spread. Data analysis was conducted using two independent processing techniques including the reciprocal method (RM) and a refraction statics software package developed by Green Mountain Geophysical Corporation. The RM technique computes refractor depths as the product of a time-depth and depth conversion factor for every receiver. Refractor depths were computed from north to south with forced depth ties between spreads at stations of overlap. The Green Mountain technique uses a ray theory model of seismic waves in the near surface layers of the earth to estimate layer geometries and velocities. Refractor depths are derived from time-terms computed for each receiver, and time differences between each shot/receiver pair. This method uses constant layer velocities in the computation. The refractor depth models generated from the RM and the Green Mountain analyses reveal very similar features: a slightly irregular refractor surface at depths of 30 - 45 m with an abrupt discontinuity in the vicinity of Station 87. This discontinuity has been interpreted as representing either a down-to-the-south normal fault or a flow edge of a younger basalt overlying a deeper, and older, basalt unit. A second study conducted at the Orchard Ranch site involved the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of resistivity data collected from four separate geoelectric soundings to map stratigraphic boundaries in the subsurface, both laterally and with depth. These included a single point Schlumberger vertical sounding, 20 -m and 60 -m dipole-dipole profiles, and a controlled source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey. The first set of resistivity data was acquired using a symmetric expanding Schlumberger electrode configuration running parallel to a seismic refraction line acquired in a previous study (Howarth, 1989, Line 1), and centered about the midpoint (Station 100) between the PVC and the Orchard Ranch wells. One-dimensional inversion of the data using an automatic interpretation program (Zohdy, 1989) resulted in a 16 -layer resistivity model. By imposing constraints based on the available geologic information, an equivalent four-layer model was established using an iterative process of inversion and forward modeling. The resultant model reveals three layers of differing resistivities within the unconsolidated sediments in the near surface, underlain by a highly resistive basalt at a depth of 30 m. The second set of resistivity data was acquired using a dipole-dipole electrode configuration. Two separate surveys, using 20 -m and 60 -m electrode separations (a-spacings), were conducted parallel to Line 1 beginning at the PVC well and ending near the Orchard Ranch well, providing resistivity data both laterally and vertically. Measurements were made at each field setup corresponding to n-spacings of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Pseudo-sections of apparent resistivity versus n-spacing allowed for qualitative interpretations of the data. In general, the near-surface sediments contain a shallow layer of high apparent resistivity, overlying a section of relatively low apparent resistivity. The absence of an abrupt resistivity increase in the deepest resistivity samples (60 -m dipole pseudo-section) may indicate that the basalt was not reached. The last survey was a CSAMT profile conducted along {{the entire length of the}} Line 1 refraction survey. A transmitting current electrode separation of 1525 m, located 1825 m due east of, and parallel to, refraction Line 1, was used in conjunction with a potential electrode spacing of 20 m and a magnetic coil to record orthogonal horizontal components of the electric and magnetic fields at 47 surface locations. This current and potential electrode separation distance was in excess of the 3 skin depth (far field) minimum separation necessary to ensure plane wave behavior for the resistivity and phase measurements. The CSAMT resistivity and phase data were processed with Zonge Engineering DATPRO software. A 2 -D smooth model inversion algorithm generated an earth resistivity model for a depth range of 50 - 400 m. This range likely falls entirely within the massive basalt unit as suggested from well logs. Two anomalous features stand out in the model. A region of extremely high resistivity in excess of 6000 Ω-m (as opposed to an average basalt resistivity of 200 Ω-m) appears near the vicinity of the Orchard Ranch well. This is most likely due to recording in a <b>scrap</b> metal <b>dumping</b> site near a steel cased well which has significantly contaminated the data and caused an unreliable inversion. A second notable feature is the presence of elevated resistivity vertical zonation at various locations along the profile. This has been interpreted as representing air-filled porosity within the basalt, possibly related to fractures or large void spaces...|$|R
