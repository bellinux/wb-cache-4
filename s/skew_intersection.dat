40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{research}} {{examines the}} effect of restricted head and neck movement on driving performance as measured by decision time at T-intersections. The traffic safety and human factors literature was reviewed, and very little was found concerning drivers with physical limitations. T-intersections were selected for study because most accidents involving drivers with diminished capacities occur at intersections, and T-intersections are simpler than four-way intersections. A laboratory study was selected to provide better experimental control, safety and repeatability. A unique methodology was used that employed a fixed base driving simulator which incorporated the use of video recordings of intersections to provide a 180 degree field of view. Eighteen intersections were studied with various levels of traffic volume and sight distance. The 72 test subjects were {{between the ages of}} 30 - 50, or 60 - 80, and half in each age group had restricted range of movement of their neck. The task for the subjects was to depress the brake pedal, watch the video presentations of the T-intersections on three screens and indicate when it was safe to make a left turn by releasing the brake pedal. The decision time was a measure of driving performance. The study results confirmed the hypotheses that; 1. decision time increases with age, and age effects dominated the other factors which were studied, 2. decision time increases with age and level of impairment indicating that younger drivers are able to compensate for their impairments, but older drivers both with and without impairments are unable to make compensations in their driving performance, 3. traffic volume has a greater impact on decision time at intersections than sight distance, 4. <b>skewed</b> <b>intersections</b> are hazardous for drivers with neck impairments. Further laboratory and field studies are recommended to validate the study results and to examine the problem of <b>skewed</b> <b>intersections...</b>|$|R

40|$|Intersections are {{hazardous}} {{locations and}} {{many studies have}} been conducted to identify the factors contributing to the frequency and severity of intersection crashes. However, little attention has been devoted to investigating the differences between crashes at urban and rural intersections, which have different road, traffic and environmental characteristics. By applying a random parameters probit model to the data from the Canadian Province of Alberta between 2008 and 2012, we find that urban intersection crashes {{are more likely to be}} associated with hit and run behaviours, roads with higher traffic volume, wet surfaces, four lanes and <b>skewed</b> <b>intersections,</b> and crashes on weekdays and off-peak hours, whereas rural crashes are likely to be associated with increases in fatalities and injuries, roads with higher speed limits, special road features, exit and entrance terminals, gravel, curvature and two lanes, crashes during weekends, peak hours and night-time, run-off-road crashes, and police visit to crash scene. Hence, road safety professionals in urban and rural areas should consider these differences when designing and implementing counter-measures to improve intersection safety, especially their safety audits and reviews, enforcement activities and education campaigns, to target the more vulnerable times and locations in the different areas...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, {{there were}} more than 17, 000 {{reported}} fatal crashes in rural areas of United States which accounted 56 percent of total fatal crashes. This number has not declined in a significant amount since 2009. Studies are undergoing on these rural area roadways, including intersections, to identify the major causes and take the necessary countermeasure. By using previous intersection related fatal and injury crash data, it is possible to identify high-risk intersections to point out and make the appropriate improvement. Five year fatal and injury crash data was collected (2008 - 2012) for three Indiana rural counties that had the highest frequency of fatal and injury crashes. After collecting the data, intersection related crashes were identified and analyzed. The analysis was used to identify high-risk intersections and to help recommend proper countermeasures to improve these intersections. The results obtained allowed the research team to compare crash data from various counties. Besides that, proper countermeasures, such as enhancing signs and pavement markings, installing transverse rumble strips, and realigning <b>skewed</b> <b>intersections,</b> were also recommended to increase road safety in each county. The recommended countermeasures are going to be vital alongside findings from other undergoing road safety researches, such as on horizontal curves and vertical curves, to increase roadway safety in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effect of <b>intersection</b> <b>skew</b> angle on average queue delay through {{simulation}}. The simulation model used is the TEXAS (Traffic Experimental and Analytical Simulation) model. This microscopic simulation model uses a general nonlinear car-following model. It simulates individual intersections and was designed to capture the interaction of traffic operations and intersection geometry. Simulation models were developed for three stop-controlled, tee-intersections in Lincoln, Nebraska. Field data to develop and calibrate the simulation models were collected. All simulation models were calibrated by adjusting the car following parameters. An experimental design was developed to test {{the effect of}} skew angle on average queue delay. Skew angles from 1 degree to 30 degrees were evaluated. The average queue delay reported for each skew angle is based on 30 runs of the simulation model. The results indicate that skew angle does affect average queue delay. The results also suggest that the TEXAS model can capture the effect of skew on average queue delay for small skew angles of 1 degree from the base conditions. Advisor: Elizabeth G. Jone...|$|R
5000|$|Zdeněk Bažant’s {{main focus}} is on {{mathematical}} modeling in mechanics of materials and structures. He has {{made significant contributions to}} several important engineering fields. E.g., in 1976 he showed by stability analysis that the concept strain-softening (then regarded by mechanics gurus as “insane”) does make sense if there is a finite material characteristic length that limits strain localization. Then, in 1983, he published a paradigm changing paper on the crack band model, which presented a simple way to handle nonlocal damage and avoid spurious mesh sensitivity. Both papers were hardly cited for two decades but then the citations exploded (even though the 1983 paper was declined in a premier American journal and then published in a French journal little known at that time; the citations of this papers now run several hundred a year and in 2016 exceeded 2600, on Google). The crack band model is now embedded in various commercial programs and is applied in user’s subroutines for concrete, rocks and comosites, and is the mainstay in design of large commercial composite airframes (e.g., at Boeing). [...] It was similar with Bažant’s (by now classical) material models for nonlocal damage, for energetic (non-statistical) size effect in quasibrittle fracture, for microplane constitutive modeling, for a solidifying material model for concrete creep, for calculations of moisture diffusion in nano-pores of concrete, and for his solution of elastic three-dimensional singularities at <b>skew</b> <b>intersections</b> of crack front line with a surface. They all became highly cited only recently. So did. his monumental treatise on stability of structures, innovative in treating the stability of fracture and damage, thermodynamics of structural stability, and objective stress rates for 3D bodies. Ditto his pioneering books on fracture and size effect in concrete, on concrete at high temperatures, and on concrete creep and shrinkage. Bažant is best known as the world leader in scaling research in solid mechanics. Bažant size effect law, with his demonstrations (mainly in six papers during 1976-91) of damage localization instabilitites and of spurious dependence of the early strain-softening models on element size, {{took a long time to}} sink in. But eventually it changed the design computations in concrete and geotechnical industry, and impacted the design practice in fiber composites (for large aircraft, ships and, car crashworthiness). The RILEM standard recommendation for testing of fracture energy and characteristic length of concrete (FMT/1990) is based on Bažant’s law. [...] Later Bažant extended his scaling research to statistical size effect. Exploiting the frequency law of interatomic bond breaks, he showed that, due to fracture process zone finiteness, the statistical strength of quasibrittle structures follows a graft of Gauss and Weibull distributions and exhibits a strong size effect, causing the safety factors and static and fatigue lifetimes of quasibrittle structures to be size dependent. He demonstrated that disregard of size effect was a major factor in many structural failures. His proposals of code provisions taking into account the size effect on shear failures of beams and slabs has been endorsed by ACI Committee 446 but not yet accepted for the ACI concrete design code. [...] Bažant’s microplane model for softening damage in concrete, rocks, composites, etc., in which the constitutive law is written in terms of stress and strain vectors on a generic plane, trades conceptual simplicity and clarity of physical interpretation for higher computational demands, which initially stifled applications but recently ceased to be an obstacle. The microplane model is now included in large-scale computer codes at U.S. national labs (EPIC, PRONTO, etc.) and in various commercial codes (ATENA, DIANA, SBETA, OOFEM). His microplane model for jointed rock is embedded, e.g., in ANSYS. With the microplane model, Bažant was able to capture the `vertex’ effect in softening damage, which is important for dynamics but cannot be simulated with the classical tensorial constitutive models (for concrete he also demonstrated by tests). He showed experimentally and theoretically that material strain softening reverses to hardening when the loading rate suddenly increases. [...] Bažant further made major theoretical and experimental contributions to the sustainability problems of infrastructure, to high temperature effects in nuclear containments and in tunnels exposed to fire, to thermodynamics and nano-mechanics of creep and shrinkage in hydrating cement, and to 3D singularities at fracture surface intersections. His Model B3 for practical prediction of concrete creep and shrinkage, calibrated by a worldwide database of thousands of laboratory tests assembled by his assistants, became an international standard recommendation (RILEM-CGS/1991). His nonlinear diffusion model for concrete is featured in Eurocode and widely used in durability analysis. His simple age-adjusted effective modulus method for concrete structure taking into account multi-decade chemical aging is embedded in the Eurocode as well as ACI standard recommendation. His unconditionally stable ‘exponential’ algorithm for rate-type concrete creep law is now standard in structural computations. [...] In finite strain theory and structural stability analysis, Bažant was the first to resolve the decades-old controversy about the 3D stability theories of Engesser, Haringx, Hencky, Truesdell, Biot, etc., as applied to soft-in-shear structures. In 1971, he showed by energy variational analysis that these theories correspond to different choices of objective stress rate and are all equivalent upon certain transformations of the tangential elastic moduli, and that some objective stress rates used in Abaqus, Ansys, LS-Dyna and other commercial codes do not conserve energy. This 1971 result was generally ignored until, a few years ago, Bažant demonstrated that the energy conservation error is non-negligible and can be of the order of 100% in the case of highly orthotropic structures, orthotropic damage, or high compressibility. Furthermore, he provided a coherent mechanical explanation of the collapse of WTC Towers in New York, and then derived the crush-down and crush-up differential equations of progressive collapse of tall buildings. [...] Bažant also developed a theory of the destructive alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete (including the diffusion of expanding gel) which matches test results; a theory on hundred year prediction of concrete creep based on inverse analysis of observed excessive bridge deflections, coupled with Bayesian extrapolation of short-time test data; and predictions models B3 and B4 for concrete creep and shrinkage (both drying and chemical-autogenous) which became standard international recommendations of RILEM. He also formulated new theory chemical aging due to cement hydration from hours to centuries at variable temperature and humidity, and a theory for of microprestress (eigenstress) in hydrated cement originating from disjoining pressures of hindered adsorbed water in nanopores. He extended his probabilistic theory of quasibrittle failure to the size effect on residual strength and lifetime, and on Paris law the cyclic crack growths in quasibrittle materials, and showed an analosy with dielectric breakdown. He demonstrated his non-statistical size effect for the fracture of bones and of dental materials. [...] Recently, with his motivated group of assistants, Bažant works on stability and propagation of hydraulic fracture in gas or oil shale and mitigation of environmental risks of fracking; on size effect in fatigue crack growth in quasibrittle materials; and on energy absorption in composite crush cans for cars. Considering the body forces do to water diffusing into shale pores, he showed that hydraulic fracture must branch laterally, and determined their spacing inversely, based on gas production observations. He formulated a new theory of comminution of solids under impact due to release of kinetic energy of high-rate shearing, analogous to turbulence. He examined critically the new theory of ‘peridynamics’ and showed its limitations. Bažant strives in his contributions for practical relevance, originality, clarity and mathematical simplicity. Despite engaging in some super-computer simulations, he prefers analytical approaches as a way to reach deeper understanding, even at the cost of inevitable simplifications. At the same time, he has always extensively validated his results by experimental data and, when facing a vacuum of experimental evidence, conducted a host of innovative experiments with his own research team. [...] By 2016, Bažant’s H-index reached 112, i10-index 550 and his total citations 54,000 (on Google Scholar, incl. self-cit.).|$|R
