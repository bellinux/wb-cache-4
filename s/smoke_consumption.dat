25|$|Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It {{is one of}} the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and <b>smoke.</b> <b>Consumption</b> of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDrug {{associated}} stimuli (cues) play {{a prominent}} role in addiction research because they are able to provoke craving and relapses. Generally, drug cues are seen as conditioned excitatory stimuli, which elicit drug seeking and usage. However, newer data suggest differential effects for smoking stimuli depending on their stage in the smoking ritual. Specifically, stimuli associated with the terminal stage of <b>smoke</b> <b>consumption</b> (END-stimuli) may evoke reactivity opposite to the reactivity evoked by stimuli associated with the beginning of <b>smoke</b> <b>consumption</b> (BEGIN-stimuli). This fMRI-study compared twenty non-deprived smokers with 20 non-smokers to unravel the influence of smoking related pictures displaying the beginning (BEGIN-stimuli) and termination (END-stimuli) of the smoking ritual on neural activity in the addiction network. Additionally, 20 deprived smokers (12 h deprivation) were investigated to explore the effects of deprivation on the processing of these stimuli. In non-deprived smokers, BEGIN-stimuli reliably activated the addiction network (e. g. ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex). In contrast, END-stimuli triggered a differential pattern of activations as well as deactivations; deactivations were found in the ventral striatum and the ACC. Deprivation had no clear effect on the responses triggered by BEGIN-stimuli, but affected the reactivity to END-stimuli. Our data clearly suggest that stimuli associated with different stages of the smoking-ritual trigger differential neuronal responses. While BEGIN-stimuli generally seem to activate the addiction network, END-stimuli presumably have some inhibitory properties. This new finding might add to a more differentiated understanding of cue-reactivity and addiction...|$|E

NSCLC is causally linked to tobacco consumption with more than 500 million smokers worldwide at high risk for this fatal malignancy. We are currently lagging in our knowledge of the early molecular (e. g., genomic) effects of smoking in NSCLC pathogenesis that would constitute ideal markers for early detection. This limitation is further amplified when considering the variable etiologic factors in NSCLC pathogenesis among different regions around the globe. In this review, we present our current knowledge of genomic alterations arising during early stages of smoking-induced lung cancer initiation and progression, including discussing the premalignant airway field of injury induced by smoking. The review also underscores the wider spectra and higher age-adjusted rates of tobacco (e. g., water-pipe <b>smoke)</b> <b>consumption,</b> along with elevated environmental carcinogenic exposures and relatively poorer socioeconomic status, in low-middle income countries (LMICs), with Lebanon as an exemplar.

40|$|Humans {{apparently}} differ {{greatly in}} their sensitivity and tolerance to tobacco smoke, thereby creating {{conflicts in the}} workplace. Resolution of conflicts in a large office complex at the authors ' institution required an objective measure of smoke levels. A gas chromatographic technique was devised for collection and analysis of nicotine concentrations in the building air {{as an indicator of}} tobacco smoke pollution. Segregation of smokers and nonsmokers in the large office complex still resulted in substantial exposure of the nonsmoker to tobacco smoke, although a gradient of exposure was certainly observed. Passive tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>consumption</b> in the smoking area of the office complex was calculated to be equivalent to 1. 1 cigarettes per 8 -hr period, and nicotine density in this area was 1. 96,ug/m. The restriction of smoking to a foyer area outside the office complex resulted in a slow but eventual reduction in nicotine concentrations in the office complex. Observed "background " nicotine concentration levels corresponding to 4 to 7 % of those encountered in smoking areas demonstrate that central air circulation systems and people movement increase the nicotine level throughout all rooms of a building, regardless of the smoking policies of an individual office complex.

Results: The prevalence of hypertension in men was approximately twice as high as that in women (6. 9 % vs 2. 6 %). Hypertension was associated with ageing, a lower education attainment, a higher BMI and having underlying diseases in both sexes. In men, hypertension was associated with being single, having a high income, spending more time on screens (TV & PC), cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol. In women, it was directly correlated with instant and roasted or <b>smoked</b> food <b>consumption.</b> Conclusions: Hypertension was highly associated with obesity and having underlying disease. The Thai health-risk transition is in a later stage. Thais should now be educated about the danger of high blood pressure and the protective power of a low fat and low salt diet, and a normal BMI. Cessation of smoking and moderation in alcohol intake should be promoted. </p...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Intestinal {{metaplasia}} of {{the stomach}} is a lesion in which metaplasia of gastric epithelial cells occurs for an intestinal phenotype. Gastric intestinal metaplasia is a lesion associated {{with an increase in}} the risk of gastric carcinoma development. Epidemiologic studies indicate a relation between dietary habits and stomach cancer development, some habits increasing the risk for it, and others have a protective effect, suggesting that antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C, and E, decrease the risk of this type of cancer. The relationship of these alimentary factors and intestinal metaplasia is unknown. METHODS: It is a case-control, observational study in which 320 patients with functional dyspepsia, divided in two groups, were assessed. The case I group (individuals with intestinal metaplasia) had their dietary pattern compared to that of the control group, constituted of individuals similar to those in the case group but without intestinal metaplasia, through a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The analysis of the dietary pattern of functional dyspeptic patients with intestinal metaplasia, and its comparison with those without intestinal metaplasia, showed a higher frequency of canned and <b>smoked</b> foods <b>consumption</b> in the first group and, on the other hand, a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables in patients without intestinal metaplasia. No effect of salt consumption was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest changes in the diet, with a decrease in the <b>consumption</b> of <b>smoked</b> and canned foods, and an increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, can lead to a diminution of gastric intestinal metaplasia cases...|$|R
40|$|Within the diploma thesis the {{following}} features {{have been implemented}} - summarized data about health and healthy lifestyle specialized age bracked collage students. There are also listed correct catering habits, healthy nutrition, drinkable mode, sleep and moving activity. Further there are summarized determinants the most damage health, like a <b>smoke,</b> excessive alcohol <b>consumption,</b> drug abusing, excessive mental load and risk sexual behavior. In the practical part of the thesis there is investigation of questionnaire located healthy lifestyle level of collage students on different universities in Prague. For evaluation my investigation of questionnaire I evolved my own method with own graduated scale for healthy lifestyle. The reason to develop my own method was that I {{did not find any}} sufficient scale or method in any publication focused on lifestyle that would globally cover all topics of my questionnaire. Results are illustrated in graphs and confronted among each other at first in particular areas healthy lifestyle and then globally evaluated according to norm of healthy lifestyle. Attachments of this thesis is questionary exploited during investigation of questionnaire on four universities in Prague...|$|R
40|$|Implication {{for health}} policy/practice/research/medical education: The {{aim of this}} study is to {{determine}} the association between TB and cigarette smoking in an endemic area for tuberculosis. In gen-eral, the findings of this research are indicative of strong association between TB and smoking. These results prompt for including interventions for smoking cessation in the current tuberculosis control practice. Background: The association between smoking and tuberculosis (TB), which has been proven in multiple studies with different study population ethnicity, has not yet re-ceived sufficient attention in terms of TB control. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine the association between TB and cigarette smoking in southeastern Iran, an endemic area for tuberculosis. Patients and Methods: This prospective case-control study conducted at a University-Affiliated Hospital (Boo-Ali Hospital, Zahedan, and Southeastern Iran) from March 2007 to March 2012 enrolled 253 TB patients and 312 healthy controls. Factors including his-tory of cigarette smoking, duration of smoking, number of cigarettes <b>smoked</b> per day, <b>consumption</b> of other drugs (parenteral and non-parenteral), and family history of tu-berculosis and smoking, were evaluated in both cases and controls.
