In addition, we also generalize RMAC into a comprehensive MAC protocol that provides both reliable and unreliable services for all the three modes of communications: unicast, multicast, and broadcast. Our evaluation shows that RMAC achieves a high degree of reliability with very limited overhead. We also compare RMAC with other reliable multicast MAC protocols, showing that RMAC not only provides higher reliability but also involves lower cost.

The sender-initiated <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> is used to assist in channel access, and will be set up when a node finds it difficult to access the channel.

30|$|The MAC schemes in the {{literature}} that are targeting VANETs {{can be divided into}} two classes: CSMA-based and TDMA-based. The CSMA-based protocols considered, for example, in [5, 6] are enhanced by providing different priority levels allowing packets with higher priorities to have shorter listening period before a channel access attempt is made. However, the channel may still be busy and when it is, a transmitter with higher priority traffic will randomize a shorter backoff time than transmitters with lower priority traffic. This type of prioritization mechanism where the delay before channel access together with the backoff time is manipulated according to packet priorities is also found in the standard IEEE 802.11 e which is included in IEEE 802.11 p. In [5], there is also an additional feature where a potential transmitter sends a <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> using a reserved frequency to get the attention from the intended recipient, which then polls the <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> sender.

40|$|Abstract The {{emerging}} vehicular {{networks are}} targeted to provide efficient communications between mobile vehicles and fixed roadside units (RSU), and support mobile multimedia applications and safety services with diverse {{quality of service}} (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we propose a <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> based medium access control (MAC) protocol with enhanced QoS provisioning for life critical safety services. By using <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> signals for efficient channel preemption in both contention period (CP) and contention free period (CFP), emergency users can access the wireless channel with strict priority when they compete with multimedia users, and thus achieve the minimal access delay. Furthermore, through efficient transmission coordination on the <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> channel, contention level can be effectively reduced, and the overall network resource utilization can be improved accordingly. We then develop an analytical model to quantify the medium access delay of emergency messages.

40|$|The ISM {{spectrum}} {{is becoming increasingly}} populated by emerging wireless networks. Spectrum sharing among the same network of devices can be arbitrated by MAC proto-cols (e. g., CSMA), but the coexistence between heteroge-neous networks remains a challenge. The disparate power levels, asynchronous time slots, and incompatible PHY lay-ers of heterogeneous networks severely degrade the effective-ness of traditional MAC. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, called the Cooperative <b>Busy</b> <b>Tone</b> (CBT), that enables the reliable coexistence between two such networks, ZigBee and WiFi. CBT allows a separate ZigBee node to schedule a <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> concurrently with the desired trans-mission, thereby improving the visibility of ZigBee devices to WiFi. Its core components include a frequency flip scheme that prevents the mutual interference between cooperative ZigBee nodes, and a <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> scheduler that minimizes the interference to WiFi, for both CSMA and TDMA packets. To optimize CBT, we establish an analytical framework that relates its key design parameters to performance and cost.

However, during DIFS and backoff stages, high priority stations with queued packets send an energy pulse every M slots, where M is a constant. Between two consecutive <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> pulse transmissions, {{there should be}} at least one empty Slot Time interval, as the station must have a chance to listen to the data channel. Therefore, M could be any value larger than or equal to 2 and, the IFS of low priority stations should be larger than M slots, in order to enable sensing the <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> signal.|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of node cooperation and multiple access performance in multihop wireless networks, a rapid cooperation-differentiated medium access control (MAC) protocol is proposed. In the protocol, the helper selection process is divided into a priority differentiation phase and contention resolution phase for helpers with the same priority. A higher priority helper can choose an earlier minislot in the priority differentiation phase to send a <b>busy</b> <b>tone.</b> As a result, the protocol promptly selects all the highest priority helpers. The contention resolution phase for the same priority helpers can use any existing collision resolution scheme, such as the k-round elimination contention scheme. Helpers sending a <b>busy</b> <b>tone</b> first can proceed to the next round, while others, sensing the <b>busy</b> <b>tone,</b> subsequently withdraw from contention. Therefore, a unique optimal helper is selected from the highest priority helpers with high probability. A packet piggyback mechanism is also adopted, which allows a high data rate helper with its own data packets, to transmit these to their recipient without reservation. This significantly decreases the reservation overhead and effectively improves cooperation efficiency and channel utilization. Simulation {{results show that the}} maximum throughput of the proposed protocol is 39.6 % and 9.6 % higher than those of the cooperative MAC-aggregation (CoopMACA) and instantaneous relay-based cooperative MAC protocols, respectively, in a wireless local area network environment, and 40.8 % and 31.9 % higher, respectively, in an ad hoc network environment.|$|R
