40|$|The {{totality of}} all {{environmental}} influences, including domestic and industrial noise, {{must be taken}} into account in the design <b>of</b> <b>building</b> structures. Building envelopes that have appropriate acoustic protection properties are to be used in the practice of the acoustic protection (soundproofing, etc.). According to the principles of structural design, design <b>of</b> <b>soundproof</b> <b>buildings</b> can be broken down into the two groups: design with account for the security conditions (eg., windows, doors, walls, floors), and design of noise-proof structures (eg., partitions, suspended ceilings). Multi-optional design <b>of</b> <b>building</b> structures or buildings that meet the terms of acoustic protection requires a modern approach to the process of their development. Any progress in this area is associated with computer-aided design supported by multiple analysis options. Automation allows adjustments in order to comply with the variety of the input data or objective functions to provide for optimal cycling options. In this regard, the authors describe the algorithms and principles <b>of</b> design <b>of</b> <b>building</b> envelopes on the condition of and subject to the acoustic protection. The proposed solution represents a software package capable of performing a multivariate analysis of options of acoustic protection at each stage <b>of</b> <b>building</b> design. Practical application of the software package used to solve practical problems in the design <b>of</b> <b>building</b> envelopes has demonstrated its higher efficiency that the one of traditional design methods.

On June 25, 1994, the line was cut back to Orient Heights at all times to permit reconstruction of the outer stations.

40|$|Abstract: With rapid urbanization, {{the volume}} of traffic in urban area has been {{significantly}} increased. This in turn led to problem which {{can be described as}} Road Traffic Noise. Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation <b>of</b> <b>soundproofing</b> walls is rising. Among different shapes <b>of</b> <b>soundproof</b> walls being installed, the reflection-type acoustical insulation panel is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque acoustical insulation panel. On the other hand, improving the <b>soundproofing</b> wall <b>of</b> the reflection-type acoustical insulation barrier panel needs to be focused on since it has a possibility to cause a secondary damage by reflected sounds. Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape <b>of</b> the reflection-type <b>soundproofing</b> panel. A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type soundproofing panel and the improved soundproofing panel, with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type <b>of</b> <b>soundproofing</b> panel has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors. Thus, it turns out that the study shows a potential possibility to develop a reduction technology of the reflected sound...|$|R

The thesis {{has been a}} noumenal design process into the subject of timber towers, where the conceptual system is designed to work in accordance with engineering concepts for tall buildings. The system uses mass timber as the primary structural material supported by embedded steel plates. The introduced system plays to the strength and weaknesses of both corresponding materials. Mass timber is used as the primary material {{that is designed to}} take care of the dead & live loads, while steel is used as a secondary material to give additional support to the vertical loads. The structural system is interpolated to three different height categories; 10, 20 & 30. The timber & steel system is designed to be prefabricated in parts and assembled on site.

50|$|Residents of some {{communities}} also opposed restoration of {{service on the}} Greenbush branch {{on the grounds that}} it would increase noise levels and aesthetically mar the neighborhoods through which the new rail service was to run. Concerns were also raised about traffic jams being created at the grade crossings while the gates were down for trains to pass. Partially as a result of extensive litigation, the MBTA then worked with the towns along the Greenbush route to enact several measures to mitigate the environmental impact of the restored train service. These included constructing an 890 ft long tunnel costing $40 million under downtown Hingham, another trenched underpass at Weymouth Landing, and the <b>soundproofing</b> <b>of</b> homes and businesses located near the railroad tracks. Ultimately, the legal and political delays and ensuing mitigation delayed the opening of the line for many years and resulted in a greatly increased cost. The line eventually cost $534 million - equal to the cost of the two Old Colony Lines branches combined.|$|R

40|$|Subject: an {{important}} {{task in the}} design of internal enclosing structures of apartments is the establishment <b>of</b> their required <b>soundproofing</b> ability. At present, there is no reliable method for determining the required sound insulation and in this regard internal enclosures are designed without proper justification for noise protection. Research objectives: development of a technique for determining the required sound insulation of apartment’s internal enclosures to ensure an acceptable noise regime in the apartments’ rooms under the action of intra-apartment noise sources. Materials and methods: the methodology was developed {{on the basis of a}} statistical method for noise calculation in the apartments, treated as systems of acoustically coupled proportionate rooms, and with the help of a computer program that implements this method. Results: the technique makes it possible to generate, with the use of computer technologies, a targeted selection of internal enclosures of the apartment to meet their soundproofing requirements. Conclusions: the technique proposed in the article can be used at the design stage of apartments when determining the required <b>soundproofing</b> <b>of</b> partitions and doors. Using this technique, it is possible to harmonize the sound insulation ratio of individual elements among themselves and thereby guarantee a selection of internal structures for their acoustic and economic efficiency...|$|R
