Concurrently, they demand continuity of supply and more involvement with suppliers and others to provide unexpected results. The key concept making this all possible is to significantly reduce waste and its costs. This presentation shows how managing the <b>seven</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> holds great potential to improve supply chain operations, reduce cycle time, control costs and enhance quality and process productivity. We will identify <b>seven</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and establish ways to quickly eliminate or significantly reduce waste and costs. We will look at several processes that can quickly help an organization control or eliminate waste and its subsequent costs. These synergistic processes must involve our suppliers and {{their support for the}} program. We will learn to evaluate existing procedures, extend the range of knowledge concerning lean operations along with supplier relations and cost control and to consider new ideas concerning change. Eliminating waste and cost is the goal and we get there by being lean. Objectives. Participants in this workshop will understand these concepts. That their operations include and hide waste everywhere. That lean operations reduce the forms of waste from any operation. That eliminating waste maximizes value for our customers, our workforce and our owners. Types of Waste. There are many lists of waste, but I like and use this list developed by Professor Rajan Suri. It is a terrible thing to say or think, but much of what we do is just waste...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{ergonomic}} production {{methods in}} concrete casting {{does have a}} significant human, social and financial impact {{in terms of the}} reduction of occupational injuries and related injury compensations. This paper presents a case study of comparative analyses of the ergonomic situations for concrete workers casting with two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> concrete, namely the conventional concrete and the self-compacting concrete (SCC). Analyses were conducted with two methods for the identification of ergonomic hazards; and in comparison to conventional concrete, the analysis results have shown that SCC consistently gave significant improvements in work postures and led to less workload and noise exposure among concrete workers. The combination of lean thinking and ergonomics result in a system where  the worker is as efficient, safe, and comfortable as possible during the concrete casting work process. Material handling plays a significant role in lean construction by keeping the worker at the center and ameliorating many of the ergonomic problems that would otherwise remove the person from the production process. Transportation and unnecessary motion are two <b>of</b> the <b>seven</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> that can be significantly reduced with the implementation of an ergonomic production system such as SCC that eliminates awkward work postures and vibrating tools. With the correct ergonomic material/product used in production <b>of</b> concrete structures, <b>waste</b> can be removed from the production system, thus creating an increase in production, decreased costs, an increase in quality of the product and less absence of workers in the future due to less stressful work.

In the process of improving healthcare systems and decreasing resource usage the healthcare organizations have started to look at what the industry has accomplished with their lean production. This study focuses on lean healthcare, which is a controversial subject with both opportunities and threats. The aim is to investigate if and how streamlining an emergency departments triage, which is a prioritizing unit within the emergency department, can be done with methods from lean. The study is built on a literature review and a case study, the tools value stream mapping and <b>seven</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> originating from lean. The results from this study is partly a mapping of the current situation that shows how patients and information flows through the emergency departments triage and partly interviews and queue statistics.

40|$|Value {{and waste}} are {{concepts}} {{that are used}} in improvement projects. In lean the concepts are fairly simple. Reduce the waste and the value has increased. However, value is both multidimensional and differs over time. If the concepts value and waste are to be used, the concepts must be clearly defined and measured. Otherwise, value can be reduced for the customer/user and the cost increased for the producer/seller. The purpose in this thesis is to investigate how value and waste are perceived by different stakeholders, how value and waste are related, and how value and waste are measured. The focus of the study is the improvement of production and services. The study does not investigate the product/service development. The conclusions are based on a number of cases and research from different fields such as resource-based view and marketing. The study use mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Measures of forecasting accuracy and their relations where explored with different statistical tools {{in order to understand the}} influence of measures and dimensions. The view of value concerning energy efficiency was examined in a statistical analysis of a survey concerning stakeholders’ view of a specific value, energy efficiency, as well as their influence on the value creation process. A multiple qualitative case study explores the relation between value and waste in different settings and the consequences of waste focus. The findings in the multiple case study are confirmed and elaborated further by an additional case study, both qualitative and quantitative, of value stream mapping. Value and waste are analysed with the use of order winners and qualifiers. Also, a model to clarify the consequences of mixing value creation and value exchange for customer/user and producer/seller have been defined and used in the analysis. Depending on the stakeholder there is a difference between whether value can be regarded as a use value, exchange value or both. Even if exchange value is related to a specific moment in time, use value is not. The view of value differs among stakeholders which increase the risk of sub-optimisation in production. Value and waste have multi-dimensional properties and there are links between the different dimensions. The relationships depend upon the situation in question. The lean <b>seven</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> are not independent dimensions. Also, the concept of waste as anti-value is too simplistic. In all cases studied the focus is on waste, not value. Also, it is often the symptoms of waste that are of interest in measures taken not the root causes. Reduction of waste without considering the value can create new waste. Since waste is a dependent variable, it should not be measured without considering value. Another complication is that value and waste often occurs at different points in time and in different settings. Single measures are sensitive to its environment. Several measures are more robust. Measures distort and influence the perception and thereby the decision of the studied phenomena. Also, the notion of value and waste becomes harder to define and trace as the resolution and detailing of the studied process increases.
