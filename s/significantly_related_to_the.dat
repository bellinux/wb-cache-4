25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wish {{to be held in}} high esteem.

Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E

The Ryukyuans have a specific culture with some matriarchal elements, native religion, and cuisine which had fairly late 12th century introduction of rice. The population lived on the islands in isolation for many centuries, and in the 14th century from the three divided Okinawan political polities emerged the Ryukyu Kingdom (1429-1879) which continued the maritime trade and tributary relations started in 1372 with Ming dynasty China. In 1609 the kingdom was invaded by Satsuma Domain which allowed its independence being in vassal status because the Tokugawa Japan was prohibited to trade with China, being in dual subordinate status between both China and Japan.|$|E
5000|$|In psychology, Attachment {{theory is}} a model that {{attempts}} to describe the interpersonal relationships people have throughout their lives. The most commonly recognized four styles of attachment in adults are: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant. With the rapid increase in social networking sites, scientists have become interested in the phenomenon of people relying on these sites for their attachment needs. Attachment style has been <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of social media use and social orientation on Facebook. Additionally, attachment anxiety {{has been found to}} be predictive of less feedback seeking and Facebook usage, whereas attachment avoidance was found to be predictive less feedback seeking and usage.

Furthermore, the authors suggest that anxious people behave more actively on social media sites because they are motivated to seek positive feedback from others. Despite their attempts to fulfill their needs, data suggests that individuals who use social media to fulfill these voids are typically disappointed and further isolate themselves by reducing their face-to-face interaction time with others.|$|E

50|$|The 60 kDa form of {{chaperonin}} is the immunodominant antigen {{of patients}} with Legionnaire's disease, and is thought {{to play a role}} in the protection of the Legionella bacteria from oxygen radicals within macrophages. This hypothesis is based on the finding that the cpn60 gene is upregulated in response to hydrogen peroxide, a source of oxygen radicals. Cpn60 has also been found to display strong antigenicity in many bacterial species and has the potential for inducing immune protection against unrelated bacterial infections. The RuBisCO subunit binding protein (which has been implicated in the assembly of RuBisCO) and cpn60 have been found to be evolutionary homologues, the RuBisCO subunit binding protein having the C-terminal Gly-Gly-Met repeat found in all bacterial cpn60 sequences. Although the precise function of this repeat is unknown, it is thought to be important as it is also found in 70 kDa heat-shock proteins.

50|$|Making {{sustainable}} consumption choices are <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role of habit and routine behaviours. Habits {{can be thought}} of as procedural strategies to reduce the cognitive effort associated with making choices, particularly in situations that are relatively stable. They allow us to perform routine actions with a minimum of deliberation and often only limited awareness. Moreover, the evidence suggests that habit is a crucial component in a wide variety of environmentally-significant activities: travel behaviour, shopping patterns, household chores, waste disposal, leisure activities, and even personal hygiene. Habits are formed through repetition and reinforcement. Andersen (1982) identifies three stages in the formation of a new habit. The first stage, or declarative stage, involves information processing relating to a particular choice or action. At this stage the attitudinal and affective responses to this information are both important. The information challenges the existing choice, but at this stage does not actually change coffee-buying behaviour. In the second knowledge compilation stage, however, this information is converted into a new routine by exercising a different choice in practice. When the action itself is associated with a clear positive reinforcement, and repeated over time, a ‘cognitive script’ is developed which enables to repeat the same action in similar circumstances with very little cognitive effort. This final procedural stage locks into a new coffee-buying habit and virtually without thinking now the ethically traded coffee is tossed into the supermarket trolley week after week. At this stage, the behaviour is more or less automatized and bypasses rational deliberation almost completely.|$|E

IL- 1 is expressed {{early in the}} insulate infiltrate and may {{be regarded as a}} circulating biomarker of T 1 DM risk. The major IL- 1 activities are performed by IL- 1 β, which is released from producing cells through pathways as yet unclear, and IL- 1 α that is either anchored in the plasma membrane or transported into the nucleus as a transcriptional coregulator (Dinarello et al. 2012). Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive substance created inside the body and acting as a regulator of immune response (Moore et al. 2001). The release of IL- 10 produces an efficient autocrine mechanism for controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine production when its expression was delayed (Kolla et al. 2009).|$|R

A cross-sectional research design, involving a mail questionnaire survey, was employed to collect data from a sample of franchisors operating in the UK. The hypotheses specified in the study were tested using regression (including moderated regression) analyses.
