40|$|Summary: The recent {{identification}} of the facial fat compartments has greatly affected our understanding of midfacial aging. This article chronicles the discovery of these fat compartments including the shift of attention from a purely gravitational to a volumetric approach to facial aging and the series of methodologies attempted to ultimately define the anatomy of these compartments. The revived interest in volumetric facial rejuvenation including compartment-guided augmentation techniques is discussed. Lastly, the article discusses interesting distributional patterns noted in these fat compartments likely related to the different mechanical and biologic environments of the deep and <b>superficial</b> facial <b>fat</b> pads...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Knee {{ligament}} reconstructions {{are commonly}} performed using hamstring tendon grafts. We observed anecdotally {{that there was}} a difference in the <b>fat</b> distribution <b>superficial</b> to the pes anserinus between men and women and proposed that this effect was independent of BMI, being significantly greater in women. Methods. We performed a prospective study to evaluate 40 MRI scans performed in 20 women and 20 men. The scans allowed visualisation of the insertion of the hamstring tendons at the pes anserinus. Results. The mean BMI of the male patients was 25. 6 (19. 8 – 37. 2) and of the female patients was 24. 7 (17. 9 – 34. 5). The mean <b>fat</b> distribution <b>superficial</b> to the pes anserinus in men was 16. 2 [*]mm (4. 1 – 29. 4) and in women was 29. 7 [*]mm (19. 6 – 47. 5). There was a significant increase in <b>fat</b> <b>superficial</b> to the hamstring tendons in women compared with men (P< 0. 001), despite no significant difference in BMI (P= 0. 5). Conclusions. Our evaluation of a prospective series of MRI scans has shown that there is significantly more <b>fat</b> <b>superficial</b> to the insertion of the hamstring tendons in women than in men. This effect is independent of BMI and may influence exposure during hamstring tendon graft harvesting...|$|R

The subtle {{thickening}} of the bursa {{could be an}} early sign of subacromial impingement and possibly a rotator cuff tear. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the thickness of subacromial bursa measured using ultrasonography in the painful shoulder with normal side, and also to differ-entiate Neer stages I and II impingements in patients with unilateral shoulder pain. Methods: We performed bilateral shoulder sonography in 268 consecutive patients with unilateral shoulder pain and clinical suggestion of rotator cuff pathology.

40|$|The {{anatomic}} {{understanding of}} the superficial compartments {{of the head and}} neck are evolving. Recently, studies have shown that the <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> is sequestered into separate “compartments”; however, the superficial anatomy of the submental region of the neck has yet to be defined, and improved understanding of this area may lead to advances in our ability to rejuvenate the neck. This cadaveric investigation revealed that there is one <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> compartment in the submental region. The anterior boundary of this compartment, previously without name, has been labeled the “submental septum. ” The posterior boundary of the submental fat compartment is created by a septum that arises from the platysma at a point superficial to the hyoid. Because this area is over the hyoid, it has been named the “suprahyoid septum. ” The lateral septal boundaries have been labeled the “digastric septae. ...|$|E

40|$|EMT 6 {{multicellular}} spheroids {{were introduced}} into the peritoneal cavities of mice and allowed to become vascularised, resulting in solid spherical tumours. The necrotic cores of the initially avascular spheroids were replaced by vascularised tumour tissue but the outer zones of the spheroids failed to become vascularised. The presence of both vascular and avascular components in each spheroid allowed {{the role of the}} vasculature in the antitumour action of flavone acetic acid (FAA) to be determined. Eighteen hours after treatment with FAA 0. 8 mmol kg- 1, the vascularised core became necrotic and haemorrhagic, while the outer avascular zone remained viable. Tumour cells which were infiltrating <b>superficial</b> sub-mesothelial <b>fat</b> did not become necrotic despite the presence of numerous thrombi in associated vessels. Injection of two fluorescent vascular markers, the first (Hoechst 33342) together with FAA, and the second (10 -nonyl acridine orange) 4 h later, demonstrated that there is a marked loss of blood flow in the spheroids. These results provide further evidence that FAA kills blood vessel-dependent tumour cells by interrupting the tumour blood supply...|$|R

50|$|Reshaping the {{buttocks}} with liposculpture is performed {{with a small}} cannula (2 mm) specifically for contouring <b>superficial</b> body <b>fat,</b> the configuration of which (number of open ports) {{is determined by the}} type and the degree of gluteal correction to be realized. To sculpt rounded contours to square-shaped buttocks muscles, superficial liposculpture allows the plastic surgeon to control the injection-rate of the fat-volume. Moreover, superficial liposuction can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required functional, anatomic correction, and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the patient, such as reshaping the lateral area of {{the buttocks}} into an athletic form. The study Contouring the Gluteal Region with Tumescent Liposculpture (2011) indicated that effective, gluteal-region contouring is best achieved by tailoring the liposuction-reduction and the lipoinjection-augmentation techniques to the anatomic topography of the body areas to be corrected. Furthermore, the study Contouring of the Gluteal Region in Women: Enhancement and Augmentation (2011) indicated that natural contours of the buttocks and the thighs are effectively achieved with a combined gluteoplasty of selective liposuction and lipoinjection, which reduces the need for aggressive surgical procedures, decreases the risk of medical complications, abbreviates wound-recovery-time, and lessens post-operative scarring. Combined with any buttocks-correction method, superficial liposculpture facilitates the treatment of contour irregularities, the surgical revision of scars, and the correction of gluteal-region contour depressions.|$|R

40|$|Cortisol is {{involved}} in the distribution and deposition of fat, and its action is regulated by the activity of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Glycyrrhetinic acid, the active principle of licorice root, blocks 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, thus reducing the availability of cortisol at the level of adipocytes. We evaluated the effect of topical application of a cream containing glycyrrhetinic acid in the thickness of fat {{at the level of the}} thigh. Eighteen healthy women (age range 20 - 33 years) with normal BMI were randomly allocated to treatment, at the level of the dominant thigh, with a cream containing 2. 5 % glycyrrhetinic acid (n= 9) or with a placebo cream containing the excipients alone (n= 9). Before and after 1 month of treatment both the circumference and the thickness of the <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> layer of the thighs (by ultrasound analysis) were measured. The circumference and the thickness of the <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> layer were significantly reduced in comparison to the controlateral untreated thigh and to control subjects treated with the placebo cream. No changes were observed in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone or cortisol. The effect of glycyrrhetinic acid on the thickness of subcutaneous fat was likely related to a block of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 at the level of fat cells; therefore, glycyrrhetinic acid could be effectively used in the reduction of unwanted local fat accumulation...|$|E
30|$|Facial fat {{in these}} {{compartments}} age differently (hypotrophic versus hypertrophic changes or ptosis). For example, ageing causes hypertrophic ptotic {{changes in the}} nasolabial fat and middle cheek fat, and hypotrophic involution in the lateral temporal cheek fat and deep medial cheek fat, respectively. In patients with HIV-LA, substantial volumetric changes of the <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> compartments (nasolabial, medial and middle superficial cheek fat) occur, whereas deep facial fat units appear to be less affected [31]. Therefore, qualitative assessment of these compartments {{plays an important role}} in facial rejuvenation methods and, in particular, in deciding which fat compartments should be volumised [32, 33]. Knowledge of facial fat compartments may also help in understanding facial filler distribution and migration.|$|E
40|$|The contour of {{the neck}} is a very {{important}} determinant of facial aesthetics. Precise knowledge of neck anatomy is essential for adequate planning and execution of this procedure. There are three anatomic and surgical planes involved in the management of the aging neck; the <b>superficial</b> plane (subcutaneous <b>fat),</b> the intermediate plane (platysma muscles and the fat between the two muscles), and the deep plane (subplatysmal fat, the anterior belly of the digastric muscles, and the submandibular glands). These planes need to be thoroughly evaluated in the preoperative assessment and dealt with according to each patient’s needs. Even though this article focuses on isolated management of the aging neck, careful evaluation {{of the neck}} and its relationship to the lower third of the face is fundamental. If there is significant jowling and descent of the neck-face interface, an isolated neck-lift procedure will not address that problem and will lead to a suboptimal result. In these patients, a face and neck lift is a more appropriate operation...|$|R
40|$|Circulating ghrelin elevates {{abdominal}} adiposity by {{a mechanism}} independent of its central orexigenic activity. In {{this study we}} tested the hypothesis that peripheral ghrelin induces a depot-specific increase in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass in vivo by GH secretagogue receptor (GHS-R 1 a) -mediated lipolysis. Chronic iv infusion of acylated ghrelin increased retroperitoneal and inguinal WAT volume in rats without elevating <b>superficial</b> sc <b>fat,</b> food intake, or circulating lipids and glucose. Increased retroperitoneal WAT mass resulted from adipocyte enlargement probably due to reduced lipid export (ATP-binding cassette transporter G 1 mRNA expression and circulating free fatty acids were halved by ghrelin infusion). In contrast, ghrelin treatment did not up-regulate biomarkers of adipogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ 2 or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α) or substrate uptake (glucose transporter 4, lipoprotein lipase, or CD 36) and although ghrelin elevated sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 c expression, WAT-specific mediators of lipogenesis (liver X receptor-α and fatty acid synthase) were unchanged. Adiposity was unaffected by infusion of unacylated ghrelin, {{and the effects of}} acylated ghrelin were abolished by transcriptional blockade of GHS-R 1 a, but GHS-R 1 a mRNA expression was similar in responsive and unresponsive WAT. Microarray analysis suggested that depot-specific sensitivity to ghrelin may arise from differential fine tuning of signal transduction and/or lipid-handling mechanisms. Acylated ghrelin also induced hepatic steatosis, increasing lipid droplet number and triacylglycerol content by a GHS-R 1 a-dependent mechanism. Our data imply that, during periods of energy insufficiency, exposure to acylated ghrelin may limit energy utilization in specific WAT depots by GHS-R 1 a-dependent lipid retention...|$|R
40|$|From {{measurements}} of subcutaneous fat temperature (Tsf) at known depths below the surface, skin surface temperature (Tsk), and direct skin heat flux (H), the superficial shell isulation (Iss) of the thigh (fat + skin) was calculated as Iss (degrees C. m 2. w- 1) = (Tsf - Tsk) /H in nine male subjects immersed head {{out in a}} well-stirred water bath. Also, at critical water temperature (CWT = 28 - 33 degrees C), eight of the subjects rested for 3 h, enabling overall maximal tissue insulation (It,max) to be calculated as It,max (degrees C. m 2. W- 1) = (Tre - Tw) /(0. 92 M +/- delta S), where Tre is rectal temperature, Tw is water temperature, M is metabolic rate, and s is loss or gain of body heat. Five subjects performed up to 2 h of mild leg cycling, preceded and followed by 60 min of rest, and both thigh Iss and overall It were measured during exercise. Iss increased from minimal values in Tw greater than 33 degrees C to maximal values (Iss,max) at CWT or below. Iss,max was linearly related to tissue thickness (d) in millimeters of fat plus skin, Iss,max (degrees C. m 2. W- 1) = 0. 0048 d- 0. 0052; r = 0. 95, n = 37, and was not influenced by leg exercise up to a metabolic rate of 150 W. m- 2 in CWT despite large increases in Tsf and H and large decreases in overall It. The slope of Iss,max vs. depth, 0. 0048 degrees C. m 2. W- 1. mm- 1, is almost identical to thermal resistivity of fat in vitro, suggesting that the superficial shell is unperfused in CWT at rest or during mild exercise. When maximal superficial shell insulation (It,ss,max) for the whole body was calculated with allowance for differing fat thicknesses and surface areas of body regions, it could account for only 10 - 15 % of overall It,max at rest and 35 - 40 % of overall It in mild exercise. We suggest that the poorly perfused muscle shell plays a more important role as a defense against cooling at CWT than does the <b>superficial</b> shell (<b>fat</b> + skin), particularly at rest...|$|R

30|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} UCP 1 -positive adipocytes {{have been identified}} in mice: the classical brown fat cells and brown-like fat cells (also called beige or brite adipocytes) (Ishibashi and Seale, 2010; Seale et al., 2008). Unlike classical brown fat, which is derived from a myf- 5 lineage (Seale et al., 2008), beige cells in WAT are derived from a non-myf- 5 lineage and share features of both white and brown fat cells, including high expression of white adipocyte-specific markers (e.g. aP 2, adipsin, and PPAR-γ) (Ishibashi and Seale, 2010). Adult hBAT, which is dispersed mainly in the supraclavicular, para-aortic, and suprarenal regions and is densely innervated, could be activated by cold through the sympathetic nervous system (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011; Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000). However, unlike the classical brown adipocytes found in the interscapular regions of rodents and human infants, adult hBAT shares many molecular, histological, and functional characteristics with cold-induced beige fat found in the sWAT of rodents (Wu et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2014). For example, mouse beige cells express Slc 27 a 1, TMEM 26, TBX 1, CD 40, and CD 137 in a beige-selective manner, some of which, such as CD 137, TMEM 26, and TBX 1, are highly expressed in adult hBAT (Wu et al., 2012), indicating that cold-induced hBAT is more closely related to rodent beige fat rather than classical brown fat. Within adult human neck BAT, the gene expression pattern of <b>superficial</b> neck <b>fat</b> resembles that of mouse sWAT, while deep neck fat is more like mouse BAT with high UCP 1, PGC 1 -α, and D 2 levels (Qiu et al., 2014). A whole-genome microarray experiment showed that the best molecular markers for grouping human fat cells are: 1) MPZL 2, HOXC 9, EBF 3, FBXO 31, and LEP, as WAT markers; 2) TNFRSF 9, TMEM 26, and SHOX 2, as beige/brite markers; and 3) UCP 1, LHX 8, and ZIC 1, as BAT markers (Table  1) (Cypess et al., 2013). Taken together, these studies suggest that cold-induced activation of hBAT primarily involves beige fat recruitment. However, more detailed work is needed to determine whether cold-induced activation of hBAT is mediated mainly by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) or by alternative activation of the eosinophils-type 2 cytokine-macrophage signaling pathway (Qiu et al., 2014), or both.|$|R

The aim of the project is to evaluate the effect of bariatric on abdominal fat distribution in severely obese T 2 DM and non-T 2 DM obese patients. Study design and methods: A total of 23 morbidly obese subjects (mean ± SD body mass index 43. 0 ± 3. 6 kg/m 2, age 46. 5 ± 9. 0 years) were recruited from the lager multicenter SLEEVEPASS studies (ClinicalTrials. gov/NCT 00793143). 10 healthy age-matched non-obese individuals served as controls. The obese patients were studied before and 6 months after surgery. At baseline, there were 9 T 2 DMs and 14 non-diabetics. After surgery, there were 5 remitters and 4 nonremitters. Whole body magnetic resonance imaging including the abdominal regions was performed for the obese subjects before and 6 months after surgery and for the controls once. Abdominal fat were compartmentalized and analyzed. Results: At 6 months of follow-up, BMI in the obese decreased significantly (from 43 ± 4 to 33 ± 2 kg/m 2, p < 0. 001) with substantial improvement in whole body insulin sensitivity (from 12. 2 ± 5. 7 to 23. 3 ± 8. 1 µmol/kg/min, p < 0. 001). Intraperitoneal fat mass decreased by 46 % (from 3. 4 ± 1. 1 to 1. 9 ± 1. 0 kg, p < 0. 001) more {{than the rest of}} the compartments. Abdominal visceral compartments in obese correlated with glycemic status independent of surgery. Pre-surgery posterior deep and intraperitoneal fat mass were better predictors of post-surgery glycemic status in obese. Remitters showed significant improvement in whole body insulin sensitivity (from 9. 1 ± 2. 1 to 20. 9 ± 8. 4 µmol/kg/min, p = 0. 02), fasting glucose decreased significant only in nonremitters (from 7. 1 ± 1. 1 to 6. 0 ± 0. 8 mmol/l, p = 0. 05) after surgery. There were no differences in extraperitoneal fat mass in remitters and <b>superficial</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> in non-remitters but all other compartments decreased significantly 6 months after the surgery Conclusion: Both deep subcutaneous and visceral fat are important contributors to glycemic status in obese subjects.

40|$|Superficial subdermal liposuction (SSL) was {{presented}} by the authors as an evolution in traditional liposuction in 1989. It allows one to treat the <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> to obtain better skin retraction during every liposuction procedure. The use of ultrasound (US) in liposuction began 10 years ago as the direct application of this energy to the adipose tissue using a probe to obtain the selective destruction of fat, followed by its aspiration. This technique gave rise to many complications and thus many concerns. The external delivery of US has been proposed to overcome some of the drawbacks associated with this procedure. The authors investigate the role of external ultrasound (EU) {{used in conjunction with}} SSL. When comparing EU and SSL with SSL alone, pretreatment with EU results in less bleeding during liposuction, aspirated fat that is clearer and more oily, and less bruising and swelling during the early postoperative period. EU is an ideal complementary procedure to SSL because the crumbling of the fat induced by US permits a more uniform aspiration of the subdermal fat layer, making skin retraction more even and effective...|$|E
30|$|Injectable fillers {{are widely}} used for facial rejuvenation, {{correction}} of disabling volumetric fat loss in HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy, Romberg disease, and post-traumatic facial disfiguring. The {{purpose of this article}} is to acquaint the reader with the anatomy of facial fat compartments, as well as with the properties and key imaging features of commonly used facial fillers, filler-related complications, interpretation pitfalls, and dermatologic conditions mimicking filler-related complications. The distribution of facial fillers is characteristic and depends on the anatomy of the <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> compartments. Silicone has signature MRI features, calcium hydroxyapatite has characteristic calcifications, whereas other injectable fillers have overlapping imaging features. Most fillers (hyaluronic acid, collagen, and polyalkylimide–polyacrylamide hydrogels) have signal intensity patterns compatible with high water content. On PET-CT, most fillers show physiologic high FDG uptake, which should not be confounded with pathology. Abscess, cellulitis, non-inflammatory nodules, and foreign body granulomas are the most common filler-related complications, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis. Diffusion weighted imaging helps in detecting a malignant lesion masked by injected facial fillers. Awareness of imaging features of facial fillers and their complications helps to avoid misinterpretation of MRI, and PET-CT scans and facilitates therapeutic decisions in unclear clinical cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{observed}} that puncture of a lumbar disc may induce formation of a nodule {{on the surface of}} the disc and osteophytes. It is not known if this is based on the presence of a foreign tissue or specifically by the presence of nucleus pulposus or on the disc injury. In this study these mechanisms were separated by comparing disc puncture with application of nucleus pulposus without disc injury, with superficial disc injury without nucleus pulposus and with application of fat. Fifty rats underwent facetectomy of the left L 4 - 5 facet. Ten additional rats were used as donor rats. The rats were exposed to disc puncture (n= 10), application of homologous nucleus pulposus (n= 10), application of homologous fat tissue (n= 10), superficial disc injury (n= 10) and ten rats served as control. After 3 weeks the rats were examined macroscopically regarding presence of disc nodules and osteophytes. A limited histological analysis was performed to obtain a microscopic overview of any observed changes. In rats with application of <b>fat,</b> <b>superficial</b> disc injury and in sham controls there were almost no changes observed. However, in rats with disc puncture and applied nucleus pulposus there were clear disc nodules and osteophytes noted. Microscopically the nodules comprised granulation tissue and the osteophytes cortical bone. In conclusion, the data indicate that the presence of nucleus pulposus is more likely to be responsible for the formation of disc nodules and osteophytes than disc injury or the presence of a foreign tissue. This may provide new insights in the mechanisms regarding the formation of disc herniations and osteophytes...|$|R
40|$|Background - Although recent {{research}} on micro fat {{has shown the}} potential advantages of superficial implantation and high stem cell content, clinical applications thus far have been limited. Objectives - The authors report their experience with <b>superficial</b> enhanced fluid <b>fat</b> injection (SEFFI) for the correction of volume loss and skin aging of the face in general and in the periocular region. Methods - The finer SEFFI preparation (0. 5 mL) was injected into the orbicularis in the periorbital and perioral areas, and the 0. 8 -mL preparation was injected subdermally elsewhere in the face. Results - The records of 98 consecutive patients were reviewed. Average follow-up time was 6 months, and average volume of implanted fat was 20 mL and 51. 4 mL for the 0. 5 -mL and 0. 8 -mL preparations, respectively. Good or excellent results were achieved for volume restoration and skin improvement in all patients. Complications were minor and included an oil cyst in 3 patients. The smaller SEFFI quantity (0. 5 mL) was well suited to correct volume loss in the eyelids, especially the deep upper sulcus and tear trough, whereas the larger SEFFI content was effective for larger volume deficits {{in other areas of}} the face, including the brow, temporal fossa, zygomatic-malar region, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, chin, and lips. Conclusions - The fat administered by SEFFI is easily harvested via small side-port cannulae, yielding micro fat that is rich in viable adipocytes and stem cells. Both volumes of fat (0. 5 mL and 0. 8 mL) were effective for treating age-related lipoatrophy, reducing facial rhytids, and improving skin quality...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that puncture of a lumbar disc may induce formation of a nodule {{on the surface of}} the disc and osteophytes. It is not known if this is based on the presence of a foreign tissue or specifically by the presence of nucleus pulposus or on the disc injury. In this study these mechanisms were separated by comparing disc puncture with application of nucleus pulposus without disc injury, with superficial disc injury without nucleus pulposus and with application of fat. Fifty rats underwent facetectomy of the left L 4 - 5 facet. Ten additional rats were used as donor rats. The rats were exposed to disc puncture (n= 10), application of homologous nucleus pulposus (n= 10), application of homologous fat tissue (n= 10), superficial disc injury (n= 10) and ten rats served as control. After 3 weeks the rats were examined macroscopically regarding presence of disc nodules and osteophytes. A limited histological analysis was performed to obtain a microscopic overview of any observed changes. In rats with application of <b>fat,</b> <b>superficial</b> disc injury and in sham controls there were almost no changes observed. However, in rats with disc puncture and applied nucleus pulposus there were clear disc nodules and osteophytes noted. Microscopically the nodules comprised granulation tissue and the osteophytes cortical bone. In conclusion, the data indicate that the presence of nucleus pulposus is more likely to be responsible for the formation of disc nodules and osteophytes than disc injury or the presence of a foreign tissue.

40|$|Background: Facial {{aging is}} {{characterized}} by skin changes, sagging and volume loss. Volume is frequently addressed with reabsorbable fillers like hyaluronic acid gels. Materials and Methods: From an anatomical point of view, the deep and <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> compartments evolve differently with aging in a rather predictable manner. Volume can therefore be restored following a technique based on restoring first the deep volumes and there after the superficial volumes. We called this strategy "dual plane". A series of 147 consecutive patients have been treated with fillers using the dual plane technique {{in the last five}} years. Results: An average of 4. 25 session per patient has been carried out for a total of 625 treatment sessions. The average total amount of products used has been 12 ml per patient with an average amount per session of 3. 75 ml. We had few and limited adverse events with this technique. Conclusion: The dual plane technique is an injection technique based on anatomical logics. Different types of products can be used according to the plane of injection and their rheology in order to obtain a natural result and few side effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Deep {{tissue injury}} (DTI) is a severe type of pres-sure ulcer, in which damage initiates under intact skin, in soft tissues that are {{mechanically}} deformed by load-bearing bony prominences. Sitting-acquired DTI typically {{occurs in the}} glu-teus muscles that could sustain deformations by the weight-bearing ischial tuberosities (ITs). No clinical method currently exists for measuring internal tissue deformations; so design and selection of wheelchair cushions are based mostly on meas-uring sitting pressures. Our objective was to evaluate the influ-ence of different commercial cushions on internal soft-tissue deformations under the ITs, using weight-bearing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We specifically compared muscle, <b>superficial</b> <b>fat,</b> and effective (muscle and fat together) tissue deformations while subjects (n = 10) sat on four cushions (two viscoelastic and two foam) and directly on a rigid support. Deformations were maximal in muscle tissue (mean ~ 70 %), twice more the amount than in fat (~ 30 %). Effective soft-tissue deformations were ~ 50 % to ~ 60 %. Although cushions mildly reduced muscle deformations {{in the order of}} 10 %, theoreti-cally, our interpretation suggests that this deformation level adds safe sitting time. This study demonstrated that weight...|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, {{surgeons}} performing facial rejuvenation injections {{and cosmetic}} surgeries divided the facial fat into the superficial and deep fat layers separated by the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). The SMAS is a three-dimensional fibrous network {{that connects the}} periosteum, the muscles of facial expression, the platysma, and the fascia of the parotid gland with the dermis [20]. The <b>superficial</b> <b>fat</b> layer (located superficial to the SMAS) was long considered a single confluent mass, and treatments were designed to lift and reposition the fat pad as one single unit [21]. Similarly, practitioners injected facial fillers in arbitrarily defined facial compartments [21]. More recently, Gosai et al. {{were the first to}} classify the superficial facial fat into medial and lateral compartments (units) based on their relationship with the underlying muscles of facial expression on MRI [22]. Rohrich and Pessa demonstrated the actual anatomical divisions of the facial fat by injecting methylene blue dye into cadaveric facial specimen [23]. Subsequent studies by Rohrich et al. and other groups validated the anatomical division of the facial fat and also identified additional distinct compartments [24 – 28]. In 2012, Girrloff et al. quantified various facial fat compartments on CT scans after injecting iodinated contrast in a cadaveric facial specimen [29].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{present the}} {{qualitative}} and quantitative ultrasonographic findings of lower eyelid compartments in patients with chronic thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) compared to normal subjects. Methods: In a prospective study, dynamic and static ultrasonographic investigation, applying high resolution (15 Â MHz) ultrasound was performed to assess the lower eyelid, in 15 TAO patients that were in chronic phase and 10 normal subjects. The thickness and echogenisity of dermis, orbicular oculi muscle, lower eyelid retractor muscle, lower eyelid fat pads, and their qualitative relationships during vertical excursion of the globe were evaluated in static and dynamic investigation. Correlation of ultrasonic and clinical findings was evaluated. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 41. 82 Â Â±Â  7. 4 years, and the controls were age-matched (mean age, 42. 8 Â Â±Â  5. 6 years). Mean proptosis of the involved eyes was 3. 3 Â mm, and mean lower lid retraction was 2. 4 Â mm in chronic TAO group. Pattern of fat motion was blocky in chronic TAO patients compared to normal jelly motion of the fat in normal cases. In analyzing the range of motion, the difference was significant in the motion of both <b>superficial</b> and deep <b>fat</b> pockets between the two groups (PÂ <Â  0. 001). Limitation of fat motion correlated both with proptosis and lower eyelid retraction (Pearson correlation coefficientÂ =Â â 0. 77 vs â 0. 43, PÂ <Â  0. 001). Fibrotic changes of lower lid fat pads appearÂ in the tissue around the septum on observation. Considering the ultrasound findings, a new staging method is proposed in this study that starts with the appearance of echodense points, getting worse in fine bands, progresses to thick bands and ends in cord formation in the lower lid fat pocket that determines total fibrosis. Conclusion: Development of a series of static and dynamic changes in ultrasoundÂ is related to the clinical findings in chronic phase of TAO. The limitation of motion and fibrotic changes of lower eyelid fat pads were more detectable in cases with a more severe proptosis and lower lid retraction. It is considered that ultrasound findings can be a representative of the severity of involvement in the chronic phase of the TAO.

40|$|In this work, a great {{contribution}} to {{the knowledge of the}} biomechanics of the breast has been done. None of the previous works were valid to simulate the real movement of the breast and a little knowledge existed about many factors which {{play an important role in}} the behaviour of the breast. We have gone in depth in this field and provided the path that must be followed in the future computational and experimental studies about the breast. Many possibilities have been discarded shedding light on the way the development of the finite element model of the breast should be carried out. Moreover, the difficult interaction between the adipose tissue and the pectoral muscle has been pointed out as key in the process. Concerning the experimental work, a lot of relaxation test have been done in human adipose tissue, in the abdomen and in the breast. Different patients and areas have been tested. Two different viscoelastic models (with several hyperelastic strain energy functions) were adjusted to the experimental tests, providing very good results. For both of them, the independency of their constants with respect to the strain rate was proved, although the independency with respect to the strain level was not accomplished. That means that it is not possible to define a unique set of constants for the adipose tissue with these two models. Probably the tissue is suffering some damage at the different strain levels, making the constants dependent on it. This damage should be studied more carefully and a damage model should be used in case the degradation was confirmed. In spite of this fact, for a certain strain level, both models are valid, being the internal variables viscoelastic model, with an Ogden strain energy function, the formulation that adjusted the experimental results more accurately. Several comparisons have been made to analyse the differences between the mechanical behaviour of the adipose tissue of different areas and individuals. The mechanical behaviour of different individuals' abdominal fat was compared. Inter-individual differences were found in both, the elastic and the viscous constants, confirming that it was a correct decision to extract the specimens from the same individual in the subsequent statistical analyses, for example, to check the validity of the QLV and IVV models or to compare the adipose tissue from different anatomical regions. It is therefore advisable to extract the specimens from the same patient if avoiding the inter-individual effects is desired. In the comparison of the mechanical properties of the adipose tissue of several regions of the abdomen and the breast, differences were found between the superficial breast and three groups of the abdomen: superficial-medial, deep-medial and deep-lateral. However, there are no differences with the superficial-lateral group. No differences were detected between the deep breast and the rest of the groups either. These conclusions have a high relevance for the breast reconstruction surgery with autologous abdominal tissue. The breast adipose tissue can be considered as a unique tissue from the mechanical point of view. Moreover, in the breast reconstruction surgery, the deep breast fat can be replaced by any part of the abdomen, since no significant differences exist in the mechanical properties. However, the <b>superficial</b> breast <b>fat</b> should be replaced, if possible, by the superficial lateral region of the abdomen. Also important although with less clinical relevance are the differences found between regions of the abdominal adipose tissue. It seems that no differences exist in the mechanical properties between both regions of the superficial layer, between both parts of the deep layer and between both parts of the medial regions. However, differences between the deep and superficial layers were found, that is to say, the mechanical properties of the abdominal adipose tissue seem to change with the depth. Comparing the elastic part of the final model presented here for the breast adipose tissue with the Samani's constants (which are the only ones found in the literature for the breast fat), it can be seen that the behaviour modelled with the Samani's constants is much stiffer than that measured experimentally in this thesis. Also supported by the results obtained in the FE models, it seems that the constants provided by Samani do not correspond to the real behaviour of the breast adipose tissue. Regarding the computational work, several models, boundary conditions and strain energy functions for different materials have been tried. The deformed shape of the deformed breast model from supine to prone position has been improved much from the initial models, although some issues need to be solved yet to improve the models and finally obtain a deformation which can be considered valid. It has been found that none of the material models and boundary conditions proposed in the literature produce reasonable results. In particular, they yield an excessively stiff behaviour. The interaction between the muscle and the breast tissue has been detected to play a key role in the deformation of the breast. The properties of the muscle are not determinant, as the muscle is not activated during the change of position modelled here and, moreover, it is stiffer than the rest of the involved tissues. Of course, if an activity in which the dynamics matter, like running, is under study, the role of the muscle can change. The skin properties can be important in the global behaviour because it is the tissue which surrounds the organ. In general, a deeper knowledge about the mechanical properties of the materials is needed. Normally, these properties have been determined in the literature with one “simple" experimental test, whereas the deformation in the breast is not simple whatsoever and quite different from the experimental test which was carried out. This can lead to wrong results when using these mechanical properties in a computational model. In addition, more studies are needed about the internal structure of the tissues and their connections...|$|R
