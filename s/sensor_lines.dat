40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} case study of production monitoring on an aerospace composite component: the hinge arm of the droop nose mechanism on the Airbus A 380 wing leading edge. A sensor network composed of Fibre Bragg Gratings, capacitive sensors for cure monitoring and thermocouples was embedded in its fibre reinforced lay-up and measurements were acquired throughout its Resin Transfer Moulding production process. Two main challenges had to be overcome: first, the integration of the <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> in the existing Resin Transfer Moulding mould without modifying it; second, the demoulding of the component without damaging the <b>sensor</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed embedding solution has proved successful. The wavelength shifts of the Fibre Bragg Gratings were observed from the initial production stages, over the resin injection, the complete curing of the resin and the cooling-down prior to demoulding. The sensors proved to be sensitive to detecting the resin flow front, vacuum and pressure increase into the mould and the temperature increase caused by the resin curing. Measurements were also acquired during the post-curing cycle. Residual strains during all steps of the process were derived from the sensors’ wavelength shift, showing values up to 0. 2 % in compression. Moreover, the capacitive sensors were able to follow-up the curing degree during the production process. The sensors proved able to detect the resin flow front, whereas thermocouples could not measure an appreciable increase of temperature {{due to the fact that}} the resin had the same temperature as the mould...|$|E

Ice shelves During the German Antarctic field season 1989 / 90 (ANT VIII/ 5) special interest was focussed on {{the examination of the}} temperature-depth profile, the ice thickness and the bottom melting by means of hot-water drillings. The drillholes were located at 77 S and 52. 3 W, about 30 km inland from the ice front. The installation of temperature chains inside the drillholes down to the sea-water underneath the ice shelf yield data about the temperature-depth profile, the ice thickness and its variation, and the sea-water temperature. In addition TDR measurements on <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> and surface measurements for the determination of ice-shelf bottom melting were performed. From re-measurements in 1991 / 92 a value for the bottom melting rate of m=- 1. 4 #+-# 0. 5 ma"-" 1 could be determined from three independent measuring techniques. The temperature regime of the ice shelf has a strong influence on the material properties of ice.

Experiments with such an encoding yielded results with poor generalization capability. A new encoding scheme was developed, based on the conceptual graph formalism. This entailed designing a set of concepts and a set of associated relations appropriate to the upper case letters of the English alphabet. From these, the following were developed: a conceptual graph representation for each letter, a connection matrix for each, and finally, a C-vector and an R-vector representation for each. The latter were used as the output encoding (21 bits) of the NN pattern recognizer. A feed-forward neural network with 256 inputs, 21 outputs, and 2 hidden layers was trained using the back-propagation- of-error algorithm.

Measuring internal strains of composite structures is of great interest {{with respect to the}} structural integrity of aerospace structures. A large number of sensors are required for large-scale structures such as aircraft. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor system based on the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology offers a versatile and powerful one for strain monitoring of large structures due to the advantage of multiplexing capability.

In plants, {{it has been suggested}} that chloroplasts also display Ca 2 + regulation. So far monitoring of stromal Ca 2 + dynamics in vivo has exclusively relied on using the luminescent Ca 2 + probe aequorin. This technique is, however, limited in resolution and can only provide a readout averaged over chloroplast populations from different cells and tissues. Here we present a toolkit of Arabidopsis Ca 2 + <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> expressing plastid-targeted FRET-based Yellow Cameleon (YC) sensors. We demonstrate that the probes reliably report in vivo Ca 2 + dynamics in the stroma of root plastids in response to extracellular ATP and of leaf mesophyll and guard cell chloroplasts during light-to-low intensity blue light illumination transition. Applying YC sensing of stromal Ca 2 + dynamics to single chloroplasts we confirm findings of gradual, sustained stromal Ca 2 + increases at the tissue level after light-to-low intensity blue light illumination transitions, but monitor transient Ca 2 + spiking as a distinct and previously unknown component of stromal Ca 2 + signatures. Spiking was dependent on the availability of cytosolic Ca 2 + but not synchronized between the chloroplasts of a cell. In contrast, the gradual sustained Ca 2 + increase, occurred independent of cytosolic Ca 2 + suggesting intra-organellar Ca 2 + release.

40|$|Multispectral and stereo band {{evaluations}} of mode D data (Blue, NIR, Pan fore and aft) from the MOMS- 2 P mission on MIR are presented. Along-track MOMS- 02 stereo datasets are {{observations of the}} earth surface from three distinct view directions with the same illumination conditions. MOMS- 02 mode D data allows to investigate three out of five signature types known in remote sensing: spatial, spectral and angular signatures. The remotely sensed signal is always {{a combination of these}} three signature types. Visual as well as computer based analysis indicates, that the result of multispectral and anisotropy based calssification is determined by different biophysical parameters. In case of vegetation, the spectral approach explores mainly the absorption of incoming radiation by pigments and water, while the anisotropy information is due to stand structure and plant architecture. The synergistic potential of the combined use of multispectral and anisotropy information is pointed out by the increase of the classification accuracy for the combined multispectral and stereo bands evaluation. The results of visual interpretation led to the conclusion that a further substantial increase can be expected using common classification routines. For the retrieval of bio-and geo-physical parameters, the accurate radiometric correction is of decisive importance. Both, radiometric calibration of the sensor, as well as the correction for atmospheric attenuation, are to be performed before a quantitative data analysis. The method used for the radiometric calibration of the MOMS- 2 P CCD <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> used for multispectral and stereo data registration is presented and the results are briefly discussed.
