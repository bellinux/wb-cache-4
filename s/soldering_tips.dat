50|$|Historically, {{stained glass}} <b>soldering</b> <b>tips</b> were copper, heated by {{being placed in}} a {{charcoal}}-burning brazier. Multiple tips were used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back in the brazier of charcoal and the next tip was used.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} is to use magnetized <b>soldering</b> <b>tips</b> which lose their magnetic properties at a specific temperature, the Curie point. As long as the tip is magnetic, it closes a switch to supply power to the heating element. When it exceeds the design temperature it opens the contacts, cooling until the temperature drops enough to restore magnetisation. More complex Curie-point irons circulate a high-frequency AC current through the tip, using magnetic physics to direct heating only where {{the surface of the}} tip drops below the Curie point.|$|E
50|$|Small irons heated by a battery, or by {{combustion}} {{of a gas}} such as butane in a small self-contained tank, can be {{used when}} electricity is unavailable or cordless operation is required. The operating temperature of these irons is not regulated directly; gas irons may change power by adjusting gas flow. Gas-powered irons may have interchangeable tips including different size <b>soldering</b> <b>tips,</b> hot knife for cutting plastics, miniature blow-torch with a hot flame, and small hot air blower for such applications as shrinking heat shrink tubing.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design microsolder control, which can hold {{constant}} temperature of <b>solder</b> <b>tip</b> and description of hardware and firmware implementation. This solution allows the same function like classical microsolders but you can connect modern <b>solder</b> <b>tip</b> with high heat capacity. Other requirements are: switching frequency should be above the audible frequency, rotary encoder for temperature adjust, LCD display...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{circuit design}} and {{realization of the}} power and control system, which can hold constant temperature of <b>solder</b> <b>tip.</b> Control system is based on microcontroller Atmega 328 of company Atmel, {{part of the work}} is the implementation and debugging control software. This solution allows to enter temperature by rotary encoder and to show the real temperature on LCD displey. This hardware also detects disconnection of <b>solder</b> <b>tip,</b> acoustic signals when the required temperature is reached and it holds last set temperature...|$|R
50|$|For non-electronic {{applications}} soldering torches use a flame {{rather than}} a <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> to heat <b>solder.</b> Soldering torches are often powered by butane and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel torches suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, {{can be used for}} soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or without a <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch by directly applying the open flame.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} Takahashi controller with {{an adaptive}} system identification in a fast response application and describes hardware design with an 8 -bit microcontroller. Takahashi controller is modified PSD controller {{and due to}} simple calculation of controller's parameters it can be implemented into the 8 -bit microcontroller. The microcontroller was selected from Freescale semiconductor, specifically MC 9 S 08 DZ 60 which has maximum allowed frequency 40 MHz. The identification {{is based on the}} least squared recursive method {{in the beginning of the}} control process and during the operation at the moment when user changes systems parameters. These are given by the application of the fast response temperature control of <b>soldering</b> <b>tips</b> which are changeable during soldering process. In the first part of the paper the controller is described and in the second part practical aspects of hardware design, such as low power consumption, method how to measure temperature by thermocouple which shares wires with heater and design of AD converter are described...|$|E
50|$|The {{acoustic}} energy {{created by the}} <b>solder</b> <b>tip</b> or ultrasonic <b>solder</b> pot works via cavitation of the molten solder which mechanically disrupts oxide layers on the solder layers themselves and on metal surfaces being joined.|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic {{soldering}} uses either ultrasonically coupled heated <b>solder</b> iron <b>tips</b> (0.5 - 10 mm) or ultrasonically coupled solder baths {{as mentioned}} above. In these devices, piezoelectric crystals {{are used to}} generate high frequency (20 - 60 kHz) acoustic waves in molten solder layers or batch, to mechanically disrupt oxides that form on the molten <b>solder</b> surfaces. The <b>tips</b> for U/S <b>soldering</b> irons are also coupled to a heating element while the piezoelectric crystal is thermally isolated, not to degrade the piezoelectric element. Ultrasonic <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tips</b> can heat (up to 450 Â°C) while mechanically oscillating at 20 - 60 kHz. This <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> can melt <b>solder</b> filler metals as acoustic vibrations are induced in the molten solder pool. The vibration and cavitation in the molten solder then permits solders to wet and adhere to many metal surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Instrument reads tip {{temperature}} and contact potential in seconds. Tinned <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> touched to temperature sensitive button for 4 seconds and to voltage probe for 1 to 3 seconds. Tip {{temperature and}} voltage appear on digital displays. Instrument quickly gives assurance conditions are correct for reliable soldering...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Schlieren-Soldering-Iron-Heat. Note {{that the}} <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tip</b> {{itself is not}} glowing {{because it is not}} Infrared {{photograph}}y. Had the photograph been a composite of Schlieren and infrared, the <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tip</b> would show as a source of illumination and the atmospheric disturbance caused by the heating would show as well. The infrared point of origin or target would be unambiguous.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> is regulated manually by holding the button until the solder melts, and then releasing it. When the solder is about to start solidifying, the button is pressed again, and so on. An experienced worker develops the skill to regulate the temperature according to need. Because the {{temperature of}} the tip is not automatically regulated, use of a soldering gun for joints on printed circuit boards can result in too much heat supplied to the joint, damaging the circuit board.|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} {{where the}} area of the solder joint is a small or band, U/S soldering using 1 - 10 mm tips can be very effective since the volume of molten metal is small and can effectively be agitated by the 1 - 10 mm U/S <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tips.</b> The figures in this article show the U/S soldering equipment (power supply and soldering tools-tips) and the application of solder to glass using U/S <b>solder</b> iron <b>tips.</b> In other larger surface bonding application, as shown in the image below, wide, heated U/S tips are being used to spread and wet active solders on large aluminum surfaces (and is applicable to other metal, ceramic and glass surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Excess solder and unconsumed flux and residue is {{sometimes}} wiped from the <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tip</b> between joints. The {{tip of the}} bit (commonly iron plated to reduce erosion) is kept wetted with solder ("tinned") when hot to assist soldering, and to minimize oxidation and corrosion of the tip itself.|$|R
40|$|It is {{an object}} of the present {{invention}} to make soldering instruments safer and easier to use. According to {{one aspect of the}} present invention, a non-heatsinking, protective shield is provided around the <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> of the <b>solder</b> iron. This heat shield covers the iron`s hot <b>tip</b> throughout the <b>soldering</b> process {{with the exception of the}} time needed to perform an actual solder connection using the tip. The shield protects the user or nearby personnel from harm when the soldering iron is at elevated temperatures (500 {degrees}F to 800 {degrees}F). Moreover, the shield is capable of preventing fires which might result if the iron`s tip inadvertently comes into contact with an object that can be easily ignited, e. g. paper. In addition, an air vacuum system is incorporated into the shield to remove the solder smoke...|$|R
50|$|For {{through-hole}} mounted devices on double-sided or multi-layer boards, {{special care}} must be taken not to remove the via connecting the layers, as this will ruin the entire board. Hard pulling on a lead which is not entirely free of solder (or with solder not thoroughly molten {{in the case of a}} <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tip</b> heating all pins) may pull out a via.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{automatic}} soldering technology using {{industrial robots}} has been spreaded {{in the production}} line. As the main problem is this automation technique low production speed and low flexibility can be counted. Though development of new method in robotic soldering the production speed can be essentially improved rather than through optimization of soldering process and robot path. This paper introduces new soldering process suitable to robotics soldering and verifies the results through experiments. Optimized vibration process is added during wire feeding. By this method quality as well as soldering speed could be improved. Automatic soldering tool for robots imitated the motion of manual workers. But hte flexiblity of tool construction is very limited as against human hands. This poor flexibility of soldering tool cannot cover the wide application. Here a flexible soldering tool is introduced. In approaching of <b>soldering</b> <b>tip</b> to pin/pad will be searched correct positions of pin using optical fiber sensor in a cartesian direction. During press process 2 press-down force components will be feedbached to optimal value because the press-down force is a important parameter of soldering process...|$|R
5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A <b>soldering</b> <b>tip,</b> made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a pilot lamp which also lights the workpiece.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soldering</b> iron <b>tips</b> {{are made}} of copper core plated with iron. The copper is used for heat {{transfer}} and the iron plating is used for durability. Copper is very easily corroded, eating away the tip, particularly in lead-free work; iron is not. Cleaning tips requires the removal of oxide without damaging the iron plating and exposing the copper to rapid corrosion. The use of solder already containing {{a small amount of}} copper can slow corrosion of copper tips.|$|R
40|$|Security systems {{employ the}} RFID method to protect objects and data {{and to ensure}} public safety {{and the safety of}} {{commercial}} activity, e. g. through the control over technological processes. The research activity aimed at improving the level of safety of electronic and technical protection needs to be verified through the manufacture of prototype IDs with RFID inlays. The authors presents an original experimental device enabling the implementation of individual chips in RFID inlays, which were made on a flexible base to which an RFID antenna is attached. The collection of the chip from the dispenser and an unambiguous orientation of the <b>soldered</b> <b>tips</b> in relation to the antenna are provided by a four-axis vacuum manipulator cooperating with a vision system identifying the location of the chip on the manipulator and its final application area. A computer control system enables the operation in two modes, i. e. a semi-automatic mode in which it is possible to manually control the order {{and the way in which}} individual tasks are performed, and an automatic mode conducted according to the designed algorithm. The developed device is intended for research on the ways to improve the manufacturing techniques and electronic document protection by means of RFID technologies...|$|R
50|$|For {{attachment}} {{of electronic}} components to a PCB, proper selection {{and use of}} flux helps prevent oxidation during soldering; {{it is essential for}} good wetting and heat transfer. The <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tip</b> must be clean and pre-tinned with solder to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating. After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off, leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal mounting clips or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and reduce joint stresses.|$|R
50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with silver <b>soldered</b> carbide <b>tips.</b> It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces donât get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called cold saws. Other names include cold cut saws, cold circular saws, cold cut off saws or circular cold saws.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{soldering}} techniques used to attach components to a PCB. High volume production is usually done with a [...] "Pick and place machine" [...] or SMT placement machine and bulk wave soldering or reflow ovens, but skilled technicians are able to solder very tiny parts (for instance 0201 packages which are 0.02 in. by 0.01 in.) by hand under a microscope, using tweezers and a fine <b>tip</b> <b>soldering</b> iron for small volume prototypes. Some parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as BGA packages.|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{electrically}} heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside {{the tip of}} the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change <b>tips.</b> <b>Soldering</b> irons designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work.Oleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve solderability.|$|R

40|$|An {{application}} and an implementation of an adaptive identification and of Takahashi PSD controller {{are described in}} this article. The application is based on 8 -bit HCS 08 microcontroller (DZ family) from Freescale semiconductor. This family is intended for automotive application, and also for general purposes. Except the microcontroller, a power part and analog part of circuit was used for measure and converting a thermocouple temperature; it is directly measured inside the heater. This system is designed for fast temperature control of <b>soldering</b> precise <b>tips.</b> The controlled system is identified during heating process by the recursive least square method {{at the beginning of}} control process and on demand of user (when the tip is replaced by other type). The hardware was designed to save space and to minimize power loses on switching transistor. It leads to have the transistor without heatsink. The transistor was selected from PowerTrench family with an extremely low rDS(ON) resistance. Â© 2016, North Atlantic University Union. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The tip of this {{apparatus}} {{is split}} into two sections that completes an electrical circuit when a low electrical resistance is placed across the tip; e.g. metallic contacts, or solder. With a current flowing, the resistance of both the <b>solder</b> and the <b>tip</b> produces enough heat to increase the temperature beyond the melting point of solder. For the light-duty work it was designed for, the Athalite tip heats just enough and can cool very rapidly; however, if applied to something with large thermal capacity such as a metal chassis, the tip can become extremely hot and can take over a minute to cool in an extreme case.|$|R
50|$|Older {{and very}} cheap irons {{typically}} use a bare copper tip, which is shaped with a file or sandpaper. This dissolves gradually into the solder, suffering pitting and {{erosion of the}} shape. Copper tips are sometimes filed when worn down. Iron-plated copper tips have become increasingly popular since the 1980s. Because iron is not readily dissolved by molten <b>solder,</b> the plated <b>tip</b> is more durable than a bare copper one, though it will eventually wear out and need replacing. This is especially important when working at the higher temperatures needed for modern lead-free solders. Solid iron and steel tips are seldom used because they store less heat, and rusting can break the heating element.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} {{recognition}} method of bridge soldering base metal on the circuits by comparing CAD figure and input image of image processing {{to locate the}} <b>soldering</b> iron <b>tip</b> accurately to secure the high quality Firstly, three dimensional CAD assembly drawing of circuits which are assembled perpendicularly in each other is projected on an imaginary two dimensional screen which is vertical to the optical axis of the camera The projected image is used as the standard CAD figure to inspect {{the location of the}} bridge soldering base metal. The positions among the bridge soldering base metals show the line state. So this line (connecting line) is used as the reference line to inspect the location of the bridge soldering base metal. The characteristics of the standard figure are represented by the connecting line, edge line and center points of base metal. Secondly, the position and gradient of connecting line among bridge soldering base metals in the input image is estimated. And the position of base metal and assembly accuracy of circuit units are calculated by comparing the shape and position of each base metal with its standard figure based on the connecting line Furthermore, the length between the opposite edges of the base metals are calculated to inspect the positions and the assemble accuracy of circuit units...|$|R
50|$|Most {{soldering}} irons for electronics have interchangeable tips, {{also known}} as bits, that vary in size and shape for different types of work. Pyramid tips with a triangular flat face and chisel tips with a wide flat face are useful for soldering sheet metal. Fine conical or tapered chisel tips are typically used for electronics work. Tips may be straight or have a bend. Concave or wicking tips with a chisel face with a concave well in the flat face to hold {{a small amount of}} <b>solder</b> are available. <b>Tip</b> selection depends upon the type of work and access to the joint; soldering of 0.5mm pitch surface-mount ICs, for example, is quite different from soldering a through-hole connection to a large area. A concave tip well is said to help prevent bridging of closely spaced leads; different shapes are recommended to correct bridging that has occurred. Due to patent restrictions not all manufacturers offer concave tips everywhere; in particular there are restrictions in the USA.|$|R
40|$|New optical {{designs and}} {{miniaturized}} optical components, {{as well as}} material-fit joining techniques allow for the downsizing of biomedical devices such as endoscopic systems. Laser-based Solderjet Bumping allows for hermetical sealing by means of localized solder joints. These material-fit, metal-based joints provide a longterm stable alternative to polymeric adhesives and permit for processing in steam autoclaves. The selection {{from a wide variety}} of solder alloys ranging from the low-melting BiSn alloy over lead-free tin-based solders to the biocompatible high-melting eutectic AuSn solder alloy, as well as the parametrization of the process allow for precise adjustment to different wetting behavior and complex shaped joining geometries. Miniaturized endoscope tips are demonstrated with windows made of saphire (diameter 1. 2 mm) <b>soldered</b> to endoscope <b>tips</b> made of stainless steel by subsequent placement of eutectic AuSn solder spheres (diameter 100 ?m) using the Solderjet Bumping technique. Measurement of leakage rate with helium showed results better than 10 - 8 mbar*l/s to 4 * 10 - 9 mbar*l/s. Pressure test (5 bar, nitrogen) and four sterilization cycles in an autoclave (134 Â°C, 2. 1 bar, steam) showed no detectable change during optical inspection and measurement of leakage rate...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} conceded that radiant heat is less effective than diathermy for heating joints. We {{have made some}} observations on {{this point in the}} knee joint in the course of other studies and present here our methods and results which may be of value to those who are interested in measuring joint temperatures and assessing the effectiveness of treatment. Methods The left leg of one subject was used for each test. The subject was seated with the leg hanging vertically. Skin temperature was recorded with two wire thermocouples made of 30 s. w. g. constantan and 47 s. w. g. copper (Whyte, 1951) held in place by the springiness of the wire leads, which were fixed more remotely to skin with adhesive plaster. This type of thermocouple records skin temperature with less than 0. 5 C. error even in the presence of radiant heat. The intra-articular temperature was recorded with a needle thermocouple passed through an area anaesthetized {{with a small amount of}} 2 per cent. novocaine on the antero-medial side of the joint.

40|$|ESDA (Electrostatic Discharge Association) ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000 {{requires}} frequent {{testing of}} the voltage leakage from the <b>tip</b> of a <b>soldering</b> iron and the resistance from the <b>tip</b> of the <b>soldering</b> iron to the common point ground. Without this test apparatus, the process is time-consuming and requires several wires, alligator clips, or test probes, as well as additional equipment. <b>Soldering</b> iron <b>tips</b> must be tested for electrostatic discharge risks frequently, and this typically {{takes a lot of}} time in setup and testing. This device enables the operator to execute the full test in one minute or less. This innovation is a simple apparatus that plugs into a digital multimeter (DMM) and the Common Point Ground (CPG) reference. It enables the user to perform two of the electrostatic discharge tests required in ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000. The device consists of a small black box with two prongs sticking out of one end, two inputs on the opposite end (one of the inputs is used to connect the reference CPG to the DMM), and a metal tab on one side. Inside the box are wires, several washers of various materials, and assembly hardware (nuts and screws/bolts). The device is a passive electronic component that is plugged into a DMM. The operator sets the DMM to read voltage. The operator places the heated <b>tip</b> of the <b>soldering</b> iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The voltage is read and recorded. The operator switches the DMM to read resistance. The operator places the heated <b>tip</b> of the <b>soldering</b> iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The resistance is recorded. If the recorded voltage and resistance are below a number stated in ESDA ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000, the test is considered to pass. The device includes all the necessary wiring internal to its body so the operator does not need to do any independent wiring, except for grounding. It uses a stack of high-thermal-resistance washers to minimize the heat transfer from the soldering iron to the wiring used to measure the resistance and voltages. This minimizes thermal error. The device allows very rapid execution of a test that is performed frequently...|$|R
40|$|I {{worked on}} several {{projects}} this term. While most projects involved additive manufacturing, I was also involved with two design projects, two testing projects, and a fabrication project. The primary mentor for these was Richard Hagen. Secondary mentors were Hai Nguyen, Khadijah Shariff, and fabrication training from James Brown. Overall, my experience at JSC {{has been successful}} and what I have learned will continue to help me in my engineering education and profession long after I leave. My 3 D printing projects ranged from less than a 1 cubic centimeter to about 1 cubic foot and involved several printers using different printing technologies. It was exciting {{to become familiar with}} printing technologies such as industrial grade FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), the relatively new SLA (Stereolithography), and PolyJet. My primary duty with the FDM printers was to model parts that came in from various sources to print effectively and efficiently. Using methods my mentor taught me and the Stratasys Insight software, I was able to minimize imperfections, hasten build time, improve strength for specific forces (tensile, shear, etc [...] .), and reduce likelihood of a print-failure. Also using FDM, I learned how to repair a part after it was printed. This is done by using a special kind of glue that chemically melts the two faces of plastic parts together to form a fused interface. My first goal with SLA technology was to bring the printer back to operational readiness. In becoming familiar with the Pegasus SLA printer, I researched the leveling, laser settings, and different vats to hold liquid material. With this research, I was successfully able to bring the Pegasus back online and have successfully printed multiple sample parts as well as functional parts. My experience with PolyJet technology has been focused on an understanding of the abilities/limits, costs, and the maintenance for daily use. Still upcoming will be experience with using a composite printer that uses FDM technology to print plastic while laying an internal filament of Kevlar or carbon-fiber inside the printed material. It has been incredible being exposed to this range of technologies and I feel very fortunate to be ready for virtually any kind of printing technology I come across in the future. Design work played a part in my internship this term as well. Working with Hai Nguyen, I was able to design a set of testing tips and a test frame for use with an Arcjet. The testing tips will be made of several different materials that will possibly be used in the heat shield of the Orion space craft. These designs included technical drawings that were presented to the fabrication shop. The frame design was created from 80 / 20 (a popular brand of frame construction equipment) and included an order form with pricing for fabrication. An independent design was also done for the virtual reality lab. This design was to create a hand-controller based on a previous design. This final design was sent directly to a 3 D printer without technical drawings. Overall, my design work has given me experience with using 80 / 20, helped improve my CAD (Computer Aided Design) proficiency, and increased my knowledge of how to set up technical drawings for fabrication. The final role I have played in this internship has been to assist with testing of the inflatable technology materials working Khadijah Shariff. I began the internship assisting with permeability testing with the initial plan to continue the testing independently after training. Unfortunately, the testing apparatus suffered a technical failure and had funding pulled which cancelled that portion of the project. Further testing with inflatable technology continued with tensile testing of various stitching methods. This testing took place over a two-days and concluded successfully. Final testing was to be more tensile testing but of straps used to connect various inflatable sections. Unfortunately, the needed grips for the tensile tests could not be located and put the testing on hold. It is possible this round of testing will still take place {{by the end of the}} internship if the grips can be found. Overall, this portion of the internship has helped me become familiar with one kind of permeability test as well as a popular tensile/compression testing machine. Finally, I also had the chance to be trained using a metal lathe for making very small <b>tips</b> for a <b>soldering</b> iron. These <b>tips</b> will be used to melt threaded brass inserts into 3 D printed plastic. Working with James Brown, I was able to successfully machine a brass rod down to as little as 0. 064 inches plus or minus 0. 001 inches. It was very rewarding to learn how to best use the machine and become familiar with a skill that will undoubtedly be used again in the future. I have been told by several professional engineers that learning to use a lathe and mill will be invaluable skills in the field. This knocks 50 percent of that goal off and I look forward to learning the mill at some point in the future. As is apparent with this list of projects, my internship was not focused on a single over-arching goal. Instead, I was able to gain experience in a myriad of very different areas. I feel like my time here was spent bouncing from one project to the next. Though sometimes difficult to switch gears, it was very rewarding to be a part of so much in so little time. My career and education will be positively impacted by what I have learned at JSC. My experience with 3 D printing has improved my ability to handle many issues that may come up in the future with multiple different technologies. The design work I took part in, especially creating technical drawings, will help me better present designs to any engineer or shop I will encounter. My testing experience has helped me become familiar with a popular kind of tensile test machine that will likely be similar to the kinds I will encounter in the future. Finally, my experience with fabrication has given me a rare opportunity, as an engineer, to take part in the fabrication of a part. This experience will help me better tailor my future designs for the manufacturing process and has given me an appreciation for detailed/delicate machining work. My experience at JSC has been successful and will continue to assist me for a long time within the engineering field...|$|R
