40|$|Abstract. Gas Spring is an {{important}} component of an energy storing prosthetic knee. The spring stored energy during flexion and released the energy while in the extension. In this research, we discuss a Monte Carlo simulation model of a gas spring in an Energy Storing Prosthetic Knee (ESPK) using Oracle Crystal Ball software. The simulation is used to predict the effects of three important design variables of a gas spring which are cylinder diameter, cylinder length, and displacement to the energy storing performance of the spring. The results of simulation show that there are two design variables which have significant contribution to the variations of energy storing performance: cylinder diameter and displacement. Those design variables account for 99. 3 % to the total variance of energy <b>storing.</b> <b>Quality</b> improvement must be conducted to lowering the resulted energy storing variance. We proportionally decrease the variance of the design variables to lowering the energy storing variance. The simulation results show a significant quality improvement of about 50 % in term of energy storing standard deviation. The results also show that cylinder diameter is more sensitive than the other two design variables in energy <b>storing</b> <b>quality</b> improvement...|$|E

Export is possible with the high quality production, harvest {{at the right time}} and properly <b>storing.</b> <b>Quality</b> cherries to market {{is one of the most}} important step that determination of the optimal harvest date and harvesting on these dates. Fruits are encountered with the loss of quality and products if they are not harvested an exact date. This study was conducted to evaluate physical measurements of fruit quality as a maturity index for estimating optimum harvest date (OHD) of Lapins cherries. For this purpose, the days after full blossom (DAFB) was determined as 19. 04. 2012. Cherry fruits, began after 22 DAFB, were harvested at certain periods. Fruit samples were picked from 22 to 85 DAFB. Skin color, fruit width and length, fruit weight, fruit firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), respiration rate, maturity index (TSS/TA ratio) were analyzed in picked fruits. As a result of the analysis, as DAFB was increased, fruit weight, fruit width and length were increased. Fruit growth was slowed down in the days after OHD. With the start of the changes in fruit color L*, b * and h ° color value were rapidly decreased, while a * value was increased. This color changes was slowed down in the days after OHD. Respiration rate in small fruit stage was very high, while respiration rate was slow gradually during growth. OHD of Lapins cherry variety was determined as 64 DAFB...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Our {{minds are}} not a blank canvas onto which {{experiences}} leave their independent and indelible impression. Consumers, therefore, would rarely enter a service encounter without prior knowledge to guide their expectations. The importance of prior knowledge – {{in the form of}} schemas – while acknowledged in the study of post-event misinformation effects on memory has received limited attention. Outside of studies investigating misinformation effects, the literature indicates that inconsistency between our expectations and what we experience, improves recall accuracy. Whether this effect translates into reduced susceptibility to misinformation effects and that schema consistency increases susceptibility, is unclear. The main contribution of this thesis is the demonstration that consistency between schema and the experience, and its interaction with encoding goals, changes a person’s susceptibility to misinformation and their subsequent <b>store</b> <b>quality</b> perceptions. The effects of encoding goals – whether someone is trying to form an impression or remember the details of their experience – while used in previous misinformation studies, has not been previously investigated. To investigate the effects of schema consistency and encoding goals on misinformation acceptance, and the subsequent impact of misinformation acceptance on <b>store</b> <b>quality</b> perceptions, a three-way between participant design was undertaken using a café service encounter as the context. The three factors – independent variables – and their levels included in the study were schema consistency (consistent/ inconsistent), encoding goal (impression/ recall) and post-event information (misinformation/ neutral). Results from the study showed that misinformation effects are most likely when people are paying less attention to the service environment. The explanation provided in the study is that when there is a match between what people expect and what they experience they pay less attention to the details of the experience, which results in less diagnostic information encoded into memory. If, however, they were paying attention due to an inconsistency, the information would be attended and result in reduced misinformation acceptance. Where a person was instructed to try and remember the details of their experience rather than form an impression, they paid greater attention to detail than those who were forming an impression. When their expectations were not met in an experience, subsequent exposure to misinformation causes these people to accurately recall their original experience and escape the effect of misinformation. Significant results were also observed for changes to <b>store</b> <b>quality</b> perceptions, revealing that consumers who accept the misinformation have <b>store</b> <b>quality</b> perceptions that reflect its inclusion. Also observed was an interaction with the initial expectations that meant merchandise quality perceptions improved when a person’s memory for the experience was consistent with their original expectations, and lower when inconsistent...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the sensitivity of food access models to a dataset’s spatial distribution and the empirical definition of food access, which contributes to understanding the mixed findings of previous studies. Data was collected in the Dan River Region in the United States using a telephone survey for individual-level variables (n = 784) and a store audit for the location of food retailers and grocery <b>store</b> <b>quality.</b> Spatial scanning statistics assessed the spatial distribution of obesity and detected a cluster of grocery stores overlapping with a cluster of obesity centered on a grocery store suggesting that living closer to a grocery store increased the likelihood of obesity. Logistic regression further examined this relationship while controlling for demographic and other food environment variables. Similar to the cluster analysis results, increased distance to a grocery store significantly decreased the likelihood of obesity in the urban subsample (average marginal effects, AME = − 0. 09, p-value = 0. 02). However, controlling for grocery <b>store</b> <b>quality</b> nullified these results (AME = − 0. 12, p-value = 0. 354).
