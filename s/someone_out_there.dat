500|$|Awaking {{from his}} nap, Brian decides {{to drink a}} bottle of scotch that he had stored in his safety deposit box. He offers Stewie a sip, and they both become so drunk that Brian agrees to pierce Stewie's ear with a pin from his sweater, leaving Stewie with a bloody ear {{for the rest of}} the episode. Stewie and Brian discuss The Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan, and Brian {{explains}} that he is inspired by the philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points out if there was <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 1966 {{review of}} Revolver, KRLA Beat {{said that the}} title of Rubber Soul had [...] "become a {{standard}} phrase used to describe a creation of exceptional excellence {{in the field of}} music", such that several highly regarded releases had since earned the description [...] "a Rubber Soul in its field'". Writing in Esquire in 1967, Robert Christgau called it [...] "an album that for innovation, tightness, and lyrical intelligence was about twice as good as anything they or anyone else (except maybe the Stones) had done previously". He later wrote: [...] "Rubber Soul smashed a lot of alienation. Without reneging on the group's masscult appeal, it reached into private lives and made hundreds of thousands of secretly lonely people feel as if <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> shared their brightest insights and most depressing discoveries … Psychedelia starts here." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Microsoft {{says that}} product {{activation}} benefits consumers by allowing Microsoft to produce higher quality software, it has nevertheless received much criticism regarding its design and implementation, effectiveness at stopping piracy and respect of privacy rights. For instance, {{during the development}} of Windows XP, beta testers strongly criticized the introduction of product activation, particularly because a change in computer hardware required re-activation. Ken Fischer at Ars Technica questioned whether activation would ultimately be effective in stopping piracy, stating that while casual computer users would be affected, he would [...] "be a fool to think that <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> won't {{find a way to}} break this whole thing." [...] Dave Wilson, a technology columnist at the Los Angeles Times, describes activation as [...] "just another example of a rapacious monopolist abusing computer users who are helpless to do anything about it." [...] He too believed that the system would not have [...] "any significant effect on professional pirates." [...] Fred Langa at InformationWeek, with reference to the transmission of hardware information during activation, stated that [...] "many users are incensed at this level of monitoring, intrusion, and control by Microsoft." [...] Finally, Dr. Cyrus Peikari and Seth Fogie, security consultants, considered product activation to be [...] "hostile both to privacy and to human dignity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pantridge's {{article also}} {{energized}} Leonard Cobb in Seattle. He knew the Seattle Fire Department was already involved in first aid and therefore approached the Fire Chief, Gordon Vickery, {{to propose a}} new training program to treat cardiac arrest. The fire department already {{had one of the}} United States' first computerized systems for documenting first aid runs. Cobb realized that this system could provide scientific documentation for the efficacy (or lack thereof) of Pantridge's suggestions and suggested to Vickery that they pool their knowledge and resources. Cobb and his colleagues then provided instruction and training in cardiac emergencies including cardiac arrest to volunteer fire fighters. The program became operational in March 1970, nine months after Nagel's first save in Miami. The mobile unit was stationed outside the Harborview Hospital emergency department. As Cobb himself points out, the mobile unit was not the real innovation. Rather, it was the concept of a tiered response to medical emergencies. The idea was [...] "that we would get <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> quickly"—via the fire department's already existing mobile first aid units—"and then a secondary response would come from the mobile intensive coronary care unit." [...] The beauty of the tiered response system was the efficient use of fire department personnel, which allowed aid personnel to reach the scene quickly (on an average of three minutes) to start CPR. Then a few minutes later the paramedics arrived to provide more definitive care such as defibrillation. In this way the brain could be kept alive until the electric shock converted the heart to a normal rhythm. After stabilization the paramedics would transport the patient to the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1998, a {{young woman}} {{standing}} at a Los Angeles bus stop was taken at knife point to a deserted parking lot and raped by an unknown assailant. A bagel shop manager, Luis Vargas, {{was arrested and charged}} with this crime and with assaults on two other young women. Despite the fact that coworkers at the bagel shop placed him there at the time of the rape (which occurred 20 miles away), based upon ambiguous and contradictory identifications made by the three women, and upon a prior conviction for raping a former girlfriend, Vargas was convicted of the crimes. Vargas stated at the time of his sentencing to 55 years to life in prison on December 7, 1999, [...] "As far as I’m concerned, [...] individual [...] really did these crimes might really be raping <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> might really be killing someone out there." [...] Vargas' prophecy proved correct, as rapes and other assaults on women with a similar modus operandi continued to take place, not only after Vargas was sentenced, but even during the time between his arrest and conviction. The CIP became interested in Vargas' case in 2011, when Vargas sent the organization press clippings about recent assaults similar to those of 1998, which were attributed to a serial attacker known as the [...] "Teardrop Rapist." [...] The CIP requested that the clothes of the 1998 rape victim be examined for DNA, using technology not available at the time. The DNA samples did not match Vargas' DNA... but did match DNA taken from recent victims whose attacker matched the profile of the Teardrop Rapist. In September 2015, Vargas was exonerated of the crimes for which he had served nearly 16 years in prison. It was the CIP's third DNA exoneration and its 20th overall. Vargas is currently engaged in a civil suit against the Los Angeles Police Department, prosecutors and others, claiming that exonerating evidence was withheld at his original trial. Vargas' case was noted in an article citing the record number of exonerations that occurred in 2015.|$|E

40|$|BLAST {{is arguably}} the single most {{important}} piece of software ever written for the biological sciences. It is the core of most bioinformatics workflows, being a critical component of genome homology searches and annotation. It has influenced the landscape of biology by aiding in everything from functional characterization of genes to pathogen detection to the development of novel vaccines. While BLAST is very popular, it is also often one of the most computationally intensive parts of bioinformatics analysis. In our workflows, BLAST typically takes the majority of cpu time, and we need to parallelize to finish in a reasonable time frame. Waiting for BLAST to finish without having any clue of how long it&#x 2019;s going to take is kind of depressing, and you could waste a day of work trying to run a job that would never finish. If you feel the same way we do, then check out Cunningham, a tool we designed to estimate BLAST runtimes for shotgun sequence datasets using sequence composition statistics. We&#x 2019;ve trained its models on real metagenomic sequence data using the Amazon EC 2 cloud, and it will provide a relatively quick estimate for datasets with up to tens of millions of sequences. It&#x 2019;s not perfect, but it&#x 2019;ll give you at least some idea of expected runtime, how large a cluster you&#x 2019;re going to need, how much you&#x 2019;ll need to partition your data, etc. We use it all the time now, so we hope it&#x 2019;ll be useful to <b>someone</b> else <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Cunningham has been implemented in CloVR for efficient autoscaling in the cloud and is freely available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|There is {{very little}} written about how palaeontology is {{perceived}} by the public. Perhaps {{the reason is that}} very few professional palaeontologists have concerned themselves with public opinion, so engrossed they are with their own speciality and not realising that <b>someone</b> else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> may be interested in their findings. Dinosaur palaeontologists are, perhaps, the exception due to the public popularity of these great beasts. Dinosaurs have captured the public's imagination since they were first discovered in the 1800 s. They {{have been the subject of}} numerous films and documentaries but have often erroneously been linked with archaeology. It is not something that palaeontologists worry about too much beyond the amusement of having a member of the public attempt to discuss the Roman fort, or Celtic cross in the vicinity, whilst the palaeontologist looks for fossils hundreds of millions of years old. It may be of more annoyance to archaeologists when they are asked if they have unearthed any dinosaurs lately. Certainly, that seems to be the case as there have been several articles published on the public perception of archaeology, and they all seem to be upset at the number of times they are asked about dinosaurs. I think that the confusion may arise from the fact that archaeologists often dig things up and that palaeontologists do pretty much the same thing. The difference is that archaeologists ignore the fossils, and palaeontologists ignore the artefacts. Well, not quite - archaeologists will inform palaeontologists of any fossils found during an excavation and similarly, palaeontologists will inform archaeologists of any artefacts they find during an excavation...|$|R
