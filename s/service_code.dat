25|$|During the Battle of Galveston, Harriet Lane sank the Rebel tugboat Neptune, leaving {{one-half}} of the two-vessel Confederate fleet lying {{on the bottom of}} the harbor. However, the Confederate gunboat Bayou City circled and made a second run on Harriet Lane. At daybreak, Harriet Lane was listing steeply, and a boat was dispatched from her side to the remaining Union ships to negotiate a surrender. During the negotiations, Harriet Lane was further damaged by fire from the Union Owasco under a flag of truce in an attempt to explode her magazine. The flagship Westfield was later exploded, and the remaining Union ships fled to New Orleans, leaving Harriet Lane, along with a copy of the United States signal <b>service</b> <b>code</b> book in her cabin, in Confederate hands.|$|E
25|$|At the {{instance}} of King Philip II of Portugal, on 9 January 1606 Pope Paul V separated the Kingdom of Tanjore and the territories {{to the north}} of the Cauvery River and bordering the Bay of Bengal, from the Diocese of Cochin and constituted them a distinct diocese with Saint Thomas of Mylapur as the episcopal city and the parish church of Saint Thomas as the cathedral. At the same time the pope appointed Dom Sebastião de São Pedro, Augustinians (O.(E.)S.A.), who had been presented by the King of Portugal, to be the first bishop of Saint Thomas of Mylapur, and granted Philip and his heirs and successors in perpetuity the right of patronage ("Padroado") and presentation to the see, and the benefices that might be created therein, by the mere facts of their creation and dotation. This right and obligation the Crown of Portugal has exercised and discharged to the end, by making the bishops a princely allowance, paying a certain number of priests' salaries, with periodical increases, leave with free passages and pensions, on the lines of the Portuguese Civil <b>Service</b> <b>Code,</b> and contributing to the support of a still larger number of priests on a graduated scale.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Hitler's {{administration}} was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had [...] "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" [...] by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: [...] "On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil <b>Service</b> <b>Code</b> of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from {{you the right to}} teach at the University of Göttingen." [...] Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked. Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that [...] "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was {{in the midst of all}} the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace." [...] Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebels.|$|E

2500|$|While some {{courts have}} chosen to be more deferential to the employer's {{substantive}} reasons for dismissal, they emphasise more strongly the importance of employers having a fair process. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration <b>Service</b> <b>Code</b> of Practice (2009) explains that good industry practice for disciplinaries requires, among other things, written warnings, a fair hearing {{by people who have}} no reason to side against the employee, or with any manager involved in the dispute, and the opportunity for union representation. Often a company handbook will include its own system, which if not followed will likely mean the dismissal was unfair. Nevertheless, in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd the House of Lords held that, in a case where a van driver was told he was redundant on the spot, if an employer can show the dismissal would be made regardless of whether a procedure was followed, damages can be reduced to zero. In the Employment Act 2002, Parliament made an abortive attempt to instil some kind of mandatory minimum procedure for everybody, but after complaints from employers and unions alike that it was merely encouraging a [...] "tick-box" [...] culture, it was repealed in the Employment Act 2008. Now if the ACAS Code is not followed, and this is unreasonable, an unfair dismissal award can be increased by 25 per cent. Generally, under ERA 1996 sections 119 and 227, the principle for a [...] "basic" [...] unfair dismissal award is that, with a cap of £350 per week and a maximum of 20 weeks, an employee should receive one week's pay for each year employed if aged between 22 and 40, 1½ weeks if over 40 and ½ a week if under 22. By ERA 1996 section 123, the employee may also be entitled to the more significant, but discretionary [...] "compensatory" [...] award. This should take into account the actual losses of the employee as just and equitable, based on loss of immediate and future wages, the manner of the dismissal and loss of future unfair dismissal protection and redundancy rights. This is capped, but usually increased in line with RPI inflation. It was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award of a successful claimant was merely £4,560. Very few claimants are successful in securing reinstatement, although if they are suspended from their workplace and colleagues, the evidence suggests that the experience of litigation sours the relationship so that the employee will no longer wish to return. It is therefore important that in 2011 the Supreme Court emphasised in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital that in principle an employee may secure an injunction to continue working while internal disciplinary procedures are followed. Particularly given the difficulty of finding alternative employment while removed from work, it is not clear why a staff member who retains the support of his or her colleagues (as opposed to a manager who potentially has a conflict of interest) should not also be able to continue working until a dismissal is confirmed by a court.|$|E
