40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{motivation}} {{for the use of}} <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> in the supply chains of multinational companies (MNCs) sourcing clothing products from a developing nation. We investigate the practice of <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> in the supply chains of MNCs based upon a range of interviews with key operatives within the garment industry in Bangladesh. Our results show that <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> are typically not advancing workersâ€™ rights but where there are advances, they occur because of the financial penalties that would otherwise be imposed on suppliers (through loss of contracts). Consistent with the notion of institutional decoupling, our results suggest that MNCs appear to use <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> as an instrument to maintain and re-establish their legitimacy rather than ensuring accountability to workers (who are the most affected stakeholders). This is the first known study that investigates how <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> are undertaken by MNCs sourcing products from a developing nation; the implications this has for supply chain claims; what motivations drive the adoption of such audits and what, if anything, are the likely outcomes from the process...|$|R

Due to ineffective mechanisms for limiting corruption, the 2001-2 NFFWP in AP was a failure. It was recommended that the checks and controls must be built into the design of such programmes.

40|$|The global {{food supply}} chain is known for facing {{problems}} related to workersâ€Ÿ conditions at the stage of processing and production. A shift of governance towards the private sector has {{at the same time}} taken place among industries. This is seen among food retailers who implement Codes of Conduct in international operations in order to improve social conditions at the level of suppliers. However, the complexity of global {{food supply chain}}s results in restraints in achieving compliance to Codes of Conduct. The purpose of this thesis is to gain a deeper understanding of food retailerâ€Ÿs monitoring processes and how they work towards ensuring compliance with their Codes of Conduct and working conditions throughout the supply chains, through the application of <b>social</b> <b>auditing.</b> Companies selected for this study included one Norwegian and three Swedish food retailers. A qualitative approach was applied and a multiple case study took place. Findings indicate that the extensiveness of monitoring activities in the supply chain varies between actors when it comes to assessing working conditions in their global food supply chains through <b>social</b> <b>audits.</b> Auditing activities focused on own branded products and where audits were often conducted {{at the level of the}} subcontractor. Some variations still exist and one food retailer conducts <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> at the level of production. The extensiveness of monitoring activities is as a result of the resources available and the perception of how far down or up the supply chain that the responsibility should be levied. <b>Social</b> <b>audits</b> are conducted by retailers themselves, by suppliers or outsourced to an external auditing consultancy firm. Furthermore, the food retailers conduct a typical <b>social</b> compliance <b>audit.</b> Violations against Codes of Conduct result in the food retailers carrying out follow up activities through the creation of a correction action plan and beginning discussions with the supplier. Ending the business relationship is another follow up activity that is applied when severe infringements have taken place or no improvements at the level of supplier have been achieved.
