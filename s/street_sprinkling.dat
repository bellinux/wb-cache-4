60|$|I {{have not}} been to church so often {{in a long time}} as I have in the last few weeks. The people in these old lands seem to make churches their specialty. Especially does this seem to be the case with the {{citizens}} of Genoa. I think there is a church every three or four hundred yards all over town. The <b>streets</b> are <b>sprinkled</b> from end to end with shovel-hatted, long-robed, well-fed priests, and the church bells by dozens are pealing all the day long, nearly. Every now and then one comes across a friar of orders gray, with shaven head, long, coarse robe, rope girdle and beads, and with feet cased in sandals or entirely bare. These worthies suffer in the flesh and do penance all their lives, I suppose, but they look like consummate famine-breeders. They are all fat and serene.|$|R

60|$|It was in Nello's {{shop that}} Piero di Cosimo was speaking, on the twenty-fourth of November, {{just a week}} after the {{entrance}} of the French. There was a party of six or seven assembled at the rather unusual hour of three in the afternoon; for it was a day on which all Florence was excited by the prospect of some decisive political event. Every lounging-place was full, and every shopkeeper who had no wife or deputy to leave in charge, stood at his door with his thumbs in his belt; while the <b>streets</b> were constantly <b>sprinkled</b> with artisans pausing or passing lazily like floating splinters, ready to rush forward impetuously if any object attracted them.|$|R

6000|$|... "No {{chance to}} speed a horse here, of course," [...] said Lapham, while the horse with a {{spirited}} gentleness picked her way, with a high, long action, over the pavement of the street. The streets were all narrow, {{and most of}} them crooked, in that quarter of the town; {{but at the end of}} one the spars of a vessel pencilled themselves delicately against the cool blue of the afternoon sky. The air was full of a smell pleasantly compounded of oakum, of leather, and of oil. It was not the busy season, and they met only two or three trucks heavily straggling toward the wharf with their long string teams; but the cobble-stones of the pavement were worn with the dint of ponderous wheels, and discoloured with iron-rust from them; here and there, in wandering streaks over its surface, was the grey stain of the salt water with which the <b>street</b> had been <b>sprinkled.</b>|$|R

60|$|And now all respectable England is {{wondering}} at our irritability, {{and sees a}} quite satisfactory explanation of it in our national vanity. Suave mari magno, it is pleasant, sitting in the easy-chairs of Downing <b>Street,</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> pepper on the raw wounds of a kindred people struggling for life, and philosophical to find in self-conceit the cause of our instinctive resentment. Surely we were of all nations the least liable to any temptation of vanity {{at a time when}} the gravest anxiety and the keenest sorrow were never absent from our hearts. Nor is conceit the exclusive attribute of any one nation. The earliest of English travellers, Sir John Mandeville, took a less provincial view of the matter when he said, 'For fro what partie of the erthe that men duellen, other aboven or beneathen, it semethe alweys to hem that duellen that thei gon more righte than any other folke.' The English have always had their fair share of this amiable quality. We may say of them still, as the authour of the 'Lettres Cabalistiques' said of them more than a century ago, 'Ces derniers disent naturellement qu'il n'y a qu'eux qui soient estimables'. And, as he also says,'J'aimerois presque autant tomber entre les mains d'un Inquisiteur que d'un Anglois qui me fait sentir sans cesse combien il s'estime plus que moi, et qui ne daigne me parler que pour injurier ma Nation et pour m'ennuyer du récit des grandes qualités de la sienne.' Of this Bull we may safely say with Horace, habet fænum in cornu. What we felt to be especially insulting was the quiet assumption that the descendants of men who left the Old World for the sake of principle, and who had made the wilderness into a New World patterned after an Idea, could not possibly be susceptible of a generous or lofty sentiment, could have no feeling of nationality deeper than that of a tradesman for his shop. One would have thought, in listening to England, that we were presumptuous in fancying that we were a nation at all, or had any other principle of union than that of booths at a fair, where there is no higher notion of government than the constable, or better image of God than that stamped upon the current coin.|$|R
