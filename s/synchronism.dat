25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or parallel wound motor {{is referred}} to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in <b>synchronism,</b> and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums {{is that to}} measure gravity, the pendulum's length {{as well as its}} period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact <b>synchronism.</b> Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, g could be calculated from equation (1).|$|E
25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} {{needed to}} modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in <b>synchronism</b> with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|E

500|$|A stela bearing Neferhotep I's name is {{of great}} {{importance}} to archaeologists and historians alike as it enables a concordance between the Egyptian and Near Eastern chronologies. This stela depicts the [...] "Governor of Byblos, Yantinu... who was begotten by Governor Yakin" [...] seated upon a throne in front of which are the nomen and prenomen of Neferhotep I. This is significant for two reasons: first, Yakin is plausibly identifiable with a Yakin-Ilu of Byblos known from a cylinder seal of Sehetepibre, indicating that this king and Neferhotep are separated by a generation. Second, a [...] "King of Byblos Yantin-'Ammu" [...] is known from the archives of Mari who is most likely the same person as the Governor of Byblos Yantinu of the stela. Indeed, Byblos was a semi-autonomous Egyptian governorate {{at the time and}} [...] "the king of Byblos" [...] must be the Semitic king of the city ruling it {{in the name of the}} pharaoh. The archives of Mari predominantly date to the reign of the last king of the city, Zimri-Lim, a contemporary of Hammurabi who ultimately sacked Mari. This provides the <b>synchronism</b> Neferhotep I [...] Yantinu [...] Zimri-Lim [...] Hammurabi.|$|E
500|$|Kautilya (c. 370–283 BCE), in his Sanskrit work Arthashastra, {{mentions}} the “easy to travel" [...] trade {{route to the}} South and {{the products of the}} Pandya kingdom, including some special varieties of pearls. He refers to the city of Madurai and the river Tamaraparani in the Pandya kingdom. The Sinhalese chronicle Mahawamsa claims that King Vijaya (c. 543 BCE) married a daughter of the Pandyan king Kulasekaran, to whom he was sending rich presents every year. Using the references to king Gajabahu I in the Mahawamsa and the Uraiperu katturai of the Tamil epic Cilappatikaram, historians have arrived at a literary chronological device referred to as the Gajabahu <b>synchronism</b> to date the events mentioned in the Tamil epic to the 2nd century CE. The famous Greek traveler Megasthenes (c. 302 BCE) {{mentions the}} “Pandae" [...] kingdom and refers to it as “that portion of India which lies to the southward and extends to the sea". The Roman historian Strabo (c. 1st century BCE) mentions the embassies sent by the Pandyas to the court of Augustus, along with a description of the ambassadors from Dramira. He also gives various details about the trading relationship between the Tamil kingdoms and Rome. Pliny the Elder (c. 77 CE) refers to many Tamil ports in his work The Natural History. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 60–100 CE) gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and describes the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom': ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{there are}} several {{mentions}} in literary works of Sanskrit and Greek, the primary literary sources giving detailed accounts of the early Chera Kings are the anthologies of Sangam literature, created between [...] 1st and the 4th centuries CE. They are rich in descriptions {{about a number of}} Chera kings and princes, along with the poets who extolled them. However, these are not worked into connected history and settled chronology so far. A chronological device, known as Gajabahu <b>synchronism,</b> is used by historians to help date early Tamil history. Despite its dependency on numerous conjectures, Gajabahu <b>synchronism</b> has wide acceptance among modern scholars and is considered as the sheet anchor for the purpose of dating ancient Tamil literature. The method depends on an event depicted in Silappatikaram, which describes the visit of Kayavaku, the king of Ilankai (Sri Lanka), in the Chera kingdom during the reign of the Chera king, Senguttuvan. The Gajabahu method considers this Kayavaku as Gajabahu, who according Mahavamsa, a historical poem written in Pali language on the kings of Sri Lanka, lived {{in the latter half of}} the 2nd century CE. This, in turn, has been used to fix the period Senguttuvan, who ruled his kingdom for 55 years (according to the Pathitrupathu), in the 2nd century CE.|$|E

It is not a thing the ultra-orthodox Dynasty 21 would have done... We have an earlier example of the opposite, in fact. The king of the Mitanni had asked Amenhotep II for his daughter's hand in order to cement a political alliance. Amenhotep refused, offended by the suggestion that an Egyptian princess be submitted for that ridicule of being married off to a foreign leader." ...|$|E

[...] Zarifopol's revolt was more contextual, and bound by his own debt to the classics: Ralea sees him as a classical rationalist in the manner of Voltaire, Sainte-Beuve, and Anatole France, and Călinescu as a [...] "cultured academic, for all his freethinking airs", copying his style from Caragiale and Tudor Arghezi, without [...] "a sense of the sublime".
