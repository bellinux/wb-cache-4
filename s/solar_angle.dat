High quality 1 min measurements of direct irradiation collected by the BSRN stations in Carpentras in France and Payerne in Switzerland, are aggregated to yield time series of hourly direct irradiation on both horizontal and normal planes.

Our calculations show that the G condition {{is more likely to}} occur {{during the first half of}} a day than during the second half of a day, at all latitudes during all seasons for the same value of the <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle.</b> The F 1 -layer occurrence probability is larger in the first half of a day in comparison with that in the second half of a day for the same value of the <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle</b> in latitude range 1 for all seasons, while the F 1 -layer occurrence probability is approximately the same for the same <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle</b> before and after noon in latitude ranges 4 and 5. The F 1 -layer and G condition are more commonly formed near midday than close to post sunrise or pre-sunset. The chance that the day-time F 1 -layer and G condition will be formed is greater in summer than in winter at the given <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle</b> in latitude ranges 2 ? 5, while the F 1 -layer occurrence probability is greater in winter than in summer for any <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle</b> in latitude range 1. The calculated occurrence probability of the Nm F 2 weak negative disturbances reaches its maximum and minimum values during daytime and night-time conditions, respectively, and the average night-time value of this probability is less than that by day for all seasons in all studied latitude regions. It is shown that the Nm F 2 normal, strong, and very strong negative disturbances are more frequent on average at night than by day in latitude ranges 1 and 2 for all seasons, reaching their maximum and minimum occurrence probability values at night and by day, respectively. This conclusion is also correct for all other studied latitude regions during winter months, except for the Nm F 2 normal and strong negative disturbances in latitude range 5. A difference in the dependence of the strong and very strong Nm F 2 negative disturbance percentage occurrences on the <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle</b> is found between latitude ranges 1 and 2.

50|$|Extreme {{oscillations}} in irradiance {{occur in}} these regions, for months {{it may be}} totally dark (in winter) or light (in summer).

So less light can penetrate into water and becomes bio available to the plants in polar water under the ice cover.Water temperatures are low, but do not change much seasonally. The low temperature and low available high irradiance together limit primary production.Major nutrients (N, P, Si) are often not limiting primary production.Blooming of Phytoplankton happens in summer, because of the decreased salinity (sea ice melt-water), lower mixing, higher stratification, higher temperature and more bio available light.|$|E
50|$|The {{timing of}} sea ice algae blooms has a {{significant}} impact on the entire ecosystem. Initiation of the bloom is primarily controlled by the return of the sun in the spring (i.e. the <b>solar</b> <b>angle).</b> Because of this, the ice algae bloom usually occurs before the blooms of pelagic phytoplankton, which require higher light levels and warmer water. Early in the season, prior to the ice melt, sea ice algae constitute an important food source for higher trophic levels. However, the total percentage that sea ice algae contribute to the primary production of a given ecosystem depends strongly on the extent of ice cover. The thickness of snow on the sea ice also affects the timing and size of the ice algae bloom by altering light transmission. This sensitivity to ice and snow cover has the potential to cause a mismatch between predators and their food-source, sea ice algae, within the ecosystem. This so called match/mismatch has been applied to a variety of systems. Examples have been seen in the relationship between zooplankton species, which rely on sea ice algae and phytoplankton for food, and juvenile walleye pollock in the Bering Sea.|$|E

50|$|The term freshet is most {{commonly}} used to describe a spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt in rivers located in the northern latitudes of North America. A spring freshet can sometimes last several weeks on large river systems, resulting in significant inundation of flood plains as the snowpack melts in the river's catchment area. Freshets occur with generally diminishing strength and duration depending upon the snowpacks having large accumulations and then the local average rates of warming temperatures; late spring melts allowing faster flooding from the relatively longer days and higher <b>solar</b> <b>angle</b> against more southerly latitudes and elevations reaching average melting temperatures sooner where earlier and generally lesser seasonal snow piles melt more gradually spread over a longer melt period. Serious flooding from southern freshets are more often related to rain storms of large tropical weather systems rolling in from the South Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico, to add their powerful heating capacity to lesser snow packs. Tropically induced rainfall influenced quick melts can also affect snow cover to latitudes {{as far north as}} southern Canada, so long as the generally colder air mass is not blocking northward movement of low pressure systems.

5000|$|Solar {{insolation}} {{is made up}} of direct, diffuse, {{and reflected}} radiation. The absorption factor of a PV cell is deﬁned as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell. At high noon on a cloudless day at the equator, the power of the sun is about 1 kW/m², on the Earth's surface, to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. As such, PV arrays can track the sun through each day to greatly enhance energy collection. However, tracking devices add cost, and require maintenance, so it is more common for PV arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face solar noon (approximately due south in the Northern Hemisphere or due north in the Southern Hemisphere). The tilt angle, from horizontal, can be varied for season, but if fixed, should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system. This optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output. The optimization of the photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux, soiling, and snow losses should be taken into effect. In addition, recent work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection. For example, the spectral albedo can {{play a significant role in}} output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system [...] and the type of solar cell material. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges from 4 kWh/m²/day in northern climes to 6.5 kWh/m²/day in the sunniest regions. A photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of Europe or the United States may expect to produce 1 kWh/m²/day. A typical 1 kW photovoltaic installation in Australia or the southern latitudes of Europe or United States, may produce 3.5-5 kWh per day, dependent on location, orientation, tilt, insolation and other factors. In the Sahara desert, with less cloud cover and a better <b>solar</b> <b>angle,</b> one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kWh/m²/day provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units. The area of the Sahara desert is over 9 million km². 90,600 km², or about 1%, could generate as much electricity as all of the world's power plants combined.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a general}} notion in the {{literature}} that, with increasing latitude, trees have deeper crowns {{as a result of}} a lower solar elevation angle. However, these predictions are based on models that did not include the effects of competition for light between individuals.

Because the level of between-tree shading increases with decreasing <b>solar</b> <b>angle,</b> the predicted ESS will shift to higher crown base height. This argument is supported by a simulation model to check for the effects of crown shape and the change of light intensity that occurs with changing <b>solar</b> <b>angle</b> on model outcomes.
