40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "General aviation accounts for three-quarters of U. S. air traffic, from small propeller planes to large jets, operating among nearly 19, 000 airports. While most security operations are left to private airport operators, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), provides guidance on threats and vulnerabilities. In 2004, TSA issued suggested security enhancements that airports could implement voluntarily. Unlike commercial airports, in most cases general aviation airports {{are not required to}} implement specific security measures. GAO was asked to perform onsite assessments at selected airports with general aviation operations to determine what physical security measures they have to prevent unauthorized access. With advance notice, GAO investigators overtly visited a nonrepresentative selection of 13 airports, based on TSA-determined risk factors. Three of the airports also serve commercial aviation and are therefore <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> security regulations. Using TSA's voluntary recommendations and GAO investigators' security expertise, GAO determined whether certain security measures were in place. GAO also requested documentation of incidents of unauthorized access. Results of GAO's assessments cannot be projected to all general aviation airports and are not meant to imply that the airports failed to implement required security measures [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The RESIST (Residual Stress and Structural Integrity Studies using Thermography) project aims {{to develop}} a non-contact, non-destructive, full-field {{measurement}} and portable residual stress assessment technique based on thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA). The TSA residual stress assessment (RSA) technique relies upon {{a change in the}} thermal expansion coefficient when a material is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> plastic straining. <b>TSA</b> RSA has been successfully applied to non-welded materials, so the next stage is to assess the feasibility of application on weldments. The study focuses on establishing the validation of the technique on austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L (EN 1. 4404), which is commonly used in power generation industry. A series of increasingly complex ‘weld mock-ups’ made out of 316 L are designed <b>to</b> test the <b>TSA</b> RSA approach. Finite element (FE) simulations of the welded mock-ups were produced. The design, FE modelling and manufacture of two of the mock-ups are presented.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cytotoxic}} {{mechanism of}} the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) Trichostatin A (TSA) was explored in a neuroblastoma (NB) model. TSA induces cell death in neuroblastic-type NB cells by increasing the acetylation of Ku 70, a Bax-binding protein. Ku 70 acetylation causes Bax release and activation, triggering cell death. This response <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> depends on the CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetylating Ku 70. TSA-induced cell death response correlates with CBP expression. In stromaltype NB cell lines {{with low levels of}} CBP and relative resistance <b>to</b> <b>TSA,</b> increasing CBP expression disrupts Bax-Ku 70 binding and sensitizes them <b>to</b> <b>TSA.</b> Reducing CBP expression in neuroblastic cell types causes resistance. Cytotoxic response <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> is Baxdependent. Interestingly, depleting NB cells of Ku 70 also triggers Bax-dependent cell death, suggesting that conditions that leave Bax unbound to Ku 70 result in cell death. We also show that CBP, Ku 70, and Bax are expressed in human NB tumors and that CBP expression varies across cell types comprising these tumors, with the highest expression observed in neuroblastic elements. Together, these results demonstrate that CBP, Bax, and Ku 70 contribute to a therapeutic response <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> against NB and identify the possibility of using these proteins to predict clinical responsiveness to HDACI treatment...|$|R
40|$|Graphene oxide (GO) and {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) {{have been}} previously used independently as active supports for layered double hydroxides (LDH), {{and found to}} enhance the intrinsic CO 2 sorption capacity. However, the long-term stability of the materials <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> temperature-swing adsorption (<b>TSA)</b> cycles still requires improvement. In this contribution, GO and MWCNT are hybridized to produce mixed substrates with improved surface area, and compatibility for the subsequent deposition of LDH platelets, compared to either phase alone. The incorporation of a robust and thoroughly hybridized carbon network considerably enhances the thermal stability of activated, promoted LDH over twenty cycles of gas adsorption-desorption (96 % of retention of the initial sorption capacity at the 20 th cycle), dramatically reducing the sintering previously observed when either GO or MWCNT were added separately. Detailed characterization of the morphology of the supported LDH, at several stages of the multicycle adsorption process, shows that the initial morphology of the adsorbents is more strongly retained when supported on the robust hybrid GO/MWCNT network; the CO 2 adsorption performance correlates closely with the specific surface area of the adsorbents, with both maximized at small loadings of a 1 : 1 ratio GO:MWCNT substrate...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 8 (FGF 8) is over-expressed in {{prostate}} cancer (CaP) correlating with high-grade disease and reduced survival. The role of acetylation in transcriptional regulation of FGF 8 was investigated using the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). METHODS. FGF 8 transcriptional response <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> was investigated by gene reporter assays, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were also performed. RESULTS. FGF 8 is upregulated in response <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> treatment along with NF-kappa B transcriptional activity. Over-expression of p 65 activated FGF 8 transcription. ChIP assays revealed p 65 recruitment to the fgf 8 promoter, containing putative NF-kappa B binding sites, post TSA stimulation. PI- 3 K activity {{is required for}} TSA mediated FGF 8 upregulation. CONCLUSION. Using TSA treatment in prostate cancer cells, a requirement of PI- 3 K activity in mediating TSA function is demonstrated and a novel role for NF-kappa B in the regulation of FGF 8 expression is uncovered...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} {{regulate the}} transcription of genes, which {{can affect the}} differentiation of MSCs. The aim of the current work is {{to determine how the}} histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and VPA affect the expression of neuronal lineage genes in a culture of rat MSCs (rMSCs). Materials and Methods: We analyzed the expression of early neuron marker gene (Tubb 3), mature neuron markers genes (Vacht, Th, Htr 2 a) and the oligodendrocyte progenitor marker gene (GalC). Moreover, changes in the gene expression after three different periods of exposure <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> and VPA were investigated for the first time. Results: After six days of exposition <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> and VPA, the expression of Tubb 3 and GalC decreased, while the expression of Th increased. The highest increase of VAChT expression was observed after three days of TSA and VPA treatment. A decrease in Htr 2 a gene expression was observed after TSA treatment and an increase was observed after VPA treatment. We also observed that TSA and VPA inhibited cell proliferation and the formation of neurospheres in the rMSCs culture. Discussion: The central findings of our study are that TSA and VPA affect the expression of neuronal lineage genes in an rMSCs culture. After exposure <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> or VPA, the expression of early neuronal gene decreases but equally the expression of mature neuron genes increases. After TSA and VPA treatment ER of the oligodendrocyte progenitor marker decreased. TSA and VPA inhibit cell proliferation and the formation of neurospheres in rMSCs culture...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} effect of lysine {{acetylation}} in related proteins on regulation of the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, and determine the lysine-acetylated proteins and the acetylated modified sites in AGS gastric cancer cells. METHODS: The CCK- 8 experiment and flow cytometry were used to observe the changes in proliferation and cycle of AGS cells treated with trichostatin A (TSA). Real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to observe expression changes in p 21, p 53, Bax, Bcl- 2, CDK 2, and CyclinD 1 in gastric cancer cells exposed <b>to</b> <b>TSA.</b> Cytoplasmic proteins in gastric cancer cells before and after TSA treatment were immunoprecipitated with anti-acetylated lysine antibodies, separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and silver-stained to detect the proteins by mass spectrometry after removal of the gel. The acetylated proteins in AGS cells were enriched with lysine-acetylated antibodies, and a high-resolution mass spectrometer was used to detect the acetylated proteins and modified sites. RESULTS: TSA significantly inhibited AGS cell proliferation, and promoted cell apoptosis, leading to AGS cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases, especially G 0 /G 1 phase. p 21, p 53 and Bax gene expression levels in AGS cells were increased with TSA treatment duration; Bcl- 2, CDK 2, and CyclinD 1 gene expression levels were decreased with TSA treatment duration. Two unknown protein bands, 72 kDa (before exposure <b>to</b> <b>TSA)</b> and 28 kDa (after exposure <b>to</b> <b>TSA),</b> were identified by silver-staining after immunoprecipitation of AGS cells with the lysine-acetylated monoclonal antibodies. Mass spectrometry showed that the 72 kDa protein band may be PKM 2 and the 28 kDa protein band may be ATP 5 O. The acetylated proteins and modified sites in AGS cells were determined. CONCLUSION: TSA can inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation, which possibly activated signaling pathways {{in a variety of}} tumor-associated factors.

40|$|Secreted (TSA) {{and water}} lysed (WLA) antigens derived from cell {{culture of the}} RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii {{have been used to}} induce antigen {{specific}} mitogenesis of lymphocytes from patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic toxoplasmosis. Lymphocyte responsiveness to WLA was similar to previous reports, with about 50 % of patients showing a false negative reaction. Responses <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> however were highly specific, with no false negative reactions. This increased specificity was not due to an increased response against TSA by patients' lymphocytes (P less than 0. 001), but a lower TSA response by uninfected subjects' lymphocytes (P greater than 0. 1) compared with WLA in both cases. In a minority of both infected and uninfected subjects, there was a low but detectable response to antigens secreted by the host cell line (HCA), and this was directly compared to their responses against TSA. There was at least a 10 -fold increase in the patients' responses <b>to</b> <b>TSA</b> when compared with HCA (P less than 0. 001), whereas {{there was no significant difference}} between the uninfected subjects' responses to these antigens (P greater than 0. 1).
