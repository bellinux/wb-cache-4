A comparison between the Protocol for Assessing Community Excellence in Environmental Health and the PRECEDE-PROCEED model used in health education illustrates some similarities and differences in terminology, assessment procedures, interven-tion design, and types of evidence used by the two disciplines. Promising intervention strategies draw on the expertise of both fields and include <b>social</b> <b>action,</b> <b>policy</b> and media advocacy, coalition building, organizational change, lay health advisers, risk communication, and tailored educational messages. Appropriate targets of change can range from the equitable distribution of resources to individual behavior change.

These changes have significant impact on the relationship with the publics targeted by these policies, and make it necessary to take individual preferences into account. That is the case in France today, where institutionalization of the non-take-up theme may be paving the way for "post-welfarism", in which policy making takes in account individual preferences above all.

40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{research}} (1988 to 1998) on {{gender differences in}} environmental attitudes and behaviors found that, contrary to past inconsistencies, a clearer pic-ture has emerged: Women report stronger environmental attitudes and behaviors than men. Additional evidence of gender differences in environmental attitudes and behaviors was also supported across age (Study 1) and across 14 countries (Study 2). As a single variable, the effect of gender on proenvironmental behavior was consistently stronger than on environmental attitudes. Explanations for gen-der differences in environmentalism were examined in Study 3. It was found that compared to males, females had higher levels of socialization to be other oriented and socially responsible.

Objective: Partners collaborated to translate science and best practices into <b>social</b> <b>action</b> and <b>policy</b> change to address childhood lead poisoning. Methods: Using {{the evolution of a}} childhood lead poisoning prevention initiative, we discuss how an academic–community relationship can be created and sustained. Lessons Learned: Our experience demonstrates that broadbased partnerships are enhanced by the attributes of community-based participatory research (CBPR). We observe that engaging in community collaborations that are not driven by research eliminates potential conflicts for academic and community partners.

It highlights work being done in career development and public policy, and provides information to broaden the knowledge-base of those interested in this area. Theories are suggested for conceptualizing and organizing public policy as it related to work and career. Career specialists can help redefine public problems by using terminology conveying a different view of an existing problem. In addition, they can contribute to many policy issues by: (1) helping with links between models and delivery systems; (2) defining roles of parties involved in guidance services; (3) delineating which models are appropriate for counseling; and (4) designing evaluation programs and outcome studies to assess quality of guidance and psychological services.

40|$|During {{the past}} 60 years of China’s socialist construction, its higher {{education}} policy has experienced dramatic paradigm shifts {{in line with}} the nation’s transformation from a planned to a market economy. During the 1950 s- 1970 s, the paramount principle of education policy was political in nature and effect. While the fundamental values of education equity were based on the Chinese communist political ideology and education was treated as a public good, equal opportunities were not necessarily guaranteed. Since 1978, contribution to economic growth was prioritised on China’s education policy agenda. The political function of education was downgraded to favour a strategy that would accelerate China’s march toward economic modernisation. Priority has been shifted from equity to efficiency that is measured almost exclusively in financial terms. Within this process, new winners and losers have been created, with the former far outnumbered by the latter. By tracing current practices to their social and historical roots in order to grasp the essence of paradigm shifts in China’s higher education policy during the past six decades, this article argues that as a kind of <b>social</b> <b>action,</b> education <b>policy</b> requires to be observed within certain social, historical environment. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} premise that the two goals framing social work {{practice}} are self-determination and socialjustice, the author argues that social work has been more devoted to the implementation of the former than the latter.

From a review of the literature, methods ofpolicy practice are identified as legislative advocacy, reform through litigation, <b>social</b> <b>action,</b> and <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> analysis. Each method is analyzed in terms of its characteristics, specific social work roles, and potential effectiveness. The connection between social work as a professionand social welfare is indisputable (Day, 1989;Jansson, 1988).

This fact by itself does not make social work central to social welfare in the sense of shaping policies, managing services, or introducing innovations.

40|$|Abstract Background In Pakistan, {{preference}} for boys over girls is deeply culturally embedded. From birth, many women experience gendered disadvantages; less access to scarce resources, poorer health care, higher child mortality, limited education, less employment {{outside of the}} home and circumscribed autonomy. The prevalence of psychological morbidity is exceptionally high among women. We hypothesise that, among women of childbearing age, gender disadvantage is an independent risk factor for psychological morbidity Methods A cross-sectional catchment area survey of 525 women aged 18 to 35 years living in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The effect of gender disadvantage was assessed as a latent variable using structural equation modelling. Indicators were parental gender preference, low parental care, parental overprotection, limited education, early age at marriage, marital dissatisfaction and low autonomy. Psychological morbidity was assessed using the 20 item Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ). Results Gender disadvantage was independently predictive of psychological morbidity. Among married women, socio-economic status did not predict psychological morbidity, and the effect of education was mediated through gender disadvantage rather than socioeconomic status (SES). The women's own {{preference for}} a male child was strongly predicted by their perceptions of having been disadvantaged by their gender in their families of origin. Conclusions The high prevalence of psychological morbidity among women in Pakistan is concerning given recently reported strong associations with low birth weight and infant stunting. <b>Social</b> <b>action,</b> public <b>policies</b> and legislation are indicated to reduce culturally embedded preferences.

40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{extensive}} sharing of responsibility between governmental and non-profit organisations to accomplish <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> <b>actions,</b> the relationship between state and the nonprofit organisations and the degree of dependence of these organisations in relation to the state has been acknowledged as a critical issue within social and public policy. However, the hallmark of much research related with non-profit/statutory relations has derived mainly from the widely recognition of non-profit s increased income from statutory sources (Salamon and Anheier, 1996). As a result, non-profit s dependency on the state has been captured essentially by assessing financial dependency.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{approach to}} human behaviour under scrutiny: {{an overview of}} arguments for the autonomy of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> Abstract. The article reviews and re-examines some arguments against the treatment of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> within the economic approach {{as an extension of}} economic behaviour/ rationality and thus against its denial of the speci®c, irreducible nature of the extra-economic. A major argument is that <b>social</b> <b>action</b> is a sui generis phenomenon that cannot be reduced with theoretical impunity to its economic modalities. <b>Social</b> <b>action</b> is characterized by substantial autonomy relative to economic behaviour/ rationality. Arguments about the autonomous character of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> seek to remedy the indiscriminate extension of the economic approach beyond the ®eld of economy to all human behaviour construed as consistent utility maximization. These arguments adduce certain classes of factors (socio-psychological, socio-cultural, socio-systemic and others) contributing toward the autonomy of <b>social</b> <b>action.</b> In addition, the economic-approach treatment of the human actor as Homo economicus is reversed by conceiving the economy as a domain of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> of which economic behaviour is a special case.
