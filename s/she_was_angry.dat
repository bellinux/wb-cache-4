5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> at Archie and {{was worried about}} what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

25|$|In 1930 Ashcroft {{was cast}} as Desdemona in a {{production}} of Othello at the Savoy Theatre, starring Paul Robeson in the title role. The production was not well received, but Ashcroft's notices were excellent. The production prompted a political awakening in Ashcroft, who was astonished to receive hate-mail for appearing onstage with a black actor; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that Robeson was the star at the Savoy Theatre but was not welcome at the adjoining Savoy Hotel. During the run she had a brief affair with Robeson, which, followed by another with the writer J. B. Priestley, {{put an end to}} her first marriage.

Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> because all the media attention was on Aylan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they can escape Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account.|$|E

500|$|Director Chris Buck {{believed}} that Menzel's vocals would {{help in the}} portrayal of the character, saying, [...] "Idina {{has a sense of}} vulnerability in her voice. She plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fearâ€”so we needed someone who could portray both sides of the character, and Idina was just amazing." [...] Menzel was unaccustomed to working with animated films and being required to portray her character's feelings with her voice alone, though she did not find it particularly challenging. While recording, she was able to [...] "play" [...] with her voice, trying various tones to establish the ranges in Elsa's emotions. For example, Menzel wanted there to be a difference between the ways she sounded when she was being bold and when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry.</b> She would also physically restrict her hands from moving as she recorded the film's early scenes in order to project how her character was [...] "so afraid to move and feel anything that it would come out and hurt people".|$|E

[...] In a subsequent interview, Friedman rebuked Palin personally, saying <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> with Sarah Palin for using her son Trig as a political prop to pander for votes, explaining that she has a normal life and that Palin's son Trig should be treated as normal rather than like a [...] "loaf of bread." ...|$|E

Morey commented that Sonya and Toadie's relationship was vulnerable to Naomi.
