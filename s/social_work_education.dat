This article suggested that although the [...] "use of people with a problem to help other people who have the same problem in [...] more severe form" [...] is [...] "an age-old therapeutic approach," [...] the traditional focus on outcomes for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of [...] "the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance" [...] because [...] "frequently it is he who improves!" [...] (p.27). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction at least {{has the potential to be}} mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the [...] "helpee" [...] to benefit in order for the [...] "helper" [...] to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide.|$|E
