40|$|Objective: Black cohosh [Actaea racemosa L., {{formerly}} Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt. ] is a botanical used {{mainly for}} the management of menopausal symptoms. Recently, regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada, and the European Union have released statements regarding the Bpotential association ^ between black cohosh and hepatotoxicity. In response, the Dietary <b>Supplement</b> Information <b>Expert</b> Committee of the US Pharmacopeia’s Council of Experts reviewed safety information for black cohosh products. Design: The Expert Committee analyzed information from human clinical case reports, adverse event reports, animal pharmacological and toxicological data, historical use, regulatory status, and contemporaneous extent of use. Reports were obtained from diverse sources, including the European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, and the US Food and Drug Administration. Case reports pertaining to liver damage were evaluated according to the Naranjo causality algorithm scale. Results: Thirty nonduplicate reports on use of black cohosh products concerning liver damage were analyzed. All the reports of liver damage were assigned possible causality, and none were probable or certain causality. The clinical pharmacokinetic and animal toxicological information did not reveal unfavorable information about black cohosh.

However, limited empirical evidence links digital word-of-mouth to purchasing decisions. We implement a regression discontinuity design {{to estimate the}} effect of positive Yelp. com ratings on restaurant reservation availability. An extra half-star rating causes restaurants to sell out 19 percentage points (49 %) more frequently, with larger impacts when alternate information is more scarce. These returns suggest that restaurateurs face incentives to leave fake reviews, but a rich set of robustness checks confirm that restaurants do not manipulate ratings in a confounding, discontinuous manner. Beliefs on product quality {{play an important role}} in shaping consumer demand. For many goods, consumers face ex ante uncertainty regarding the quality of the good and rely on imperfect signals to infer quality. Traditionally, expert opinion and social learning have helped consumers resolve these information asymmetries. For an expert’s take, consumers may consult Consumer Reports when buying an automobile or household appliance or they may read reviews by professional critics when selecting a movie or choosing among dining options. Alternatively, consumers may confer with peers who own the automobile or who have eaten at the restaurant.

40|$|A recent {{advance in}} {{biosecurity}} surveillance design aims to benefit island conservation through early and improved detection of incursions by non-indigenous species. The novel {{aspects of the}} design are that it achieves a specified power of detection in a cost-managed system, while acknowledging heterogeneity of risk {{in the study area}} and stratifying the area to target surveillance deployment. The design also utilises a variety of surveillance system components, such as formal scientific surveys, trapping methods, and incidental sightings by non-biologist observers. These advances in design were applied to black rats (Rattus rattus) representing the group of invasive rats including R. norvegicus, and R. exulans, which are potential threats to Barrow Island, Australia, a high value conservation nature reserve where a proposed liquefied natural gas development is a potential source of incursions. Rats are important to consider as they are prevalent invaders worldwide, difficult to detect early when present in low numbers, and able to spread and establish relatively quickly after arrival. The ‘exemplar’ design for the black rat is then applied in a manner that enables the detection of a range of non-indigenous species of rat that could potentially be introduced. Many of the design decisions were based on expert opinion as data gaps exist in empirical data. The surveillance system was able to take into account factors such as collateral effects on native species, the availability of limited resources on an offshore island, financial costs, demands on expertise and other logistical constraints. We demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the surveillance system and discuss how it could be updated as empirical data are collected to <b>supplement</b> <b>expert</b> opinion and provide a basis for adaptive management. Overall, the surveillance system promotes an efficient use of resources while providing defined power to detect early rat incursions, translating to reduced environmental, resourcing and financial costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spirulina, now named Arthrospira, is a {{microscopic}} and filamentous cyanobacterium {{that has a}} long history of use as a safe food, lacking toxicity. It is commercially produced in large outdoor ponds under controlled conditions. The aim of this review article is to summarize the recent available information concerning the human clinical potential and applications of Spirulina, as well as clinical data related to the safety and side effects of Spirulina. Potential health benefits of Spirulina are mainly due to its chemical composition, which includes proteins (the highest protein content of any natural food, 55 – 70 %), carbohydrates, essential amino acids, minerals (especially iron), essential fatty acids, vitamins and pigments. In this respect, three major bioactive components of Spirulina, the protein phycocyanin (a biliprotein pigment), sulfated poly-saccharides and gamma linolenic acid seem to play significant roles in impart-ing improved human body functions. Furthermore, new experimental evidence supports the immunomodulation and antiviral effects of Spirulina supplemen-tation.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{touches on}} issues of urban design, planning, architecture, historic preservation and tourism. However, only a few questions are {{at the core of}} this research. How do people perceive urban design? What is it about the design that influences our perceptions? What is it about ourselves that leads us to 2 ̆ 7 read 2 ̆ 7 shared settings differently? ^ I have approached these questions from two directions: (1) A reflective consideration of three bodies of literature: urban design, preservation, and tourism. The authors selected allow for a variety of insights into the perception and awareness of the built environment. (2) An empirical study of 2 ̆ 7 lay 2 ̆ 7 respondents at waterfront sites in Philadelphia and Yokohama. Two exploratory photo surveys have been completed, one in Philadelphia (USA) and the other in Yokohama (Japan). They were designed to gather, quickly and efficiently, user knowledge of an area. The photo survey technique has a number of potential uses, all related to <b>supplementing</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge by gaining responses from a larger cross section of an area 2 ̆ 7 s users. ^ This study has shown a strong tie between demographics and preferences for a series of specific evaluative categories of urban design in the waterfront areas of Philadelphia and Yokohama. Increasing age appears to correspond to increasing preference for some type of historical ambience in both the U. S. and Japanese survey groups. ^ Within Philadelphia, increasing education level also showed a strong correlation to increasing preference for historical ambience. This was not tested in the Yokohama Survey, but the significant correlation in Philadelphia indicates that it may be a strong determining factor of preference in other locations as well. The age of appearance (historical ambience) of a structure or district is a significant factor in various demographic groups 2 ̆ 7 preferences. It can serve as a supporting factor in guiding the conservation and change of the physical fabric of the city. That significant correlations are found to exist within demographic groups for these evaluative categories at all, may prove equally important.
