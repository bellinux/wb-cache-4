5000|$|The late 19th to {{the early}} 20th century {{experienced}} {{a revival of the}} He Chaozong manner. Notable was the Dehua ceramicist Su Xuejin ( [...] , 1869-1919). He is said to have recreated the He Chaozong manner to a degree the originals cannot be distinguished from his own efforts. It can be safely assumed that many of these works bear the seal of the earlier master such as the Manjusri statue presented here. The accompanying thinly potted Guanyin statue displays the typical Dehua gourd seal above the He Chaozong <b>square</b> <b>seal,</b> an indication of an even later period of production. The Manjusri statue is heavily potted, clearly a revival piece and perhaps a close recreation of the original master. It bears a single He Chaozong seal. Both statues appear the products of the same ceramic studio, if not the same artist. The Manjusri statue shows none of the mannerism of robes characteristic of many late Ming and early Qing period Dehua statuary. It seems a revival of a classical manner.|$|E

Colophon: "Scribal," rectangular, reads: "تمت الكتاب بعون الله الملك الوهاب كتبه عبد الفقير"Explicit: "ولكن هذا اخر الكلام من كتاب المواقف ونسأل الله تعالى أن يثبت قلبنا على دينه ولا بزيغه بعد الهداية ويعصمنا عن الغواية ويوقفنا للاقتداء برسول الله واصحابه والتابعين لهم باحسان ويعفو عن طغيان القلم وما لا يخلق [كذا] عنه البشر من السهو والذلل وان يعاملنا بفضله ورحمته انه هو العفو الرحيم قد تمت"Incipit: "ضمن خطبة كتابه الإشارة إلى مقاصد علم الكلام رعاية لبراعة الإستهلال فبسمل اولا يتمنا ثم قال الحمد لله العلى شانه إلى أخره وحاله في ذاته وصفاته وأقعاله فانه جامع لجهات علو الشان "Title from inscription on fol. 1 a (p. 1).

40|$|AbstractAs {{part of a}} {{collaborative}} program between University of California, Berkeley, the Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago, and several commercial companies, a 20 cm <b>square</b> <b>sealed</b> tube microchannel plate detector scheme with a proximity focused bialkali photocathode is being developed. Sealed tube microchannel plate deviceshave good imaging and timing characteristics, but large areas have been previously unavailable. We have madeb considerable progress in fabricating large size microchannel plates. A key feature is the novel implementation of low cost microchannel plates using borosilicate micro-capillary arrays with hollow core tubes. The resistive and secondary electron emissive surfaces are then applied by atomic layer deposition, eliminating the wet etch and thermal reduction processes for normal glass microchannel plates. Initial results with 33 mm format microchannel plates for gain, pulse width, imaging performance and lifetime are comparable to conventional MCPs. Large 20 cm square microchannel plate prototypes with 20 μm and 40 μm pores have been fabricated and initial tests show operational gain. Design and fabrication of a 20 cm sealed tube assembly is well advanced and comprises a borosilicate entrance window, a proximity focused bialkali photocathode, a pair of microchannel plates and a stripline readout anode. The design employs a brazed ceramic walled enclosure and a transfer tube type photocathode with an indium seal. We have adopted a baseline bialkali photocathode to match the anticipated input spectrum, and have {{made a number of}} test cathodes with > 20 % peak quantum efficiency on borofloat- 33 window material. Stripline anodes are also being developed which will give less than 1 mm spatial resolution using custom ASIC amplification and timing electronics...|$|R
