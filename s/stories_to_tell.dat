25|$|The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, {{a pickup}} by NBC seemed {{unlikely}} {{and the show}} was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up. Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next 4 episodes were filmed. These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of Cheers on Thursdays at 9:30p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called FM. The series was renamed Seinfeld after the failure of short-lived 1990 ABC series The Marshall Chronicles. After airing {{in the summer of}} 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes. Larry David believed that he and Jerry Seinfeld had no more <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes. Season two was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the (Persian) Gulf War. It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30p.m. and eventually flipped with veteran series Night Court to 9:00.|$|E
500|$|Sandra Cisneros (born December 20, 1954) is a Hispanic-American writer. [...] She is {{best known}} for her first novel The House on Mango Street (1984) and her {{subsequent}} short story collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991). Her work experiments with literary forms and investigates emerging subject positions, which Cisneros herself attributes to growing up in a context of cultural hybridity and economic inequality that endowed her with unique <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> She is the recipient of numerous awards including a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, was awarded one of 25 new Ford Foundation Art of Change fellowships in 2017, and is regarded as a key figure in Chicana literature.|$|E

500|$|Following season finale, the San Jose Mercury News said [...] "If they [...] want to {{be taken}} seriously, the shows could take a cue from Canadian drama Degrassi: The Next Generation, which ... {{addresses}} the same gritty teen issues without being far-fetched", and Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle echoed that by adding [...] "Degrassi: The Next Generation has cultivated a loyal audience by avoiding the sugar-coating niceties of old-school teen TV and by treating those 10- to 14-year-olds as, well, not adults per se, but definitely maturing viewers. Degrassi focuses on a high school with a disparate student body, with countless individual <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> (which is why the franchise has lasted this long). There's nothing corny or sweet about [...] "Degrassi" [...] as it boldly tackles everything from obesity to date rape, thongs to drugs". Others, such as The Advocate gave praise and said the series was breaking new ground by depicting a gay romance between two teenaged boys.|$|E
500|$|Many {{prominent}} and successful women cite Nancy Drew {{as an early}} formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor; TV personalities Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters; singers Barbra Streisand and Beverly Sills; mystery authors Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard; scholar Carolyn Heilbrun; actresses Ellen Barkin and Emma Roberts; former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; former First Lady Laura Bush; {{and former president of}} the National Organization for Women Karen DeCrow. Less prominent women also credit the character of Nancy Drew with helping them to become stronger women; when the first Nancy Drew conference was held, at the University of Iowa, in 1993, conference organizers received a flood of calls from women who [...] "all had <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about how instrumental Nancy had been in their lives, and about how she had inspired, comforted, entertained them through their childhoods, and, for a surprising number of women, well into adulthood." ...|$|E

According to Ortved, most of the participants [...] "had <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> or axes to grind," [...] or are [...] "too successful to care." [...] Research and interviews for both the book and Vanity Fair article were conducted between January 2007 and May 2008. Ortved commented that the person he most would have liked to interview was Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson. Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the Fox Broadcasting Company, agreed to be interviewed, and reportedly told Ortved [...] "Those creative types, they're always looking to pick a fight."

500|$|Some {{critics were}} {{dissatisfied}} with {{the scope of the}} novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> Caly Risen of Flak Magazine believed that the immigrant experience was the [...] "heart of the novel", lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a [...] "fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further." [...] Risen wished to read more about the events between Cal's adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal's experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. The Washington Posts Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic also felt that the brief description of Callie's childhood was lacking; the book [...] "gloss over" [...] how her mother did not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O'Nan characterized Cal's relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as [...] "underdeveloped", causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of People had the same view about the novel's end, writing that the conclusion felt [...] "rushed".|$|E

[...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
500|$|Days after announcing Raimi's departure, {{the studio}} {{announced}} that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot. Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man {{that there are so many}} <b>stories</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> and so many characters." [...] He described the film as [...] "not a remake" [...] explaining that [...] "we're not making Sam's movie again.

The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded [...] "very funny" [...] and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and {{did not participate in}} any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers. [...] " [...] it's a funny bunch of people", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "You definitely lose touch with what the movies you're supposed to see, what's good on TV..." [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] is the second episode Vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election, and the second episode he wrote in which Homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by Burns and run into conflict with Smithers. [...] "You can't do anything {{for the first time at}} this point", Vitti quipped. Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". [...] "I gotta say, this was the most fun I ever had working on an episode", he said in the episode's DVD commentary.
