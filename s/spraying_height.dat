The process {{is based on the}} robot controlled sprayforming of molten steel droplets onto a ceramic master pattern to form a thick, dimensionally accurate steel shell. This paper describes the Sprayform Tool Process, and investigates the evolution of microstructure in thick steel shells in terms of the oxide fraction as a function of process parameters: (i) spray height; (ii) atomising gas pressure; (iii) wire feed rate; and (iv) manipulating robot velocity. <b>Spray</b> <b>height</b> had the strongest influence on oxide content; by reducing <b>spray</b> <b>height</b> from 160 to 120 mm the oxide fraction in the microstructure was halved. The role of droplet splashing on the subsequent oxidation of splash droplets has been revealed as an important phenomenon controlling sprayed microstructure and oxide fraction. On the basis of the presented experimental results, the implications for the manufacture of large steel shells by the Sprayform Tool Process are discussed. 0 2004 Elsevier B. V.

In this regulation, drift reducing spray application techniques can be used to reduce buffer zones. The purpose of this research is to measure and compare the amount of drift sediment for different spray application techniques under field conditions. A drift prediction equation for the reference spraying was used to compare other spraying techniques with the reference spraying, under different weather conditions.

This continues to be a major problem in applying agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this research is to measure the amount of sedimenting drift from a horizontal boom sprayer for different (drift reducing) spray application techniques under field conditions and to compare the results with the results from a reference spray, taking into account variations in meteorological conditions during the field drift experiments.

Tecoflex® SG- 80 A polyurethane was spun, systematically altering the spinning parameters, and the resulting scaffolds were characterised using scanning electron microscopy. Inter-fibre separation was significantly affected by flow rate, spray distance and grid and mandrel voltages; fibre diameter by flow rate and mandrel voltage; void fraction by flow rate; fibre orientation by traverse speed and mandrel speed; and thickness by flow rate. Thus, scaffold (three-dimensional) architecture may be controlled through manipulation of the electric fields and the fibre deposition (spinning parameters of flow rate and grid and mandrel voltages); and by spray movement and direction (spinning parameters of relative <b>spray</b> <b>height,</b> <b>spray</b> distance, traverse speed and mandrel speed).

Because the heat transfer of spray cooling {{has much to}} do with the heater surface temperature, it is important to ensure that the entire heating surface temperature is in an effective operating range.

In this paper, experimental method was used to investigate the effect of installation angle of spray cooling on the heat transfer performance. The five installation angles tested in this study were 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °.

40|$|A {{model for}} diesel spray wall {{impaction}} is presented, which is assessed against experiments {{for a number}} of test cases, including normal or angled injection to a wall into a quiescent space or a cross-flowing gas at various gas pressures. New relationships are given for the velocities of the droplets rebounding from the wall. These relationships take into account the wall roughness and the possible break-up of the droplets during their impingement. The impingement model was incorporated in a spray model based on the stochastic particle technique (Dukowicz 1980) and accounts for the phenomena of droplet injection, break-up, collision and coalescence, turbulent dispersion, and evaporation. The spray model was incorporated in a recently developed three-dimensional (3 -D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that simulates the unsteady compressible flow of the gas in internal combustion engines by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations. It was found that the motion of the surrounding gas caused by the spray injection plays a minor role on the predicted results.

50|$|The <b>height</b> of each <b>spray</b> nozzle {{above the}} surface of the pond should be between 1.5 m and 2.0 m. The spray nozzles {{themselves}} should be chosen so as to provide the desired spray pattern diameter at the pond surface, while yielding a maximum <b>spray</b> <b>height</b> of 2.5 m or more above the nozzle. This will provide an adequate contact time between the air and water and should be achievable with a delivery pressure of between 50 and 75 kPa across the nozzles. The performance of a spray pond depends to a large degree on the effectiveness of the spray nozzles which are installed. Ideally, the chosen nozzles should provide a fine, evenly distributed spray in conical form, be capable of passing small particles of suspended matter without blocking and be readily dismantled for cleaning. Typical droplet sizes which are achieved by spray pond nozzles vary between 3 mm and 6 mm. While providing better cooling performance because of their increased surface-to-volume ratios, the generation of droplets of smaller size would require an excessive pressure drop across the nozzles and could lead to increased wind-drift losses from the pond.|$|R

Photosynthetic rates in irrigated saplings were reduced 34 % to 53 % in comparison to unirrigated sapling rates. Similarly, water use efficiency of sapling leaves subjected to direct leachate exposure dropped an average of 70 %, while transpiration rates were similar to, and leaf temperatures were 20 % higher than, those found in unirrigated leaves. Spectral patterns of understorey leaves, distorted because of the accumulation of leachate precipitate residues on the adaxial surface, demonstrated increased absorbance in the near infrared waveband and reduced reflection in visible wave-bands compared to abaxial surfaces.

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of the vertical volumetric distribution of an axial fan sprayer on the Brevipalpus phoenicis control efficiency. First, an assay was performed to evaluate the vertical volume distribution uniformity of the sprayer, assessing different spray nozzles configurations on the spray arcs, sides of the sprayer and <b>spray</b> <b>heights.</b> Afterwards, another experiment was carried out to analyze the relationship between the distribution of the Fenpyroximate acaricide on Coffea arabica L. and the B. phoenicis control efficiency. The treatments were arranged in a 4 x 2 factorial + 1 additional control, consisting of four spray volumes (200 L ha- 1, 400 L ha- 1, 600 L ha- 1 and 800 L ha- 1) and two spray nozzles configurations (1 : 100 % of MAG 1. 5 nozzles; 2 : upper extension with 5 MAG 3. 0 nozzles, middle extension with 9 MAG 1. 5 nozzles and lower extension with 4 MAG 3. 0 nozzles). Configuration 2 provided the smallest coefficient of variation (28 %). Nozzle configurations had no effect on the incidence of B. phoenicis.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{injection}} rate modes on fuel spray-wall impingement and combustion {{process in a}} direct injection diesel engine is investigated in present work. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model for flow field, spray, spray-wall interactions, combustion, and emission formation processes {{have been used to}} carry out the computations. The optimized omega combustion chamber geometry was used in the diesel engine model instead of baseline cylindrical geometry and the results were verified for this improved combustion chamber geometry. Results for different injection modes indicate that using the ramp injection rate curve, the spray-wall impinging is increased due to higher injection rate at the end of injection duration. Also the increased in-cylinder temperature, piston surface temperature and higher turbulence intensity leads to enhanced wall-film evaporation. Soot mass fraction also decreases due to improved air-fuel mixing and evaporation of wall-film by reduction of the fuel rich zones especially in the impingement regions. Results for different injection modes indicate that using the ramp injection rate shape slightly retards the combustion process and improves combustion characteristics while maintaining lower NOx and considerably lower soot emissions compared to the boot and rectangle injection modes. Also, in this injection mode, because of the high pressure injection, higher spray droplet velocities (higher Weber number) and increased wall <b>spray</b> <b>height</b> than the other modes, it could be said that the dominant impingement regime may be the splashing regime. The results of model for baseline diesel engine are compared with the corresponding experimental data and show good levels of agreement...|$|R

It is shown that the placement and the type of the thermocouple play major role in accuracy of the calculation. The frequency of measuring and the discriminability of used devices also play a role as well as the setup of parameters in the inverse task. The election of mentioned parameters is described with regard to the speed of cooling. Knowledge from the theoretical part of the work is applied in the experimental part.

50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: <b>spray</b> <b>height,</b> atomiser gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed homogeneous structure.|$|R

Graphene is a hybridized carbon sheet with a honeycomb structure and has drawn much attention for its extraordinary characteristics such as a high mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. However {{for the purpose of this}} thesis, the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD method for producing graphitic carbon is explored further. The purpose of this research is to model and simulate the PECVD of graphitic carbon from methane gas using a plasma spray torch. In addition, the interaction of various plasma torch parameters such as <b>spray</b> <b>height,</b> gas flow rate, and electron density among other variables are explored to find their effects on the entire spray process. A Finite Element Method was used to model this setup and was implemented using COMSOL; which is a commercially available FEM modeling software. This model was setup to consist of four coupled physics: gas flow; electrostatics, drift diffusion of electrons in the plasma, and the transport to and deposition of graphene on the substrate. Experimental reaction rates and cross-sectional collision data for the simulation was taken from published literature. The results show that deposition height varies inversely proportional to the deposited carbon film height and growth rate. Furthermore, the simulations were then used to predict qualitatively, the concentrations of reactive species as well as the influence of methane gas-flow velocity and total gas pressure on the deposition rate of graphitic carbon. The main significance of this research is to show that plasma characterization and modeling are valuable tools in plasma spray design and optimization.

This article summarizes the results of a five-year study of drift from field crop sprayers using a unique integrated approach. Indirect (spray quality and wind tunnel measurements) and direct (field) drift experiments were performed, and drift models were developed to study the effect of spray application technique, droplet characteristics, buffer zones, meteorological conditions, spray liquid properties, border structures, and crop characteristics on drift from field crop sprayers. It was found that indirect drift measurements can be a valuable alternative to field drift experiments.

The balance between cooling and undesirable wetting requires careful control and placement of misting nozzles. <b>Spraying</b> from varying <b>heights</b> in an atrium showed that a single spray nozzle with Sauter mean droplet diameter of 41 microns can provide cooling of 0. 7 K without wetting. Cooling effects of mists with larger droplet diameters that cause slight wetting cannot be accurately measured due to the wet bulb effect on the sensors. Simulations suggest actual air temperatures are higher than wet sensor readings. Calculations of effective temperature ET* show that increases in humidity do not overcome the increase in thermal comfort due to the temperature reductions from fine mist...|$|R
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} experimental farms of Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station, Mashobra, situated at 2286 m {{above mean sea level}} at 31. 10 N latitude and 77. 20 E longitude north-west of Himalayas in a completely randomized block design with three replications. The response of two cultivars of Fuchsia to Cycocel (500, 1000 and 1500 ppm) and Ethrel (350, 600 and 1000 ppm) was studied with respect to growth and flowering parameters. CCC- 1000 ppm <b>spray</b> reduced the <b>height</b> of Fuchsia by 14. 8 % and increased the plant spread by 30. 8 %. CCC- 1500 ppm again advanced flowering by 16 days where as Ethrel sprays significantly delayed flowering. Ethrel 1000 ppm spray increased the number of flowers per plant by 21. 4 %. Cycocel treated plants remained in flowering over a longer duration and were having better presentability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of packing {{apparatus}} with high efficiency and uniform flow was developed to deal with wall effect and scaling effect of packed column. A desorption experiment was made in a circular cold-model experiment packed column by using air-water-CO 2 as working substance, determining the height of mass transfer unit of liquid phase of the cold-model experiment packed column under different gas-liquid loads, with and without the packing apparatus. The experimental results show that under different <b>spray</b> densities, the <b>height</b> of mass transfer unit of liquid phase of the packed column added with the packing apparatus decreased approximately above 19 % more than that not added the packing apparatus; the height of mass transfer unit of liquid phase lowers more with the decrease of the spray density, which demonstrated that the mass transfer efficiency of the packed column added with the packing apparatus was much higher than that of the column not added the packing apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{millions}} of liters of toxic liquid, {{are used to}} combat with pests and plant diseases in farms. The wide spread use of chemical pesticides causes great environmental hazards. Particles drift {{is one of the}} main problems in spraying which results in the contamination of farm lands, humans and animals. Management of particle size is regarded as the main factor in drift control. In this study, the effect of some parameters on the size of deposited particles on non-target areas was studied using statistical method. The effects of nozzle type (orifice size), spraying pressure, <b>spraying</b> boom <b>height</b> and wind speed as effective factors on drift were examined. A horizontal wind tunnel with working section of 0. 47 m wide, 0. 75 m height and 5. 5 m long was used for testing. Experiment was performed in the form of factorial split-plot based on randomized complete block design with two replications. Droplets were measured in the treatment combinations of the type of flat-fan nozzle with three orifice area (11003 - 0. 87 mm 2, 11004 - 1. 18 mm 2 and 11006 - 1. 8 mm 2), spraying pressure (150, 275 and 400 kpa), wind speed (1, 2 and 3 m s- 1) and the boom height of (0. 35, 0. 55 and 0. 75 m). Water-sensitive papers were used at intervals of 0. 8, 1. 6 and 2. 4 m from the tip of nozzles for detecting droplets size. The factors of pressure, speed and height had positive effects on the droplet size at the desired distance, but the effect of nozzle size on droplet size was negative. In the regression model the coefficients of speed was higher than the others...|$|R
40|$|A {{spray drift}} model was {{developed}} to deliver real time information to the pesticide applicator. The sprayer is equipped with sensors to deliver real time measurement of operational parameters as <b>spray</b> pressure, boom <b>height,</b> horizontal boom movements and geolocalization. The spray droplet size spectrum {{as a function of}} pressure was characterized using PDI measurements. Wind speed and direction were measured using a sprayer mounted 2 -D ultrasonic anemometer. For each successive boom position, a diffusion-advection Gaussian tilting plume model is used to compute the spray drift deposits downwind. Drift is computed independently for each droplet classes and each nozzle based on the operating parameters. Field trials were performed on a test plot in various wind conditions. The ground drift was measured for different drift distances using fluorimetry analysis. Results show that drift deposits are mainly affected by wind speed and direction what was correctly accounted for by the model. Short distance drift deposits values were overestimated by the model while long distance drift was underestimated. It appears that this most probably origins from embarked wind speed measurements and diffusion parameter. It is concluded that a treatment of embarked wind speed and diffusion measurement should be used to minimize these errors...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{concern about}} environmental effect of pesticides use {{has resulted in}} abundant research on spray drift. Spray drift modelling has been developed {{to get a better}} understanding of the parameters involved and better estimation of the off-target spray deposit. Two groups of models have received extensive a. ttention: Random-walk and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used to predict the effect of: nozzle <b>height,</b> <b>spray</b> pressure, wind speed, [...] . and were v. alidated with wind tunnels trials. Statistical models based on field trials results have been developed to estimate off-target spray deposit for different sprayers in various environmental conditions. A third group, Gaussian dispersion models, have received early attention in spray drift modelling but are not so popular, despite their international success in environmental pollution modelling. The adaptation of such a model to ground spraying is proposed. The nozzle droplet size distribution measured with a Malvern laser particle analyser is used to divide the nozzle output into several size classes. The spray deposit (or footprint) of each diameter class is computed. The summation of these footprints results in the global drift of the nozzle. The methodology is applied to derive the drift of a. flat fan nozzle located in a wind tunnel and the potential of this approach is discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{spray drift}} model called RTDrift was {{developed}} to estimate drift caused by ground sprayer machines. The sprayer was equipped with sensors measuring operational parameters namely <b>spray</b> pressure, boom <b>height</b> and movements, and geolocalization. Climatic parameters, including wind speed and direction, were measured using a 2 -D ultrasonic anemometer mounted on the sprayer. The nozzles spray drop size spectra were characterized using Phase Doppler Interferometer measurements. At every successive boom position, a diffusion-advection Gaussian tilted plume model computed the spray drift deposits for each drop class taking into account evaporation. The contribution of a single nozzle was calculated by integration of the individual puffs with respect to time and summation of the contributions of individual drops classes. The overall drift generated by the sprayer machine was obtained adding the contributions of all the nozzles. Field trials were performed on a fallow field with water and on crops with pesticides in various wind conditions. The ground drift was measured at different drift distances using fluorometric methods. When comparing {{the results of the}} model with experimental measurements of deposits, the model produced realistic maps of drift deposits. Some further improvement is needed in the presence of large scale eddies. The model offers potential benefits for the farmer as a real time drift estimator embedded on a sprayer machinePeer reviewe...|$|R
