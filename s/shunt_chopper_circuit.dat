30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} an equivalent modeling of PMSG-based WPPs considering LVRT capabilities. Taking into account the coordinated active and reactive power control strategies, the post-fault DC link voltage is calculated based on the pre-fault wind energy and the terminal voltage dip. The <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> is triggered once the calculated voltage reaches the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> threshold. When the calculated voltage is between the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> threshold and the normal value, it means the DC link voltage continuously rises without triggering the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit.</b> For the rest scenario, it signifies that the DC link voltage fluctuates around the normal value. Eventually, the PMSGs will be divided into three groups according to the range in which DC link voltage changes, and thus to establish the equivalent model of PMSG-based WPPs. Using the PowerFactory DIgSILENT software platform, we verified the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed equivalent WPP.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the {{different}} changes in DC link voltages are selected as a clustering principle, e.g., PMSGs {{are divided into}} three groups at most: Group 1) <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> conduction within the fault duration; Group 2) the DC link voltage continuously rising without reaching the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> threshold within the fault duration; Group 3) the DC link voltage fluctuating {{in the neighborhood of}} the normal value within the fault duration.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been done for {{establishing}} analytical theory and design method of a <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> that {{is a kind of}} D. C. amplifiers. 　This paper cosists of seven chapters and an appendix. 　In chapter 1, introduction, <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> are compared with conventional D. C. amplifiers in regard to every characteristics and the fields utilizing effectively <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> are clarified. The purpose and the summary of this study are described in this chapter. 　In chapter 2, is described the approximate solution of <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> which have larger time constants than chopper 2 ̆ 7 s switching period; general formulas are obtained by using the special characteristics of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltage and current, and by using the approximation of circuit impedances. The frequency response and so on are easily obtained by inserting elements of Y-matrix of <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> in to the general formulas. Characteristics of each fundamental circuit are investigated in detail and the most suitable contact ratio of choppers at which the gain of chopper amplifiers changes scarcely is obtained by using the general formulas. The error of the approximate solution is also investigated with experiments. 　In chapter 3, is first described the performance calculation for <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> comprising two <b>choppers</b> at least of which the performance can not be analysed independently. The performance calculation is obtained by using the products of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s characteristic functions and the analytical method used in chapter 2. The performance calculation is available for analysing balanced modulating <b>circuits</b> or <b>chopper</b> amplifiers with negative feedback, and coincides closely with experimental values. The differential type of a wide-band chopper amplifier is described next and is the one which broadens the freqency band width withou tmaking a switchinig frequency higher and by increasing the nurnber of a mechanical chopper. The analysis and the design method of the differential type is also given in this chapter. 　In chapter 4, is described the precice analysis of <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits.</b> The general successive formulas of <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> are obtained by the concept of T transform or modified Laplace transform and give the precice values of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltages. Initial values at each switching period is not neccesary for using the successive formulas, so the chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltages may be easily calculated by the successive formluas. The precice solution coincides with the approximate solution if the time contsants of <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits</b> are sufficiently large. The stability criterion can be obtained by the precice solution. 　In chapter 5, it is described how negative feedback has influence on the characteristics of <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits.</b> It is shown by the theory and the experiment that higher harmonics generated in the demodulating circuits of the conventional chopper amplifiers do not change and higher harmonics of the wide-band chopper amplifiers can be sufficiently decreased by negative feedback. The upper limit of negative feedback is obtained by the precice solution {{for the sake of the}} design of chopper amplifiers with negtive feedback. It is clarified that a circuit which is considered as stable in general may be unstable with specialmechanism of oscillation. The upper limit of negativefeedback of the complex circuits considered as hard to be calculated by the theory, is obtained by the experiment...|$|R
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wind power generation and power electronics, the PMSG {{has become the}} current trend based on specific characteristics, such as its gearless drive train, high LVRT capability, {{and its ability to}} decouple the generator from the grid fault. At present, the study of multiple-machine representation for PMSG-based WPPs only takes into account diversity in wind speeds (Abbes et al. 2015; Conroy and Watson 2009). Furthermore, since the speed changes in both the wind turbine and generator are negligible during the voltage dip, the simplified equivalent PMSG-based WPP models are recommended, in which the drive train, the generator and the machine side converter (MSC) are omitted (Conroy and Watson 2009; Neumann et al. 2015). Although the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> is taken into account, these simplified models with single-machine representation or multiple-machine representation cannot accurately reflect the diversity in <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> conductions within the WPP. As for DFIG-based WPPs, the traditional equivalent WPP model built based on wind speeds experiences large discrepancies due to its failure to represent the diversity in crowbar circuit conductions (Brochu et al. 2011). Similarly, the PMSGs are equipped with the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits,</b> and the diversity in <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> conductions should also be abstracted while clustering the PMSGs.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{different}} DC link voltage changes can lead to different conduction statuses of the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuits.</b> The characteristics of the <b>chopper</b> <b>circuit</b> conduction can reflect both the power loss consumed by the chopper resistor and the status of the DC capacitor energy storage. In addition, when DC link voltage rises or fluctuates within the fault duration, it represents the adjustment ability of the GSC and the active-power behavior of the PMSG. A continued rise in the DC link voltage indicates the GSC has already lost its active power control ability due to its current limit. In this case, the PMSG will maintain the maximum output active power within the fault duration, and has an active power pulse after the fault clearance. The DC link voltage fluctuating near the normal value reveals that the GSC still has its active power control ability, so the output active power will only fluctuate near its pre-fault value within the fault duration and will smoothly recover to a new steady state after the fault clearance.|$|R
