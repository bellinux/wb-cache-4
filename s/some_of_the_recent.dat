5|$|Production of {{full-length}} animated features {{was temporarily}} suspended {{after the release}} of Bambi. Given the financial failures of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market, the studio's financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production. Then in-production features such as Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Lady and the Tramp were therefore put on hold until after the war. Other issues affecting the studio at the time included the drafting of several Disney animators to fight in World War II, and the necessity for the studio to focus on producing wartime content for the U.S. Army, particularly military training, and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio's animation output was for the military. During the war, Disney produced the live-action/animated military propaganda feature Victory Through Air Power (1943), and a series of Latin culture-themed shorts resulting from the 1941 Good Neighbor trip were compiled into two features, Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944).|$|E

25|$|Historically, unions of Protestant {{churches were}} {{enforced}} by the state, usually {{in order to have}} a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern Christian ecumenism progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> major examples are the United Protestant Church of France (2013) and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in Europe and North America due to the rise of secularism, Reformed and Lutheran denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among evangelical, nondenominational and charismatic churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other.|$|E

25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} from multiple Martian missions for liquid water on Mars. There is good indirect isotope {{evidence from the}} Phoenix lander which shows that some liquid on the surface, likely to be water, has exchanged oxygen atoms with the CO2 in {{the atmosphere in the}} recent geological past. This evidence is not yet sufficient to determine whether this is due to intermittent flooding or flows, such as after geothermal or volcanic activity or meteorite impacts, or whether the liquid water is present every year, as in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> suggestions for shallow subsurface habitats. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's imaging spectrometer has discovered the presence of hydrated salts in recurrent slope lineae – dark downhill flows which darken during warm seasons and fade during cold seasons. The seasonal changes of these flows are highly indicative of shallow subsurface movement of brine.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 labour {{was getting}} too {{expensive}} in France, and Meccano subcontracted the manufacture of some models to Auto Pilen s.a. in Spain. These models had already been made in France and were sold exclusively under the marque Dinky.

Some of these tools were later sent to Auto-Pilen where they were modified or updated before; being re-issued, however {{it is not known}} if the dies were modified by Meccano or by Pilen. These models were sold in France under the marque Dinky, they were clearly identified as Dinky and as MADE IN SPAIN on the base plate. In Spain they were sold as Pilen and marked as such. Pilen models, most of which were Dinky dies, were very popular and numerous in Spain and commonly sold in El Corte Engles and Galerias Preciados department stores.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> {{excavations}} {{have discovered}} the Buddhist, Hindu and Jewish religious sites in the empire. Buddhism and Hinduism were competitors of Zoroastrianism in Bactria and Margiana, in the far easternmost territories. A very large Jewish community flourished under Sasanian rule, with thriving centers at Isfahan, Babylon and Khorasan, and with its own semiautonomous Exilarchate leadership based in Mesopotamia. Jewish communities suffered only occasional persecution. They enjoyed a relative freedom of religion, and were granted privileges denied to other religious minorities. Shapur I (Shabur Malka in Aramaic) was a particular friend to the Jews. His friendship with Shmuel produced many advantages for the Jewish community. He even offered the Jews in the Sasanian empire a fine white Nisaean horse, {{just in case the}} Messiah, who was thought to ride a donkey or a mule, would come. Shapur II, whose mother was Jewish, had a similar friendship with a Babylonian rabbi named Rabbah. Raba's friendship with Shapur II enabled him to secure a relaxation of the oppressive laws enacted against the Jews in the Persian Empire. Moreover, in the eastern portion of the empire, various Buddhist places of worship, notably in Bamiyan were active as Buddhism gradually became more popular in that region.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{the year}} before the {{publication}} of Hutton's Triumph of the Moon, the American Wiccan Donald H. Frew (1960–) published an article entitled [...] "Methodological Flaws in Recent Studies of Historical and Modern Witchcraft" [...] in the Canadian journal Ethnologies in which he criticised the study of Wiccan history up till that point, including Hutton's Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles. Arguing that the [...] "most basic flaw in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> studies of Witchcraft is the systematic altering of source texts to support the author's arguments", Frew accused the American Wiccan Aidan Kelly, author of Crafting the Art of Magic, of being particularly guilty of this. He furthermore went on to criticise the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson of misrepresenting the work of Margaret Murray, arguing that she had made Murray appear more [...] "dogmatic and absolute" [...] than she actually was. Moving on, Frew accuses Hutton of the same, believing that in Pagan Religions he used a [...] "belittling" [...] tone to discuss Murray's work. Hutton responded to Frew in an article published in the journal Folklore in 2000. Entitled [...] "Paganism and Polemic: The Debate over the Origins of Modern Pagan Witchcraft", in the paper Hutton commented that Frew's work had been a [...] "historiographical landmark", being [...] "only the second contribution to one of the key scholarly debates in the history of contemporary religions".|$|E

60|$|The entire circus was {{altogether}} Italian, {{with the}} exception of the clowns, who, to the credit of our nation, are always Americans, or advertised as such, in Italy. Its chief and almost absorbing event was a reproduction of the tournament which had then lately been held at Rome in celebration of Prince Tommaso's coming of age, and for a copy of a copy it was really fine. It had fitness in the arena, which must have witnessed many such mediaeval shows in their time, and I am sensible still of the pleasure its effects of color gave me. There was one beautiful woman, a red blonde in a green velvet gown, who might have ridden, as she was, out of a canvas of Titian's, if he had ever painted equestrian pictures, and who at any rate was an excellent Carpaccio. Then, the 'Clowns Americani' were very amusing, from a platform devoted solely to them, and it was a source of pride if not of joy with me to think that we were almost the only people present who understood their jokes. In the vast oval of the arena, however, the circus ring looked very little, not half so large, say, as the rim of a lady's hat in front of you at the play; and on the gradines of the ancient amphitheatre we were all such a great way off that a good field-glass would have been needed to distinguish the features of the actors. I could not make out, therefore, whether the 'Clowns Americani' had the national expression or not, but one of them, I am sorry to say, spoke the United States language with a cockney accent. I suspect that he was an Englishman who had passed himself off upon the Italian management as a true Yankee, and who had formed himself upon our school of clowning, just as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> English humorists have patterned after certain famous wits of ours. I do not know that I would have exposed this impostor, even if occasion had offered, for, after all, his fraud was a tribute to our own primacy in clowning, and the Veronese were none the worse for his erring aspirates.|$|E
