25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} concrete girders was not built {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. Remedial work had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was <b>sand-blasted</b> and repainted.|$|E

She underwent a 14-month refit that sought to restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers <b>sand-blasted</b> paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs. (A new pinewood deck would be installed in Green's Bayou.) In total, more than [...] of steel (amounting to about 15% of the ship's hull) was replaced and more than 40,000 rivets were seal-welded on the underwater hull.|$|E

2500|$|The 1982 {{recession}} in Mexico weakened {{the economy and}} hit the automotive market and industry, with VAM being no exception. The dire situation, coupled with a government decree banning the importation of automotive accessories took its toll in both standard and optional equipment of all car lines and marques sold in Mexico. All high-trim Americans for 1982 were no longer available with power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, tilt steering column, quartz digital clock, and rear defroster. Items that were standard for 1981 such as the remote controls for the door mirrors, the intermittent wipers, the reading dome light, and vanity mirror were put on the option list. The rest of the equipment was virtually unchanged from 1981. Despite this, {{there was a new}} optional accessory for the year, an AM/FM/stereo tape player radio. All three high-trim editions featured a new VAM-designed luxurious grille with a rectangular pattern, while the three base models used AMC's square-pattern design borrowed from U.S. market Eagle models. The GFS, ECD and DL models also got a set of plain VAM-designed bumper end caps with a chrome molding on the top side edge. Along with these, AMC's Eagle nerfing strip design was also used in both bumpers. The headlight bezels changed to blacked out units in their internal sections keeping the chromed surrounding areas. All-new aluminum road wheels also replaced the previously-imported Noryl wheel covers. A unique version of the year was the American ECD, which featured a lengthened and squared rear roofline with smaller and more rectangular C-pillar windows that had a small [...] "ECD" [...] <b>sand-blasted</b> logo. Other changes were black rear side window surrounds for the American DL wagon that were originally created by AMC for the Eagle models, while the American GFS had plain side window panels. Both versions of the three base models were the same as in 1981 except for the grille design, new door panels, and the absence of the quartz clock in the automatic cars.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we put the}} {{emphasis}} on the reclaiming high purity silicon materials from waste electronic grade silicon chips which is collected from semiconductor industry, so as to meet the demand of solar grade silicon materials to a certain extent. We adopted sand blasting and acid etching in the recovering process of waste silicon chips. On the experiment we removed the impurity layers {{on the surface of the}} waster silicon chips and reclaimed the high purity silicon chips by <b>sand-blasting</b> method. In addition, the admixture of HF 、HNO 3 and CH 3 COOH was used to etch the metal-intermingled layers on the surface of the waster silicon chips so that high purity silicon chips were reclaimed. We can identify that the two methods of <b>sand-blasting</b> and acid etching would be available in reclaiming high purity silicon materials from waste electronic grade silicon chips. <b>Sand-blasting</b> is suitable to reclaim silicon chips with large size, and acid-etching is suitable to reclaim silicon chips with small size or silicon grains. Of course, we can use the two methods together to reclaim high purity silicon materials with high efficiency and low cost. 本篇论文针对当前半导体行业留下来的废弃电子级硅芯片进行回收处理，以期有效去除废弃硅芯片表面的金属掺杂层，回收高纯硅料，从而补充供不应求的太阳能级硅料。 在处理过程中，主要采用喷砂和化学腐蚀两种方法。喷砂是利用喷枪将白刚玉均匀地喷到硅片表面，以除去表面金属杂质层，从而回收高纯硅料。化学腐蚀法是利用混合酸溶液将废弃硅芯片表面的金属杂质层腐蚀干净，从而获得纯度较高的硅片。实验证明，通过喷砂和化学腐蚀两种回收处理废弃电子硅芯片的方法都是切实可行的。机械喷砂适宜于样品尺寸比较大的硅片，对于样品尺寸比较小的碎片或者颗粒则适宜于采用化学腐蚀法。为了有效地回收高纯硅材料，可以将两种方法综合加以利用...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effect of {{substrate}} nano/micro-structure design on the grain size, mechanical properties and surface wettability of nanostructured radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputter-deposited silver-containing hydroxyapatite (Ag-HA) coatings containing 0. 13 - 0. 36. wt. % silver. The {{results of this study}} revealed that the Ag-HA coating microstructure could be designed by controlling the pre-treated surface topography of titanium. The nano/micro-patterned surfaces of titanium were prepared by <b>sand-blasting</b> followed by acid-etching. The size of the nano-patterns on the surface of titanium was also affected by the <b>sand-blasting</b> procedure; namely, the lower the pressure was, the larger the size of the nano-structures and the distance between them. The effect of the coating grain size on the surface wettability and physico-mechanical properties of the biocomposites was revealed. The hydrophobic properties were imparted to the rough titanium by a nanostructured Ag-HA coating. Although according to the XRD patterns the coatings were mainly composed of HA, some differences in the morphology were observed. Therefore, the decreased wettability of the Ag-HA coatings could be explained by taking into account the different grain sizes of the films rather than the changes to the surface chemistry. Nanoindentation studies revealed {{that in the case of}} the Ag-HA-coated samples, smaller grains resulted in significantly higher nanohardness and Young's modulus...|$|R
