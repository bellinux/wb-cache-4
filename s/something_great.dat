25|$|On 2 March 1880, on his {{way from}} London to Switzerland, Gordon had visited King Leopold II of Belgium in Brussels and was invited {{to take charge of}} the Congo Free State. Leopold tried very hard to {{convince}} Gordon to enter his service, not least because Gordon was known to be modest in his salary demands, unlike Leopold's current agent in the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley, who received a monthly salary of 300,000 Belgian francs. Gordon rejected Leopold's offers, partly because he was still emotionally attached to the Sudan and partly because he disliked the idea of working for Leopold's Congo Association, which was a private company owned by the King. In April, the government of the Cape Colony offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces, which Gordon declined. A deeply depressed Gordon wrote in his letter declining the offer that he knew, for reasons that he refused to explain, that he had only ten years left to live, and he wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>great</b> and grand in his last ten years.|$|E

500|$|While in negotiations, Douglas' staff {{approached}} the show's producers about a guest spot for Douglas and the sitcom's executives sought {{to work against}} Douglas' image. His management team wanted him to stretch beyond his usual roles, and believed a successful comedy show like Will & Grace {{would be a good}} way to do so. The show's producers said that Douglas was willing to go with any story line the writers could come up with. Executive producer and co-creator of the show, David Kohan said: [...] "There's <b>something</b> <b>great</b> about playing on a person's iconic status. [...] Michael Douglas often plays these virile men, and the idea of making him a gay cop too shy to ask Will out was funny." ...|$|E

World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing <b>something</b> <b>great</b> for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{was born}} in Athens around 524BC, the son of Neocles, who was, {{in the words of}} Plutarch [...] "no very {{conspicuous}} man". His mother is more obscure; according to Plutarch, she was either a Thracian woman called Abrotonon, or Euterpe, a Carian from Halicarnassus. Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father. Plutarch considers this to be false. Plutarch indicates that, on account of his mother's background, Themistocles was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of Athens, Cynosarges, outside the city walls. However, in an early example of his cunning, Themistocles persuaded [...] "well-born" [...] children to exercise with him in Cynosarges, thus breaking down the distinction between [...] "alien and legitimate". Plutarch further reports that Themistocles was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life. His teacher is said to have told him: [...] "My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, but definitely <b>something</b> <b>great,</b> either for good or evil." ...|$|E

500|$|Short films {{released}} by Wong Fu Productions have received, cumulatively, millions of views, {{and the group}} has several thousand fans. According to Wang, the group's website received 5,000 daily hits in 2009. He expected the audience size to grow [...] "as online video becomes {{part of everyday life}} for the up-and-coming generation of movie-watchers" [...] but believed that movie theaters will not become obsolete. University of Southern California digital media expert David Wertheimer also believed that [...] "Wong Fu's use of new media to tell their community stories and build a business is the wave of the future." [...] The group's success has allowed for growth in the popularity of Asian American comedians who promote themselves primarily through YouTube, such as Kevin Wu (KevJumba), Ryan Higa (Nigahiga), Christine Gambito (HappySlip), and David Choi. Although grateful for the group's success and popularity, Wang said, [...] "Some people who go to film school, they'll make <b>something</b> <b>great</b> but it's only seen by like, two hundred people [...] It's kind of not fair." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Prism started when Perry was embarking on the California Dreams Tour. She {{began with a}} process she deemed [...] "slow cooking", which consisted of recording random [...] "fragments of ideas" [...] into her mobile phone's dictaphone application. A member of Direct Management Group, Ngoc Hoang, then transcribed the audio files, which he inserted into what Perry described as a [...] "treasure chest"; such object was consulted by Perry later on during the album's recording sessions. While Perry started recording the album officially in November 2012, accompanied by Greg Wells and Greg Kurstin, she noted {{she was still in}} a [...] "dark place", and that she had not [...] "let the light in". The sessions began again in March 2013, following a trip to Madagascar which Perry credited as having [...] "put [...] priorities in perspective", thus leading her to [...] "do more work on self". Perry also viewed a video made by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses loss. She commented: [...] "When you lose something, all your foundations crumble—but that also leaves a big hole that's open for <b>something</b> <b>great</b> to come through." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do <b>something</b> <b>great,</b> but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E

That's <b>something</b> <b>great</b> from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|By April 2010, Joss Whedon {{was close}} to {{completing}} a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing <b>something</b> <b>great,</b> as we think Joss is." [...] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how [...] "these people shouldn't {{be in the same room}} let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".|$|E
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. Go in there and sing it. Go in there and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write <b>something</b> <b>great</b> right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your first instinct is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E

Younge and Muhammad composed the score as if they were creating 13 albums, one for each episode, with the music inspired by Wu-Tang Clan, Ennio Morricone, and Muhammad's group A Tribe Called Quest. Muhammad felt that the music was [...] "about getting that hip-hop foundation and making sure those drums were as big as day", while Younge said, [...] "we wanted to make <b>something</b> <b>great.</b> Not just for black people or minorities, just <b>something</b> <b>great</b> that just happens to be based on our culture."
