40|$|Many {{different}} types of surface mining equipment use enclosed cabs to protect equipment operators from health and safety hazards. The overburden removal and mining process can be extremely dusty and can cause excessive dust exposure. To study this issue, a cooperative research effort was established between the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U. S. Silica Co., Clean Air Filter Co., and Red Dot Corp. {{in an effort to}} lower respirable dust levels in an enclosed cab on an older <b>surface</b> <b>drill</b> at a silica sand operation.

An average cab efficiency of 93. 4 % was determined with gravimetric sampling instruments when comparing the outside with the inside cab dust levels on the final design. Although this study considered just one operation, the goal was to identify cost-effective improvements that could be implemented on all types of enclosed cabs to lower respirable dust concentrations. Two critical components for an effective enclosed cab system are having a properly designed, installed, and maintained filtration and pressurization system, along with a method for maintaining structural cab integrity, which allows the cab to be positively pressurized. Another important component is maintaining cab cleanliness.

The work on which this paper is based included an extensive literature study, as well as field investigations on a surface mine in Namibia. A number of additional dust suppression interventions were identified. These improvements, listed below, will assist in reducing dust concentrations around the drill rigs: • Increase maintenance frequency on the shroud, sealing ring, suction pipes and filters of the drill rigs, • Design and install new overlapping rubber belts on the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an air-blocking shelf on the inside perimeter of the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an airflow meter to ensure that the QC: QB ratio never drops below 3 : 1, • Only allow wet drilling, • Flush the dust collector system more regularly with compressed air to ensure that it does not become blocked, • Introduce stricter supervision to ensure that the suction pipes are always connected to the shroud, • Give drill rig operators more advanced training to ensure more effective drilling in order to reduce dust levels.

40|$|NASA s {{plans for}} a lunar outpost require {{extensive}} excavation. The Lunar Surface Systems Project Office projects that {{thousands of tons of}} lunar soil will need to be moved. Conventional excavators dig through soil by brute force, and depend upon their substantial weight to react to the forces generated. This approach will not be feasible on the Moon for two reasons: (1) gravity is 1 / 6 th that on Earth, which means that a kg on the Moon will supply 1 / 6 the down force that it does on Earth, and (2) transportation costs (at the time of this reporting) of $ 50 K to $ 100 K per kg make massive excavators economically unattractive. A percussive excavation system was developed for use in vacuum or nearvacuum environments. It reduces the down force needed for excavation by an order of magnitude by using percussion to assist in soil penetration and digging. The novelty of this excavator is that it incorporates a percussive mechanism suited to sustained operation in a vacuum environment. A percussive digger breadboard was designed, built, and successfully tested under both ambient and vacuum conditions. The breadboard was run in vacuum to more than 2 [...] times the lifetime of the Apollo Lunar <b>Surface</b> <b>Drill,</b> throughout which the mechanism performed and held up well. The percussive digger was demonstrated to reduce the force necessary for digging in lunar soil simulant by an order of magnitude, providing reductions as high as 45 : 1.

At transportation costs of $ 50 K to $ 100 K per kg, reducing digging forces by an order of magnitude translates into billions of dollars saved by not launching heavier systems to accomplish excavation tasks necessary to the establishment of a lunar outpost.

To stay in the top segment it is of great importance to have a well functioning development strategy as well as rig functions that makes the work as easy as possible for the operator. In this master thesis one development strategy has been evaluated and a dub tip control has been developed from idea to test on rig.   Today the conventional method to position the drill is to use two joysticks with three axes each where each axis corresponds to one hydraulic actuator on the boom and feeder structure. The dub tip control system enables the operator to position the drill in Cartesian coordinates with only one 3 -axes joystick. After the definition of the desired drill angle is done, the control system makes sure that this angle is obtained throughout the positioning motion. This system makes it considerably easier for an inexperienced operator to position the drill.   For development, simulation and verification of the control algorithms and regulators Matlab/Simulink has been used. To test the control system on rig, a configuration with LabVIEW together with a compactDAQ has been evaluated. LabVIEW is chosen because it provides the opportunity to create a user friendly graphical user interface. To use this configuration is however not recommended for persons with little or none experience from using LabVIEW.   This development strategy can be used for tests and verifications of control algorithms, but since neither Windows nor the compactDAQ are real time systems, there are solutions that are better but of course to a higher price.   The master thesis work has shown that it is possible to implement a dub tip control on a rig of this dimension.

40|$|Objective: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in {{partnership}} with stakeholders in the mining and surface drilling industries, conducted research to develop engineering control technologies that reduce workplace noise exposure. The result of this research partnership {{is the development of}} a partial cab. Background: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) continues to be an occupational health problem in the U. S. mining industry. Hearing loss data suggest that by age 50, nearly 90 % of coal miners have a hearing impairment. This compares to 10 % for a general population of nonexposed males. Previous studies showed that operators of noncab <b>surface</b> <b>drill</b> rigs are overexposed to noise. These rigs are used in various surface drilling industries, including mining and construction. Many surface rigs do not have full cabs {{as a result of the}} original equipment manufacturer design or the prohibitive cost of aftermarket products. Approach: Engineering controls are the most desirable among the hierarchy of controls to lower noise exposure and prevent NIHL. NIOSH researchers determined that a noise control to protect the operator at the rig's control panel would be effective based on the organization of work practices and typical worker behaviors. As a result, researchers developed the partial cab. This engineering control design addressed stakeholders' needs associated with cost, transport, and worker usage. Field tests found the partial cab effective in reducing noise exposure at the rig's control panel, a typical location for a drill rig operator. In one case, sound levels at the control panel were reduced from 104 to 96 dB(A). Coupled with continued use of personal protective equipment such as hearing protection devices, the partial cab can help reduce noise exposures below the NIOSH recommended exposure limit (85 dB(A)) during a typical workday. Partial Cab Communication Suite: A communication suite (DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2007 - 147 c) was assembled with multiple information components to help surface drilling operators understand the benefit of this noise control technology, as well as how to construct the partial cab. The suite is packaged on a CD to be viewed on a standard computer and includes video, graphic, and instructive components. For example, a viewer of the CD can watch a video that highlights the benefits of the partial cab in real work scenarios, view CAD drawings of the partial cab design, and then print out information on construction materials and design details. The CD also provides background information on NIHL and hearing protection devices to increase knowledge about this occupational health concern. This information can be coupled with an accompanying training checklist to help promote the partial cab's importance to workers using the technology.

40|$|The Valle Grande Paleo-lake in {{the southeastern}} portion of Valles Caldera, NM, U. S. A. {{provides}} a useful location to study short distance source-to-sink variation in geochemistry and mineralogy. In this study, lithium is the primary focus {{in order to test}} its effectiveness at recording past environmental change. This is possible due to the ~ 75 m of lake sediment that has been drilled and cored in this region and the extensive paleo-climate work that has been completed with this material; this has provided a strong understanding of past environmental change throughout the lifespan of the lake. Chemical and mineralogical analyses were conducted in the lake sediment and from source rock material surrounding Valle Grande to understand such changes during the weathering, erosion, and deposition of this material. Finally, as this is a depositional basin dominated by a single type of igneous rock in an arid region, it provides a useful analog to Martian lacustrine settings, such as Gale Crater which also is characterized by a closed depositional basin dominated by an igneous rock type, basalt rather than rhyolite. In the drill core lithium was minimally enriched in the interglacial sediment compared to the glacial; in addition, the trend for lithium with depth was somewhat similar to established climate proxies. However, these changes were not as distinct as the trends seen with the other proxies and the mean values for the two periods investigated were within one standard deviation of each other. 	The ChemCam instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory rover analyzed the rock <b>surface,</b> <b>drill</b> hole walls, tailings, and unprocessed and sieved dump piles to investigate chemical variations with depth in the first two Martian drill holes and possible fractionation or segregation effects of the drilling and sample processing. The drill sites are both in Sheepbed Mudstone, the lowest exposed member of the Yellowknife Bay formation. Yellowknife Bay is composed of detrital basaltic materials in addition to clay minerals and an amorphous component. The drill tailings are a mixture of basaltic sediments and diagenetic material, such as calcium sulfate veins, while the shots on the drill site surface and walls of the drill holes are closer to those pure end members. The sediment dumped from the Sample Acquisition, Processing, and Handling Subsystem is of similar composition to the tailings; however, due to the specifics of the drilling process, the tailings and dump piles come from different depths within the hole. This allows the ChemCam instrument to analyze samples representing the bulk composition from different depths. On the pre-drill surfaces, the Cumberland site has a greater amount of CaO and evidence for calcium sulfate veins, than the John Klein site. However, John Klein has a greater amount of calcium sulfate veins below the surface, as seen in mapping, drill hole wall analysis, and observations in the drill tailings and dump pile. In addition, the Cumberland site does not have any evidence of variations in bulk composition with depth down the drill hole, while the John Klein site has evidence for a greater amount of CaO (calcium sulfates) in the top portion of the hole compared to the middle section of the hole, where the drill sample was collected.
