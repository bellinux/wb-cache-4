5|$|Husband (Rowland): <b>Surely</b> no, unless thou wert a bird.|$|E
5|$|Or rats {{will most}} <b>surely</b> devour us all.|$|E
5|$|Akhtab {{eventually}} {{managed to}} enter and persuade them that the Muslims would <b>surely</b> be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses {{as far as the}} eye could see, swung the Qurayza opinion in the favour of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|And {{in those}} days of {{darkness}} and disaster, which, as they come to all nations, will <b>surely</b> again come to us, he will tell us of another Jeremiah Meacham, of more Jeremiah Ballards, of another Benjamin Haskell, of another William Stacy...|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations {{have occurred in the}} Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost <b>surely</b> responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E
5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them. The Bendix Corporation issued denials, {{stating that the}} units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, and insisted that had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have <b>surely</b> been detected and the unit replaced.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would <b>surely</b> harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but someone else would <b>surely</b> have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books <b>Surely</b> You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, Barrett {{instructed}} Colonel David Branson of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry {{to attack}} the Confederate encampment at Brazos Santiago Depot near Fort Brown. Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown {{with the intention of}} reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces thinking they would not encounter any problems, assuming all the Confederates <b>surely</b> had heard of Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise they encountered Confederates that did not know of Lee's surrender.|$|E
5|$|We, the people, declare {{today that}} the most evident of truths—that {{all of us are}} created equal—is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall.... Our journey is not {{complete}} until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then <b>surely</b> the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.|$|E
25|$|By definition, we {{conclude}} that g(Xn) converges to g(X) almost <b>surely.</b>|$|E
25|$|For an ergodic transformation, {{the time}} average equals the space average almost <b>surely.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bifrenaria verboonenii {{placement}} is {{not well}} defined so far, yet <b>surely</b> among the large species.|$|E
25|$|The word mitrailleuse is <b>surely</b> {{the source}} for the modern Italian term: Mitragliatrice, {{describing}} a machine gun, as well.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2007, Florida Marlins team {{president}} David Samson was {{featured on the}} show as he often is. When told by Dan about the report of Seattle Mariners player Ichiro Suzuki signing a 5-year, $100 million contract, Samson {{was in a state}} of disbelief. He went on to say that no player in baseball was worthy of that amount and that this deal would <b>surely</b> return the league to the days of ridiculous contracts, <b>surely</b> ruining the sport.|$|E
25|$|As for him {{who gives}} and is godfearing and {{confirms}} the reward most fair, We shall <b>surely</b> ease {{him to the}} Easing. {92:5–7}.|$|E
25|$|The boldness of this {{speculation}} is <b>surely</b> unexcelled {{in the history}} of thought. Up to the present, however, it presents the appearance of an Icarian flight.|$|E
25|$|A 3rd Arkansas Regiment, 30-Day Volunteers (cavalry), almost <b>surely</b> never {{completely}} organized—only the rosters of two mounted companies, under Captains Reves and Hooker, have survived.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{construction}} of Fapla Cricket Ground {{is estimated at}} around 1 crore but when it completed will give back a lot more. It will <b>surely</b> give Dhanghadi better chances at National Tournament. Also with better infrastructures Nepal will rise higher in ICC’s Cricket development ranking. Fapla cricket ground will likely be completed in few days.Construction of a ground {{is a big deal}} in itself but what important once the construction is completed is its maintenance-if that is ensured Fapla will <b>surely</b> be a faith changer for Nepal cricket.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{appointed}} Northrop a {{brigadier general}} on November 26, 1864, {{but he did}} not risk sending the appointment to the Confederate Senate, where it would <b>surely</b> have been rejected.|$|E
25|$|And the {{man that}} committeth {{adultery}} with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall <b>surely</b> be put to death.|$|E
25|$|And {{even if the}} {{probabilistic}} reasoning were rigorous, this would still imply only that the conjecture is almost <b>surely</b> true for any given integer, which does not necessarily imply that it is true for all integers.|$|E
25|$|Before the 10th century, {{there are}} no traces of {{occupation}} of the site on which the city is now built. Perhaps {{there were a few}} hovels or a modest hunting lodge, but <b>surely</b> nothing more important.|$|E
25|$|Most {{traditional}} songs involving {{tragic death}} are included among the Child ballads. The absence of this song from that list has puzzled several commentators, since Francis Child must <b>surely</b> {{have known about}} the song.|$|E
25|$|Cassius Dio, in a fragmentary notice, {{mentions}} {{trouble in}} Egypt which was suppressed by a tribune of the Praetorian Guard. <b>Surely,</b> {{this man was}} part of Gaius' entourage, {{but other than that}} nothing is known of him.|$|E
25|$|Every {{positive}} number x is {{the product}} of two normal numbers. For instance if y is chosen uniformly at random from the interval (0,1) then almost <b>surely</b> y and x/y are both normal, and their product is x.|$|E
25|$|Ezekiel 18:17—that hath {{withdrawn}} {{his hand}} from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed Mine ordinances, hath walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall <b>surely</b> live.|$|E
25|$|By the 10th {{century the}} Byzantine Era {{is found in}} the Novellas of AD 947, 962, 964, and most <b>surely</b> of the year AD 988, all dated in this way, as well as the Act of Patriarch Nicholaos II Chrysobergos in AD 987.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspect was}} already forgiven and {{freed from the}} jail after the father of Dan Campilan said that if Dan was alive, <b>surely,</b> Dan will forgive him. The family of Dan will not file a case to the suspect anymore.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to generating hypothetical objects to explain phenomena, {{the interpretation of}} reality by our thought also bestows a derivative reality on the abstractions with which thought works. If they are the instruments wherewith thought accomplishes such effects upon reality, they must <b>surely</b> be themselves real.|$|E
25|$|At {{some unknown}} time, Wetzlar was granted market rights, and thereby, {{the right to}} levy market dues. Within a year, a market {{community}} came into being. The monastery's forerunners were <b>surely</b> part of the crystallization point at which believers, traders and craftsmen met, above all on holidays.|$|E
25|$|Sixes and fours are automatic, {{there is}} no need to run if they deem the ball will <b>surely</b> touch or go past the {{boundary}} rope. If the batsmen decide to run, they will be cancelled off, and four/six runs will be added to the score.|$|E
25|$|Slowly but <b>surely,</b> the Portuguese secured {{most of the}} carracks, half-blinded by the smoke. Hussain's {{flagship}} was overpowered {{and many}} began jumping ship. The galleys were dominated, and the shallow caravels positioned themselves between the ships and the coast, cutting down any who attempted to swim ashore.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch {{very likely}} was {{influenced}} by Dante's Divine Comedy for his Africa. Dante's prestigious work was well known and <b>surely</b> a challenge to him. Dante's remarks of praise of medieval heroes in his Comedia, Convivio, Espitole and De monarchia also had an influence on Petrarch.|$|E
25|$|Especially in {{the field}} of soloistic {{improvisation}} (taqsīm) over the common scales (maqām) in Arabian music, his colleagues considered him to be an unsurpassed master. It <b>surely</b> attributes to Bashir's pioneering work, that nowadays oud-players are able to give solo-concerts all over the world.|$|E
