40|$|In {{this paper}} we present UAuth, a two-layer {{authentication}} framework that provides more security assurances than two-factor authentication while offering a <b>simpler</b> <b>authentication</b> experience. When authenticating, users first verified their static credentials (such as password, fingerprint, etc.) on their devices {{to achieve the}} local-layer authentication, then submit the OTP-signed response generated by their device to the server to complete the server-layer authentication. We also propose the three-level account association mechanism, which establishes the association among devices, users and services, and then creates a mapping from user’s devices to user’s accounts. Users can gain access to different service via any device in the association easily. Our goal {{is to provide a}} quick and convenient SSO-like login process on the basis of security authentication.

40|$|Mobile {{devices have}} long been {{considered}} useful in bootstrapping authentication via other channels, including the web. As mobile devices begin to include complete web browsers, {{there is an opportunity}} to standardize a <b>simple,</b> web-based mobile <b>authentication</b> technique, both for devices themselves and for desktop access using the mobile device as a secondary channel. The path to better authentication will require a standard JavaScript browser API that web sites can easily trigger to achieve <b>simple,</b> secure <b>authentication.</b> The Need: Easy, Secure Authentication. Authentication on the web is overwhelmingly achieved with passwords, even though it is common knowledge that passwords are woefully insufficient because of phishing [3]. Even discounting the security threat, keeping track of dozens of passwords is particularly inconvenient: users are so averse to new site registration that startup investors and web designers often recommend some level of “account-less ” operation to lower the barrier to first use. Two major solutions have been proposed.

40|$|Due {{to their}} massive user base and request load, {{large-scale}} Internet applications have mainly focused on goals such as performance and scalability. As a result, {{many of these}} applications rely on weaker but more efficient and <b>simpler</b> <b>authentication</b> mechanisms. However, as recent incidents have demonstrated, powerful adversaries are exploiting the weaknesses in such mechanisms. While more robust authentication mechanisms exist, most of them fail to address the scale and security needs of these large-scale systems. In this dissertation we demonstrate that by {{taking into account the}} specific requirements and threat model of large-scale Internet applications, we can design authentication protocols for such applications that are not only more robust but also have low impact on performance, scalability and existing infrastructure. In particular, we show that there is no inherent conflict between stronger authentication and other system goals. For this purpose, we have designed, implemented and experimentally evaluated three robust authentication protocols: Proxychain, for SIP-based VoIP authentication; One-Time Cookies (OTC), for Web session authentication; and Direct Validation of SSL/TLS Certificates (DVCert), for server-side SSL/TLS authentication. These protocols not only offer better security guarantees, but they also have low performance overheads and do not require additional infrastructure. In so doing, we provide robust and practical authentication mechanisms that can improve the overall security of large-scale VoIP and Web applications.

50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>Authentication</b> and Security Layer (SASL) is a {{framework}} for authentication and data security in Internet protocols. It decouples authentication mechanisms from application protocols, in theory allowing any authentication mechanism supported by SASL {{to be used in}} any application protocol that uses SASL. Authentication mechanisms can also support proxy authorization, a facility allowing one user to assume the identity of another. They can also provide a data security layer offering data integrity and data confidentiality services. DIGEST-MD5 provides an example of mechanisms which can provide a data-security layer. Application protocols that support SASL typically also support Transport Layer Security (TLS) to complement the services offered by SASL.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 2, {{the security of}} the CardSpace identity metasystem relies on the authentication of the user by the IdP. In a case where a single IdP and multiple RPs are involved in a single working session, which we expect to be a typical scenario, {{the security of the}} identity metasystem within that working session will rely on a single layer of authentication, that is, the authentication of the user to the IdP. This user authentication can be achieved {{in a variety of ways}} (e.g., using an X. 509 certificate, Kerberos v 5 ticket, self-issued token or password); however, it seems likely that, in the majority of cases, a <b>simple</b> username/password <b>authentication</b> technique will be used.|$|R

50|$|Hand Geometry Authentication - Hand {{geometry}} techniques exploit {{hand shape}} characteristics, such as finger length and width. This leads to quite {{a small amount}} of data (about 9 bytes), thus restricting their application to <b>simple</b> <b>authentication</b> purposes only. Also, their behaviour related to the fulfilment of the above properties is moderate. The iris, the circular coloured membrane surrounding the pupil of the eye, is a unique structure consisting of specific characteristics such as striations, furrows, rings, crypts, filaments, and corona. Iris patterns are characterised by very high distinctiveness, even twins have different ones. The probability that two individuals have the same iris pattern is about 10^sup -52^. The probability that two distinct iris patterns result to the same iris-code used (about 256 bytes) by a biometric system is negligible (about 10^sup -78^), thus allowing almost perfect matching accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{very nature}} of web applications- their ability to collate, process and {{disseminate}} information over the Internet- exposes them in two ways. First and most obviously, they have total exposure by nature of being publicly accessible. Second, they process data elements from within HTTP requests- a protocol that can employ a myriad of encoding and encapsulation techniques. Any service available on the Internet requires <b>authentication.</b> <b>Simple,</b> one factor <b>authentication</b> schemes are vulnerable to hacking and require lot of discipline among authorized users- {{in the form of}} complying with strong password, One Time Password and password salt. The challenges start from making the authentication setup of the network services as secure and as simple as possible. In order to overcome this problem, we will develop a portal and authentication setup {{to address the problem of}} the directly making the authentication setup and the web services of the organization accessible from the internet.
