6000|$|... "Oh dear, Mr. Dunn, {{it is very}} pretty; quite a {{beautiful}} picture. I cannot let Susan rob you of that. You must keep that for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> particular friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me quite as important, Mr. Twing," [...] she said drily, [...] "that you should first learn <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> duties, which I came here early to teach you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm a reporter--same thing," [...] {{the young}} man answered. [...] "Perhaps you've got <b>some</b> {{troubles}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> here in <b>your</b> shops?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't agreed until I {{understand}} {{you a little}} better," [...] she quietly replied. [...] "I fancy you have <b>some</b> object <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> in view." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you say a}} word more," [...] I answered, [...] "I shall {{think you}} have <b>some</b> reason <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> for wishing to go to England by yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘No!’ cried I. ‘And who proposes it? I am as {{curious as}} yourself, {{but let us}} rather send for the police; or, if your {{highness}} dreads a scandal, for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> servants.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I answer that? Probably through <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> family. It {{has made}} its way through Lady Kingsbury to Castle Hautboy, and has then been talked about. I am not {{responsible}} for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] cried I. [...] "And who proposes it? I am as {{curious as}} yourself, {{but let us}} rather send for the police; or, if your {{highness}} dreads a scandal, for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me see," [...] Katharine said, [...] "one puts {{hot water}} into the cups first, doesn't one? You have <b>some</b> dodge <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> haven't you, William, about making tea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It gave poor Strether in truth--uneasy as it {{made him}} too--something of the thrill of a bold {{perception}} justified. [...] "Well," [...] he answered kindly enough, [...] "I was sure a moment since that <b>some</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> had come to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Booth asks me, Why {{do you not}} propose <b>some</b> plan <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own?</b> Really, that is {{no answer}} to my {{argument}} that his treatment will make the patient very much worse. [Note added in Social Diseases and Worse Remedies, January, 1891.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Neither does Miss Nickleby {{look the}} worse,' said Sir Mulberry, bending his bold gaze upon her. 'She was always handsome, but upon my soul, ma'am, {{you seem to}} have {{imparted}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> good looks to her besides.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jewellery {{belonging}} to the jongejuffrouw," [...] he said dryly, [...] "which this rogue hath stolen from her. Will you take charge of them, Nicolaes? And here," [...] he added, counting out {{a few pieces of}} gold and silver, [...] "is <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady! How do {{you know}} it was a lady? Just like a woman making up a romance out of nothing. Yes, there's the delusion, which is bad. Keep his mind off it as much as possible, and tell him <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> in your best brogue. I'll come and examine him to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should tell}} you,' replied Ralph, looking coldly down upon him, 'that for <b>some</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> you told a lie, {{and that it}} wasn't {{the first time and}} wouldn't be the last; that I wasn't {{surprised}} and wasn't to be taken in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 16 In the Dedication to The Tale of a Tub Swift had {{addressed}} Somers in {{very different}} terms: [...] "There is no virtue, either in public or private life, which <b>some</b> circumstances <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> have not often produced upon {{the stage of the}} world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you; but it's getting late, and I {{ought to}} be getting on, if I knew the way. Perhaps you've got <b>some</b> girls <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> so you can {{understand}} how scared I am to be lost at night and in such a strange place as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{certainly}} not so fastidious in my notions {{of birth and}} station as aunt de Lacey," [...] she said, laughing; [...] "but I should forget <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> instructions, dear Mrs Wyllys, did I not feel that education and manners make a sensible difference in the opinions and characters of all us poor mortals." ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Yet {{there is}} an old saying about turning the other cheek, an old saying, a saying so {{impossible}} that the world has never been able {{to get it out of}} its mind. You have helped to enlist men for the army, I think? Some of them have fought in the late war, and you have even sent <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> militia there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't insinuating {{anything}} about what you been doing. You been your own boss, and of course I had to take anything off anybody as long as I was broke. But lemme tell you, from now on, no pasty-faced female is going to rub it in any more. You're going to try <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> medicine. You're {{going to give up}} your rotten stenographer's job, and you're going to stay home where I put you, and when I invite you to come on a spree you're going to be glad--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Iris {{called her}} back: [...] "I {{heard you say}} just now, Fanny, that you were out of spirits yourself. If you were {{speaking}} <b>of</b> <b>some</b> troubles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> I am sorry for you, and I won't say any more. But {{if you know what}} my anxieties are, and share them--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can you insult me so, Thomas! And {{is it not}} monstrous for you to talk of my wickedness {{when you}} have a like scheme in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> head? You know you have. <b>Some</b> bumpkin <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> choosing--some petty gentleman who lives down at that outlandish place of yours, Falls-Park--one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> pot-companions' sons--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{the name}} of all that's {{calculated}} to drive one crazy, man,' said the unfortunate single gentleman, 'have you not, for <b>some</b> reason <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> taken upon yourself my errand? don't you know with what object I have come here, {{and if you do}} know, can you throw no light upon it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unfortunately," [...] Laverick remarked, [...] "we cannot stand up. Please {{understand}} that I will not discuss this {{matter with you}} in any way. I will not borrow money from Rendell or any friend. I have asked the bank and I have asked Pages, who will be our largest creditors. To help us would simply be a business proposition, so far as they are concerned. As you know, they have refused. If you see any hope in that direction, why don't you try <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> friends? For every one man I know in the House, you have seemed to be bosom friends with at least twenty." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dear sweet April {{still looks}} coldly upon us--the month you love so dearly. Little white lambs {{are in the}} fields now, and so much that is sweet is coming; {{but there is a}} shadow over this house now; and also, my dear kind friend is far away. The horse-chestnuts have thrown away the winter {{coverings}} of their buds, and given them to that dear economical mother earth, who makes such good use of everything, and works up old materials again in a wonderful way, and is delightfully unlike most economists,--the very soul of generous liberality. Now <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> words, so powerful as they are,--you are speaking of the Alp and of the [...] "Great Builder"--of your own transientness, as of the grass upon its sides; and in this very sadness, a sense of strange companionship with past generations, in seeing what they saw. They have ceased to look upon it, you will soon cease to look also; and the granite wall will be for others, etc., etc.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{forget that}} my father was an Englishman," [...] {{returned}} the guide, [...] "and, besides being a trader, was a sort of Jack-of-all-trades. He taught me many things about which the kinsfolk of my mother know very little. You must not suppose that because some of us are only half-civilised we can do nothing neatly or well. Many of our men are skilful workers in metal, and we owe much of our power in that way to English missionaries, who brought Christian mechanics to the capital. There is hardly anything in the shape of wrought iron-work that we cannot execute if we have a model or pattern. We can work also in copper and brass. But it is not only in metals that we can work fairly well--indeed very well, if we are to take the word of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> countrymen who have seen and judged our work--we are also pretty good at pottery and cabinet-making. As you have seen, we can weave good cloth of cotton and silk, and some of our ingenious men have even tried their hands at clock-making and musical instruments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} it exactly," [...] said Mary. [...] "You returned him his property which you had borrowed, {{and at the}} same time put into his hands <b>some</b> property <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> I don't know whether it ought to be considered as only giving him back his dipper, or bailing him the fish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had ever}} {{thought that you}} had {{expended}} a sovereign except for the object <b>of</b> furthering <b>some</b> plot <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> I should have been grateful. As it is I {{do not know that}} we owe very much to each other." [...] Then he left the room, and, getting into a cab, went away to Lincoln's Inn.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{naturally}} {{be a matter}} of much moment to your lordship who is to succeed him," [...] said Mr. Slope. [...] "It would be a great thing if you could secure the appointment for <b>some</b> person <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> way <b>of</b> thinking on important points. The party hostile to us are very strong here in Barchester--much too strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that there}} is nothing surprising. The class of the chosen few is too small every where, to be very {{numerous}} at any given point, in a scattered population like that of America. The broker will as naturally appreciate the broker, as the dog appreciates the dog, or the wolf the wolf. Least of all is the manliness you have named, likely to be valued among a people who have been put into men's clothes before they are out of leading-strings. I am older than you, my dear Paul," [...] {{it was the first time}} John Effingham ever used so familiar an appellation, and the young man thought it sounded kindly--"I am older than you, my dear Paul, and will venture to tell you an important fact that may hereafter lessen <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> mortifications. In most nations there is a high standard to which man at least affects to look; and acts are extolled and seemingly appreciated, for their naked merits. Little of this exists in America, where no man is much praised for himself, but for the purposes of party, or to feed national vanity. In the country in which, of all others, political opinion ought to be the freest, it is the most persecuted, and the community-character of the nation induces every man to think he has a right of property in all its fame. England exhibits a great deal of this weakness and injustice, which, it is to be feared, is a vicious fruit of liberty; for it is certain that the sacred nature of opinion is most appreciated in those countries in which it has the least efficiency. We are constantly deriding those governments which fetter opinion, and yet I know of no nation in which the expression of opinion is so certain to attract persecution and hostility as our own, though it may be, and is, in one sense, free." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{all that}} {{concerns}} eating and drinking, company, climate, {{and ways of}} life, community of taste is to be sought for. It would be trying, for instance, to keep bed and board with an early riser or a vegetarian. In matters of art and intellect, I believe it is of no consequence. Certainly it is of none in the companionships of men, who will dine more readily with one who has a good heart, a good cellar, and a humorous tongue, than with another who shares all their favourite hobbies and is melancholy withal. If your wife likes Tupper, that {{is no reason why}} you should hang your head. [...] She thinks with the majority, and has the courage of her opinions. I have always suspected public taste to be a mongrel product, out of affectation by dogmatism; and felt sure, if you could only find an honest man of no special literary bent, he would tell you he thought much of Shakespeare bombastic and most absurd, and all of him written in very obscure English and wearisome to read. And not long ago I was able to lay by my lantern in content, for I found the honest man. He was a fellow of parts, quick, humorous, a clever painter, and with an eye for certain poetical effects of sea and ships. I am not much of a judge of that kind of thing, but a sketch of his comes before me sometimes at night. [...] How strong, supple, and living the ship seems upon the billows! With what a dip and rake she shears the flying sea! [...] I cannot fancy the man who saw this effect, and took it on the wing with so much force and spirit, was what you call commonplace in the last recesses of the heart. And yet he thought, and was not ashamed to have it known of him, that Ouida was better in every way than William Shakespeare. If there were more people of his honesty, this would be about the staple of lay criticism. It is not taste that is plentiful, but courage that is rare. And what have we in place? How many, who think no otherwise than the young painter, have we not heard disbursing second-hand hyperboles? Have you never turned sick at heart, O best of critics! when <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> sweet adjectives were returned on you before a gaping audience? Enthusiasm about art is become a function of the average female being, which she performs with precision and a sort of haunting sprightliness, like an ingenious and well- regulated machine. Sometimes, alas! the calmest man is carried away in the torrent, bandies adjectives with the best, and out-Herods Herod for some shameful moments. When you remember that, you will be tempted to put things strongly, and say you will marry no one who is not like George the Second, and cannot state openly a distaste for poetry and painting.|$|E
50|$|After {{the band}} was formed, {{producer}} Vic Del Rosario discovered them while they were performing in a live bar gig. Since then, the group adopted the name 17:28 as a reference to verse 17:28 of the Biblical Book of Acts of the Apostles, For in him, we live, move and have our being. And as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> poets have said, we are His offspring. They chose the name since all of the members were devout Roman Catholics as they agreed on that decision.|$|E
