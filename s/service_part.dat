Amanor-BoaduThe China {{agricultural}} equipment market represents 48 % {{of the equipment}} demand in South East Asia, and 16. 5 % of the global equipment demand in 2005. With John Deere’s market leadership position in the global {{agricultural equipment}} business, {{in order to maintain}} that leadership, China will have be part of their plans. John Deere started doing business in China in 1976 and has grown to four agricultural machinery factories in the country. <b>Service</b> <b>parts</b> sales make up {{an important part of the}} agricultural equipment business, both in revenue and profit. Margins on <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> sales can be as much as eight times that of new complete good sales. Within China, the John Deere dealer organization in the past has focused primary on selling complete goods, missing out on <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> sales. Successful equipment dealerships outside of China maintain a balance between complete good sales, <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> sales, and <b>service</b> labor sales. The objective of this research was to determine those factors that appear to impact the amount of <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> a John Deere dealership in China sells. Data was collected for three years and regression modeling used to determine what impact variables had on <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> sales and net <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> sales. The outcome of the research found that there are key attributes of John Deere dealerships along with geographical regions that John Deere can focus on in China to improve their <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> sales...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{obsolescence}} of <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> is analyzed {{in a practical}} environment. Based on the analysis, we propose a method {{that can be used}} to estimate the risk of obsolescence of <b>service</b> <b>parts,</b> which is subsequently used to enhance inventory control for those parts. The method distinguishes groups of <b>service</b> <b>parts.</b> For these groups, the risk of obsolescence is estimated using the behavior of similar groups of <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> in the past. The method uses demand data as main information source, and can therefore be applied without the use of an expert's opinion. We will give numerical values for the risk of obsolescence obtained with the method, and the effects of these values on inventory control will be examined.

Of the two others, one remained with Gothaer {{and the other was}} severely damaged in an accident during evaluation. Nothing today is known about the type's performance in combat, but of the eight on active service, no more than four appear to have been operational at any one time (October 1916). By February 1917, this number had dwindled to one aircraft only, and from April none remained in <b>service.</b> <b>Part</b> of the problem no doubt lay with their engines. The Mercedes D.IV was plagued by severe crankshaft vibration that resulted in frequent crankshaft failures.|$|E

When the worker departed, Voris added those responsibilities to his own. Voris admitted he had been ignorant of the need to file annual reports and was following Michigan’s processes to return to good standing, and would pay the fines (five dollars per year of failing to report). Voris pointed out that while he had failed in regard to the state paperwork, the paperwork for St. Michael's Media to be a 501c organization was with the Internal Revenue <b>Service</b> (<b>part</b> of the federal government) and which had always been up-to-date – assuring viewers that donations had always been tax deductible.|$|E
40|$|With the {{pressure}} of time-based competition increasing, and customers demanding faster service, availability of <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> becomes {{a critical component of}} manufacturing and <b>servicing</b> operations. <b>Service</b> <b>Parts</b> Management first focuses on intermittent demand forecasting and then on the management of <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> inventories. It guides researchers and practitioners in finding better management solutions to their problems and is both an excellent reference for key concepts and a leading resource for further research. Demand forecasting techniques are presented for parametric and nonparametric approaches, and multi echelon cases and inventory pooling are also considered. Inventory control is examined in the continuous and periodic review cases, while the following are all examined in the context of forecasting: • error measures, • distributional assumptions, and • decision trees. <b>Service</b> <b>Parts</b> Management provides the reader with an overview and a detailed treatment of {{the current state of the}} research available on the forecasting and inventory management of items with intermittent demand. It is a comprehensive review of <b>service</b> <b>parts</b> management and provides a starting point for researchers, postgraduate students, and anyone interested in forecasting or managing inventory...|$|R
