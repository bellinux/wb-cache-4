40|$|One of {{the recent}} tasks and {{responsibilities}} of the Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information (CVTI SR) is to provide technology transfer support to public research organisations on national level. For this purpose, SCSTI has been mandated by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic to implement national project, co-financed from the EU structural funds within the Operational Programme Research and Development, named National infrastructure for technology transfer support in <b>Slovakia</b> – NITT <b>SK.</b> The project is focused on building and securing operation of the national system supporting technology transfer processes in Slovakia and is implemented in the period June 2010 – December 2014 with the total budget of 8. 2 million. The transfer of knowledge from science to industry, {{for the benefit of}} society, will be supported through the complex mechanism, which is currently being developed. The key subject in the whole system will be the National Technology Transfer Centre, which will co-operate closely with local technology transfer centres established at universities and public research institutions. Important part of the system will be the National patent fund, from which financial support in the processes of protecting and commercialising intellectual property will be provided to public research institutions. The financial support shall include payments for patent filing and maintenance (PCT, USPTO, European and national applications), patent attorneys services, patent translations, partner search, marketing, negotiating and licensing. Even nowadays, patent filing fees are covered form the state budget money administrated by the CVTI SR, while external support services are provided within the NITT SK project. This is a great benefit for Slovak public and state universities and the Slovak Academy of Sciences, which had to permanently face the lack of financial means for these purposes. Concerning the technology transfer activities that are being provided through the NITT SK project, these cover the whole process of transferring scientific knowledge into the praxis, starting from intellectual property protection and ending with its commercial utilisation. Services are provided by external high-level experts on relevant technology transfer issue from respective scientific field. All costs are covered from the NITT SK budget and are free for scientific community. Concrete services include assessment of intellectual property commercialisation potential, state of the art analyses, patent application preparation and filing, technology marketing, partner searches, negotiation support, preparation of licensing agreements, spin-offs creation, follow-up of royalties’ payment and so on. Since 2012, when this support started, several patent applications have already been supported within the NITT SK project. Last year, the National portal for technology transfer has also been launched within the NITT SK project. It provides a comprehensive overview of technology transfer issues serving researchers, students, companies and local TT offices. Useful are sample contracts, internal regulations and other methodological materials related to technology transfer. It comprises also a list of competencies of Slovak RandD institutions and links to relevant Slovak, foreign and international organisations, groups and initiatives.

30|$|The {{comparison}} of DEA efficiency scores with the rating of Denkwerk Zukunft (2014) shows {{not only their}} different capability of depicting nuances in the evaluation, but also {{that there is no}} strong correlation between the two concepts of assessment. Thus, Table  5 also highlights their diversity in the approach: namely, the comparison between the best practice and the averages, on one hand, and between the profile formation and equal weighting, on the other hand, for the five welfare indicators. Great Britain (GB with a rating of only 2) and the extremely super-efficient Luxembourg (L with a rating of only 3 *) are two examples of cases where the DEA evaluation is noticeably better than the rating of Denkwerk Zukunft, whereby both countries are identified as efficient in all the standard DEA models. Vice versa, strongly CCR inefficient <b>Slovakia</b> (<b>SK</b> 0.40) and Hungary (H 0.43) have a rather high rating of 4 and 4 *. Reasons for this are not always as obvious {{as in the case of}} the very high GDP/cap of Luxembourg (L 1.68 times that of DK as second best). The detailed results of DEA can provide valuable information for an in-depth analysis; for example, the endogenously generated weights for each welfare indicator. 9 Consequently, both evaluation concepts complement each other in their aggregation and analysis of data.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{and describe}} the incidence rates, mortality, and cost of CAP (community-acquired pneumonia), in both inpatient and outpatient settings, in the Czech Republic (CZ), <b>Slovakia</b> (<b>SK),</b> Poland (PL), and Hungary (HU). A retrospective analysis was conducted on administrative data from the health ministry and insurance reimbursement claims with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia in 2009 to determine hospitalization rates, costs, and mortality in adults ≥ 50 years of age. Patient chart reviews were conducted to estimate the number of outpatient cases. Among all adults ≥ 50 years, the incidence of hospitalized CAP per 100, 000 person years was: 456. 6 (CZ), 504. 6 (SK), 363. 9 (PL), and 845. 3 (HU). The average fatality rate for all adults ≥ 50 is 19. 1 %, and for each country; 21. 7 % (CZ), 20. 9 % (SK), 18. 6 % (PL), 17. 8 % (HU). Incidence, fatality, and likelihood of hospitalization increased with advancing age. Total healthcare costs of CAP in EUR was 12, 579, 543 (CZ); 9, 160, 774 (SK); 22, 409, 085 (PL); and 18, 298, 449 (HU); with hospitalization representing over 90 % of the direct costs of treatment. The burden of CAP increases with advancing age in four CEE countries, with hospitalizations driving the costs of CAP upwards in the elderly population. Mortality rates are generally higher than reported in Western EU countries...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{turbulence}} of 1989, {{the countries of}} Central and Eastern Europe have striven to "return to Europe". Agreements have been signed with ten post-communist countries, beginning in 1991 with Czechoslovakia (before its division), Hungary and Poland. Since that time several countries have {{expressed a desire to}} become members of the EU. In 1997 the European Commission announced its opinion on the applications for EU membership of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and seven other applicant countries. The Commission recommended the commencement of negotiations on accession with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. Mr. Kucia's report, presented {{in the form of a}} series of manuscripts totalling 91 pages, written in English and Polish and including many pages of tables and graphs, presents the results of a study of public opinion on European integration in four countries of Central Europe (CE) : the Czech Republic (CZ), Hungary (H), Poland (PL), and <b>Slovakia</b> (<b>SK).</b> The research results are primarily based on a public-opinion survey known as the Central and Eastern Eurobarometer (CEEB). CEEB has been conducted on behalf of the European Commission in the Central and Eastern European countries each year in autumn since 1990. Below is a very small selection of Mr. Kucia's research findings. Throughout the 90 s people in the four countries increasingly saw their countries' future tied up with the EU, since economic and political connections to the EU were growing and prospects for EU membership were increasing. Regional co-operation within CE did not gain much popular recognition. However, initially high levels of enthusiasm for the EU were gradually superseded by a more realistic approach or even scepticism. Poland was the exception in this respect; its population was more positive about the EU in 1996 than ever before. Mr. Kucia concludes that, since the political "elites" in CE are more positive about the EU than the people they serve, they should do their best to bring people round to their beliefs, lest the project of European integration become purely the business of the elites, as Mr. Kucia claims it has been in the EU up till now. He accuses the governments of the region, the EU authorities and the media of failing to provide appropriate information, especially about the two subjects which most affect them, association with the EU and the PHARE assistance programme. Respondents were asked to rank in order the countries or regions they saw their country's future most closely tied up with. In the period 92 - 96 the EU received the highest ratings in all of CE. The ratings were highest in CZ in 92 and 93 (46 %) and in Poland in 96 (46 %). They were the lowest in Hungary (22 % in 94). After the EU came "Other Western European countries (non EU) ", that is Austria, Sweden and Finland (before they joined the EU in 1995), Switzerland and Norway. Mr. Kucia puts the high ratings of these countries down to historical connections and geographical proximity, particularly in the case of Austria. The USA always came second in Poland, and in Hungary too its standing has always been higher than in CZ or SK. Indeed Mr. Kucia suggests that the USA's standing is disproportionately low in especially the CZ. Germany was nominated frequently by Hungarians, though in the CZ and SK, figures have been consistently low (1 - 2 %). "Other CE/EE countries" increased their ratings in all of CE except Poland between 92 and 96. With regard to these last figures, Mr. Kucia makes an interesting note. Assuming that for the respondents in the four countries this category covered the Visegrad 4, least support was found in Poland, whose government was the most in favour of close political co-operation within the V 4, while most support was in evidence in CZ and SK, for whose governments V 4 was simply not a priority. Again, there is evidence of a divide between the political elites and the people. Russia has occupied a consistently modest rank. It was the highest in PL, fairly low in H and SK and the lowest in CZ. The Slovak government's policy of closer ties with Russia is reflected in a growth in the figures from 2 % in 93 to 6 % in 95. Every year the spontaneous answer "we should depend on ourselves" appeared, which Mr. Kucia interprets as either a sign of isolationism and disillusionment or as a call for self-reliance. Unfortunately he regards both these tendencies as unfeasible in the uniting Europe. Moving to more general conclusions, Mr. Kucia finds that the concept "Central Europe" does not have much meaning for Central Europeans. He believes that this is probably due to the failure to establish a viable regional co-operation network. Group discussions also revealed that people thought themselves European as a consequence of being Czech or Polish etc. Thus European identity is based on national identities. Generally within the surveyed period, the numbers of those who said they often think themselves European decreased, while the numbers of those who said they never think themselves European increased from 41 % in PL, 36 % in CZ, and 30 % in H in 1990, to 67 % in CZ, 58 % in PL, and 51 % in H in 1995...|$|E
