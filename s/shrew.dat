5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the marsh <b>shrew</b> is {{sympatric}} {{with other members of}} the genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black <b>shrew</b> shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water <b>shrew</b> (Sorex palustris). Although the marsh <b>shrew</b> and the American water <b>shrew</b> (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water <b>shrew</b> has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the marsh shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water <b>shrew</b> has a smaller skull, without the marsh shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The marsh <b>shrew</b> typically has a longer snout than that of the American water <b>shrew,</b> which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 2013, Thor's hero <b>shrew</b> (Scutisorex thori) is {{a species of}} <b>shrew</b> native to the Democratic Republic of Congo. It and its sister species, the hero <b>shrew</b> (Scutisorex somereni), are the only mammal species known to have interlocking vertebrae. The team named the <b>shrew</b> after Thor due to the god's association with strength.|$|E
5|$|The marsh <b>shrew</b> and the American water <b>shrew</b> (Sorex pallustris) {{share many}} {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American water <b>shrew</b> is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh <b>shrew</b> to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the Pacific water <b>shrew</b> to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized {{that in the early}} Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American water <b>shrew</b> and marsh <b>shrew</b> diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf <b>shrew</b> (S. nanus), the southeastern <b>shrew</b> (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate <b>shrew</b> (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh <b>shrew</b> and the American water <b>shrew</b> to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined the nature of the relationships between marsh shrews, Pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh <b>shrew</b> are shown below in detail.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the current}} taxonomy, the Myosoricinae are a {{subfamily}} of <b>shrews.</b> As such, they form one of three main types of <b>shrews,</b> the other two being the red-toothed <b>shrews</b> and the white-toothed <b>shrews.</b> They are {{the only one of}} the three to be found exclusively south of the Sahara Desert, and accordingly they have been described in English as the African <b>shrews,</b> but also many white-toothed <b>shrews</b> are in Africa and accordingly this term is more generally used for <b>shrews</b> from Africa in general.

Three wild mammals are well-established introductions: the rabbit ({{introduced in the}} mediaeval period), the red squirrel and the hedgehog (both introduced in the 19th century). The stoat (Mustela erminea) became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000.

50|$|Elephant <b>shrews,</b> or jumping <b>shrews,</b> {{are small}} insectivorous mammals native to Africa, {{belonging}} to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea, whose traditional common English name comes from a fancied resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and an assumed relationship with the <b>shrews</b> (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. Nonetheless, elephant <b>shrews</b> are not classified with the superficially similar true <b>shrews,</b> but are instead {{more closely related to}} elephants and their kin within the newly recognized Afrotheria; the biologist Jonathan Kingdon has proposed they instead be called sengis (singular sengi), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa.|$|R
50|$|Most Prebleâ€™s <b>shrews</b> live in arid or {{semiarid}} shrub-grasses {{that are}} associated with coniferous forest dominated by sagebrush. However, these <b>shrews</b> are not restricted to this habitat. They have been found In Oregon living on the big Transition Zone meadows. In another part of Oregon, these <b>shrews</b> have been found in marsh habitats. A majority of Preble's <b>Shrews</b> have been captured in arid habitats, frequently in the immediate or nearby presence of sagebrush. This is likely for protection. Specimens captured in southwestern Wyoming were found in sagebrush-steppe areas: In southern British Columbia, Preble's <b>Shrews</b> were captured in lightly grazed grasslands surrounded by scattered stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) or ponderosa pine.|$|R

A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E

40|$|American water <b>shrews</b> (Sorex palustris) are {{aggressive}} predators {{that feed}} {{on a variety}} of terrestrial and aquatic prey. They often forage at night, diving into streams and ponds in search of food. We investigated how <b>shrews</b> locate submerged prey using high-speed videography, infrared lighting, and stimuli designed to mimic prey. <b>Shrews</b> attacked brief water movements, indicating motion is an important cue used to detect active or escaping prey. They also bit, retrieved, and attempted to eat model fish made of silicone in preference to other silicone objects showing that tactile cues are important in the absence of movement. In addition, water <b>shrews</b> preferentially sniffed model prey fish and crickets underwater by exhaling and reinhaling air through the nostrils, suggesting olfaction {{plays an important role in}} aquatic foraging. The possibility of echolocation, sonar, or electroreception was investigated by testing for ultrasonic and audible calls above and below water and by presenting electric fields to foraging <b>shrews.</b> We found no evidence for these abilities. We conclude that water <b>shrews</b> detect motion, shape, and smell to find prey underwater. The short latency of attacks to water movements suggests <b>shrews</b> may use a flush-pursuit strategy to capture some prey...|$|R
