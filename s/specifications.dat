40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} logical <b>specification</b> of data types. This <b>specification</b> is built upon a {{previously}} given <b>specification</b> for a data type {{that we want to}} extend by introducing new constructing objects and defined operations. The extended data type is specified by superposing a circumscription principle to some <b>specification</b> axioms. Circumscription formalizes in second-order logic some forms of (non-monotonic) common-sense reasoning in knowledge bases [11]. By means of circumscription we separate very clearly the first-order <b>specification</b> language (or axioms) from the <b>specification</b> mechanism. By showing the logical equivalence to Zhang's noncircumscriptive data type <b>specification</b> [17], we obtain the categoricity of our <b>specification</b> when we start from a categorical <b>specification</b> for the original data type. Keywords: data type <b>specification,</b> circumscription, first-order logic, second-order logic, knowledge bases, non-monotonic reasoning. 1. Introduction In this work we apply [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>specification</b> model and present {{a method to}} algorithmically derive a {{protocol}} <b>specification</b> from a service <b>specification</b> based on the model. Unlike the previous models based on finite state machines, the proposed model can explicitly express concurrency, synchronization, and timing requirements such as delays and timeouts. We assume that there exists a reliable communication channel between any two protocol entities and the maximum delay for each channel is bounded by a positive constant. Because of the variable nature of the communication delays along with the time constraints associated with events, no protocol <b>specification</b> can fully simulate the service <b>specification.</b> The proposed method derives a protocol <b>specification</b> that is optimal {{in the sense that}} it provides the largest possible subset of the service <b>specification</b> under the communication delay constraints. We also give a method to derive a sub <b>specification</b> from a service <b>specification</b> and a maximum communication delay of each channel such that the sub <b>specification,</b> but no superset of it, can be simulated by the derived protocol <b>specification...</b>|$|R
