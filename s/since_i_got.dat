500|$|Arsenal {{dropped into}} mid-table {{throughout}} the 1973–74 season, with McLintock's departure signalling {{the demise of}} the Double-winning team. Kennedy failed to score from 6 October to mid-January, and speculation rose of possible moves to Sunderland, Newcastle United, or Aston Villa. In February, he released a statement saying that [...] "my game has gone downhill <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> married but has started to pick up again now I am in bachelordom... I feel that I am better off without her". He ended the season in good form, though Mee had already decided to move him on and replace him with Brian Kidd.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{deployment}} to Europe, the Kilmers' daughter Rose had died, and twelve days later, their son Christopher was born. [...] Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers {{to write a}} book about the war, deciding upon the title Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth. The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written [...] "anything in prose or verse <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here—except statistics—but I've stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy when I get a chance." [...] Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and poetry. [...] The most notable of his poems during this period was [...] "Rouge Bouquet" [...] (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. [...] At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918 that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).|$|E
2500|$|In January 1954, Doll {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Rams in a three-team, multi-player deal that also sent Night Train Lane to the Chicago Cardinals. [...] At the time of the trade, Doll, who lived at the time in San Gabriel, California, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "This is good news. [...] I've wanted to play for the Rams <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out of school." [...] Doll {{concluded}} his playing career with the Rams and had five interceptions in 1954. [...] When he retired {{at the end of the}} 1954 season, Doll was the NFL's all-time career leader with 41 interceptions.|$|E
5000|$|During his campaign, Carter reaffirmed {{his support}} for the legalization of {{same-sex}} marriage, stating, “Marriage equality is something I believe in and have in for a very, very, very long time <b>since</b> before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into politics.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Simpson agreed. [...] "Not long <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{reckoned}} I'd <b>got</b> the gang. Now you're all that's left. The packers don't count." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “It seemed {{abundantly clear}} to me that this was how the culture needed to evolve — rock, jazz, pop and world music all fusing {{together}} to form one truly universal language. No Walls was the embodiment of everything I had dreamed of <b>since</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> turned on to music. We were the Freedom Principle in action!” ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, [...] "No doubt about it, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here in the early 70s things have gone downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that Bush and Cheney organised {{the attack on the}} World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [...] are capable of monstrous evil, I just think the theories they have - of no plane hitting the Pentagon - is nutty. It's like flying saucers." [...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None, my boy, thank God. Prosperity has {{attended}} me ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the first money you sent home. That saved me, Teddie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It iss a pad craitur you've peen--fery pad--ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> you, but it iss no more {{mischief}} {{you will}} pe dooin' after this--whatever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understand}} that," [...] said Lemuel. [...] "I couldn't help it, at first. But I've {{got to see}} it all in {{a different}} light <b>since</b> then. <b>I</b> know that you meant the best by me. I know now that what I wrote wasn't worth anything, and just how you must have looked at it. I didn't know some things then that I do now; and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> to know a little more I have understood better what you meant by all you said." ...|$|R
500|$|Jack Nicholson, {{recounting the}} {{reaction}} to a screening of the film, states that the audience [...] "laughed so hard I could barely hear the dialogue. I didn't quite register it right. It was as if I had forgotten it was a comedy <b>since</b> the shoot. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> all embarrassed because I'd never really had such a positive response before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do mean to say, ma'am, that I {{never touched}} a dhrop of {{anything}} sthronger than wather, barring tay, <b>since</b> the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the pledge from the blessed apostle." [...] And Richard boldly crossed {{himself in the}} presence of them both. They knew well whom he meant by the blessed apostle: it was Father Mathew.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There!' said Mrs Prig, 'that's the way he's been a-conductin of himself, Sarah, ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{him out of}} bed, if you'll believe it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me everything, Anne, dearie. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{your phone}} I've {{been in a}} regular muddle, believe ME. Cornelia Bryant was never so kerflummuxed before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have prayed ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{your first}} letter, and I see it does no good," [...] he answered. [...] "Our prayers cannot alter fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we acted for the best; {{but things}} {{have turned out}} badly, and I feel more hopelessly at sea, as to what we had better do next, than <b>I</b> have done <b>since</b> the day <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Ostend. At any rate, {{there is nothing to}} be done until we have got a fair sight of the brigantine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I served aboard ship, where I was put out, {{being too}} idle a {{vagabond}} to be kep' at home. I {{always wanted to}} run wild somewheres for a change; but I didn't really go to do it, till I picked up a letter which {{was waiting for me}} in port, at the Brazils. There was news in that letter which sickened me of going home again; so I deserted, and went off on the tramp. And I've been mostly on the tramp ever <b>since,</b> till <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here last Sunday." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hazlitt justifies his own {{contrary}} attitude at length: [...] "When one {{is found}} fault with for nothing, or for doing one's best, one {{is apt to}} give the world their revenge. All the former {{part of my life}} I was treated as a cipher; and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> into notice, <b>I</b> have been set upon as a wild beast. When this is the case, and you can expect as little justice as candour, you naturally in self-defence take refuge in a sort of misanthropy and cynical contempt for mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad {{of one of}} your caresses," [...] said a porcupine, meekly; [...] "it has been some time <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a loving embrace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} think so," [...] she replied. [...] "Seems to me I've had {{nothing else to}} do <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here but buy frocks and things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What fun!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do {{send for}} him! He thinks that I am staying with Miss Pengarth, and I haven't written once <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here!" ...|$|E
60|$|I myself {{liked the}} hero of the tale more than I have liked worthier men, perhaps because I thought I had {{achieved}} in him a true rustic New England type in contact with urban life under entirely modern conditions. What seemed to me my esthetic success in him possibly softened me to his ethical shortcomings; but I do not expect others to share my weakness for Jeff Durgin, whose strong, rough surname had been waiting for his personality ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> it off the side of an ice-cart many years before.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942 {{he escaped}} to Mexico, {{where he lived}} until 1948 and {{published}} numerous books about libertarian socialism and the Spanish collectives. In 1952 he traveled to Israel and studied kibbutzim. Following his experience there, Souchy traveled to Cuba and was briefly involved with the very lively Cuban anarchist movement. In the late 1950s, he undertook an unsponsored lecture tour of Latin America to try to advance trade unionism. In 1963 the International Labour Organization hired him as an educational expert. Until then, Souchy had worked exclusively in the anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist movement. Smiling, Souchy said [...] "to imagine, at 71 years old, when others had long <b>since</b> retired, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my first job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mind," [...] he answered, good-humouredly, {{conscious}} that his trousers terminated at the ankle, {{and that the}} seams of his unbuttoned coat were bursting. [...] "I should be comfortable in anything <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> rid of that sword {{and the other thing}} like a satchel which kept tripping me up. The management of a woman's train has always seemed to me an accomplishment, but it is nothing compared with the difficulty of walking like a soldier with those things whacking at your ankles every few moments. One thing I can promise you and myself, Countess. If Domiloff and the whole lot of them catch me nothing would induce me to put on that uniform again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're a wonder, darling. You really are. I've been repeating {{that ever}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> your {{telegram}} from Eastnor.' She broke off. 'Ogden, come near me, my little son.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said March, [...] "I wish it didn't {{make me feel}} so sneaking. What a {{long day}} it's been! It seems like a century <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "He {{knew that}} I must sing to-night. I have been {{expecting him to}} {{telephone}} every moment <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home. You have seen him?" ...|$|E

Thank you. -ii- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I have to first thank {{my family and friends}} for their support and their patience while I worked through this project. I also extend my sincerest gratitude to my advisor, Randy Mason, who has been so helpful and encouraging <b>since</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> to UPenn and a great resource during the thesis process. Additionally, I would like to thank Laura Spina, Mike Hauptman, Eva Gladstein, Jorge Danta, Erin Cote, and Patrick Hauck for lending their time and professional knowledge to answer many questions regarding neighborhoods and zoning in Philadelphia. -iii- TABLE OF CONTENTS DEDICATION i...|$|R
5000|$|... "The New Man in Charge" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sam McPherson of TV Overmind graded the epilogue an A, deeming [...] "If you didn’t like 'The End', you’ll probably love this. And if you liked 'The End', well, you’ll still probably love it." [...] Alan Sepinwall of Star Ledger was also {{satisfied with the}} epilogue, stating [...] "I went into 'The New Man in Charge' not expecting some crucial missing chapter from the Lost saga, but a chance {{to spend a few}} more minutes with Benjamin Linus and Hugo Reyes, and to maybe get a few blanks filled in ... And <b>since</b> that's what <b>I</b> <b>got,</b> <b>I</b> was satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Augusta, Augusta," [...] he said, [...] "don't you understand? I love you! I love you! No {{woman was}} ever loved before as I love you. I {{fell in love}} with you the very first time I saw you in the office at Meeson's, when I had the row with my uncle about you; and ever <b>since</b> then <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> deeper and deeper in love with you. When I thought that you were drowned it nearly broke my heart, and often and often I wished that I were dead, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> fairly into work," [...] said Susan; [...] "I wouldn't have it. But when I {{was little}} {{we were always}} pawning things. Why! we've pawned kettles!..." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{promotion}} of the album, Adkins joined label-mate Toby Keith for his 2009 American Ride Tour. Adkins described his experience on the tour, saying [...] "Touring with Toby last year changed my career, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to see first hand that Toby and his organization place a premium on having fun and <b>since</b> that's what <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in this business for in the first place, this feels like {{the right place to}} be." [...] He made television appearances on series such as the Today Show and The O'Reilly Factor on August 19, Fox & Friends on August 20. In addition, Adkins appeared on several late night talk shows including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on September 14, Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 15, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on October 5, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on October 12 and Chelsea Lately on October 19.|$|R

60|$|Next day, I {{found that}} the mercury in the barometer, which had risen {{steadily}} since we cleared the ice, remained steady. I had had very good observations, with now and then the interruption of a day or so, <b>since</b> our departure. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the sun at noon, and found {{that we were in}} Lat. 58 degrees S., Long. 60 degrees W., off New South Shetland; in the neighbourhood of Cape Horn. We were sixty-seven days out, that day. The ship's reckoning was accurately worked and made up. The ship did her duty admirably, all on board were well, and all hands were as smart, efficient, and contented, as it was possible to be.|$|R
