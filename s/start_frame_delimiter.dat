40|$|Master of ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringDwight D. DaySynchronization {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} steps in a wireless communication system. With the system having limited energy resources, low power devices and designs are key aspects of the design process. Digital communication and decoding is discussed along with how synchronization is part of communication. The parameters for wireless communication are outlined and how the system can be simplified in order to reduce power consumption for the network is investigated. The background for the Body Area Network Board which was created for the project, Biosensor Networks and Telecommunication Subsystems for Long Duration Missions, EVA Suits, and Robotic Precursor Scout Missions, is discussed along with some synchronization background as well as some previously researched demodulators designed for limited preambles. With limited-length preambles, oversampling is needed to achieve synchronization. This research investigates what minimum oversampling ratio is needed in a simplified system to still achieve packet synchronization and several synchronization words were compared. The parameters for packet synchronization are outlined as well the impulse noise model used for simulation. For the simulation and the test setup, several oversampling ratios and synchronization words are compared using probability of miss detection and probability of false detection. The oversampling ratio of 16 was shown to be a critical point where increasing the oversampling rate above 16 had diminishing returns. In terms of probability of miss detection, the 7 -bit Barker sequence along with the <b>start</b> of <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter</b> for IEEE 802. 15. 4 had better performance compared to the <b>start</b> of <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter</b> for Ethernet and the sequence 01010111...|$|R
50|$|In IEEE 802.3, a {{datagram}} {{is called}} a packet or frame. Packet is {{used to describe the}} overall transmission unit and includes the preamble, <b>start</b> <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter</b> (SFD) and carrier extension (if present). The frame begins after the <b>start</b> <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter</b> with a frame header featuring source and destination MAC addresses and a field giving either the protocol type for the payload protocol or the length of the payload. The middle section of the frame consists of payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check, which is used to detect corruption of data in transit. Notably, Ethernet packets have no time-to-live field, leading to possible problems {{in the presence of a}} switching loop.|$|E
50|$|An Ethernet {{frame is}} {{preceded by a}} {{preamble}} and <b>start</b> <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter</b> (SFD), which are both part of the Ethernet packet at the physical layer. Each Ethernet frame starts with an Ethernet header, which contains destination and source MAC addresses as its first two fields. The middle section of the frame is payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a frame check sequence (FCS), which is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check used to detect any in-transit corruption of data.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between time and frequency domain TOA estimators compliant with the 802. 15. 4 a Standard has been made. The time domain estimator {{is done in}} two stages. One has the goal of identify the rst pulse in each symbol interval and the other aims to acquire the <b>start</b> of <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter.</b> The frequency domain estimator is also based in two stages. A simple coarse estimation stage provides the symbol synchronization required by the ne estimation stage which nds the rst delay of the rst arriving path in a power delay pro le developed in the frequency domain by using high resolution spectral estimation techniques. An accuracy of few centimeters is asymptotically achieved by both estimators. While time domain estimator shows slightly more accurate results at high values of SNR, frequency domain estimators works slightly better at low SNR. 1 Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a {{promising}} radio technology which {{is well suited}} to low power short-range wireless applications. At Holst Centre/imec, there is a research program on the design and implementation of ultra low power, Impulse Radio-UWB (IR-UWB) wireless systems suitable for audio streaming and real time localization systems. Some key technology challenges for IR-UWB systems are Direct Current (DC) power consumption, Link-budget and Quality of Service (QoS). The {{first part of this}} thesis focuses on measurement of DC power consumption; transmit output power and spectrum using the IR-UWB transmitter. As the hardware supports several modes, an automated measurement setup with programmable parameters has been created. In the second part, a mathematical model for the preamble and <b>Start</b> of <b>Frame</b> <b>Delimiter</b> (SFD) detection stages of the receiver operation is provided. This part of the receiver is a critical one and is challenging for IR-UWB type of signals due to the low transmit power. A method to estimate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) per pulse from the output of the preamble detection block is proposed. A theoretical approach for setting the threshold for SFD detection is described. It is shown through simulations that this method of threshold setting provides a significant improvement in receiver performance.

50|$|HDLC frames can be {{transmitted}} over synchronous or asynchronous serial communication links. Those links have no mechanism to mark the beginning or end of a frame, so {{the beginning and end}} of each frame has to be identified. This is done by using a <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter,</b> or flag, which is a unique sequence of bits that is guaranteed not to be seen inside a frame. This sequence is '01111110', or, in hexadecimal notation, 0x7E. Each frame begins and ends with a <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter.</b> A <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter</b> at the end of a frame may also mark the start of the next frame. A sequence of 7 or more consecutive 1-bits within a frame will cause the frame to be aborted.|$|R

50|$|Each frame {{begins and}} ends with a <b>frame</b> <b>delimiter.</b> The <b>frame</b> header {{immediately}} follows the SOF <b>delimiter.</b> The <b>frame</b> header is used to control link applications, control device protocol transfers, and detect missing or out of order frames. Optional headers may contain further link control information. A maximum 2048 byte long field (payload) contains the information to be transferred from a source N_Port to a destination N_Port. The 4 bytes Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) precedes the EOF delimiter. The CRC is used to detect transmission errors. The maximum total frame length is 2148 bytes.|$|R
