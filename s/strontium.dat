5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs <b>strontium</b> {{as if it}} were its lighter {{congener}} calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable <b>strontium</b> isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of <b>strontium</b> a day. In adults, <b>strontium</b> consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, <b>strontium</b> can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.|$|E
5|$|Acantharea, a {{relatively}} large group of marine radiolarian protozoa, produce intricate mineral skeletons composed of <b>strontium</b> sulfate. In biological systems, calcium is substituted in a small extent by <b>strontium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, <b>strontium</b> occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed <b>strontium</b> metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered <b>strontium</b> metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile <b>strontium</b> salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, <b>strontium</b> metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>strontium</b> and {{strontianite}} {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. <b>Strontium</b> was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of <b>strontium</b> (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of <b>strontium</b> consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods, consumption of <b>strontium</b> has dramatically declined.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for <b>strontium</b> is in glass for colour {{television}} cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for <b>strontium</b> is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of <b>strontium.</b> All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with <b>strontium</b> and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% <b>strontium</b> oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} <b>strontium,</b> a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of <b>strontium</b> and barium plays a significant part in stabilising <b>strontium</b> complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its <b>strontium</b> and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|In {{groundwater}} <b>strontium</b> behaves chemically {{much like}} calcium. At intermediate to acidic pH Sr2+ {{is the dominant}} <b>strontium</b> species. In the presence of calcium ions, <b>strontium</b> commonly forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased pH. At intermediate to acidic pH, dissolved <b>strontium</b> is bound to soil particles by cation exchange.|$|E
5|$|<b>Strontium</b> {{has been}} shown to inhibit sensory {{irritation}} when applied topically to the skin. Topically applied, <b>strontium</b> {{has been shown}} to accelerate the recovery rate of the epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).|$|E
5|$|<b>Strontium</b> is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, <b>strontium</b> is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element {{that is highly}} reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. <b>Strontium</b> has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural <b>strontium</b> is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as <b>strontium</b> is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable <b>strontium,</b> on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E
5|$|The drug <b>strontium</b> {{ranelate}} aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, <b>strontium</b> ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of <b>strontium</b> over the calcium which it replaces. <b>Strontium</b> also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. <b>Strontium</b> is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce <b>strontium</b> hydroxide and hydrogen gas. <b>Strontium</b> metal burns in air to produce both <b>strontium</b> oxide and <b>strontium</b> nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of <b>strontium</b> metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. <b>Strontium</b> hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of <b>strontium</b> are known.|$|E
5|$|Nobelium's {{complexing}} ability with chloride ions is most {{similar to}} that of barium, which complexes rather weakly. Its complexing ability with citrate, oxalate, and acetate in an aqueous solution of 0.5Mammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and <b>strontium,</b> although it is somewhat closer to that of <b>strontium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Strontium</b> {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total <b>strontium</b> chloride hexahydrate by weight. Small amounts {{are used in}} the refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|<b>Strontium</b> is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of <b>strontium</b> (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic <b>strontium</b> exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|The mean <b>strontium</b> {{content of}} ocean water is 8mg/l. At a {{concentration}} between 82 and 90 µmol/l of <b>strontium,</b> the concentration is considerably {{lower than the}} calcium concentration, which is normally between 9.6 and 11.6mmol/l. It is nevertheless much {{higher than that of}} barium, 13μg/l.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} {{producers}} of <b>strontium</b> as celestine as of 2015 are China (150,000t), Spain (90,000t), and Mexico (70,000t); Argentina (10,000t) and Morocco (2,500t) are smaller producers. Although <b>strontium</b> deposits occur widely in the United States, {{they have not}} been mined since 1959.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{included}} in BSCCO (bismuth <b>strontium</b> calcium copper oxide) which {{is a group of}} similar superconducting compounds discovered in 1988 that exhibit the highest superconducting transition temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hills}} {{to the north}} of the village of Strontian the mineral {{strontianite}} was discovered, from which the element <b>strontium</b> was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808.|$|E
5|$|Organostrontium {{compounds}} contain {{one or more}} strontium–carbon bonds. They {{have been}} reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions. Although <b>strontium</b> {{is in the same}} group as magnesium, and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118pm; Eu2+ 117pm; Sm2+ 122pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, <b>strontium</b> dicyclopentadienyl, Sr(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting <b>strontium</b> metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|<b>Strontium</b> {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because <b>strontium</b> is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} half-life of <b>strontium</b> in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published {{biological half-life}} figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life {{is estimated to}} be about 18 years. The elimination rate of <b>strontium</b> is strongly affected by age and sex, due to differences in bone metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{occurs in}} {{the water of the}} Black Creek watershed, {{typically}} at concentrations of less than 0.07 milligrams per liter. Beryllium is about as common, with a concentration of less than 0.06 milligrams per liter. <b>Strontium</b> is much more common, with a concentration of up to 4.4 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Barium salts are {{typically}} white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and barium ions provide no specific coloring. They are denser than the <b>strontium</b> or calcium analogs, {{except for the}} halides (see table; zinc is given for comparison).|$|E
5|$|Barium vapor is {{condensed}} {{and packed}} into molds {{in an atmosphere}} of argon. This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure barium. Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being <b>strontium</b> and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of <b>strontium,</b> barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like <b>strontium</b> and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|During {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear weapons}} testing, {{it was observed}} that strontium-90 is one of the nuclear fission products with a relative high yield. The similarity to calcium and the chance that the strontium-90 might become enriched in bones made research on the metabolism of <b>strontium</b> an important topic.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>strontium</b> is {{so similar}} to calcium, it is {{incorporated}} in the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, <b>strontium</b> titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>strontium</b> is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their {{abundance}} increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural <b>strontium,</b> though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly according to analysis of the strontium–niobium–palladium elemental ratios. The Emperor Seamounts were active for at least 46 million years, with the oldest lava dated to the Cretaceous Period, followed by another 39 million years of activity along the Hawaiian segment of the chain, totaling 85 million years. Data demonstrate vertical variability {{in the amount of}} <b>strontium</b> present in both the alkalic (early stages) and tholeitic (later stages) lavas. The systematic increase slows drastically {{at the time of the}} bend.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{isotopes}} {{with mass}} numbers {{at or below}} 88 decay primarily by positron emission (proton → neutron) to form <b>strontium</b> (Z = 38) isotopes. Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron → proton) to form zirconium (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β− delayed neutron emission.|$|E
5|$|Although earlier {{theories}} {{postulated that}} large lakes formed from glacial meltwater, increased precipitation or decreased evaporation (or both) are today considered necessary for lake formation; a complete glacial melting {{would have had}} to occur in less than about a century to produce the required volume. The water volume would be insufficient to explain Lake Tauca's high water levels; however, some smaller lakes in the southern Altiplano probably expanded from glacial meltwater alone. The lake may have contributed to increased precipitation by influencing land breezes. According to <b>strontium</b> isotope data, there may have been little water exchange between Tauca's Uyuni and Coipasa basins. During the Coipasa lake cycle, the Coipasa-Uyuni and Poopó basins had a limited connection. Minor water-level fluctuations occurred during the lake's existence.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an alkaline earth metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, <b>strontium,</b> barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the alkaline earth metals are rather reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkaline earth metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of <b>strontium</b> (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues <b>strontium</b> and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, <b>strontium,</b> and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
