5000|$|In 1926, the American {{edition of}} Vogue {{published}} {{an image of}} a Chanel little black dress with long sleeves, dubbing it the garçonne (little boy look). Vogue predicted that such a simple yet chic design would become a virtual uniform for women of taste, famously comparing its basic lines to the ubiquitous and no less widely accessible Ford automobile. The spare look generated widespread criticism from male journalists, who complained: [...] "no more bosom, no more stomach, no more rump ... Feminine fashion of this moment in the 20th century will be baptized lop off everything." [...] The popularity of the little black dress can be attributed in part to the timing of its introduction. The 1930s was a period of the Great Depression Era, when women needed affordable fashion. Chanel boasted that she had enabled the non-wealthy to [...] "walk around like millionaires". Chanel started making little black dresses in wool or chenille for the day and in <b>satin,</b> <b>crêpe</b> or velvet for the evening.|$|E

40|$|Silk fabrics {{emerge in}} a wide {{spectrum}} of popular products like silk <b>satin,</b> silk <b>crepe</b> de chine, silk georgette, silk chiffon, silk taffeta, silk scarves etc. Silk being a natural and delicate fibre demands certain caring treatments during its use in textiles, apparels in particular. Silk apparels and textiles, like the other textile products, get soiled due to repeated use. These products need to be refurbished for reuse without substantively altering their functional and aesthetic properties. National and international organizations coordinate their efforts to establish objective test methods for care label instructions. Correct care of silk products ensures retaining their quality for years. Care labels in apparels provide a useful information to the end users to look after their textile products made from different fibres. These labels are basically simple, space-saving, comprehensive pictorial symbols reducing the dependence on language and guiding the consumers to clean and maintain the product in the best possible way. Care instructions play a very vital role during laundering of the textile products, particularly silk, both domestically and commercially. This paper focusses the effects of care label codes like washing, laundering, dry cleaning, ironing, drying etc. on the different phenomena like deformation, colour change, colour staining of the plain weave 100 % silk fabric samples followed by the selection of the appropriate care code for greater durability and refurbishing of the fabric. Faulty laundering, boiling, steaming, uneven friction and stretching may damage the fabric quickly. The authors attempt to address these issues with the hel...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Our method can render various cloth fabrics with microcylinder {{appearance}} model under environment lighting at interactive frame rates. The insets {{show the}} environment maps. From left to right, cloth fabrics are linen plain, polyester <b>satin</b> charmuse, silk <b>crepe</b> de chine, velvet. This paper proposes an interactive rendering method of cloth fabrics under environment lighting. The outgoing radiance from cloth fabrics in the microcylinder model is calculated by integrating {{the product of}} the distant environment lighting, the visibility function, the weighting function that includes shadowing/masking effects of threads, and the light scattering function of threads. The radiance calculation at each shading point of the cloth fabrics is simplified to a linear combination of triple product integrals of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function, multiplied by precomputed spherical Gaussian convolutions of the weighting function. We propose an efficient calculation method of the triple product of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function by using the gradient of signed distance function to the visibility boundary where the binary visibility changes in the angular domain of the hemisphere. Our GPU implementation enables interactive rendering of static cloth fabrics with dynamic viewpoints and lighting. In addition, interactive editing of parameters for the scattering function (e. g. thread’s albedo) that controls the visual appearances of cloth fabrics can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this design}} {{was to create a}} sense of shock value through the {{textiles}} and silhouette. Teal has been forecasted as being a major textile theme this season in the apparel industry and I wanted to incorporate it in this rebellious design. The full tulle skirt was used to create volume and to integrate the sheer trend of 2014. Process: Extensive fabric and silhouette trend research was conducted to during the conception of this design. Teal satin was chosen as the primary color/textile to add a shocking pop. The short princess seam dress under the full sheer tulle skirt creates an extreme juxtaposition between the texture and sheet of the textiles and the silhouettes of each. Techniques: Draping was used to create this garment. Draping is covering the body in graceful folds to adorn the body for the correct fit. From the draping, a pattern was made and, from the pattern, a sample was made to fit on my model. From the fitting, changes to the pattern was made and the final garment was started. Princess seams were utilized in the dress to create a form fitting shape and to further flatter the wearer’s body. The tulle skirt was more challenging in construction. The many yards of tulle were tamed, pleated, and basted in place prior to it being sewn into the waistband. Materials: 100 -percent polyester black tulle, teal <b>crepe</b> <b>satin,</b> polyester lining, two invisible zippers, thread...|$|R
50|$|The town {{is known}} for two annual events, with traditions found nowhere else. The better known {{of these is the}} {{creation}} of “cabo del año” (end of the year) altars for family members who have died in the past year. Like the rest of Mexico, residents of Huaquechula celebrate Day of the Dead, with the traditional “ofrenda” or altar for all loved ones, but those who have died received their own altar on the first Day of the Dead after their demise. These altars are generally very large {{in the form of a}} pyramid, covered in white <b>satin</b> or <b>crepe</b> paper, folded and gathered over the facade to simulate clouds. The upper levels are supported with columns, most often in Baroque estipite. The altars are a fusion of pre Hispanic ornamental tradition and altars originally created for Maundy Thursday, which accounts for their white character. They are constructed anew for each recently deceased and materials can cost between 3,000 and 15,000 pesos, depending on size and richness of adornment.Most cabo del año altars have three levels although sometimes this varies. The lowest level represents life on earth for the deceased. A photograph of the person is placed in the center, traditionally arranged so that it can be viewed only indirectly with a mirror. There are several theories as to why, such as the mirror represents the entrance to the beyond or underworld, a representation of eternity or a symbol that the person is no longer here. Around the photo are various offerings of things that the person liked in life. The most common are food items such as plates of mole, tamales, sweets, fruit, hot chocolate, atole, tequila, mezcal and beer. There are also particular breads baked for these kinds of altars in this town such as “hojaldra” to represent the skull and bones of the deceased, a “rosquete” to represent the face and pan de muerto to represent the human body covered in its own blood (sugar colored red). There are also wax candles to give light in the darkness, twelve images of angels, one for every month of the year, incense and images of crying angels to represent the bereaved family. There can also be sugar miniatures of animals such as sheep, ducks and donkeys, especially if the deceased was a child. The second level is dedicated to the link between humanity and the Divine, as well as heaven. Here images of angels, the Virgin Mary and the Host can be found along with religious relics and candles of various sizes. In many of the altars today, these have been replaced all or in part with electric bulbs. Decorative elements include sugar skulls, incense burners and marigold flowers. The third level is dedicated to the Divine, often represented with a cross or an image of the Trinity.|$|R
