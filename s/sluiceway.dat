Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a <b>sluiceway,</b> or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E

Before the last ice age, Kitchen Creek had a much smaller drainage basin; during the ice age, glaciers covered all of the park except the Grand View outcrop. About 20,000years ago the glaciers retreated to the northeast and glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a <b>sluiceway,</b> or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek.

2500|$|Imperial Dam {{was built}} to replace the Laguna Diversion Dam, built in 1901–1915, {{which was the first}} dam and {{reclamation}} project on the Colorado River. Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and 72 [...] scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California <b>sluiceway,</b> which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top [...] per second—more than 50 times the flow of the Rio Grande.|$|E

It is somewhat like navigating a thunder-spout.

5000|$|The city began {{construction}} on Barrett Dam in 1921, {{under the direction}} of engineer Hiram N. Savage. In December of that year, unusually heavy rainfall filled the reservoir behind the incomplete dam, very nearly causing its failure. Over the following few months, construction was hurried in order {{to keep up with the}} rising lake, which was only held back by wooden flashboards as the water level actually exceeded the height of the poured concrete for most of the construction period. Temporary <b>sluiceways</b> had to be maintained in order to drain excess water from the lake, which consistently threatened to overtop the dam.

500|$|Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) and Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) were {{byproducts}} produced {{through the}} burning of coal in the station. Bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers {{at the bottom of}} the boilers by high pressure water jets.

Two barges provided this service over the years; Sir Fon and MVA. The barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to the east of the stations. However, dumping in the sea stopped in 1992 when the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships prevented further dumping in the North Sea.

40|$|Fish may {{be exposed}} to {{damaging}} levels of fluid shear stress and turbulence while passing through hydroelectric power plants. The generally assumed locations for such potential damage are the turbine and draft tube passages, although {{it is possible that}} fish are also injured during passage over the spillway or through <b>sluiceways</b> and fish bypass outfalls. Unless mitigated, fluid-induced injuries and mortality could frustrate efforts to develop advanced, fish-friendly turbines or to provide safe alternate downstream passages. The effects of shear stress and turbulence on fish are poorly understood, {{in part because of the}} difficulties in conceptualizing these phenomena, determining their magnitudes and distribution within hydroelectric systems, and then recreating them in a controlled laboratory environment. We define the fluid phenomena that are relevant to the assessment of effects on fish. The magnitudes of fluid stresses associated with man-altered aquatic environments are often considerably higher than those found in natural environments (e. g., normal river flows). However, levels of shear stresses that occur during flash floods appear to be comparable to those expected within a turbine. Past studies of the effects of shear stress on fish are of limited value, mainly because of their narrow scope and lack of instrumentation to measure velocities on appropriately small scales. A laboratory experiment to study the effects of shear stress and turbulence on fish is described...|$|R
40|$|This video captures a {{collaborative}} effort to explore the role of art in both local and global environmental issues. Through a creek walk that engages both the environment and community members, the authors hope to assess the efficacy of their project and reinvigorate dialogue of art and environmental issues Climate change is a global phenomenon with diverse and often unclear local indices. This project {{is concerned with the}} artistic negotiation of a particular local context of environmental transformation - the creek systems of the Illawarra region, New South Wales, Australia. Subject to industrial and suburban development, directed into <b>sluiceways</b> and drains, and criss-crossed with roads and railway lines, the creeks flow from the inland escarpment to the sea. Informed by contemporary socially engaged art practice and notions of 2 ̆ 7 ground-truthing 2 ̆ 7, our approach is to walk the creeks - to start at the beach and to follow the creeks upstream as far as we can. We encounter weeds, trash, fences, dead-ends and occasional bits of carefully crafted 2 ̆ 7 natural creek line 2 ̆ 7. We walk in small groups and invite people to join us. We take photographs and write about the walks. The walks are structured as conversations in which we collectively engage with neglected everyday indices of environmental change. In pursuing this project we regularly encounter questions concerning the role of art in engaging with both local and global environmental issues. Our aim here is to produce a video of one of our walks in which we not only explore a particular creek line but also discuss issues related to art and environmental activism. It will be framed as a plein air dialogue considering issues such as: the role of art in discerning local features of global environmental change; the shifts in art entailed in rendering it as literal experience and conversation; and the potential risks associated with subsuming art into activism. Our specific interest, in this context, is in discovering whether our local activities can be effectively communicated via a short film and contribute to another level of discussion that innovatively ties together local and global concerns...|$|R
