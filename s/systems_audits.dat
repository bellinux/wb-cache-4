40|$|The {{variety of}} quality systems {{is a very}} {{important}} and an actual theme in the agri-food sector. These quality systems are only partly acknowledged by different quality standard organizations, but customers within the supply chain demand them. Enterprises, which supply different customers and export abroad this, face the problem that {{they have to deal with}} several standards and implement them within the enterprise as well as take part in several <b>systems</b> <b>audits</b> and certifications. The economic problem consists of determining the most efficient introduction of a quality system or a combination of quality systems in the enterprise. The emphasis of the work lies in the development of a framework for the benchmarking of quality systems at all stages of the agri-food production and an allocation and operationalisation of cost and benefit categories. A concept including the database “QualintSys” was developed during a PhD-thesis to estimate the costs and benefits of quality systems.

40|$|This article {{reflects}} {{the topic of}} IT audit – information technology audit – with respect to research, consulting and teaching. The expression 'IT audit' comprises information <b>systems</b> <b>audits</b> {{as well as information}} security audits combining the short-term to long-term management of the IT infrastructure with its daily operation in order to achieve the organization's objectives. No overall common standard procedure for an IT audit works generally. However, standard procedures for IT audits, e. g. ISO 27001, are available, which must be particularly adapted and customized to fulfil a company's needs. This task requires experts. Thus, students of all Information Systems Bachelor or Master programs are trained to work in IT audit projects or even to lead them. This paper presents a case study, concerning the IT audit of organizations acting in the Swiss social insurance environment. The derived concepts are discussed. A best practice for the transfers of knowledge to students in terms of connecting research and consulting is proposed and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Project-based Emissions Trading Schemes, {{like the}} Clean Development Mechanism, are {{particularly}} prone to problems of asymmetric information between the project {{parties and the}} regulator. Given the specificities of these schemes, the regulator’s optimal monitoring strategy significantly differs from the one to be applied for capand- trade schemes or environmental taxes. In this paper, we extend the general framework on incomplete enforcement of policy instruments to reflect these specificities. The main focus of the analysis {{is to determine the}} regulator’s optimal spot-check frequency under the plausible assumption that the submitted projects vary with respect to their verifiability. We find that, given a limited monitoring budget, the optimal monitoring strategy is discontinuous, featuring a jump within the set of projects with lower verifiability. In this region, actual abatement is low and can fall to zero. For these cases, the sign of the slope of the strategy function depends on the actual relationship of the abatement cost and the penalty function. We conclude that, in a real-world context, project admission should ultimately be based on the criterion of verifiability. environmental regulation, emissions trading <b>systems,</b> <b>audits</b> and compliance...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hospitals face an {{increasing}} pressure towards efficiency and cost reduction while ensuring patient safety. This warrants a closer {{examination of the}} trade-off between production and protection posited in the literature for a high-risk hospital setting (intensive care). Purposes: Based on extant literature and concepts on both safety management and organizational/safety culture, this study investigates to which extent production pressure (i. e., increased staff workload and capacity utilization) and safety culture (consisting of safety climate among staff and safety tools implemented by management) influence the occurrence of medical errors and if/how safety climate and safety tools interact. Methodology / Approach: A prospective, observational, 48 -hour cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 57 intensive care units. The dependent variable is the incidence of errors affecting those 378 patients treated throughout the entire observation period. Capacity utilization and workload were measured by indicators such as unit occupancy, nurse-/physician-to-patient ratios, levels of care, or NEMS scores. The safety tools considered include Critical Incidence Reporting <b>Systems,</b> <b>audits,</b> training, mission statements, SOPs/checklists and the use of barcodes. Safety climate was assessed using a psychometrically validated four-dimensional questionnaire. Linear regression was employed to identify the effects of the predictor variables on error rate, as well as interaction effects between safety tools and safety climate. Findings: Higher workload has a detrimental effect on safety while safety climate - unlike the examined safety tools - has a virtually equal opposite effect. Correlations between safety tools and safety climate as well as their interaction effects on error rate are mostly nonsignificant. Practice Implications: Increased workload and capacity utilization increase the occurrence of medical error; an effect that can be offset by a positive safety climate but not by formally implemented safety procedures and policies.

BACKGROUND Over the last several decades, both manufacturing processes and power plants have been significantly changed by the rapid evolution of process control systems. Each new generation of technology has im proved manufacturing quality and productivity. Each new technology forces a reevaluation of audit meth ods to assure proper application of the new systems. Prior to 1960 s, manufacturing industries were adequately staffed with knowledgeable personnel with a detailed understanding of the process and operation of the plant. Without automation, plants relied upon resident experts to run and maintain their equipment. Automation was single or cascaded controllers with limited functionality. With the advent of the modern computer and the microprocessor during the 1970 s, industry immediately accelerated the automation process. Corporate cost cutting measures and the down sizing trend of the 1980 s, consequently eroded much of the front-line expertise in plant operation, engi neering and maintenance. The elimination of experi enced supervisors and engineers placed increasing responsibility on process operators. Without the ex pertise of their predecessors, each new generation of operators became more dependent upon the contro...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{due to the}} {{existing}} competitiveness among companies and the open economy characteristic of the European Union, {{it is essential to}} pay attention to human resources and workplace conditions as to what company survival refers. Proper workplace conditions not only reduce economic costs due to the occupational hazard reduction, but also contribute to increasing the efficiency of the workers {{and the quality of the}} company. To achieve these goals in the company, it is of an utmost importance to establish and introduce in the work environment a Safety and Health management system which should be efficient and guarantee a continuous improvement following the principles of PLAN, DO, CHECK and ACT. Within the variety of management systems, the OHSAS 18001 model has had a wide acceptance at a global level and has been implemented by various sectors, mainly due to two important characteristics of it, its Integration with Quality and Environment management systems and the possible certification. The main goal of the OHSAS standard is to support and foster good practice regarding safety and health in the workplace through a systematic and structured management going beyond the legal requirements. To be able to assess the efficiency of these management <b>systems,</b> <b>audits</b> must be used. Audits allow monitoring and verifying the efficient implementation and assess if the level of conformity of the management system elements is appropriate with the requirements. The goal of this project is to make and audit, adjusting as much as possible with the real procedures used in it, thus making all the stages defined in an audit, from the initial reunion to the final reunion, going through the interviews and the on-site reviews. To achieve this goal, collaboration from an electrical distributor company has been demanded, where an audit has been performed with the intention of determining the degree of compliance of the organization with the requirements of the OHSAS management system to use it as a guide for future certification...|$|E

40|$|Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) {{was born}} out of the need to create a UK tax {{authority}} by merging both the Inland Revenue and HM Customs & Excise into one department. HMRC encounters spreadsheets in tax-payers ’ systems on a very regular basis as well as being a heavy user of spreadsheets internally. The approach to spreadsheet risk assessment and spreadsheet audit is by the use of trained computer auditors and data handlers. This, by definition, limits the use of our specialist spreadsheet audit tool to such trained staff. In order to tackle the growing use of spreadsheets, a new way of approaching the problem has been piloted. The aim is to issue all staff who come across spreadsheets with a simple to use analysis and risk assessment tool, based on the departmental software SpACE (Spreadsheet Audit & Compliance Examination). 1. BACKGROUND Historically, UK tax authorities have been encountering spreadsheets during <b>systems</b> <b>audits</b> at businesses since the inception of spreadsheets; however the risks inherent didn’t immediately manifest themselves and it was some time before they became apparent and were ultimately acknowledged. Initially it was computer auditors who, having recognised the existence of these risks, were able to address them using software tools to examine the spreadsheet in detail at file level rather than as hard copies. In fact, Ray Butler’s paper, “Is this spreadsheet a tax evader ” did much to raise awareness of those risks, and it was subsequently to help prove the problem was common amongst the international community and was not restricted to the United Kingdom. Spreadsheets used by businesses may serve many purposes, some of which include the monitoring or controlling of both direct or indirect taxes, which in the UK includes taxes such as VAT, Corporation Tax and PAYE. They usually play a major role within the business accounts and will likely be found at the most critical points in the audit trail, significantly impacting upon the revenue base. They are often designed and developed by company employees who are rarely qualified to do so and are seldom checked {{to make sure they do}} what was actually intended, not realising that creating a spreadsheet is akin to programming and the untested spreadsheet is as dangerous and untrustworthy as an untested program...|$|E
