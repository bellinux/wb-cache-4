Weekend Edition Saturday usually slots musical performances, arts stories or interviews in <b>segment</b> <b>C.</b> Weekend Edition Sunday uses the time for its weekly puzzle segment with Will Shortz, as well as interviews and light features. At {{the end of the}} segment, Simon or Martin will read the credits and sign off for the hour. <b>Segment</b> <b>C</b> is followed by a forty-second funding credit announcement, and then ninety seconds of music.|$|E

50|$|These are a {{class of}} Nankai megathrust earthquakes, {{frequently}} occurring in combination with, or following, a rupture of <b>segments</b> <b>C</b> and/or D (Tōnankai zone, yielding Tōnankai earthquakes) and sometimes segment E (Tōkai zone, yielding Tōkai earthquakes). They are also known as Nankaidō earthquakes (Nankaidō jishin).|$|R
50|$|The Tōnankai {{earthquakes}} {{are major}} megathrust earthquakes {{that affect the}} Tōnankai region (Southeastern Sea) of Japan, between the Tōkai region (Eastern Sea) and Nankaidō (Southern Sea Circuit) region, and are caused by ruptures in the Tōnankai zone of the Nankai megathrust, specifically <b>segments</b> <b>C</b> and/or D.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Segment</b> <b>C</b> {{kicks off}} at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or {{as many as}} three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs {{immediately}} after <b>Segment</b> <b>C</b> at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will [...] "break format" [...] and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.|$|E
50|$|On {{all but one}} occasion, rupture of <b>segment</b> <b>C</b> (±D ±E) {{has been}} {{followed}} by rupture of segments A+B within a few years.

30|$|A third {{scenario}} {{corresponding to}} the <b>Segments</b> <b>C</b> and E (Fig. 7 (d)), which are {{the northern and southern}} extended content of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki rupture area, respectively, has a relatively low coupling (Uchida and Matsuzawa, 2011) and small to intermediate values in ΣM 0 (Fig 5). Moreover, these two zones are characterized by moderate earthquakes (M ~ 7) that repeat approximately every ~ 20 yr (Loveless and Meade, 2010), which may indicate a plate interface behavior only capable of producing moderate earthquakes. Additionally, two M > 7.0 aftershocks of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake occurred approximately 20 - 30 min later at both the northern and southern edges of the rupture area, inducing an increase of up-dip seismic moment release in <b>Segments</b> <b>C</b> and E (Fig. 5 (a)). These two segments may have been loaded by the mainshock (Miyazaki et al., 2011).|$|R

50|$|The usage {{primarily}} {{comes to}} us from translations of Euclid's Elements, in which two line segments a and b are called commensurable precisely if there is some third <b>segment</b> <b>c</b> that can be laid end-to-end a whole number of times to produce a segment congruent to a, and also, with a different whole number, a segment congruent to b. Euclid did not use any concept of real number, but he used a notion of congruence of line segments, and of one such segment being longer or shorter than another.|$|E

5000|$|Fossils {{from the}} front of a snout of a plesiosaur were {{discovered}} in 2000 on the property of Jorge Muñoz, in Loma La Cabrera, near Villa de Leyva in Boyacá, Colombia, on grounds of marine origin dating from the Barremian epoch of the Cretaceous. Muñoz reported the find to the local authorities, who in turn gave notice to staff of the Museo Geológico José Royo y Gómez in the Colombian Geological Survey in Bogotá. Then was made the excavation of the nearly complete skeleton between 2004 and 2005, in collaboration with the Fundación Colombiana de Geobiología (Colombian Geobiology Foundation), and the remains being then transferred to Bogotá, assigning the catalog number VL17052004-1, for preparation and study. The remains were found articulated mostly in the <b>Segment</b> <b>C</b> of the Arcillolitas Abigarradas Member of the Paja Formation, with kaolinitic argillite corresponding to an intertidal marine environment, with several specimens of ammonites or impressions of these in the rock matrix, including one inside the skull. These ammonites include the species Gerhardtia galeatoides, G. provincialis and the genus Heinzia, typical of the Barremian. German paleontologist Oliver Hampe made an initial description of the specimen in 2005, classifying it as Brachauchenius sp., i.e. as an indeterminate species of this genus, previously only recorded in the Upper Cretaceous of the United States, and it constitute the first reappearance of non-rhomaleosaurid pliosaurs after a hiatus between the Berriasian to Hauterivian. In 2016, María Páramo, Marcela Gómez-Pérez, Fernando Etayo and Leslie Noé made a more complete description and they designated to VL17052004-1 as holotype of a new genus and species, Stenorhynchosaurus munozi. The genus name is derived from the Greek words stenos, [...] "narrow"; rhyncho, [...] "snout" [...] and saurus, [...] "lizard", while the species name, munozi is in recognition of Jorge Muñoz by discover and report the fossil.|$|E
30|$|To quantitatively {{estimate}} the lateral {{variation of the}} P-wave velocities within the topmost mantle wedge, we assumed that the P-wave was laterally uniform {{at the bottom of}} the forearc lower crust (7.0 km/s, Takahashi et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2005), and that the tomographic velocities at the depth of the forearc Moho were the average of the velocities {{at the bottom of the}} lower crust and the top of the mantle wedge. Along profile NS 1, we projected the fore-arc Moho where the tomographically-derived velocity was about 7.3 km/s in segment B, and where it was about 7.5 km/s in <b>segment</b> <b>C.</b> In accordance with the assumption of lateral uniformity, we estimated the P-wave velocity of the topmost mantle wedge to be about 7. 5 km/s in segment B and 8.0 km/s in <b>segment</b> <b>C.</b> Similarly along profile NS 2, we projected the forearc Moho onto where the tomographically derived velocity was about 7.1 km/s in segment B, and onto where it was about 7. 5 km/s in <b>segment</b> <b>C,</b> which means that the P-wave velocity of the topmost mantle wedge was about 7.2 km/s in segment B and about 8.0 km/s in <b>segment</b> <b>C.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{segment of}} the megathrust {{to the east of}} the rupture area for the 1944 {{earthquake}} has not ruptured since 1854 and the likelihood of a 'Tokai earthquake' is considered to be high. There is no evidence that this segment has ruptured on its own in the past, although this cannot be ruled out. Any rupture of segment E may also include <b>segments</b> <b>C</b> & D, possibly causing a repeat of the damaging 1854 Tōkai earthquake.|$|R

The <b>segments</b> <b>C</b> Ci have the same length - 2r - for all i. Therefore the triangle C C1 C2 is isosceles, and its third side - C1 C2 - has a side length of less than 2r. Therefore the circles 1 and 2 intersect - a contradiction.|$|R

40|$|Arm swing is an {{essential}} component in regulating dynamic stability of the whole body during walking, while the contribution of active arm swing to local dynamic stability of different motion segments remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of arm swing under natural arm swing condition and active arm swing condition on local dynamic stability and gait variability of the trunk <b>segments</b> (<b>C</b> 7 and T 10 joint) and lower extremity joints (hip, knee and ankle joint). The local divergence exponents (λsλs) and mean standard deviation over strides (MeanSD) of 24 young healthy adults were calculated while they were walking on treadmill with two arm swing conditions at their preferred walking speed (PWS). We found that in medial–lateral direction, both λsλs and MeanSD values of the trunk <b>segments</b> (<b>C</b> 7 and T 10 joint) in active arm swing condition were significantly lower than those in natural arm swing condition (p 0. 05, respectively). In anterior–posterior and vertical direction, neither λsλs nor MeanSD values of all body segments showed significant difference between two arm swing conditions (p > 0. 05, respectively). These findings indicate that active arm swing may help to improve the local dynamic stability of the trunk segments in medial–lateral direction...|$|R
