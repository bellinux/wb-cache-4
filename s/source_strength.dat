A second {{cause of}} {{diminution}} in {{the force of}} the voltaic battery, consequent upon its own action, is that extraordinary state of the surfaces of the metals (969.) which was first described, I believe, by Ritter[A], to which he refers the powers of his secondary piles, and which has been so well experimented upon by Marianini, and also by A. De la Rive. If the apparatus, fig. 103. (1096.), be left in action for an hour or two, with the wire 3 in contact with the plate p, so as to allow a free passage for the current, then, though the contact be broken for ten or twelve minutes, still, upon its renewal, only a feeble current will pass, not at all equal in force to what might be expected. Further, if P^{1} and P^{2} be connected by a metal wire, a powerful momentary current will pass from P^{2} to P^{1} through the acid, and therefore in the reverse direction to that produced by the action of the zinc in the arrangement; and after this has happened, the general current can pass through the whole of the system as at first, but by its passage again restores the plates P^{2} and P^{1} into the former opposing condition. This, generally, is the fact described by Ritter, Marianini, and De la Rive. It has great opposing influence on the action of a pile, especially if the latter consist of but a small number of alternations, and has to pass its current through many interpositions. It varies with the solution in which the interposed plates are immersed, with the intensity of the current, the strength of the pile, the time of action, and especially with accidental discharges of the plates by inadvertent contacts or reversions of the plates during experiments, and must be carefully watched in every endeavour to trace the <b>source,</b> <b>strength,</b> and variations of the voltaic current. Its effect was avoided in the experiments already described (1036. &c.), by making contact between the plates P^{1} and P^{2} before the effect dependent upon the state of the solution in contact with the zinc plate was observed, and by other precautions.|$|E

50|$|Kirchhoff and Helmholtz showed, {{that the}} {{radiation}} of sound from a limited source region {{can be described}} by enclosing this source region by a control surface - the so-called Kichhoff surface. Then the sound field inside or outside the surface, where no sources are allowed and the wave operator on the left hand side applies, can be produced as a superposition of monopoles and dipoles on the surface. The theory follows directly from the wave equation. The <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> of monopoles and dipoles on the surface can be calculated if the normal velocity (for monopoles) and the pressure (for dipoles) on the surface are known respectively. A modification of the method allows even to calculate {{the pressure on the}} surface based on the normal velocity only. The normal velocity could be given by a FE-simulation of a moving structure for instance. However, the modification to avid the acoustic pressure on the surface to be known leads to problems, when considering an enclosed volume at its resonant frequencies, which is a major issue of the implementations of their method. The Kirchhoff integral method finds for instance application in Boundary element methods (BEM). A non-zero flow velocity is accounted by considering a moving frame of reference with the outer flow speed, in which the acoustic wave propagation takes place. Repetitive applications of the method can account for obstacles. First the sound field {{on the surface of the}} obstacle is calculated and then the obstacle is introduced by adding sources on its surface to cancel the normal velocity on the surface of the obstacle. Variations of the average flow field (speed of sound, density and velocity) can be taken into account by a similar method (e.g. dual reciprocity BEM).|$|E

Sink strength was varied by changing the temperature and the number and position of earlier formed fruits. Shading as well as heating for short periods showed that flowers/fruits were the most susceptible to abortion during the first week after anthesis. The different experiments where <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> was varied all showed that when <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> decreased, the rate of abortion increased linearly, whether <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> was decreased by shading, high plant density, or leaf pruning.

With the same <b>source</b> <b>strength,</b> the rate of abortion showed a close relationship with the growth rate of the earlier formed competing fruits, suggesting that the induction of abortion by earlier formed fruits is due to their sink strength. Most of the variation in abortion could be related to differences in vegetative growth rate, the latter being an indicator of the source-sink ratio. However, with the same vegetative growth rate, the rate of abortion was lower for the leaf pruning treatments where no competing fruits were retained than for the fruit load treatments. This indicates that although most of the variation in abortion can be related to the source and sink strength of the plant, some effects of competing fruits can only be explained by a combination of competition and dominance...|$|E

The Netherlands commission on radiation dosimetry (NCS) recently published recommended quality control procedures and detectors for the dosimetry of beta sources.

Well ionization chambers, a plastic scintillator, plane-parallel ionization chamber, diode and radiochromic film were used for determination of <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> (dose rate at reference distance) and uniformity of intravascular and ophthalmic sources. The <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> of multiple sources of each type was measured and compared with the <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> specified by the manufacturer. Results: The standard deviation of the difference between measured and specified <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> was mostly about 3 %, but varied between 0. 8 and 15. 8 % depending on factors such as source type, detector, phantom and manufacturers calibration. The average non-uniformity was about 7 % for intravascular sources and 20 % for ophthalmic sources.

In cases of airborne transmissible diseases in indoor environments, spatial patterns of the cases of infection can often be observed as the occupants were likely to have been exposed to different concentrations of the infectious particles. Existing models cannot incorporate the spatial pattern of infection in an outbreak when estimating the infectious <b>source</b> <b>strength,</b> which may cause errors in estimation. This research aims at performing retrospective estimation of the infectious <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> of an influenza outbreak case during a flight with the aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and likelihood estimation. The approach allows consideration of the spatial distribution of infection in the outbreak in the infectious <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> estimation. In 1999, 20 of 74 passengers were infected with influenza during a 3 hour flight in Australia. The case was reconstructed using CFD. Expiratory aerosols were released from the index case's mouth in the numerical model. Spatial and temporal distribution of the expiratory aerosols in the other passengers' breathing zones and the number of expiratory aerosols deposited on different surfaces were then obtained. Based on the distribution data, the Wells-Riley approach was then used to perform a set of infection risk assessments on the passengers by using a range of quantum generation rate values. Likelihood estimation was then used to correlate the passengers' infection risks to the actual outcome of the outbreak. The quantum generation rate resulting in the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was most likely to be the true infectious <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> in the case. Comparison between the infectious <b>source</b> <b>strength</b> estimated by this approach and that ignoring the spatial infection pattern was made.

A special case concerns large weapons, such as artillery or demolitions, which create high-energy blast waves.
