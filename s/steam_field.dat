It was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958, when New Zealand built a plant of its own in Wairakei. In recent years concerns have been expressed about the sustainability of its steam supply, as a 30% drop in steam pressure levels has been recorded from the maximum levels of the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Earth Sciences division, {{seismicity}} {{was very}} low {{prior to the}} use of the Geyser <b>steam</b> <b>field</b> for geothermal energy, although this may have been the result of low seismic coverage of the area. [...] Before 1969, there were no earthquakes above magnitude 2 recorded by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in an approximately 70 mi2 km2 area around the Geysers. [...] Studies have shown that injecting water into the Geysers field produces earthquakes from magnitude 0.5 to 3.0, although a 4.6 occurred in 1973 and magnitude four events increased thereafter. [...] Even with increasing injection rates over time, the rate of magnitude 3 earthquakes has remained relatively unchanged since the 1980s, although the absolute number of earthquakes has increased significantly. A magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck near the Geysers on January 12, 2014 and a magnitude 5.0 on December 14, 2016. [...] Despite the increases in the number of earthquakes and the fears of local residents, it is unlikely that a large earthquake will occur at the Geysers since there is no large earthquake fault or fracture nearby.|$|E
5000|$|The largest dry <b>steam</b> <b>field</b> in {{the world}} is the Geysers, 116 km north of San Francisco. It was here that Pacific Gas and Electric began {{operation}} of the first successful geothermal electric power plant in the United States in 1960. The original turbine lasted for more than 30 years and produced 11 MW net power. The Geysers has 1517 megawatt (MW) of active installed capacity with an average capacity factor of 63%. Calpine Corporation owns 15 of the 18 active plants in the Geysers and is currently the United States' largest producer of geothermal energy. Two other plants are owned jointly by the Northern California Power Agency and the City of Santa Clara's municipal Electric Utility (now called Silicon Valley Power). The remaining Bottle Rock Power plant owned by the US Renewables Group has only recently been reopened. A nineteenth plant is now under development by Ram Power, formerly Western Geopower. Since the activities of one geothermal plant affects those nearby, the consolidation plant ownership at The Geysers has been beneficial because the plants operate cooperatively instead of in their own short-term interest. The Geysers is now recharged by injecting treated sewage effluent from the City of Santa Rosa and the Lake County sewage treatment plant. This sewage effluent used to be dumped into rivers and streams and is now piped to the geothermal field where it replenishes the steam produced for power generation.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{proposals}} {{from various}} BOT and BOO proponents were entertained in 1988 and in {{early part of}} 1989. This culminated in the signing by end-1988 of a BOT agreement between the NPC and Hopewell Energy Management Limited of Hong Kong for the Installation of the two 110-megawatt turbine plants in Luzon. Gas turbines have been favored over conventional power plants due to their simplicity in construction, quick start capability, and ease of connection to the power grid and shorter installation period. The ultimate goal of NPC was to achieve the total electrification before the 21st century. For such ambitious plan, NPC envisioned the interconnection of all-independent grids in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao through the advanced system of overhead lines and submarine cables. In 1990, the Negros-panay interconnection project was finally put into operation. The 18.3 km submarine cables interconnecting the two islands enable NPC to utilize the excess steam from the Palimpinon Geothermal power plant in Negros. The project {{is part of the}} master plan to develop an electric superhighway for the entire country. The major component of this project is the interconnection of the Luzon grid to Leyte where the large <b>steam</b> <b>field</b> of Tongonan is located. Hand-in-hand with its efforts of ensuring the efficient power service, NPC endeavoured to assist {{in the development of the}} communities situated in areas where its power plants and transmission line facilities are located. On June 13, 1991, Pablo V. Malixi was appointed by President Corazon C. Aquino as the fourth president of the corporation replacing Ernesto M. Aboitiz who was named chairman of the National Power Board. In the same year, the National Power Corporation installed and commissioned 11 gas turbine units throughout the country to meet the urgent power supply deficiencies, caused by an extended dry spell. In addition, the state-owned power firm installed 768 diesel generator sets (with a total capacity of 19.7 KW) to serve the consumers in isolated islands - in line with NPC’s mission to bring the benefits of electricity to the farthest corners of the country. There was a change in NPC corporate leadership in 1993. Dr. Francisco L. Viray was named new NPC president. He took his oath of office on May 18, 1993 at Malacañang with President Fidel V. Ramos himself administering the oath. In September 1994, just 17 months after, there was another change in the corporate leadership. Guido Alfredo A. Delgado, a banker, assumed the post of NPC president at oath taking rites held in Malacañang on September 28. Delgado is the sixth president, and at 36, the youngest to assume the headship of NPC. He succeeded Dr. Viray who was designated Secretary of energy, vice former NP Board Chairman Delfin L. Lazaro who opted to retire from government service. NPC concluded the year 1995 with a total generating capacity of 9,507 megawatts (MW), a 4.84% rise from the 1995 figure of 9,068 MW. This was due to the commissioning of a number of power plants during the year by NPC and by independent power producers. Likewise, a total of 312 circuit km (195 miles) of new transmission lines were put up all over the country. NPC’s energy production rose to 33,296 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 1995, an 8.7% growth over a year-ago figures, while energy sales grew by 7.9% to 31,031 GWh. This expansion in production and sales matched the rising demand for power during the year which rose by 10.68% to 5,328 MW. In 1996, NPC commissioned the 10-kilowatt wind turbine power plant. In addition, the 700-mega Pagbilao coal-fired power plant built by Hopewell under the Build-Operate-Transfer scheme is commissioned into operation.|$|E
40|$|The {{boundaries}} of reservoir fluid convection cells are discreet and intricate zones, commonly sealed or reduced in permeabilities, {{which are often}} quite readily identifiable in many hydrothermal systems.

Hot water geothermal fields discharge steam-water mixtures, which have proved difficult to measure compared with the dry <b>steam</b> from <b>fields</b> like The Geysers and Lardarello. With {{the development of the}} lip pressure method, however (James 1962), an accurate method was derived which could measure the flow when a geothermal well discharges to the atmosphere at sonic velocity. Fortunately most discharges from wells do in fact attain such velocities, {{and as long as the}} enthalpy of the mixture is known, the flow can be determined. Where the enthalpy is unknown some other measurement has also to be made in order to solve the two factors of flow and enthalpy. By discharging the whole mixture into a silencer, the water portion can be estimated by means of a weir, and this provides the second measurement (described in James 1966) required to solve both unknowns. With the hoped-for commercial success of the total energy turbine in the near future, it will be necessary to have a means of measuring the steam-water flow into the machine. As long as the enthalpy of the flowing fluid is known, there should be no intrinsic difficulty in obtaining this, as the nozzles themselves act as metering devices due to the phenomena of sonic velocity at the throat. High gas concentrations in the steam phase, together with high chemical content in the water phase, require the use of “corrections” which will have to be determined from field tests to confirm theory. Clean steam-water mixtures appear to present no difficulties. 7 refs...|$|R
