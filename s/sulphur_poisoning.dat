Different molybdenum-cerium catalysts, with various atomic ratios (Mo/Ce = 0. 001, 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3), have been prepared and tested {{with respect to the}} black carbon (BC) combustion and the oxidation of propene before and after treatment under SO 2. Based on their catalytic behaviour and according to molybdenum loadings, the catalysts have been classified into two groups. The first is that of ceria and the catalysts with low molybdenum loading (1 Mo 1000 Ce, 1 Mo 100 Ce) which presents a good activity, an excellent CO 2 selectivity and a bad resistance to <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning.</b> However, the second group of catalysts containing higher molybdenum loadings (1 Mo 10 Ce, 2 Mo 10 Ce, 3 Mo 10 Ce) shows lower activity and CO 2 selectivity but a better resistance to <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning.</b> The role of molybdenum against ceria <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> has been evidenced...|$|E
40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) {{are high}} {{temperature}} solid-state electrochemical devices that convert fuel into {{electricity and heat}} with high efficiency. Many fuels suitable for SOFCs derive from hydrocarbon sources, such as natural gas or biogas; however, these contain significant impurities, most notably compounds containing sulphur, which can poison the nickel electrocatalyst in the anode of the fuel cell. Sulphur removal is usually carried out but it is complicated and expensive to achieve levels below 1 part per million (ppm). An enhanced scientific understanding of chemical interactions {{on the surface of}} SOFC electrodes is critical to the development of robust nickel-based anodes, but the mechanisms and effects of <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> are not fully understood. The scope of this thesis is to advance the field of sulphur-poisoning research by studying the effect of current density on the sulphur-induced degradation, and focuses on intermediate-temperature (IT) conditions with nickel-gadolinia doped ceria (Ni-CGO), which is the most promising anode material for IT-SOFCs, operating between 600 – 800 °C. The work of this thesis is aimed at (i) investigating the kinetics of <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning,</b> and the effect of current density, by use of a specially built three-electrode electrochemical test rig; (ii) analysis of structural modifications to the anode microstructure as a result of exposure to fuel cell conditions and (iii) development and prototype testing of a miniature SOFC test rig with optical access for in situ Raman spectroscopy. Fuel cell operation at higher current density was found to partially mitigate the <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> of up to 3 ppm H 2 S in H 2 fuel, while microstructural analysis found that the presence of as little as 0. 5 ppm H 2 S accelerated restructuring of nickel grain surfaces. Finally, preliminary proof-of-concept results were obtained for the in situ Raman rig, and suggestions for a future design are discussed.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{unresolved}} issues for fuel cells is to define a procedure to accelerate degradation phenomena occurring inside the cells {{in such a way}} as to obtain meaningful long-term results and information about the behaviour of the system in a shorter time. To define an accelerated testing protocol, a lot of different parameters have to be considered, all of them strongly dependent each other and concurring to determine the end of life of a fuel cell. A preliminary literature review of the majors degradation phenomena was assessed to better understand the correlation of degradation mechanisms, occurring inside MCFCs, cell components and operative parameters, pointing out that electrolyte loss is the only degradation mechanism connected with all the operative parameters. The aim of this work is to carry out a deep study of the electrolyte evaporation in a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and by this mechanism to evaluate the possibilities for inducing controlled acceleration of superimposed degradation phenomena, for this reason at the end of this experimental campaign, the effect of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide <b>poisoning</b> was evaluated, making possible a direct comparison between degradation coming from electrolyte loss and degradation coming from <b>sulphur</b> dioxide <b>poisoning.</b> The first interpretation of long term tests carried out with MCFC button cells (3 cm 2) will be presented in the attempt to better understand how evaporation loss takes place and could be accelerated...|$|R

Today Scania offers the largest variety of engines operating on alternative fuels in the market. The {{number of the}} alternative fuel operated vehicles sold in 2016 increased by 40 % [1]. Nevertheless, one of the alternative fuels – biodiesel - {{is a source of}} inorganic contaminants. These impurities can detrimentally affect the diesel truck after-treatment system that is responsible for harmful emission abatement. As a consequence, better understanding of the alternative fuel impact on the after-treatment system is necessary for further development of a sustainable transportation system.

30|$|This work follows on {{from a study}} over Pt/alumina and Pt/silica {{where the}} {{adsorption}} of hydrogen sulphide was examined in relation to its effect on steam reforming [8]. In this study, the adsorption of hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol over Rh/silica and Rh/alumina at 293  K will be examined and the amount compared with that found from carbon monoxide chemisorption. In this way, {{the total amount of}} hydrogen sulphide adsorption can be measured and related to the amount of surface rhodium. Competitive adsorption of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide will be examined as it is rare that a poison is present in the absence of another species (reactant or product). By comparing the competitive adsorption, an assessment can be made as to the relative strength of adsorption between carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide. The extent hydrogen sulphide may adsorb in the presence of carbon monoxide can give an insight into <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> of carbon monoxide hydrogenation over rhodium. The adsorption of hydrogen sulphide will be examined at high temperature (873  K) in the absence and presence of hydrogen, to understand whether hydrogen is effective at reducing the amount of sulphur adsorbed. Le Chatelier’s principle indicates that the amount of sulphur adsorbed should be reduced; however {{this will be the first}} experimental verification. This will inform our understanding of <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> in systems such as steam reforming.|$|E

Rhodium,. ruthenium, strontium, titanium, {{tungsten}} or zirconium, supported on gamma alumina {{have been investigated}} for methanation reaction. The catalyst was prepared by impregnation the mixed solution of nickel nitrate and soluble salt of the additive on gamma alumina pellets. The parameters studied include minimum methanation temperature, the apparent activation energy, the reaction order, surface area, the catalytic activity, concentration profile {{and the extent of}} <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning.</b> The correlations between the observed values of these parameters and measurable characteristics like intermetal heat of adsorption, ionic radius, electron density and metallic radius of the additive suggest that the catalytic behaviour of the nickel-bimetallic system is, under the influence of electron effects. However, geo-metric factors are also playing some part, It has been demonstrated that reducible oxides behave better than irreducible in maintaining catalytic activity, The addition of palladium, platinum, tungsten and chromium metals, famous for hydrogen spillover, improved the performance of the catalyst, supporting the fact that local concentration of hydrogen plays some part, The kinetic data indicates that reaction orders are strongly negative for all catalysts except Ni-pt /Al 2 O 3; in this case it becomes positive at higher temperatures. The reaction orders for catalysts except Ni-Ca/al 2 o 3 become less negative with increasing temperature, suggesting a competitive adsorption of co. The impregnation profiles of Zr, Co, Rh, Ir and Mo ions on alumina pellets relative to Ni ions suggest that ions of Co, Rh, Ir and Mo, because of higher charge density and ions of Zr, for larger ionic radius as compared to Ni ions, are preferentially adsorbed of restricted at the periphery.

40|$|The aim of {{this course}} of {{research}} was to further {{our knowledge of the}} mechanism of catalysts at the molecular level – thence, to form predictions and suggestions toward rational catalyst design. The first part of this work deals with catalysis on silver. Although well-known in selective oxidation, the potential of silver for chemoselective hydrogenation was only recently realised. Here, the hydrogenation of acrolein and crotonaldehyde was studied in ultra-high vacuum on the Ag(111) model catalyst. The delicate hydrogenation of both aldehydes to the desired unsaturated alcohol was demonstrated for the first time by temperature programmed reaction (TPR). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) showed unambiguously that the orientation of the C=C and C=O bonds with respect to the surface critically influences the outcome of the hydrogenation reaction. Using a similar approach, the hydrogenation chemistry of crotonaldehyde was studied on sulphur-modified Cu(111), to rationalise why sulphur enhances the selectivity of practical copper catalysts in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. The presence of <b>sulphur</b> (normally a <b>poison)</b> transformed the otherwise inert Cu(111) surface into an excellent catalyst for crotyl alcohol formation. A combination of TPR, XPS and NEXAFS showed that once again, the geometry of the adsorbed aldehyde was crucial in determining selectivity. In this case, the chemoselective reaction itself was observed not just by TPR, but also in situ by XPS and NEXAFS. The final Chapter of this thesis describes a significant breakthrough in chemoselective hydrogenation: the first demonstration of chemoselective hydrogenation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Here, results from ultra-high vacuum experiments are used to make a direct prediction of practical catalyst behaviour. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

However, several challenges {{are connected to the}} application ofcatalytic combustion in gas turbines. The first part of thisthesis reviews the use of catalytic combustion in gas turbines. The influence of the fuel has been studied and compared overdifferent catalyst materials. The material section is divided into two parts. The firstconcerns bimetallic palladium catalysts. These catalysts showeda more stable activity compared to their pure palladiumcounterparts for methane combustion. This was verified both byusing an annular reactor at ambient pressure and a pilot-scalereactor at elevated pressures and flows closely resembling theones found in a gas turbine combustor. The second part concerns high-temperature materials, whichmay be used either as active or washcoat materials. A novelgroup of materials for catalysis, i. e. garnets, has beensynthesised and tested in combustion of methane, a low-heatingvalue gas and diesel fuel. The garnets showed some interestingabilities especially for combustion of low-heating value, LHV,gas.

SO 2 poisons the catalyst, which results in a decrease of the NOx conversion with increasing SO 2 exposure time. The NOx storage capacity can be regained after regeneration of the catalyst. The regeneration is most effective using long regeneration time, high temperature and low lambda value. A measure of the regeneration efficiency, activity based sulphur removal (ASR), is defined. ASR is used to model the regeneration efficiency with the independent variables; regeneration time, temperature and lambda value. The model describes the experimental results well. The amounts of released SO 2, H 2 S and COS, during the regeneration differ depending on regeneration conditions. Low lambda values give high amounts of H 2 S and low amounts of SO 2, whereas the reverse is true for high lambda values. The production of COS is low in all cases. The results can schematically be described with a model where sulphur can migrate between deactivating and non-deactivating positions on the catalyst surface...|$|E

The experimental results demonstrate regeneration of the potassium formate solution using the thermal output from the SOFC {{in the first of}} its kind tri-generation system. Optimisation has shown that a 2. 2 L. min- 1 regenerator desiccant volumetric flow facilitates best performance. When integrated with the micro-SOFC, the open cycle desiccant system demonstrates a COP of approaching 0. 7, an encouraging value for a waste heat driven cooling system of this capacity. A tri-generation performance analysis is presented which serves to demonstrate the novel system operating in a building. The system achieved an electrical efficiency of 11 % and regeneration efficiency of approximately 37 %. The electrical efficiency is lower than that predicted by the company supplying the micro-tubular SOFC, because the unit suffered <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> during preliminary tests. The electrical power output decreased from 250 W to 150 W, which reduced the electrical efficiency from around 18 % to 11 % and the overall efficiency from approximately 45 % to just over 37 %.

The core component is based on a composite anode substrate made of porous Alumina forming alloy (NiCrAl), combined with an electron conducting oxide ceramic (La 0, 1 Sr 0, 9 TiO 3 -α – LST), without having pure Nickel as structural component. Two manufacturing routes were followed for the manufacturing of the electrolyte, plasma spraying or PVD avoiding thus a sintering step in air at high temperature. The first prototype have been produced through the plasma spraying route, with 100 µm thick electrolyte and without anode functional layer showed a very limited peak-performance measured at 20 mW/cm² at 750 °C. However no significant variation has been measured and no reactivity have been detected showing thus the stability of system under SOFC operating conditions. The plasma sprayed electrolyte has been successfully replaced by a thin electrolyte produced through the PVD route approach with a thickness reduced to less than 3 µm, allowing the incorporation of an anode functional layer, major improvement of cell performance is being expected [...] The project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) for the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology Initiative under grant agreement n° 303429...|$|E
40|$|The idea of gasifying (reforming) a {{fraction}} of a light crude oil in the reservoir, was conceived originally by Davidson and Yule((1)). This involved "stringing" a series of downhole gasification (DHG) units along either a horizontal producer well or vertical producer well, or along some other suitable well arrangement. Although catalytic steam reforming of naphtha practiced on a large scale has been extensively researched, such understanding is largely restricted to much lower pressures than those investigated in the present study. We present results obtained using a small, "pilot-scale" DHG unit, or reforming reactor, operated at up to 100 bar pressure. The feed to this unit was a light naphth{{a fraction}} cut from Statfjord crude oil. The effect of pressure, catalyst loading, steam to hydrocarbon ratio and gasifier temperature were investigated. Essentially, the conversion to inert gases, principally hydrogen and carbon dioxide, at high pressure was sufficiently high to make the process technically feasible in depleted light oil reservoirs. Furthermore, the economics of this novel enhanced oil recovery process, which also produces (and stores) hydrogen, appear to be very favourable. However, the experiments, which were conducted under pilot-scale conditions using a single tube reactor unit, were not of sufficient duration time to test the long-term effects on catalyst activity owing to carbon fouling and <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning.</b> These factors (at least carbon deposition) can be controlled as demonstrated in the experiments by adjusting the steam-to-hydrocarbon ratio and the depth of naphtha-cut taken from the crude oil. These aspects of the process are to be further investigated in a Phase 2 project...|$|E
40|$|Steam {{reforming}} is a {{well established}} industrial process {{for the formation of}} synthesis gas. It takes place in two reversible stages: the reforming reaction (1) followed by the water-gas shift reaction (2). (1) 	CnH 2 n+ 2 + nH 2 O		nCO + (2 n+ 1) H 2 (2) 	CO + H 2 O 	CO 2 + H 2 Reaction (1) is highly endothermic and is favoured at high temperatures and low pressure, while reaction (2) takes place at as low temperature as possible. One of the major problems affecting the steam reforming industry is catalyst deactivation due to <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Sulphur is present in the hydrocarbon feedstock and even after desulphurisation steps some sulphur still remains, from ppb to ppm levels. Such low levels of sulphur can still poison the catalyst due to the catalyst having a significant time on stream. It is therefore desirable to produce a catalyst that exhibits sulphur resistance to prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. In this project the behaviour of precious metal catalysts (Rh and Pt supported on La-ZrO 2, Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2) towards sulphur was examined. Two major aspects were studied, the catalysts’ adsorpitive behaviour towards sulphur and the effect of sulphur during the steam reforming reaction. Low pressure pulses of H 2 S and CH 3 SH over the catalysts followed by gas chromatography revealed that sulphur is a very strong adsorbing species, similar to CO, and could not be displaced by the adsorption of another species as there was no mechanism to desorb the sulphur species. The alumina supported catalysts offered some protection from <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning,</b> evidenced during co-adsorption experiments with CO, because the support was acting as a ‘sulphur sink’. Adsorption mechanisms were proposed for H 2 S at the different adsorption conditions tested: a 3 -site adsorption mechanism producing surface sulphides at room temperature and at higher temperatures bulk sulphides were formed. High pressure steam reforming reactions of ethane were carried out at three different temperatures (600 oC, 550 oC and 500 oC) to act as standards to the poisoned reactions, but also revealed interesting insights into the reforming of ethane. Each catalyst produced a unique reaction profile during steam reforming, with the La-ZrO 2 catalyst exhibiting greatest activity. The Rh catalysts showed high selectivity towards the formation of CH 4 due to the hydrogenolysis of C 2 H 6, which was not occurring over the Pt catalysts. The Pt catalysts were the least active and deactivated considerably as the result of carbon formation. Sulphur species, hydrogen sulphide and methanthiol, were introduced into the reaction by dissolving them in the feed water. It was found the identity of the sulphur species had a significant impact upon the extent of catalyst deactivation, with methanthiol having the most detrimental effect, which was attributed to the molecule decomposing and laying down carbon. None of the catalysts tested exhibited particularly high sulphur resistance, particularly with regard to methanthiol, however Rh/ZrO 2 did recover a lot of its original activity once the poison was removed from the feed. This was due to the removal of surface carbon rather than the removal of sulphur from the catalyst, because La-ZrO 2 has a faster rate of oxygen transfer and therefore a mechanism to remove surface carbon...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} partial oxidation (CPO) {{of natural}} gas over noble metal catalysts is an attractive way to obtain syngas (CO and H 2) which can be employed for downstream processes to produce synthetic fuels. The preliminary conversion of methane to syngas is also interesting {{in the context of}} advanced combustion systems with reduced NOx emissions. Several catalysts have been studied for CPO of methane, but Rh-based systems have established as the best performing catalysts in terms of both activity and selectivity. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> is a tricky issue for industrial processes, leading to catalysts loss of activity. Recently, the presence of sulphur containing compounds naturally occurring in natural gas or added as odorants necessary for safety reasons, was recognized as a serious drawback for the costly Rh catalysts. Indeed, sulphur adversely affects the catalytic performance during catalytic partial oxidation adsorbing onto Rh active sites, causing a (reversible) suppression of their steam reforming activity, with an associated risk of catalyst overheating during CPO autothermal operation. Therefore the development of catalysts that are intrinsically sulphur tolerant and are not readily poisoned by the amounts of sulphur commonly found in natural gas is desirable. On the basis of recent works that have shown that metal phosphide catalysts have promising hydrodesulphurization (HDS) properties due to a higher sulphur tolerance than the correspondent metal based catalysts, in this work, a novel structured Rh catalyst doped with phosphorous and supported on alumina, has been prepared and investigated during the CPO of methane under self-sustained conditions at short contact time in the presence of sulphur. Results were compared with the reference undoped Rh/γAl 2 O 3, showing a significant enhancement of the specific steam reforming reaction rate of P-doped catalyst, and a higher sulphur tolerance. Both the findings were correlated to the presence of phosphorous, whose interaction with Rh improved the metal dispersion on the support and inhibited the strong sulphur adsorption lowering the resulting surface S coverage. Since natural gas may comprise significant amounts of ethane beside methane, the CPO of ethane is also object of study, in the view of a direct use {{of natural gas}} as feed at the on-site gas field without separating respective components. The importance {{of the role of the}} gas phase chemistry, which was found negligible in the case of CH 4 CPO over Rh and Pt catalysts, increases for higher alkanes following the progressive lower stability of the C-H bond, as in the case of CPO of ethane or propane, when large quantities of ethylene can be formed with Pt based catalysts (but not with Rh). However, the literature data available in the field of <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> during CPO of higher hydrocarbon is so far scarce and somehow contradictory. Therefore, in the second part of this PhD thesis, the effect of sulphur addition to the feed during the CPO of ethane for syngas production (C 2 H 6 /O 2 = 1) has been investigated over more conventional Rh and Pt catalysts supported on a γ-alumina washcoat anchored to honeycomb monoliths. The findings obtained confirmed the previous results on CPO of methane on Rh: sulphur addition resulted in a rapid and reversible poisoning, depending on its concentration. However the adverse impact of sulphur is much larger on Rh than on Pt. Due to the more complex chemistry of ethane, two main effects related to the presence of sulphur during its CPO have been identified: i) the strong inhibition of the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane occurring on Rh but not on Pt; ii) the progressive inhibition of steam reforming of both the reactant (ethane) and one of the products, ethylene, whose formation in turn increases after the introduction of sulphur. The latter result was also observed for Pt catalyst. Since ethylene is thought to be mainly formed by the homogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, this result suggested the possibility to take advantage of selective <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> in order to maximize the formation of ethylene. The oxidative catalytic conversion of light alkanes (in particular ethane) to olefins is an attractive solution to obtain ethylene and propylene, the most important building blocks for the polymers industry. The CPO of ethane to ethylene (stoichiometric feed ratio C 2 H 6 /O 2 = 2) is characterized by a complicated chemistry which involves both heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction paths, whose contribution and synergy may be strongly alterated by S-poisoning. In the final part of this PhD work, S-poisoning of catalytic steam reforming of C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4 has been investigated as a strategy to increase the process selectivity and yield to ethylene during the CPO of ethane to ethylene (C 2 H 6 /O 2 = 2) over Rh and Pt catalysts. In other words, the possibility to use sulphur as an intentional selective poison of undesired heterogeneous reactions to boost the production of ethylene has been exploited. At the same time, taking advantage of the selective poisoning of sulphur on catalytic reforming paths, an attempt has been done to shed light on the complex interaction of hetero-homogeneous chemistry available in a C 2 H 6 CPO reactor, to understand the contribution of heterogeneous reforming reactions to the overall performance of the reactor...|$|E

Special {{attention was paid to}} the improvement of the resistance of the catalyst against <b>sulphur</b> <b>poisoning</b> by the H 2 S present in the gasification gas. Deactivation tests were performed on catalytic filter discs using either benzene, naphthalene or a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds in a simulated gasification gas containing up to 200 ppm H 2 S. At 900 degreesC and at a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s, the developed catalyst formulation shows a benzene conversion of 93 % (50 ppm H 2 S), 78 % (100 ppm H 2 S) and 57 % (200 ppm H 2 S). However, benzene is not a problematic compound concerning the utilization of biomass gasification. More important is the removal capacity of this catalytic filter disc for the problematic heavy tars like naphthalene. Subsequent deactivation tests with naphthalene and with a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds showed that for simulated gasification gas containing up to 100 ppm H 2 S and for a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s (typical value in real gas) the naphthalene conversion is 98 % in both cases. As a result, the target tar conversion (> 95 %) was achieved in typical hot gas filtration conditions. The significant improvement over a pure nickel based catalyst by adding the appropriate amount of CaO is encouraging towards the further improvement of the sulphur tolerance of this catalyst.
