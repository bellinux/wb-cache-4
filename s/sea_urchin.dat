5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot.

5|$|The <b>Sea</b> <b>Urchin</b> is a 1913 American silent short romantic drama film {{directed}} by Edwin August and starring Jeanie MacPherson and Lon Chaney. The film was {{the earliest known}} character role by Lon Chaney and the first screenplay by MacPherson. The story follows a hunchback fisherman, who finds a young girl and raised her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} marrying her. A handsome boy soon gains her affections and the hunchback threatens him with a knife. The next day, the boat tips over during an argument and the hunchback saves the girl. As the young lovers reunite, he sees how happy they are together and he takes his leave. The film was released on August 22, 1913 and was played across the United States. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E

5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> populations apparently controlled by other factors.

5000|$|Similarly, sea otters protect kelp forests from damage by {{consuming}} <b>sea</b> <b>urchins.</b> Kelp [...] "roots", called holdfasts, {{are merely}} anchors, {{and do not}} perform similar roles {{to the roots of}} terrestrial plants, which form large networks that acquire nutrients from the soil.
