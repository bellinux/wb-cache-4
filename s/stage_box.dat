60|$|Then {{followed}} the wonderful evening. Philip found Beatrice {{alone in the}} <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> {{when he returned from}} taking Elizabeth to her dressing-room.|$|E
60|$|We {{followed}} him on tiptoe {{to the front}} of the house. He unlocked the door of the left-hand <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> with a key which he took from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|My {{wife and}} I think {{of going to}} Boston May 7th to see Anna Dickinson's debut on the 8th. If I find we can go, I'll {{try to get a}} <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> and then you and Mrs. Howells must come to Parker's and go with us to the crucifixion.|$|E
50|$|The venue is {{situated}} on Old Ford Road in Bethnal Green, London. The hall, opened in 1929 with {{a capacity of}} 1,200, <b>stages</b> <b>boxing</b> {{as well as providing}} a gymnasium and swimming pool.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his status in boxing, and with help from a number of wealthy patrons, he opened his own amphitheatre in 1743, in Hanway Road, near Oxford Street. Here, Broughton and his team <b>staged</b> <b>boxing</b> exhibitions.|$|R
50|$|Knjazesko Srbski Teatar - First Serbian Court Theater {{was placed}} within the adapted {{premises}} of typography {{and it was}} a building with the <b>stage,</b> <b>boxes</b> and ground floor. The repertoire of the theater consisted mainly of his plays while the theater ensemble beside Vujic as a leading actor and director consisted of secondary school pupils and adult amateurs.|$|R
60|$|So {{we went in}} just as {{the curtain}} rose upon the first act of Rostand's great play. The house was packed with an immense audience. One box alone, the <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> on the left, was empty. I leaned over to Isobel, and would have told her the story which all the world knew.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} that you told me this," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that I can {{nevertheless}} promise you the <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> for Monday night. I have a call on it. We must all meet once more. It is just possible that I may have a pleasant surprise for both of you." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{passed into}} the <b>stage</b> <b>box,</b> where their entrance, {{although}} they kept {{as far as possible}} in the background, excited much comment. They felt at once that they had come into an atmosphere charged with electric emotion. Little ripples of excitement were floating through the theatre. Interest had become strained--almost painful. A brilliant house had been worked up into a state of breathless absorption. A little man burst in upon them.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom {{there is}} no indoor sport capable of {{attracting}} five-figure attendances on a regular basis, and this restricts the development of large indoor arenas. Nonetheless a number of 10,000+ seater arenas have been built {{in recent years and}} more are planned. These facilities make most of their income from pop concerts, but they occasionally <b>stage</b> <b>boxing</b> matches and other sporting events.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{he had the}} largest stable of prizefighters in the nation, and he <b>staged</b> <b>boxing</b> matches for many years at several Philadelphia sites. None of his boxers won a world championship, but several were highly ranked contenders in a period when boxing was a widely popular form of sports entertainment. In 1928, his stable of boxers became Max Hoff Inc. His group was {{the first group of}} prize fighters to be incorporated.|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{deals with a}} {{two-stage}} packing problem {{that has to be}} solved in the daily distribution process of a Portuguese trading company. At the first <b>stage</b> <b>boxes</b> including goods are to be packed on pallets while at the second stage these pallets are loaded into one or more trucks. The boxes have to be transported to different customers and the actual goal is to guarantee a sufficient utilization of the truck loading spaces. A two-stage packing procedure is proposed to cover both problem <b>stages.</b> First <b>boxes</b> are loaded onto pallets using a well-known container loading algorithm. Then trucks are filled with loaded pallets by means of a new tree search algorithm. The applicability and performance of the two-stage approach was evaluated with a set of instances that are based on actual company data...|$|R
6000|$|At this point, {{as might}} have been expected, {{spontaneous}} applause broke forth, originating in the right-hand <b>stage</b> <b>box.</b> Here was a daring defiance indeed, a courage of such a high order that it completely carried away the ladies and drew reluctant plaudits from the male element. [...] "Give it to 'em, Humphrey!" [...] said {{one of those who}} happened to be sitting next to Miss Flint, and who received a very severe pinch in the arm in consequence.|$|E
6000|$|How remote, how royal, how {{unattainable}} she {{had appeared}} to me that night! Now here she was a kindly, charming hostess, {{the mother of a}} family who regarded me as [...] "a distinguished author." [...] To make that radiant girl in the <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> and my lovely hostess coalesce was difficult, but as I studied her profile and noted the line of her expressive lips I was able to relate her to the princely player whose genius I had worshiped from the gallery.|$|E
60|$|In all {{the cases}} that I have {{examined}} this same error has crept in. I had often imagined, from the fact of people keeping fifteen servants, that they were rich. I had supposed that because a woman rode down town in a limousine to buy a fifty-dollar hat, she must be well to do. Not at all. All these people turn out on examination to be not rich. They are cramped. They say it themselves. Pinched, I think, is the word they use. When I see a glittering group of eight people in a <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> at the opera, I {{know that they are}} all pinched. The fact that they ride home in a limousine {{has nothing to do with}} it.|$|E
50|$|It is {{equipped}} with some unique technical solutions, such as power windows and modern ice-making installation. Advanced audio equipment (amplifiers, digital mixing engines and <b>stage</b> <b>boxes)</b> by Yamaha is installed in the Žalgiris Arena. The arena has 48 VIP suites, 21 suites for the Žalgiris basketball club and media, 9 suites for a single rent, an exhibition hall, and a fitness center. There are 8 halls in the Arena where more than 150 various events take place annually.|$|R
5000|$|Bloom {{was born}} March 9, 1870, in Pekin, Illinois, to Polish-Jewish {{immigrants}} who soon moved to San Francisco. He {{was introduced to}} theater production in his early teens, then became a theater manager, <b>staging</b> <b>boxing</b> matches featuring [...] "Gentleman Jim" [...] Corbett. Seeking ever more spectacular attractions, he attended the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris, where he was particularly taken with the dancers and acrobats of the [...] "Algerian Village," [...] somewhat representative of France's Algerian colony.|$|R
2500|$|Crewe {{trained in}} Paris and London, where, {{as a young}} man, he was a {{frequent}} visitor to Frank Matcham's home. Up to the mid-1890s Crewe collaborated with Sprague, producing the Lincoln Theatre Royal {{as well as a}} number of theatres around London. It was after he branched out on his own that he developed what was to become his characteristic Baroque-influenced style. His work around the turn of the century was marked by horizontal balconies tied to ranges of <b>stage</b> <b>boxes</b> and elaborate ornamental features.|$|R
60|$|Philip's {{disposition}} {{had been}} so curiously affected by the emotions {{of the last few}} months that he was not in the least surprised to find himself, that evening, torn by a very curious and unfamiliar spasm of jealousy. After an hour or so of indecision he made his way, as usual, to the theatre, but instead of going at once to Elizabeth's room, he slipped in {{at the back of the}} stalls. The house was crowded, and, seated in the <b>stage</b> <b>box,</b> alone and gloomy, his somewhat austere demeanour intensified by the severity of his evening clothes, sat Sylvanus Power with the air of a conqueror. Philip, unaccountably restless, left his seat in a very few minutes, and, making his way to the box office, scribbled a line to Elizabeth. The official to whom he handed it looked at him in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|During these hot {{words on}} both sides she had been {{standing}} at a pier-glass, arranging something in her dress intended to suit Moss's fancy upon the stage,--Moss {{who was about to}} enact her princely lover--and then she walked off without another word. She went through her part with all her usual vigour and charm, and so did he. Elmira also was more pathetic than ever, as the night was supposed to be something special, because a royal duke and his young bride were in the <b>stage</b> <b>box.</b> The plaudits given would have been tremendous only that the building was so small, and the grand quartette became such a masterpiece that there was half a column concerning it in the musical corner of the next morning's Daily Telephone. [...] "If that girl would only go as I'd have her," [...] said Mr. Moss to the most confidential of his theatrical friends, [...] "I'd make her Mrs. Moss to-morrow, and her fame should be blazoned all over the world before twelve months had gone as Madame Moussa." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{had visited}} the {{chambers}} which Lord Brownstone and Drake occupied together, and in girlish innocence had put on the gentlemen's clothes and danced before them. Then they all went to the theatre, where Golly's delightful simplicity and childish ignorance of the world had charmed them. Everything to her was new, strange, and thrilling. She even leaned from the carriage windows to see the [...] "wheels go round." [...] She {{was surprised at the}} number of people in the theatre, and insisted on knowing if it was church, because they all sat there in their best clothes so quietly. She believed that the play was real, and frequently, from a <b>stage</b> <b>box,</b> interrupted the acting with explanations. She informed the heroine of the design of the villain waiting at the wings. And when the aged mother of the heroine was dying of starvation in a hovel, and she threw a bag of bonbons on the stage, with the vociferous declaration that [...] "Lord Brownstone had just given them to her--but--Lordy!--SHE didn't want them," [...] they were obliged to lead her away, closely followed by an usher and a policeman. [...] "To think," [...] she wrote to John Gale, [...] "that the audience only laughed and shouted, and never offered to help! And yet look at the churches in London, where they dare to preach the gospel!" ...|$|E
50|$|Boxing Match; or, Glove Contest is an 1896 British short {{black-and-white}} silent documentary film, {{produced and}} directed by Birt Acres for exhibition on Robert W. Paul's peep show Kinetoscopes, featuring a <b>staged</b> <b>boxing</b> match between Sergeant-Instructor Barrett and Sergeant Pope with a round, an interval and a knockout. The film was considered lost until footage from an 1896 Fairground Programme, originally shown in a portable booth at Hull Fair by Midlands photographer George Williams, donated to the National Fairground Archive was identified as being from this film.|$|R

25|$|The theatre {{required}} minimal renovations {{for its new}} purpose: new paint {{of white}} and gold, some furnishings, and a drop curtain painted by Auguste Rubé. Four candelabra were fastened to the columns of the <b>stage</b> <b>boxes</b> and the busts of Corneille and Molière were replaced with ones of Gluck and Lully. A grand piano surmounted with a bust of Weber was installed in the foyer. Structural alterations were made to some ancillary spaces, including the conversion of stables used for horses in Dumas's historical dramas, into the musicians' green room.|$|R
5000|$|For {{temporary}} {{shows the}} <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> is {{placed at the}} side or rear of the stage. The <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> contains around 75% sends, and 25% returns. Both sends and returns tend to use XLRs; however, some systems use TRS A Gauge 1/4" [...] phone connector for the returns. Returns tend {{to be used for}} foldback (on-stage monitoring) or FOH returns at line level. Larger systems can be fitted with split points integrated into the <b>stage</b> <b>box,</b> providing both an input and an isolated output on each line. In this system, the split point could be connected to the foldback desk, via another multicore. Larger shows tend to use a system with subsnakes which plug into the main <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> so one can use shorter microphone leads on stage and have less clutter.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> and {{multicore}} cable is in live sound reproduction, especially where an audience is present. The discreet multicore cable and <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> {{can be used to}} effectively manage the cables from the microphones, and allows for one single cable to be trailed from the sound desk to the stage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> {{typically}} houses between 16 and 32 female XLR connectors; {{the actual}} input configuration {{depends on the}} number of channels contained in the multicore cable. All of the microphones and musical instruments connect to the <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> and then the multicore cable runs to the sound desk or audio mixer. There are often 4-8 Male XLR Connectors on the <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> which are called returns. Occasionally these are 6.3 mm phone connectors, but the use of Jack plugs or sockets on a multicore is strongly discouraged. The returns allow for the sending of line level audio from the sound desk to the stage for foldback and FOH.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{was decorated with}} a naval theme reflecting the history of Plymouth. Over the upper <b>stage</b> <b>boxes</b> were [...] "poop-lanterns" [...] resembling the sterns of three-deck warships; below these were crossed anchors with the centres containing ships' figureheads. Above the auditorium was a domed ceiling, which was decorated with [...] "historical paintings" [...] as was the proscenium. The scenes illustrated included the knighting of Sir Francis Drake by Queen Elizabeth I, [...] and the Spanish Armada. Medallions bearing portraits of naval and military heroes decorated {{the front of the}} gallery and grand circle.|$|R

50|$|A <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> is {{a rugged}} metal housing {{used in the}} audio {{engineering}} and entertainment fields to connect microphones and other sound equipment to the multicore cable. It functions {{as an extension of}} the equipment cables, allowing for the sound desk to be situated further away from the stage, and also as a single location for cables to be plugged in. The entire assembly of <b>stage</b> <b>box</b> and multicore cable is sometimes referred to as an audio snake or simply snake.|$|E
