40|$|Fish {{demonstrate}} the greatest variety of parental care strategies within the animal kingdom. Fish parents seldom provision food for offspring, with some exceptions predominantly found in substrate-brooding Central American cichlids and mouth-brooding African cichlids. Here, we provide {{the first evidence}} of food provisioning in a substrate-brooding African cichlid Neolamprologus mondabu. This fish is a maternal substrate-brooding cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika, and feeds on benthic animals using unique techniques–individuals typically feed {{on the surface of}} sandy substrates, but also expose prey by digging up substrates with vigorous wriggling of their body and fins. Young also feed on benthos on the substrate surface, but only using the first technique. We observed that feeding induced by digging accounted for 30 % of total feeding bouts in adult females, demonstrating that digging is an important foraging tactic. However, parental females fed less frequently after digging than non-parental females, although both females stayed in pits created by digging for approximately 30 s. Instead, young gathered in the pit and fed intensively, suggesting that parental females provision food for young by means of digging. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the feeding frequency of young before and after digging that was <b>simulated</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> and observed that young doubled their feeding frequency after the simulated digging. This suggests that parental females engage in digging to uncover food items that are otherwise unavailable to young, an...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{and their}} mechanical properties have been closely investigated {{since the late}} 1990 s. Initially researches were mainly focused on using of CNTs to reinforce polymer and ceramic matrices, later – on the reinforcing of metallic matrices. Thus, CNT-reinforced aluminium has potential applications in the aerospace, automotive and sports industries where light weight combined with high stiffness and strength is desired. Technologies of nanocomposite metals production are expensive and complex. For this reason it is perspective to apply non-destructive methods and to use specimens with small dimensions for determination of material properties. The specimens with cross-section 10 x 2 mm and a length of 60, 70, 80 mm {{was used in the}} research. Two methods have been used to determine the elastic material properties: an impulse excitation method and a method, based on the three-point-bending tests. Peak-picking method has been applied to determine dissipative material properties. Specimens machined from large billets made of aluminium alloy LM 24 with CNT volume content of 0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 5 and 1. 0 % have been tested to determine the influence of the CNT on elastic and dissipative properties of the LM 24 alloy. Specimens with free-free boundary conditions <b>simulated</b> <b>by</b> <b>handing</b> the specimens on thin threads have been used in the experiments conducted by the impulse excitation and peak-picking methods. The experimental results show that anchoring of specimen in the upper corners instead of the nodal lines of bending modes didn’t influence values of eigenfrequences and the dependency of loss factor on the frequency, but increased values of loss factor to constant value of 0. 00025. The addition of CNT to the aluminium alloys did not yield a visible increase in their elastic properties, but decreased their dissipative properties. If for bending modes the maximal average deviation (in comparison with pure LM 24 alloy) is 32 %, for twisting modes it is 45 %. It is necessary to note that material investigated did contain pores that have considerable influence on the elastic and dissipative material properties. Therefore {{it was not possible to}} obtain clear dependences of the material properties on CNT content...|$|R
30|$|Virtual hand usually <b>simulates</b> human <b>hands</b> <b>by</b> {{mapping the}} actual shapes of hands to virtual {{environment}} and modeling the hand-object manipulations in human machine interactions. For describing virtual hand and its manipulation in a unified framework, a method based on conformal geometric algebra (CGA) is proposed {{to solve the}} problems of virtual hand modeling and interaction in this paper. With the vertex blending based on CGA, the artifacts on the finger joints are improved, which enhances the realism of the virtual hand model. With the same tool, the collision detection between the virtual hand and the manipulated objects is implemented. The gesture of grasp, pinch, and hold are recognized, and the corresponding manipulation rules are established by CGA calculation. To test these three typical manipulations, the manipulated objects are imported and the manipulation effectiveness is evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{environmental}} impacts of man made products have been determined by performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) on the product. As the name implies, LCA is usually covers the entire life of the product in a so-called "cradle-to-grave" assessment. In determining {{environmental impacts}} over the whole product life, LCA's are reasonably adequate. However, in providing detailed impacts on a particular phase of life, LCA's are lacking. Detailed assessments are important because very few stakeholders have influence over a product during all phases of life. Stakeholders need detailed impact assessments in their particular phase of life. More detailed assessments give stakeholders more {{information that can be}} used for better environmental management (EM) and more environmentally benign operations. In many LCA's, the manufacturing phase of life has been over-generalized and over-simplified because of its relatively small environmental impact, as compared to other phases of life. Nevertheless, certain stakeholders, such as manufacturing companies, need detailed impact information for the manufacturing phase of life so that they can create a more sustainable manufacturing process. Most traditional LCA's use a case-based approach, which was deemed to be inadequate. For these LCA's, the information provided for each case is often quite detailed and specific. However, this makes the assessment less flexible, limiting the quality of the assessment to the degree that the current scenario matches the existing cases. In order to make a more user-specific assessment, a model-based approach was used. To give the model flexibility, a parametric model was created based on mathematical equations that represent various parts of the manufacturing process. To give the model structure, an activity-based costing (ABC) approach was used. Using the ABC structure, the manufacturing process was broken down into activities, each of which was characterized by mathematical models. Large models would be difficult to construct and <b>simulate</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> so a model was built with the aid of a computer. The modeling language SysML (Systems Modeling Language) was used to create an object-oriented model of the manufacturing process, using the ABC structure. SysML defines overall properties and behaviors of the various elements in the model, while the plug-in tool ParaMagic was used to execute the model via a Mathematica Solver. The model computes carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, and waste mass generation for a particular manufacturing scenario. The goal of the model was to quantify environmental impact factors in order to aid manufacturing stakeholders in EM. The overall goal of the research was to determine whether an activity-based, object-oriented model was a valid approach, and whether the computer-aided tools adequately implemented this approach. Findings show that SysML is capable of modeling large and complex systems. However, due to some limitations of Paramagic, only some of SysML's capabilities were utilized. Nevertheless, Paramagic is capable of extracting information out of a manufacturing model built in SysML, and solving parametric relations in Mathematica in a timely manner. Timely solutions of complex models are critical for stakeholders keeping a competitive edge. M. S. Committee Chair: Bert Bras; Committee Member: Chris Paredis; Committee Member: Leon McGinni...|$|R
