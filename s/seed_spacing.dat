Recently, <b>spaced</b> <b>seeds,</b> a special type of pattern that accounts for errors or mutations, are routinely used instead of k-mers. <b>Spaced</b> <b>seeds</b> allow to improve the sensitivity, with respect to k-mers, in many applications, however the hashing of <b>spaced</b> <b>seeds</b> increases substantially the computational time.

The metering units included a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the standard cell corn plate, a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the flat plate, and a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus row unit with the finger pick‐up metering system. Planter <b>seed</b> <b>spacing</b> uniformity was measured using three parameters: ISO Miss index, ISO Multiples index, and Coefficient of Precision (CP 3).

The field slope treatments included: front‐up (front of planter unit), front‐down, right‐up (right side of planter unit), and left‐up (left side of the planter unit) each at field slope levels of 10 % and 20 %, and level. Slope and travel pattern had significant effects on the <b>seed</b> <b>spacing</b> uniformity {{for each of the}} three metering units tested.

Variation in corn <b>seed</b> <b>spacing</b> from a John Deere MaxEmerge Plus Vacumeter planter was {{evaluated}} on the University of Nebraska Planter Test Stand {{in a laboratory}} setting for two seed tube conditions (new or worn) with two examples of corn seed shape (round or flat). <b>Seed</b> <b>spacing</b> uniformity was measured using three <b>seed</b> <b>spacing</b> uniformity parameters: Coefficient of Precision (CP 3), ISO Multiples index, and ISO Miss index.

40|$|Optimal <b>spaced</b> <b>seeds</b> were {{introduced}} by the theoretical computer science community to bioinformatics to effectively increase homology search sensitivity. They are now serving thousands of homology search queries daily. While dozens of papers have been published on optimal <b>spaced</b> <b>seeds</b> since their invention, many fundamental questions still remain unanswered. In this paper, we settle several open questions in this area. Specifically, we prove that when {{the length of a}} non-uniformly <b>spaced</b> <b>seed</b> is bounded by an exponential function of the seed weight, the seed outperforms strictly the traditional consecutive seed in both (i) the average number of non-overlapping hits and (ii) the asymptotic hit probability. Then, we study the computation of the hit probability of a <b>spaced</b> <b>seed,</b> solving three more open questions: (iii) hit probability computation in a uniform homologous region is NP-hard and (iv) it admits a PTAS; (v) the asymptotic hit probability is computable in exponential time in seed length, independent of the homologous region length. ...|$|R
