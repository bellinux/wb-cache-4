3000|$|... 3 -digit {{occupational}} codes {{correspond to}} {{a high level of}} disaggregation and constitute the finest description of occupations available for a long representative panel of US workers. Census occupational codes were defined, among other things, according to the skills involved in performing the job. For example, 3 -digit codes distinguish among sales occupations between jobs that involve increasing degrees of knowledge and task complexity: from street vendors, to cashiers, sales workers (subdivided into eight different industry groups), sales representatives (six industry groups), sales engineers, and <b>sales</b> <b>supervisors.</b> However, there still might be unobserved heterogeneity in schooling requirements within some 3 -digit occupations. One concern would be that a 3 -digit occupation contains several occupations with different schooling requirements. With this in mind, for occupations such that the frequencies of two or more schooling levels are within 15 percentage points of each other, we choose to use a more conservative definition of over (and under)-education. Specifically, workers whose schooling attainments fall within the range defined by these schooling levels are classified as matched, while those with a higher (lower) level of education are defined as overeducated (undereducated). It {{is important to note that}} our results are robust to the choice of other cutoffs. 14 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{occupational}} mortality differences among working-age North Carolinians in order to a) identify associations between cause of death and occupation that may warrant further study and b) suggest occupation groups in need of health promotion/disease prevention activities. Methods: The study examines associations between “usual lifetime occupation ” and underlying cause of death as reported on the death certificates of males and females ages 35 - 49 and 50 - 64 who died during the ten years 1988 - 97. The proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) is used to identify occupational groups with probable excess risk of death from 32 causes. Results are compared to those of earlier North Carolina studies as well as epidemiologic studies conducted elsewhere. Results: Significantly high PMRs were found most often among males who died from AIDS. Consistent with earlier studies, laborers and other blue collar workers as well as <b>sales</b> <b>supervisors</b> and proprietors exhibited excess mortality from several causes. For females, a finding of note is the excess mortality from liver disease found among housewives/homemakers. Other results suggest high prevalences of alcohol consumption and smoking among certain groups of workers.

The interaction equivalency theorem states that meaningful learning can be achieved as long as courses are designed {{with at least a}} high level of one of three types of interactions (learner-content, learner-teacher or learner-learner). This study aimed to establish whether the interaction equivalency theorem applies to online learning in the corporate sector. The research was conducted in a large Mexican commercial organization, and involved 147 learners (<b>sales</b> <b>supervisors),</b> 30 teachers (<b>sales</b> managers and directors) and 3 academic assistants (course designers, or Education support staff). Three courses of an existing Leadership Program (Situational Leadership, Empowering Beliefs and Effective Performance) were redesigned and developed to test three course designs, each emphasizing a different type of interaction (learner-content, learner-teacher or learner-learner). Data were collected through surveys (for diagnostic and evaluation purposes) and exams. All courses yielded high levels of effectiveness, in terms of satisfaction, learning, perceived readiness for knowledge transfer and return on expectations. This suggests that the interaction equivalency theorem not only applies in a business setting but might also include other indicators of course effectiveness, such as satisfaction, learning transfer and return on expectations.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} understand the effect of internal resources on foreign market entry mode selection. The knowledge-based view was {{used to analyze the}} decisions made before market entry, entry mode selection and decisions made after market entry that ultimately benefit firm performance and knowledge gain. By better understanding the role of knowledge in internationalization firm leaders will be better informed as to the specific items that must be learned in order to best improve performance. Furthermore, identification of the proper internal constraints will assist leaders in selecting the entry mode that is best suited to their individual firm. Based on the above motive, this research has three main goals. First, to understand what factors influence a firm's entry mode decision. Second, after entering a country, what factors influence the firm's performance. Third, upon market penetration, which specific factors influence the firm's knowledge gain. This research seeks to provide a well-rounded model of internationalization, beginning with pre-internationalization proper entry mode selection and concluding with post-internationalization organizational learning that ultimately increases performance and knowledge gain. This research used Taiwanese firms in the electronics and traditional industries. Respondents were chosen from a list of firms selected from the Investment Commission, MOEA and the Taichung and Dali Industrial Area website. 1000 questionnaires were sent and 100 questionnaires were returned for a return rate of 10 %. Respondents were general managers, managers or international <b>sales</b> department <b>supervisors.</b> Results revealed that in Taiwanese firms (1) internal constraints such as lack of internal control mechanisms and lack of experiential knowledge did not {{have a significant effect on}} entry mode selection, (2) upon country penetration social and market learning increase firm performance and (3) post-internationalization social and market learning increases knowledge gain. 本研究旨在探討內部資源對海外市場進入模式選擇與績效的關係。並以知識基礎理論作為進入市場前的決策，評估進入模式選擇與進入市場後的決策。首先，利用察覺公司內部障礙，選擇最適合的進入模式。接著，透過深入的探討國際化與知識間的關係，讓公司能清楚的了解應該學習什麼才得以提高組織績效。 緣上動機﹐本研究目的為﹕(一) 了解哪些因素會影響公司進入模式選擇。(二) 哪些因素會影響公司進入市場後的績效。(三) 找出會影響公司進入市場後之知識累積因素。最後，本研究期能提供一個完整的國際化模式，探討公司從進入市場前的決策到進入市場後的決策。 本研究以台灣的電機電子業與傳統產業為研究對象﹐抽樣對象主要以「經濟部投資審議委員會」之企業為主﹐以台中工業區和大里工業區之公司為輔，共發 1000 份問卷，回收問卷為 100 份，回收率為 10 %。受測對象為(副) 總經理、經(副) 理、或海外行銷相關負責人。實證結果發現﹕(一) 內部控制機制和經驗知識缺乏的內部障礙對進入模式選擇沒有顯著的影響。(二) 公司在市場上的社會學習與市場學習對績效有正向影響。(三) 進入市場後的社會學習與市場學習對知識累積有正向影響。CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION	 6 1 - 1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION	 6 1 - 2 OBJECTIVES	 7 1 - 3 OUTLINE	 8 CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW	 10 2 - 1 OVERVIEW OF ENTRY MODE RESEARCH	 10 2 - 2 HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT	 20 CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODS	 33 3 - 1 SAMPLE	 33 3 - 2 DEPENDANT VARIABLES	 34 3 - 3 INDEPENDENT VARIABLES	 36 3 - 4 CONTROL VARIABLES	 37 3 - 5 QUESTIONNAIRE LANGUAGE AND TRANSLATION	 37 3 - 6 PILOT TEST	 38 3 - 7 QUESTIONNAIRE DISTRIBUTION	 38 CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION	 39 4 - 1 CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS	 39 4 - 2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS	 40 4 - 3 DISCUSSION	 48 CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS	 53 5 - 1 OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH	 53 5 - 2 PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS	 55 5 - 3 RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS	 57 5 - 4 RESEARCH LIMITATIONS	 58 5 - 5 FUTURE RESEARCH	 58 APPENDIX A - QUESTIONNAIRE, ENGLISH VERSION	 60 APPENDIX B - QUESTIONNAIRE, CHINESE VERSION	 65 BIBLIOGRAPHY	 6...|$|R

We demonstrate how thinking and acting 'mobile' reshapes managers' and workers' activities and interactions. The investigation {{is based on an}} ethnographically. informed case study in a Latin American organization, with particular focus on the social aspects of the use of mobile/echnology in the sales and warehouse processes. More specifically, we provide an account of the techno-political aspects of the use of mobile technology in the sales process at comers shops, which seems to be an under-researched area [...] Ã‚Â·We also juxtapose the use of mobile technology at comer shops with its use in the warehouse. Such juxtaposition allows us to bring into view some of the subtle and complex techno-political processes of mobile technology in organizing commercial activities. This work is informed by the view {{that there is a need}} for more d~tailed work on the importance of objects (or non humans) in organizational research. As such it draws on actor network theory and the cyborg notion for its theoretical foundation. Indeed in this study mobile technology is an active actor, which we refer to as 'PDA' (as a proper noun). We show how PDA has acted as a transformative agent, an actometwork and intermediary, changing the way <b>sales</b> representatives, operators,. <b>supervisors,</b> managers, and even clients, work and interact. We show how the implementation and use of PDA produced diverse, sometimes 'unpredictable, and significant changes in the commercial process; in particular, we show how mobile technology mediates and enacts new relationships ofpower, control and identity construction. We propose and demonstrate how Pfaffenberger's framework of the technological drama provides the basis. for a detailed account of how the legitimacy or illegitimacy of mobile technology is the outcome of a complex, continuous and subtle interplay of competing political discourses which aim to fix the way 'technical features' are interpreted. In this regard, the designers and the opposition of mobile solutions use the PDA's affordances to shape statements and counter statements in favour or against the regularization of the 'mobile' commercial process. We have named this discourse 'the language of mobility' or 'mobile differentiators'. These mobile differentiators provide the language, at least partially, that competing actors ciiaw upon to shape PDA and its social context. As a result, we show that power distribution, regimes of control and people's identity are network effects of the ongoing technological drama of the implementation and use of mobile technology. For practitioners our findings may have important implications for understanding how mobile technology might reconstitute (or not) organizational processes in unpredictable arid often unintended ways.

Besides, the writers also carried out an informal interview with the <b>sales</b> <b>supervisor</b> and the existing salespersons in Honda Basuki Rachmat. As the result, the writers found that the salesperson?s training in Honda Basuki Rachmat can be considered insufficient. The. informal interview even proved that the training that is conducted by Honda is unorganized. Several points that need to be paid attention are the types of the training that will be carried out, the target of the training, and the training frequency. Besides, one thing that also needs to be recognized is what the salespersons actually want in a training, so that the training can be useful, not only for the company, but also for the salespersons themselves. Hopefully, it will lead Honda Basuki Raclunat to be a successful company...|$|E
