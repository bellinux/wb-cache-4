40|$|The coastal banks from Møre to Lofoten were {{surveyed}} with R. V. «Johan Hjort» {{during the period}} I — 11 March 1972. The primary aim of the survey was by means of echo sounding and trawling to obtain information about the spawning grounds of saithe. Dense concentrations of saithe were found twice during the survey: In the area Sørmannsneset — Skateneset — Steinmaren off Møre and on {{the northern part of}} the Halten Bank. Samples from trawl hauls indicated that the saithe were in the process of spawning in both areas. These two areas appear to be the most important spawning grounds of saithe within the surveyed area. The trawl catches of saithe were dominated by the 1964 and 1965 year classes. The year classes 1962 and 1966 were also abundant. Concentrations of smaller demersal fish were observed during most of the survey. Norway pout was the most common species off Møre, but was apparently replaced further north by greater silver smelt, redfish (Sebastes viviparus), and <b>silvery</b> <b>cod.</b> Mature cod and haddock were only found in small concentrations south of Lofoten...|$|E
