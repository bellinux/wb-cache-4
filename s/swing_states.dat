5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters living outside the <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> {{have a greater}} certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E
5|$|As in 1884, the {{election}} {{focused on the}} <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing {{his home state of}} New York by 14,373 votes. The Republicans won Indiana, largely {{as the result of a}} fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal <b>swing</b> <b>states,</b> while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{criteria}} {{considered to be a}} factor in selecting a vice-presidential candidate was the ability to deliver a traditionally Republican or a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> in the November election. Every successful Democratic presidential campaign since 1960 had included a politician from a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> (usually in the South) who helped deliver one or more states for the Democrats.|$|R

5|$|The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, {{beginning}} a population shift to central and northern Indiana, {{and contributed to}} a relative decline {{in the southern part}} of the state. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been. Indiana's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war, making it one of a few key <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> that often decided national elections. Between 1868 and 1916, five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets. In 1888 Benjamin Harrison, one of the state's former Civil War generals, was elected president of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key <b>swing</b> <b>states.</b> McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{presidential campaigns}} and the {{mainstream}} media treated Virginia as a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> {{for most of the}} campaign. [...] Obama campaigned extensively in Virginia and counted on the booming northern parts of the state for a Democratic victory. Victory for McCain would have been extremely difficult without Virginia; {{he would have had to}} win every <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> as well as at least one Democratic-leaning state.|$|R
5000|$|Since the 2000 election, {{with regards}} to {{third-party}} voting, Chomsky has maintained [...] "if it's a <b>swing</b> <b>state,</b> keep the worst guys out. If it's another state, do what you feel like." [...] When asked if he voted in the 2008 election, he responded: [...] I voted green. If I {{had been in a}} <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> - this Massachusetts is a fixed state - if I had been in a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> I probably would have held my nose and voted for Obama. Just to keep out the alternative, which is worse. I had no expectations about him and I’m not in the least disillusioned. In fact I wrote about him before the primaries. I thought he was awful.|$|R

5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the <b>swing</b> <b>states,</b> including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
25|$|Except in closely fought <b>swing</b> <b>states,</b> {{voter turnout}} is largely {{insignificant}} due to entrenched political party domination in most states. The Electoral College decreases the advantage {{a political party}} or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out, except in those <b>swing</b> <b>states.</b> If the presidential election were decided by a national popular vote, in contrast, campaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere. Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their friends and neighbors {{to turn out to}} vote. The differences in turnout between <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.|$|E
25|$|FairVote has {{conducted}} research on both presidential and Congressional elections. Most of its presidential election {{research focuses on}} the electoral college's effects on campaigning. In its 2012 Presidential Election analysis, FairVote documented the large disparity in both time and money spent in <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> (e.g., Florida) versus safe states (e.g., Maryland). In addition, FairVote has begun publishing data on how much time sitting presidents spend in <b>swing</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E

25|$|The final {{prediction}} by FiveThirtyEight on {{the morning}} of election day (November 8, 2016) was at 10:41AM and had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election. while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability. FiveThirtyEight's model pointed the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performing in several of those <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> in comparison with Obama's performing in 2012. The main issues pointed by the forecast model was the unbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats); mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in <b>swing</b> <b>states,</b> in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities. In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving. Nate Silver also focused on state by state numbers in considered 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points.|$|E
25|$|However, Jonathan Chait of The American Prospect and The New Republic {{notes that}} Nader did indeed focus on <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> disproportionately during {{the waning days}} of the campaign, and by doing so jeopardized his own chances of {{achieving}} the 5% of the vote he was aiming for.|$|E
25|$|Colorado is {{considered}} a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> {{by the turn of}} the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Ohio was won by {{incumbent}} President George W. Bush by a 2.1% {{margin of}} victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered the Buckeye <b>state</b> as a <b>swing</b> <b>state.</b> The state's economic situation gave hope for Senator Kerry. In the end, the state became {{the deciding factor}} of the entire election. Kerry conceded the state, {{as well as the}} entire election the morning following election night, as Bush won the state and its 20 electoral votes. The close contest was the subject of the documentary film ...So Goes the Nation, the title of which is a reference to Ohio's 2004 status as a crucial <b>swing</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R
50|$|A major <b>swing</b> <b>state,</b> Obama {{spent over}} $28 million to McCain's $24 million. The Republican ticket visited the state 28 {{times to the}} Obama ticket's 22 times.|$|R
25|$|Later on {{election}} night, after Obama {{was named the}} winner, he picked up several more wins in <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> in which the polls had shown a close race. These included Florida, Indiana, Virginia, and the western states of Colorado and Nevada. All of these states had been carried by Bush in 2004. North Carolina and the bellwether state of Missouri remained undecided for several days. Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri, with Obama pulling out a rare win in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. This put the projected electoral vote count at 365 for Obama and 173 for McCain. Obama's victories in the populous <b>swing</b> <b>states</b> of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia contributed to his decisive win. The presidential electors cast their ballots for President and Vice President, and Congress tallied these votes on January 8, 2009.|$|E

25|$|Always visibly {{active in}} {{environmental}} and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the Vote for Change tour playing {{a series of}} concerts in American <b>swing</b> <b>states.</b> These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org {{with the goal of}} mobilizing people to vote for John Kerry and against George W. Bush in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the Dixie Chicks.|$|E
5000|$|A Hillary Clinton voter from an uncontested state (one that is {{definitely}} Democratic or definitely Republican) agrees {{to vote for}} a third-party candidate (such as Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein), and in exchange, a supporter of the third-party candidate from a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> agrees to vote for Clinton. This has no effect on the total number of votes received by each candidate but it does give Clinton more votes in a <b>swing</b> <b>state,</b> and therefore improves the probability of Clinton winning the election.|$|R
5000|$|New Hampshire {{is often}} {{noted for its}} {{moderate}} politics and {{its status as a}} prominent <b>swing</b> <b>state.</b> Voters predominantly selected Republicans for national office during the 19th and 20th centuries until 1992. Since then, the state has been considered as a <b>swing</b> <b>state,</b> and the Cook Political Report now classifies New Hampshire as [...] "Even" [...] after the 2016 election, reflecting that neither party has an advantage. Since 2006, control of the state legislature and New Hampshire's congressional seats have switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats in a series of wave elections.|$|R
50|$|Most {{national}} and <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> polls favored Clinton, who was strongly {{favored to win}} by most media outlets. However, Trump exceeded expectations on Election Day, especially in the Rust Belt where he swept the traditionally Democratic states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin by narrow margins. Clinton recorded lop-sided margins in large states such as California, Illinois and New York while keeping Texas, Arizona and Georgia unusually close for a recent Democratic nominee. Clinton also won safe Democratic medium-sized states such as Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington with vast margins. Clinton managed to edge out Trump in Virginia, a <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> where her running mate Tim Kaine had served as Governor. Trump also won traditional <b>swing</b> <b>state</b> Florida by a tight margin along with Republican-leaning North Carolina, further contributing to the electoral flip of the popular vote. Trump won by a large margin in Indiana, Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee with most of Trump's larger wins coming in smaller states.|$|R
25|$|The 2004 presidential {{election}} debates included mentions of the same-sex marriage debate and referred, initially indirectly, to Cheney. Both Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and vice-presidential candidate John Edwards mentioned and praised Cheney's openness {{with regard to}} her sexual orientation when questioned regarding gay issues. Some commentators viewed these remarks as a gratuitous, cynical appeal to residual homophobia among blue-collar voters in key <b>swing</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nominees {{participate}} in nationally televised debates, {{and while the}} debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates.
