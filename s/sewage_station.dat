On the same day, Lt. Gen. Raed Shaker Jawdat of Iraqi Federal Police said that ISIL militants had begun a [...] "mass escape" [...] from the city to areas of Halabisa and Albu Alwan west of Fallujah. He saw a [...] "total collapse" [...] among the ranks of ISIL. On the same day, Iraqi army started advancing from Fallahat vicinity to those areas in the western axis of Fallujah, killing 20 ISIL members and opening three routes for the passage of tanks and armored vehicles. At the same time, 900 families were evacuated.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the yield and nutrition in maize plants due to application of sewage sludge from the <b>sewage</b> <b>station</b> {{in the city of}} Jeronimo Monteiro was mounted an experiment in completely randomized design with three treatments and five replications. The treatments in mineral fertilizers, use of sewage sludge equivalent to nitrogen recommended for the cultivation and application of sewage sludge with total mineral fertilizer. At the end of the experiment the seeds were weighed while the nutritional analysis was done at flowering and the results showed that application of sewage sludge increased the weight of seeds per pot and foliar concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, zinc, manganese, copper and boron and copper in maize. On the other hand the others nutrients did not change significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} is the analysis of possibilities for financing business projects in the tourism sphere. Partial aims are study and comparison of program documentations and also monitoring of procedure leading to acquisition of financial support and actual project proposal. I´ve developed the project {{according to the rules}} for regional operation program Jihozápad and according to the directions from the applicant´s handbook, which I´ve used for examining the study of performability, the Cost - Benefit Analysis, Cash flow, time schedule and other necessary analyses. The project focuses on the services development in water tourism sphere of given locality. A concrete task is set to establish a refreshment store with employees´ background. On the ground floor of the building there will be a new restroom, connected to a newly built <b>sewage</b> <b>station.</b> Last planned action is a drilled well with supplements. The specific task of the project is edulcorating and extending the time spent by the visitors in our camp and providing better conditions for the employees. The project is based on the presumption of enhancing the quality of services will attract both water sportsmen and local citizens, cyclotourists and other interest groups...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{different}} irrigation methods (furrow, surface drip and subsurface drip) and water qualities (municipal treated effluent and fresh water) with irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture and root depth monitoring were evaluated on the composition and physicochemical quality of the corn flour. A split plot experiment with three main treatments (irrigation methods) and two sub-main treatments (irrigation water qualities) with four replications were designed and executed in Marvdasht <b>sewage</b> <b>station.</b> The magnitude and extent of the factorial influence were measured/conducted using the effects on Water Absorption Capacity (WAC), Swelling Index (SI), solubility (TSS) and Gelatinization Temperature (GT). Based on the results, the corns, irrigated by furrow irrigation method showed higher protein and oil contents than those irrigated by other methods. In each irrigation method, the samples irrigated with effluent, had higher protein content than those irrigated with fresh water. However, the protein content of the grains probably improved with increasing the volume of irrigation water in furrow methods than the other irrigation methods. The sub-surface drip using wastewater {{can be a good}} choice from the point view of agriculture (due to its higher water saving and greater yield) and also food industry (because of the high starch content, solubility and swelling index and the least gelatinization point of the corn flours) ...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on the {{distribution}} and abundance of plankton in Awba stream and reservoir, University of Ibadan {{over a period of}} four months between November 2011 and February 2012. Studies {{were carried out}} at four selected stations comprising station 1 as the entry point of the stream into the University, which also served as the control, station 2 receiving <b>sewage,</b> <b>station</b> 3 downstream along the stream and at a point along Awba Reservoir serving as station 4. 1 ml aliquot of each plankton sample from the study stations were examined under a binocular microscope while identification of the plankton was carried out using standard textbooks. The results of the phytoplankton indicated the absence of Microcystis flos-aquae, Agmenellum and Oscillatoria limnetica in station 1 while members of the family bacillariophyceae appeared at all stations. All species of chlorophyceae family except Spirogyra were peculiarly absent at station 2. Other phytoplankton representatives at this point (station 2) included Microcystis, Anabaena, Oscillatoria and Melosira. Paramecium was the only zooplankton group that was absent in station 1 but the only species presented in station 2. This station also revealed the lowest diversity indices and very low or no Jaccards coefficient of similarity with the other stations. The overall differences observed in the abundance, species richness, Margalef and Shannon-Wiener indices of diversity of plankton in the study reveal self purification or recovery downstream from the effluent discharge. </p...|$|E

Irrigation with 100 % concentration of wastewater from the Eastern <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>station</b> at 100 % concentration decreased the growth of Acacia saligna seedlings. Sewage effluent had increased specific gravity in all the treatments except with low concentration from the Eastern source; Fiber length was increased when the seedlings were irrigated with wastewater from the eastern <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>station</b> at 100 % concentration. The growth of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings decreased when irrigated with wastewater, the decrease was more pronounced with wastewater from the eastern <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>station</b> at 50 % concentration.
