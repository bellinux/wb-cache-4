5|$|Pascu was {{a native}} of Agnita (at the time part of Braşov Region, now in <b>Sibiu</b> <b>County),</b> where he {{graduated}} from primary school. He was born to an ethnic Romanian father and a half-Hungarian mother; on his mother's side, he was also the descendant of Poles and Slovaks. His mother was a Roman Catholic and his father, like Gyuri, was a Romanian Orthodox. His name reflects his complex heritage: Ioan was chosen as his Romanian name; his second name was the Hungarian Gyurika, but it was recorded as Ghiurico in his birth certificate and personal documents ever since—as Pascu later indicated, this was because neither his father nor the notary were familiar with Hungarian phonology. Pascu, who was fluent in the Hungarian language, preferred the hypocoristic Gyuri.|$|E

40|$|This PhD thesis {{provides}} a multi-layered analysis of Saxon rural fortified churches from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries in Transylvania. By examining the histories and archaeologies of these poorly studied but prominent medieval survivals, the thesis explores the {{processes by which}} the Church transformed Saxon social structures and considers how far structure and form reflect that society and its evolving identities. The timeframe spans the primary Saxon colonization of Transylvania until the occupation of the region by the Turks after 1526. Critically, {{almost all of the}} Saxon villages and churches originated and were subsequently fortified during this period and many have remained relativity unaltered since. Three major research strategies are employed: (l) a quantitative analysis of data for the representative regions of Brasov and Sibiu Counties; (2) detailed analysis of the form and function of the built units; and (3) detailed assessment of two major case studies. Data were collected from published and archival reports and sources, plus interviews, newspapers and site surveys. Core to the whole is the creation of a Gazetteer of Saxon sites in Braşov and <b>Sibiu</b> <b>Counties.</b> The thesis considers Saxon fortified complexes in their site and landscape setting, but first reviews medieval to modem Saxon Transylvania, evaluating the impact of events on the Saxon peoples, and then details the nature of Saxon rights, privileges, and administration in their lands and settlements. The roles and development of the Saxon fortified churches are next explored, assessing topographic, defensive, material and economic considerations and evolutions. The final part of the thesis analyses the morphology, domestic, cultural and social life of the Saxon fortified church and village, through which we may assess other angles of evolving Saxon identity. In addition, the thesis has considered the heritage of complexes - how viewed, how maintained, issues of access, of decay - and their recognition by UNESCO and European Union departments. The thesis reveals a specific Saxon colonial form which adapted to a near constancy of threat and uncertainty. The survival of so many components of this distinctive past requires far more attention from scholars to appreciate fully the Saxon contribution.

40|$|Wood can be {{considered}} one of the first building materials. So far, it has had a constant and varied utilization concerning built environment with or without a structural role. This aspect is mainly the result of the spread of the wooden material as species around the world, but also due to a series of qualities like: easy processing, light weight and good mechanical characteristics. Even if it can be characterized by a high perish ability linked to multiple factors like vulnerability to fire, it still has a wide utilization range in the present. The main theme of this paper discusses the wooden species utilized in vernacular architecture and furniture and their destination in traditional wooden housing, in a synthetic manner, structuring information in special tables. The role of these tables would be to reflect through a visual method the wood utilization patterns and the variety of wooden species existing in the three analyzed areas: Vâlcea, <b>Sibiu</b> and Buzău <b>Counties.</b> In this way, it is possible to observe evident connections between the structural and spatial evolution of the vernacular house (mainly due to the shift of functional or specific needs) and the utilization patterns of local wooden material that contributed to this architectural, functional and stylistic diversity...|$|R
40|$|My paper {{presents}} the Hungarian {{documents of the}} peasants’ riot, led by Horea in Transylvania (1784). These documents were kept in the archive of the “Consilium Locumtenentiale” from Buda and they remained unknown to historic research until now. 	The importance of this relatively significant amount of documents (over 4000 pages) consists {{in the fact that}} these regard not only the history of Transylvania but also the history of Hungary. In 2006 these documents were published with the support of The Hungarian Historical Research Institute from the University of Debrecen, in a special volume. 	Before analyzing these documents, I thought {{it would be useful to}} present the results of the Hungarian and of the Romanian research, regarding the riot led by Horea. 	By doing this I succeeded to avoid a series of misinterpretations during the research and I succeeded in providing a more accurate interpretation of the riot. For this reason, in the first part of the paper, I present the general image of the riot, thus excluding the excessive interpretations which were generated by the political views of some authors. 	I tried to present the point of view of the Romanian historians, point of view which belonged to two fundamental directions: a moderate one, and here we must mention Nicolae Iorga and David Prodan, and an excessively nationalistic one, found in Stefan Pascu’s work. 	Among the Hungarian historians we must mention Berlasz Jeno, as being one of the most accurate analyzers of the historical event, and Szucs Jeno, who made a parallel interpretation of the two methods of scientific research used by the two historical currents. 	It is obvious that Horea’s riot had not only economical reasons, although the historians from both countries insist on this. It is certain that the outbreak of the riot is due to the misunderstandings regarding the reorganization of the border regiments from Transylvania, fact that agitated both the peasants and the noblemen. Because of the subscriptions that were meant to precede the recruitment, were stopped by the emperor himself, the peasants thought that the emperor was forced to yield in to the pressures made by the noblemen. 	These subscriptions for the future border regiments were supposed to take place at the same time with another subscription which started at November 1 st 1784 and agitated the peasants even more. 	The riot started at October 31 st 1784 in Zarand, from where it quickly spread to Hunedoara, Alba, Cluj, and <b>Sibiu</b> <b>counties,</b> and even to Arad county which was situated on Hungarian territory. 	A crucial event of the riot was the issuing of an “ultimatum” at November 12 th 1784 which imposed some conditions on the noblemen. Apparently this ultimatum should belong to the peasants, but in the debate over this subject, the historians are divided between considering this ultimatum the program of the riot (David Prodan) or a nobiliary petition (H. Balazs Eva). 	The biggest exaggeration belongs to Stefan Pascu, who considered the document as being a political program which colud be, thus, prior even to the political programme of the French revolution. It is certain that the points belonging to the 12 th November 1784 ultimatum were found in a proposition sent to Maria Theresa by the Austrian State Council, in 1762 with the intention to modernize the whole society from the eastern provinces of the empire. 	After December 7 th 1784, following the battle of Mihaileni, the riot starts to fall apart. Shortly at December 24 th 1784 the riot was considered to be ended, even by the authorities 	. Its leaders were captured in the last days of the year and then, they were executed. 	The documents that I brought up with this occasion, bring important facts to the chronology of the riot, more exactly to the end of it [...] The main part in the peacemaking process, was not played by the authorities from Transylvania, but by the royal commissary Anton Jankovics, who took all the important decisions regarding the peacemaking process, both in Transylvania and in Hungary. 	Even if in Hungary, the riot was present only in Arad county, measures were taken to prevent its spreading on almost the entire teritory of Hungary, especially in the 11 eastern counties which were close to the border with Transylvania. These measures implied the permanent day and night surveillance of the peasants, the limitation and later the interdiction of the gunpowder commerce, the confiscation of the weapons belonging to the peasants. All the Hungarian counties were forced to report weekly about anything that could cause the outburst of other riots. These measures have strongly affected the social and economical life in Hungary, especially the commerce. 	The documents show that Horea’s riot brought about a significant amount of fear both in Transylvania and in Hungary. On the other hand these documents allow us to take a look into the hidden part of the riot, its secret part, especially into those parts which deal with the participation of the orthodox priests at the violent events, and the activity of Mihai Popescu, a lieutenant in the Russian army, suspected to be one of the instigators of the riot. 	From these document we learn that the central authorities from Hungary regarded the riot not only as a problem of Transylvania, but also a Hungarian problem. This fact is shown by the big number of documents and also by the special interest that the authorities showed to any details which could suggest an imminent danger. 	Despite the contradictions between the emperor and the noblemen, these powers coopertated to make peace and to eliminate the danger which the riot represented...|$|R

40|$|The National Structure of the Romanian Population at the 20 th of October 2011 Census. This is {{the third}} study {{regarding}} the national structure {{of the population of}} Romania. The first two approached the 1992 and 2002 censuses and were published in Studia UBB, Geographia, 2 (1991) and the Romanian Review of Political Geography (2004) 2. On the census day, Romania had 20, 121, 641 inhabitants, of which 83. 45 % (16, 792, 868) are Romanians, while the other 16. 55 % belong to: Hungarians 6. 10 % (1, 227, 623 inhabitants), Gypsies 3. 09 % (621, 573 people), other 18 national minorities (Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Russian-Lipovans, Tartars, Serbs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Greek, Italians, Jews, Czechs, Poles, Chinese, Armenians, Csangos, Macedonians) and the category “other national groups” have together only 1. 21 % (242, 767 inhabitants). There is also a category of people for which the information was ”unavailable”, totaling 6. 15 % (1, 236, 810 people) of the Romanian population (fig. 1). As requested to assess the essential issues of such a subject, one needs to analyze the distribution of the national minorities across Romania, {{at the level of the}} counties and the eight geographical-historical provinces of Romania: Transylvania, Moldavia, Dobrudja, Muntenia, Oltenia, Banat, Crişana and Maramureş. Generally, regarding the presence of the Romanian population, one notices the following situation at the level of the counties: in 18 counties of the total of 41 in Romania, the weight of the Romanian population is over 90 %, including all the eight Moldavian counties (Bacău, Botoşani, Galaţi, Iaşi, Neamţ, Suceava, Vaslui, Vrancea), six out of the ten counties of Muntenia (Argeş, Brăila, Buzău, Dâmboviţa, Prahova, Teleorman) and four out of five counties of Oltenia (Dolj, Gorj, Olt, Vâlcea). The highest weight of Romanians is recorded in the counties of Gorj (94. 17 %) and Botoşani (94. 08 %). A weight between 80 and 90 % was recorded in five out of the ten counties of Transylvania (Alba, Bistriţa-Năsăud, Braşov, Hunedoara, <b>Sibiu),</b> in both <b>counties</b> of Dobrudja (Constanţa, Tulcea), in four out of ten counties of Muntenia (Călăraşi, Giurgiu, Ialomiţa, Ilfov), one in Oltenia (Mehedinţi), two in Banat (Caraş-Severin, Timiş), and in the city of Bucharest. The other nine counties have a weight of 70 - 80 % of Romanian population (Cluj, Arad, Maramureş), 60 - 70 % (Sălaj, Bihor, Maramureş) and under 60 % (Covasna 21. 41 %, Harghita 12. 61 %, Mureş 50. 35 %). The Hungarian national group has a weight of 6. 10 % at national level and is present most of all in Transylvania, where it represents 21. 56 % of the population of this province (858, 454 locuitori). The highest weight has been registered in the counties of Harghita (82. 90 %), Covasna (71. 53 %), Mureş (36. 46 %), Sălaj (22. 36 %) and Cluj (14. 99 %). Values above 15 % have been also recoreded in the counties of Satu Mare (32. 69 %) and Bihor (24. 02 %). Compared to the situation of the counties in the center and western Romania, in the East, South-East and South the Hungarians are almost completely absent, as their weight is largely below 1 %. The Gypsy population represents 3. 09 % (621, 573 people) of the Romanian population and is present in all the 42 administrative units. One remarks a rather homogeneous distribution of the Gypsies, as their weight is higher than 5 % in only a number of counties: Mureş (8. 52 %), Sălaj (6. 69 %), Dâmboviţa (5. 27 %), Giurgiu (5. 41 %), Ialomiţa (5. 21 %), Bihor (6. 02 %) and Satu Mare (5. 05 %). In all other counties, as well as at the level of provinces, the Gypsies have weights below 5 %. All the other national minorities have together a weight of only 1. 21 % (242, 767 people) of the Romanian population. They have weights between 1 % and 7 % in only ten of the Romanian counties: Sibiu, Suceava, Constanţa, Tulcea, Arad, Caraş-Severin, Timiş, Bihor, Satu Mare and Maramureş, and in four provinces out of eight. The analyzed census presents a peculiarity which did not exist before, the column entitled “Unavailable information”. For 6. 15 % of the Romanian population (1, 236, 819 people) the information regarding ethnicity was unavailable. At the level of the counties, in 14 cases this group represented less than 5 %, in all other counties it represented between 5 % and 10 % while in the city of Bucharest the information was unavailable for 11. 68 % of the population...|$|R
