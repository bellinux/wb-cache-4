5|$|While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd {{systematically}} kill several diamond smugglers, M {{suspects that}} South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond {{to uncover the}} smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.|$|E

Troops and equipment started slipping away from the front and aboard navy vessels from 8 December 1915.|$|E

25|$|They can be {{difficult}} pets to care for, requiring regular attention and a very specific diet of grasses and hay. Each year, they go into a period called rut that can last for several months, in which their personalities can drastically change, often becoming defensive or even aggressive. Despite their needs, prairie dogs are very social animals and come to <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they treat humans as members of their colony, answering barks and chirps, and even coming when called by name.|$|E
25|$|Rust Belt {{states such}} as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and even Michigan {{were thought to be}} in play with Trump as the nominee, while states with large {{minority}} populations, such as Colorado and Virginia, were expected to shift towards Clinton. By the conventions period and the debates, however, it did not <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the Rust Belt states could deliver a victory to Trump. According to Politico and the 538 online blog, his path to victory went though {{states such as}} Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, and possibly Colorado.|$|E
25|$|Ma Chao is {{introduced}} in Chapter 10, where he participates {{in a campaign}} led by his father and Han Sui against Li Jue and Guo Si in Chang'an in 192, during which he slays the enemy officers Wang Fang (王方) and Li Meng (李蒙). He does not reappear until Chapter 57, in which he suggests to his father that he could lead the army against Cao Cao at Xuchang in 211 to follow Emperor Xian's orders to slay Cao Cao, but his father tells him to remain in Liang Province and command the Qiang troops there. After his father is killed by Cao Cao, Ma Chao, Han Sui and another eight officers fight against Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass, during which Ma Chao fights with Cao Cao's generals Xu Chu, Yu Jin, Cao Hong and Zhang He, and slays Li Tong. Later, Cao Cao's strategist, Jia Xu, suggests to Cao Cao {{to send a letter}} containing errors and markings (making it <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the recipient has something to hide) to Han Sui to make Ma Chao falsely believe that Han Sui is maintaining secret contact with Cao Cao. Ma Chao gradually becomes more suspicious of Han Sui, who also has the intention of defecting to Cao Cao's side after learning that Ma Chao no longer trusts him. Han Sui manages to escape when Ma Chao tries to kill him, but his left hand is cut off by Ma during the fight. Ma Chao is eventually defeated by Cao Cao's forces, but manages to escape and find shelter among the Qiang tribes.|$|E

500|$|The music {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} jazz and 20th-century avant-garde. The {{instruments in the}} orchestra frequently interrupt both {{each other and the}} female voices, and some sections of the composition <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are improvised. Laborintus II makes use of both traditional percussion instruments and electronic sounds, and their interplay serves to [...] "erect musical and textural architectures, then disassemble them quickly". Max Feldman has compared the style to that of Raymond Scott.|$|E
500|$|Artist Larry Carroll and Illustrator Howard Schwartzberg {{designed}} the cover artwork for South of Heaven, having {{designed the}} artwork for Slayer's previous album Reign in Blood. Photographer Glen E. Friedman took the promotional shot which surfaced as {{the back cover}} of South of Heaven {{around the time of}} 1986's Reign in Blood. Lombardo felt it made Slayer <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they [...] "had matured a little bit", while Friedman himself deemed it [...] "a really cool back cover" [...] and [...] "one of the most classic shots of them [...] ever".|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} depict Karnaca as grounded environment {{to help the}} city <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it could exist in reality. Arkane wished to avoid what one member dubbed [...] "the Deus Ex effect"—wherein man-sized vents were placed wherever the game designers felt, often in nonsensical places. The team tried to reflect practicalities of everyday life; for instance, a building {{would have to have}} some kind of toilet and a guard's placement should make in-world sense. Colonies in places such as Australia, India and Africa were investigated to comprehend the transition of people adapting from the cold climate of Dunwall to areas with a warmer constitution like Karnaca.|$|E

500|$|Thomas drew {{inspiration}} for {{his point of}} view about Veronica's character from his own life, stating, [...] "I've sort of gotten past this, but I certainly lived in that space for a long time." [...] Thomas had had the idea for this mystery of the week {{since the beginning of the}} season; in an interview, he stated that he would like to include several [...] "college-age crimes" [...] such as [...] "this idea of a college girl getting pregnant, and someone getting the idea they're doing her a favor by slipping her RU-486." [...] The promos for the episode made it <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Veronica was pregnant.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor often {{speaks of}} {{removing}} both {{the signature of}} the artist from his works {{as well as any}} traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as [...] "traces of the hand". He aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary {{in order to make the}} sculpture <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it was [...] "perfect" [...] and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.|$|E
500|$|In {{works like}} the Serenade for Strings and the Variations on a Rococo Theme, Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at {{writing in a}} style of 18th century European pastiche. [...] In the ballet The Sleeping Beauty and the opera The Queen of Spades, Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} from imitation to full-scale evocation. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls [...] "passé-ism," [...] lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were the present. On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to Igor Stravinsky, who turned to Neoclassicism partly {{as a form of}} compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.|$|E

500|$|Responses to {{the story}} were ambivalent; some reviewers called it strong with good dialog; others said it was poor. GameRevolution and CGW called the dialog poor, sophomoric, and often overly-verbose; in {{particular}} CGW said some speeches became an [...] "agonizingly long filibuster" [...] that only served to delay the return of control to the player. [...] Other sources called {{it one of the}} richest, most engrossing stories to be found outside films and novels, and more original than most RPGs. Computer Games criticized the linear storyline, and said the few dialog choices available to the player had no real impact on the storytelling. CGW said the linear story prevented Redemption from being a true RPG because it lacked interaction with many characters, and the lack of player impact on the story made it <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were not building characters but rather were getting them {{to the story}} milestones. According to PC Gamer, while the game's linearity was a negative, it kept the narrative tight and compelling.|$|E
2500|$|Ballon (...) is the {{appearance}} of being lightweight and light-footed while jumping. It is a desirable aesthetic in ballet and other dance genres, making it <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a dancer effortlessly becomes airborne, floats in the air, and lands softly. The name is widely thought {{to be derived from}} the French word ballon (meaning [...] "balloon"), though it has been dubiously claimed that the name was inspired by French ballet danseur Claude Balon, who was known for performing exceptionally light leaps.|$|E

2500|$|The United States {{declined}} {{to recognize the}} All-Palestine government in Gaza by explaining that it had accepted the UN Mediator's proposal. [...] The Mediator had recommended that Palestine, as defined in the original Mandate including Transjordan, might form a union. Bernadotte's diary said the Mufti had lost credibility {{on account of his}} unrealistic predictions regarding the defeat of the Jewish militias. Bernadotte noted [...] "It would <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in existing circumstances most of the Palestinian Arabs would be quite content to be incorporated in Transjordan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bennett's {{durability}} {{came not}} from avoiding injuries, but from playing through them. [...] When he broke another finger during the 1887 World Series, The New York Times reported:"It {{did not seem}} anything unusual to Bennett or his fingers[...] [...] [...] When he held up that battered right hand, with its fingers swollen and spread like a boxing glove, with rags tied around three of them, and a general appearance of having been {{run over by a}} freight-car about the entire hand, it did not <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there were room to split it in any new place." ...|$|E
2500|$|D'Or's {{voice is}} unusually {{versatile}} and flexible, and notable for its unique tone and color, and {{for having a}} very recognizable sound. His voice is characterized by powerful fullness and richness, making it <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it is his natural singing voice, created without use of the falsetto technique. However, despite its richness his voice cannot {{be compared to the}} color of a contralto, unlike singers such as David Daniels, given that D'Or has a unique, male-sounding timbre. When he sings in modern fashion, he employs his speaking—or chest—voice, instead of his singing, alto voice. D'Or has been compared to Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli ( [...] but with a Middle Eastern flavor), and his voice has been described as having the smoothness of Jack Johnson overlaid with the falsetto style of Jeff Buckley.|$|E
