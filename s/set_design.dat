5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, <b>set</b> <b>design</b> and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the <b>set</b> <b>design,</b> including the film's lighting design. The <b>set</b> <b>design</b> {{was an integral part}} of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Millionaires {{basic set}} {{is a direct}} {{adaptation}} of the British version's <b>set</b> <b>design,</b> which was conceived by Andy Walmsley. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. Millionaire required that the show's <b>set</b> <b>design,</b> along with all {{other elements of the}} show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully {{to the way in which}} they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's Millionaire <b>set</b> <b>design</b> the most reproduced scenic design in television history. The original version of the U.S. Millionaires set cost $200,000 to construct. The U.S. Millionaires production design is handled by George Allison, whose predecessors have included David Weller and Jim Fenhagen.|$|E
5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and <b>set</b> <b>design</b> of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to those previously mentioned, the film also featured Dan Haggerty, who starred in the television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. He provided the fighting dog, {{played the role of}} the dog's trainer and worked on the <b>set</b> <b>design</b> and the actual restoration of the carousel.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} shot over twenty-five days in May 2012 {{in the forests}} around Vancouver, at Simon Fraser University and at {{additional}} stages in Burnaby. The Herzog and Company production team was in Vancouver for three months with <b>set</b> <b>design</b> by Legacy Effects, the same company that worked on the previous shorts.|$|E
5|$|Whedon {{was also}} keen on {{utilizing}} vertical space; thus, having the crew's quarters accessible by ladder was important. Another {{benefit of the}} <b>set</b> <b>design</b> was that it also allowed the actors {{to stay in the}} moment and interact, without having to stop after each shot and reset up for the next. This helped contribute to the documentary style Whedon strove for.|$|E

5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have faulted Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and <b>set</b> <b>design.</b> Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction of the lead character, Sandy, approval of the film in general has been tarnished due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979). Both Warren and Alien distributors 20th Century Fox have rejected claims that the script of Inseminoid was influenced by that of the earlier film.|$|E
5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble {{board for the}} opening scene that would convey {{the idea that the}} Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words. The design of Bart's visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a <b>set</b> <b>design</b> for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E

The London production was also nominated for Best Theatre Choreographer and Outstanding Achievement in Music.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the <b>set</b> <b>design.</b> Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing to board the ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning <b>set</b> <b>design</b> for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for <b>set</b> <b>design</b> ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes have}} been made to the basic set since the {{syndicated}} version's premiere in 1983. In 1996, a large video display was added center stage, which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high-definition broadcasting. In the mid-1990s, the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme. As a result, in addition to its generic design, the set also uses many alternate designs, which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs. The most recent <b>set</b> <b>design</b> was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson, with later modifications by Jody Vaclav. Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick Stiles.|$|E
5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, <b>set</b> <b>design</b> and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic <b>set</b> <b>design</b> in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having <b>set</b> <b>design</b> seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for <b>set</b> <b>design,</b> however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E
