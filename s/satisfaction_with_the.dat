5|$|A CRA poll {{released}} in March 2010 showed {{public support for}} Williams' Progressive Conservative Party that had extended to a record 80 percent of decided voters, up from 77 percent from February. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government was 93 percent voters.

A CRA poll conducted in May 2010, showed that <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government was at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March, the party's support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent.

40|$|Introduction: The {{period of}} late {{adulthood}} is a period {{in which many}} actions {{for the purpose of}} summing up and evaluating the life so far are taken. One of the aspects of life which is then evaluated is its quality. Under the influence of many factors, the quality of life decreases among the elderly and thus it influences their life satisfaction level. Aim of the research: To evaluate the influence of socio-living and health factors on the level of life satisfaction of the elderly. Material and methods: The research was conducted through a diagnostic survey, using an opinion poll technique. The applied research tool was a copyrighted questionnaire and life satisfaction scale – SWLS (<b>the</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> Life Scale). <b>The</b> examined group consisted of persons in older age, benefiting from nurse care in various health facilities. Results : The majority of those examined showed a mean rate (<b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life). There are major discrepancies among the studies on the extent of influence according to such factors as housing conditions, income and professional activity. Health factors, namely suffering from multiple diseases, the chronic character of the disease, handicap and disability correlate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> feeling of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life. <b>The</b> more factors – health problems, the lower is <b>the</b> rate of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life. Conclusions: <b>The</b> socio-living conditions to a major extent influence <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life of <b>the</b> examined persons. Health factors play a major role in <b>the</b> feeling of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life.

These efforts were eventually subdued. After regaining control, the French colonial authority took steps to address the repercussions of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom, providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations, but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists.|$|E

Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011.
