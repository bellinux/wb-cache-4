5|$|Given the book's {{fluid and}} {{changeable}} approach to plot and characters, a definitive, critically agreed-upon plot <b>synopsis</b> remains elusive (see Critical response and themes: Difficulties of plot summary below).

5|$|The {{back story}} in the {{published}} <b>synopsis</b> differs from the actual production in a few aspects. When the organ grinder takes the children back to his hovel, the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the <b>synopsis,</b> it states the children are instructed to dance to the hurdy-gurdy. The organ grinder does not play a hurdy-gurdy. In the published <b>synopsis</b> the parents are named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} workload-based wavelet <b>synopses,</b> which exploit query workload {{information to}} significantly boost accuracy in approximate query processing. We show that wavelet <b>synopses</b> can adapt effectively to workload information, {{and that they}} have significant advantages over previous approaches. An important aspect of our approach is optimizing <b>synopses</b> constructions toward error metrics defined by workload information, rather than based on some uniform metrics. We present an adaptive greedy algorithm which is simple and efficient. It is run-time competitive to previous, non-workload based algorithms, and constructs workload-based wavelet <b>synopses</b> that are significantly more accurate than previous <b>synopses.</b> The algorithm also obtains improved accuracy for non-workload case when the error metric is the mean relative error. We also present a self-tuning algorithm that adapts the workload-based <b>synopses</b> to changes in the workload. All algorithms are extended to workload-based multidimensional wavelet <b>synopses</b> with improved performance over previous algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of workload-based wavelet <b>synopses</b> for different types of data sets and query workloads, and show significant improvement in accuracy even with very small training sets. ...|$|R

Approximate query processing provides important alternatives when exact query answers are not required. τ-Synopses [23] is a system {{designed to provide a}} run-time environment for remote execution of various <b>synopses</b> for relational databases. Our work introduces the τ-xSynopses, a system designed to support remote execution of <b>synopses</b> for XML databases. The τ-xSynopses system extends the design and the implementation of the τ-Synopses, enabling a single environment for managing <b>synopses</b> for both XML and relational databases. The system enables easy registration of new <b>synopses</b> from remote platforms, after which the system can manage these <b>synopses,</b> including triggering their construction, rebuild and update, and invoking them for approximate query processing.

The τ-Synopses is a system {{designed to provide a}} run-time environment for remote execution of multiple <b>synopses</b> for both relational as well as XML databases. The system can serve as an effective research platform for experimental evaluation and comparison of different <b>synopses,</b> as well as a platform for studying the effective management of multiple <b>synopses</b> in a federated or centralized environment. ...|$|R

While conventional wavelet <b>synopses</b> are based on greedily minimizing the overall root-mean-squared (i. e., L 2 -norm) error in the data approximation, recent work has demonstrated that such <b>synopses</b> can suffer from important problems, including severe bias and wide variance in the quality of the data reconstruction, and lack of non-trivial guarantees for individual approximate answers. As a result, probabilistic thresholding schemes have been recently proposed as a means of building wavelet <b>synopses</b> that try to probabilistically control other approximation-error metrics, such as the maximum relative error in data-value reconstruction, whic...|$|R
