50|$|On 11 December 2009 a new 3 mi loop {{was opened}} with Axminster at its centre. This allowed the {{previous}} sparse and irregular timetable {{to be replaced}} with a regular hourly frequency; trains are timetabled to pass at Axminster. Work had started in February 2009 on the £20 million project which included building a new platform {{on the site of}} the disused platform, installing a new footbridge, lifts and waiting shelter, strengthening seven bridges and 20 culverts, installing 12 new signals, replacing three miles of signal cables and modernising the <b>signalling</b> <b>panel</b> at Chard Junction signal box.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that an engine shed was {{provided}} upon {{the opening of the}} L&EG, given that as the first train of the day started at East Grinstead and the last train terminated there, {{there would have been a}} need to house the engine. However, the exact date of the shed's opening is unknown. Records show that LB&SCR D1 class No. 233 Handcross was allocated to East Grinstead shed when new in March 1883. The shed closed at the end of 1894; there were by now sheds at Three Bridges and Tunbridge Wells West. However, station plans from 1910 show that the water tank, water column and engine pit still remained. The station had north and south signal boxes; the north box was occasionally used to operate a crossover to the north but operation was transferred to the south box in the 1920s which was operational until 17 July 1987. The box has since been demolished and the line is worked from the Oxted <b>signalling</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A new {{signalling}} installation, {{believed to}} be the first in the world to include electronic interlocking equipment, was brought into use recently at Henley-on Thames... The branch was reduced to single track, with a passing loop at Shiplake in 1961. The line is continuously track circuited, and there are acceptance switches or levers at Twyford, Shiplake, and Henley. The equipment is designed to perform the basic functions of railway signalling apparatus by controlling the interlocking of signals, so that correct distances are maintained between trains that follow or cross or approach each other. This is done by means of computor sic techniques using arrangements of plug-in electronic [...] "bogie" [...] units, in which transistors and magnetic cores perform [...] "logical" [...] switching operations. There are no magnetic relays of conventional type... The installation at Henley is operated from a mosaic-type <b>signalling</b> <b>panel,</b> of the pattern already standard on the Western Region, controlling 36 routes on the [...] "entrance-exit" [...] principle with a switch at the entrance point of the route and a pushbutton at its exit. Track, signal, point, and other miscellaneous indications are also shown on the panel in the usual way. For reasons of economy, all points and facing point locks are worked manually from the existing lever frame, from which all the mechanical interlocking has been removed.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an application of}} the Microsoft Kinect camera for an autonomous mobile robot. In order to drive autonomously one main issue {{is the ability to}} recognize signalling panels positioned overhead. The Kinect camera can be applied in this task due to its double integrated sensor, namely vision and distance. The vision sensor is used to perceive the <b>signalling</b> <b>panel,</b> while the distance sensor is applied as a segmentation filter, by eliminating pixels by their depth in the object’s background. The approach adopted to perceive the symbol from the <b>signalling</b> <b>panel</b> consists in: a) applying the depth image filter from the Kinect camera; b) applying Morphological Operators to segment the image; c) a classification is carried out with an Artificial Neural Network and a simple Multilayer Perceptron network that can correctly classify the image. This work explores the Kinect camera depth sensor and hence this filter avoids heavy computational algorithms to search for the correct location of the signalling panels. It simplifies the next tasks of image segmentation and classification. A mobile autonomous robot using this camera was used to recognize the signalling panels on a competition track of the Portuguese Robotics Open...|$|E
40|$|The FGF signal {{transducer}} molecule Dof {{has been}} shown to act upstream of the Ras-MAPK pathway. It is unknown how Dof transmits the signal from the activated FGF receptor to the MAPK cascade. Several approaches were taken to analyse this mechanism. 1. One way to resolve this question is to analyse Dof mediated interactions. In this work interaction of Dof with selected candidates of a yeast two hybrid screen was analysed biochemically. Most but not all of the tested candidates were able to form a complex with Dof in Drosophila S 2 cells. The predicted capability of Dof for self-association was validated by showing that the molecule was able to form dimers/oligomers in S 2 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies of Dof with the FGF receptor Heartless showed that the DBB domain � an essential region of the molecule needed for dimerisation and shared with BCAP and BANK � is required for efficient receptor binding. A consensus sumoylation site is located within the DBB domain of Dof. Mutation of this site impaired binding to the FGF receptor Heartless. Dof interacted with the SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc 9 and was sumoylated in Drosophila S 2 cells suggesting that SUMO modification of the molecule might regulate interaction with the FGF receptor. 2. As a second approach phosphorylation of Dof was analysed that might influence the activity of the protein in signal transmission. Dof becomes phosphorylated in the presence of an activated FGF receptor at the conserved tyrosine motifs for PI 3 K and Csw binding. In addition, we identified a novel tyrosine motif as a phosphorylation target which appears four times in Dof. Strikingly, it is also present in BANK and some other signalling molecules. The C-terminal part of Dof is also phosphorylated and might be involved in conformational regulation of the protein, since the removal of the last 200 amino acids improved the binding affinity of Dof to Heartless. 3. Dof is cleaved in Drosophila S 2 cells, which might give an additional level in the regulation of signalling. This cleavage is caspase dependent, regulated by Dronc and requires an intact caspase cleavage site in Dof. However, a Dof transgene mutant for the caspase cleavage site rescued efficiently dof mutant phenotypes indicating that this site is not essential for Dof functions assayed in this work. Mutant Dof constructs with C-terminal truncations of different lengths that removed the caspase cleavage site varied in their expression levels despite their similar stability in S 2 cells. These differences were not seen in mRNA abundance but only in protein levels and higher expression levels correlated with the presence of a region in Dof identified as a binding site for the ribosomal protein S 10. Full length Dof showed expression levels comparable to that of the mutant construct lacking the ribosomal protein binding site. Thus, this is the first indication that Dof cleavage products might have additional roles in the regulation of Dof function. 4. One essential function of Dof is to activate the Ras-MAPK pathway in vivo. To find out if only the MAPK <b>signalling</b> <b>panel</b> is utilised by Ras activity the role of the three Ras effectors Raf, RalGDS and PI 3 K were determined in FGF signalling during Drosophila embryogenesis. This analysis showed that both the Raf and RalGDS effector pathways might have a function in FGF signalling but that additional Ras activity is required either to regulate these cascades or to turn on other effector pathways. Our results indicate that PI 3 K is not needed for FGF signal transduction. In addition to Ras, Rap 1 might be also involved in FGF signalling downstream or in parallel to Dof. How Rap 1 is activated and to what extent the two closely related Ras family GTPases share downstream effectors is not understood at present...|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, the {{beginning}} of the end for classic [...] "Control" [...] came with the commissioning of large power signal boxes from the 1950s. A power signal box (PSB) often has a number of signalmen operating multiple electric or computerized <b>signalling</b> <b>panels</b> and large illuminated track diagrams showing wide areas of operation. This makes traffic regulation much easier for signalmen to handle among themselves. In some cases, a Traffic Regulator is appointed, who may be consulted for train working decisions. Following the accident at Ladbroke Grove in 1999, it was resolved that supervisors should be appointed at key signal boxes. However, these supervisors are not train controllers. Similar appointments have been made at major signal boxes in New South Wales since 2003.|$|R
