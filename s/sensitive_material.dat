According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>material</b> before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to <b>sensitive</b> <b>material</b> ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E

5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>material.</b> Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E

30|$|Many ALD processes, {{with various}} Si {{precursors}} (chlorosilanes or aminosilanes) and oxidants (H 2 O, H 2 O 2, or O 3), were {{developed for the}} growth of SiO 2. Those processes usually require relatively high temperatures (>[*] 150 [*]°C) [12 – 16]. For processes compatible with thermally <b>sensitive</b> <b>materials</b> such as organic, biological, and polymeric materials, the catalyzed ALD [17 – 19] and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) [9, 20 – 22] have been used as an effective solution with process temperatures below 100 [*]°C. However, the commonly used H 2 O and O 2 -based oxidants can lead to material degradation in the case of moisture/oxygen <b>sensitive</b> <b>materials.</b> Compared to H 2 O and O 2, at low-temperature, CO 2 is not chemically reactive. In this case, using CO 2 as an oxidant can minimize the degradation of moisture/oxygen <b>sensitive</b> <b>materials</b> by avoiding unnecessary oxidization. Furthermore, CO 2 was reported by King [23] to be a viable oxidizing agent {{for the growth of}} PEALD SiO 2 films when using SiH 4 as a Si precursor. However, the growth temperatures of those PEALD processes, which were in the range of 250 – 400 [*]°C, are not compatible with high-temperature <b>sensitive</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R

500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may have gone too far, and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into <b>sensitive</b> <b>material</b> before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow. But being a sucker for a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful."

500|$|Raynor {{was also}} {{inspired}} by the issue of World War I soldiers who were executed for cowardice when they were suffering from shellshock. One of the episode's working titles was [...] "Soldier's Heart", an American Civil War term for shellshock. The final title recalls an infamous order from Field Marshal Douglas Haig on 11 April 1918, {{in response to the}} German Spring Offensive, which included the phrase: [...] "Every position must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement". This policy led shell-shocked soldiers, like the fictional Tommy, to be sent back to war after a very short recuperation period. Director Andy Goddard felt that a scene in which Tommy watches footage of the Iraq War was key to the episode; this experience tells Tommy that the human condition has not changed since 1918 and that humanity still makes the same mistakes. During the episode, Jack suggests that the British army executed [...] "more than 300" [...] shell-shocked soldiers for cowardice during the First World War. Executions for all offences numbered 346, of which 40 were for murder or mutiny. The remaining 306 were for desertion (266), cowardice (18), and other offences (22). While some of these can now be attributed to shell shock, most cannot, although all 306 were posthumously pardoned in 2006. Early drafts of the episode included Tommy asking for Suzie Costello, a member of the Torchwood Institute who had committed suicide in the series' 2006 premiere episode. In regards to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>material</b> in the episode, actress Naoko Mori stated that whilst reading the script she [...] "kind of forgot it was Torchwood and [...] it was science-fiction". She found the climax of the episode [...] "heartbreaking".|$|E

(See, for example, 1035 Cal. Evidence Code for rape crisis advocates, and 1037.6 Cal. Evidence Code for domestic violence advocates). However, these privileges are not absolute, and may be overruled by a judge upon a showing that [...] "the probative value of the information outweighs the effect of disclosure of {{the information on the}} victim, the counseling relationship, and the counseling services", or under a number of other limited circumstances.

40|$|In {{this study}} a low cost and low {{complexity}} optical detection method of proteins is presented by employing a detection {{scheme based on}} electrostatic interactions, and implemented by sensitization of a polymer optical fiber (POF) surface by thin overlayer of properly designed <b>sensitive</b> copolymer <b>materials</b> with predesigned charges.

2500|$|Direct {{access to}} Himmler also made Schellenberg privy {{to some of}} the Reich's most <b>sensitive</b> <b>material.</b> For example, Schellenberg knew early on about the {{arrangement}} between Germany and Russia concerning the partition of Poland, an agreement which presaged the military invasion. Once the Nazis invaded and occupied Polish territory, Schellenberg was entrusted with securing the rear areas by Himmler and Heydrich, which meant he oversaw the deployment of special commandos from the SD and Gestapo, units which carried-out brutal measures against the Poles. Another one of his areas of responsibility was counter-espionage, both within Germany and the occupied territories—a task for which Schellenberg seemed well-suited given his penchant for intrigue. Operating as an intelligence adviser to Himmler in Poland meant Schellenberg was at the front edge of the spear, but this did not mean he was incapable of being surprised. In fact, he was particularly shocked at the utter devastation wrought by the Wehrmacht in Poland and commented in his Memoirs upon seeing it that, [...] "Until then I had no real conception of what total war meant." ...|$|E
