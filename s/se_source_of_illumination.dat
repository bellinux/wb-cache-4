Along with being used in combat against the monsters that roam the hallways, this manipulation of light will also play a big part in solving certain puzzles along the way. However, Jake must be careful in managing his <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> light, as some <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>illumination</b> work on a timer, while having too many electrical appliances turned on will blow a fuse, plunging the level into darkness and resulting in Jake being pulled into the shadows by the creatures.|$|R
