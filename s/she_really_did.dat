500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>did,</b> and I know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E
500|$|The year 1992 saw {{the release}} of the book Sex by Madonna. However, the book, which {{contained}} explicit sexual imagery and pictures of voyeuristic fantasies, was negatively accepted by the critics as well as some her fans. Madonna's fifth studio album Erotica and the film Body of Evidence were released at the same time; both failed to garner critical and commercial acclaim. Hence she decided to re-invent her image, to connect with her fans and repair the damage that her provocative image had caused to her career. [...] "I'll Remember" [...] was one of the songs that was developed for this purpose. The ballad was initially composed by musician Richard Page before being reworked by Madonna and Patrick Leonard. According to Page, [...] "Madonna was brought in... she changed all my lyrics for the better. <b>She</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> a great job." [...] Regarding her feelings for the song, Madonna commented, ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Ricky Vela joined Selena y Los Dinos {{as their}} keyboardist. Although Vela was {{attracted}} to the group's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, he kept his feelings to himself. When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager Abraham Quintanilla, III, he began teasing him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela wrote [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and {{it was given to}} Selena to record for Amor Prohibido. Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart. Although the song was originally intended as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market. The group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to [...] "sweeten" [...] the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success. Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was [...] "internalized" [...] without affecting the originality of its recording. In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, [...] "What you got there is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. He mused, [...] "Now looking back, <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> a beautiful job when recording the song, she had so much passion. The song became a classic." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercedes and Riley reunite {{but when}} she discovers Riley does not love her she kidnaps Bobby in revenge and blames it on a Mitzeee, who has {{recently}} escaped from prison. Metcalfe said Mercedes does not have [...] "any regrets whatsoever. I think she does what she does at {{the time for a}} reason and she'll deal with the consequences later". Mercedes is arrested when Myra reports her to the police. Riley is shortly after shot dead. Mercedes is put on trial for two counts of perverting the course of justice, one for the kidnap and one for stabbing herself. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Mercedes lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) would advise Mercedes to blame Riley for the crimes as he can not defend himself. Mercedes reluctantly agrees and tells the courtroom that Riley stabbed her and was abusive towards her. Metcalfe felt the scenes were [...] "great to film", adding that [...] "the writers came up with some brilliant material". However, she felt the scenes were [...] "challenging" [...] to film as Mercedes [...] "completely breaks down and says how bad Riley was. From the audience's point of view, it's really going to be quite shocking". The actress added that Mercedes [...] "does feel guilty about it, but only as guilty as Mercedes can ever feel. So she gets over it very quickly!" [...] During the trial Jim suggests that Riley killed Lynsey and that Doctor Browning is innocent. Doctor Browning appears at the trial to give evidence, which Metcalfe revealed is [...] "a total surprise. I don't think she knows how she'll react until she actually sees him, and when she does they're back in that moment when he was dragged away from her. <b>She</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> fall for him hook, line and sinker".|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Roosevelt {{also made}} {{extensive}} use of radio. [...] She {{was not the first}} First Lady to broadcast—her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had done that already. But Mrs. Hoover did not have a regular radio program, whereas Mrs. Roosevelt did. [...] She first broadcast her own programs of radio commentary beginning on [...] July 9, 1934. On that first show, she talked about the effect of movies on children, the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence, and her opinion about the recent All-Star baseball game. [...] She also read a commercial from a mattress company, which sponsored the broadcast. [...] She said she would not accept any salary for being on the air, and that she would donate the amount ($3,000) to charity. [...] Later that year, in November 1934, she broadcast a series of programs about children's education; it was heard on the CBS Radio Network. Sponsored by a typewriter company, Mrs. Roosevelt once again donated the money, giving it to the American Friends Service Committee, to help with a school it operated. [...] During 1934, Eleanor Roosevelt set a record for the most times a First Lady had spoken on radio: she spoke as a guest on other people's programs, as well as the host of her own, for a total of 28 times that year. [...] In 1935, Mrs. Roosevelt continued to host programs aimed at the female audience, including one called [...] "It's A Woman's World." [...] Each time, she donated the money she earned to charity. [...] The association of a sponsor with the popular First Lady resulted in increases in sales for that company: when the Selby Shoe Company sponsored a series of Eleanor Roosevelt's programs, sales increased by 200%. [...] The fact that her programs were sponsored created controversy, with her husband's political enemies expressing skepticism about whether <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> donate her salary to charity; they accused her of [...] "profiteering." [...] But her radio programs proved to be so popular with listeners that the criticisms had little effect. She continued to broadcast throughout the 1930s, sometimes on CBS and sometimes on NBC.|$|E
2500|$|Fussi and Paolillo also {{examined}} restored {{footage of the}} infamous 1958 Norma [...] "walkout" [...] in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control. <b>She</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> have the bronchitis and tracheitis she claimed, and the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.|$|E

2500|$|Back on Mount Olympus, Zeus's wives {{ask him to}} take pity on Clio ("Have You Never Been Mellow"). Thetis retells {{the story}} of Achilles and his {{vulnerable}} heel. All the demi-gods and demi-goddesses are so afflicted. This gives Clio an epiphany: [...] She, too, is invulnerable, except for her heels, but when the evil sisters had her shot with the arrows of love, she had been wearing the [...] "mighty legwarmers," [...] and so {{she must have been}} completely invulnerable. This means that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> love Sonny! Kira then declares her love for Sonny and rips off her legwarmers ("I'm Free") and attempts to fly away with Pegasus and Sonny, before Zeus pulls them down with copper chains.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the nature}} of her songwriting, Amos stated: [...] "My songs might be confessional, but I don’t like giving away too many details. One of the reasons I’ve made ten albums and {{maintained}} my family life is that I respect my own privacy." [...] She confessed, [...] "At times, I have used made-up characters to keep the media at bay." [...] During an interview, she commented: [...] "I guess the girl that released Little Earthquakes was not a mother, {{and she was in}} her 20's, {{and there were a lot}} of things that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> discover. She found her voice...and then nine records later, the woman who is putting out Abnormally Attracted to Sin knows what she did with her voice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Money," [...] remarked the old man, {{knocking}} the ashes from his pipe, [...] "is very necessary to {{one who is}} incompetent to earn his salt.

5000|$|On February 15, 2017, Washington Post {{columnist}} Jennifer Rubin {{agreed that}} Conway {{should be banned}} from future television appearances.
