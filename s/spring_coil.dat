Several patent ductus arteriosus occluders (most notably the Rashkind device) have been developed and studied. Occluding <b>spring</b> <b>coils</b> have been used to close abnormal vessels and vascular connections. We previously reported the use of occluding <b>spring</b> <b>coils</b> to close the small patent ductus arteriosus in a small group of patients. This report describes our series of patients having patent ductus arteriosus closure with occluding <b>spring</b> <b>coils.</b> Methods. Between June 1990 and June 1993, 30 patients underwent cardiac catheterization to have patent ductus arteriosus closure by occluding <b>spring</b> <b>coils.</b> Selection criteria were age > 6 months and narrowest patent ductus arteriosus internal dimension ⪯ 3. 0 mm by color flow imaging. Definitive selection was based on review of aortograms performed at catheterization. A 5. 2 F coronary catheter was used to deliver one or two standard occluding <b>spring</b> <b>coils.</b> A loop was delivered in the main pulmonary artery, and the remainder of the coil was delivered across the patent ductus arteriosus and into the aortic diverticulum. Patent ductus arteriosus closure was confirmed by aortography or color flow imaging, or both. Follow-up after coil placement occurred at 6 weeks and 6 months and included two-view chest radiography, echocardiography and color flow imaging. Results. Of the 30 patients, 29 had successful implantation by one (27 patients) or two (2 patients) occluding <b>spring</b> <b>coils.</b> Of these 29 patients, 19 had a clinically apparent and 10 had a silent patent ductus arteriosus. Average ductus minimal internal dimension was 1. 7 mm (range 1. 0 to 3. 0). Complete closure of the ductus was confirmed in 27 patients by aortography or color flow imaging or both (in 24 within 4 h, in 2 after 6 weeks and in 1 after 6 months). Six weeks after implantation, two patients had a tiny residual patent ductus arteriosus noted on color flow imaging. One patient did not have successful implantation. This patient had a 3. 2 -mm ductus, and two coils migrated to the distal left pulmonary artery and could not be retrieved. There were no deaths or any significant complications noted during early or late follow-up in these patients. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract】Objective: To {{summarize}} {{our experience}} in surgical treatment of traumatic lower limb pseudoaneurysm. Methods: Twenty patients with traumatic lower limb pseudoaneurysm were surgically treated in our department from January 2007 to January 2012. The treatment protocols included interventional covered-stent placement (10 cases), <b>spring</b> <b>coil</b> embolization (2 cases), and surgical operation (8 cases). Surgical operations included pseudoaneurysm repair (2 cases), autologousvein transplantation (1 case), and artifi cial-vessel by pass graft (5 cases). Results: All {{the patients were}} successfully treated without aggravating lower limb ischemia. Pseudoaneurysm disappeared after treatment. A surgicaloperation is suitable to most pseudoaneurysms, but its damage is relatively obvious and usually leads to more bleeding. It also requires a longer operating time. Compared to a surgical operation, interventional therapy is less traumatic and patients usually have a quicker recovery (P< 0. 05). All patients were followed up once per month for 12 - 36 months by color Doppler ultrasound examination. There were no cases of pseudoaneurysm recurrence.

40|$|In many sensing applications, it is {{desirable}} to harvest the energy from random motion to power data acquisition, communication, and control circuits. However, constraints on size and mass often require one to explore the feasibility of energy harvest over traditional energy storage devices (i. e. batteries). In this research, tools are developed to enable the study of energy harvested versus size (mass/volume) for systems consisting of a multi-pole, air-core permanent magnet, <b>spring,</b> <b>coil,</b> and diode rectifier packaged within a rigid body device of arbitrary geometry. At {{the heart of the}} tool are time-domain, mechanical models of the magnet translation and the rigid body rotation under the influence of external and reciprocal internal forces. The models are derived to consider friction internal to the device as either viscous friction or Coulomb friction. The motion of the permanent magnet is used within an electrical system model of the magnet/coil/diode to establish coil current and electromagnetic force on the magnet. The combined mechanical/electrical model has been validated by verifying conservation of momentum and energy and comparing results with analytical predictions for oscillatory frequency and damping. Subsequently, the model has been used to characterize the energy harvest capabilities of a mobile, wireless sensor designed to measure and transmit water-quality data within a water distribution system. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} dynamic {{process model}} has been developed to investigate features of the inherently transient hot radial forging process, taking account of complex process kinematics, thermo-elastoplastic material behaviour and microstructural evolution. As an input to this model, a fully systematic thermomechanical testing matrix was carried out on a Gleeble 3800 including temperature (20 - 1100 °C), strain (up to a true strain of 1) and strain rates (from 0. 1 to > 50 s- 1). The proposed model can accurately capture vibration characteristics due to the high frequency short strokes during radial forging, which {{have been found to}} have a strong effect on material flow, forging load. Numerical analyses were performed to investigate the effect of different axial spring stiffnesses on forging load, strain distribution in the workpiece, and maximum axial feeding rate. It has been found that forging load increases significantly with increasing stiffness of the axial spring. The axial spring stiffness was also found to have a strong effect on determination of axial feeding rate and reduction ratio of workpiece by limiting the axial vibration amplitude of workpiece under the maximum compression of <b>spring</b> <b>coil</b> to avoid hard stop of workpiece in the axial direction during forging. It has been found that the spring stiffness does not have a strong effect on the strain distribution in the work piece. For practical application, the proposed model is applied to simulate the manufacturing process of a hollow transmission shaft using a GFM SKK 10 /R machine. Simulation results based on a 3 dimensional framework provide a detailed insight of material flow, residual stress and grain size evolution during the multiple pass radial forging process and the results are compared with available experimental measurements.

40|$|Objectives. Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the late fate of intraaortic <b>spring</b> <b>coil</b> loops after embolization of aortopulmonary vessels. Background. In some aortopulmonary collateral vessels and patent ductus arteriosi, the narrowest segment is close to the aorta; coils used to close such vessels will “straddle” the lesion, allowing one or more coil loops to protrude into the aortic lumen. The consequences of this procedure are unknown. Methods. We reviewed the cineangiograms of all patients who had at least one aortopulmonary collateral vessel or patent ductus arteriosus closure between January 1, 1988 and August 31, 1993. From this group, 53 patients had multiple-plane angiographic evidence of intraaortic coil loops. All subsequent cineangiograms were reviewed {{to determine}} coil position or movement and evidence of recanalization or endothelial coverage of the coil loop. We also reviewed each hospital record or communicated directly with referring physicians to identify any subsequent complications such as emboli or endocarditis. Results. Of the 53 patients with intraaortic coil loops, 49 patients had closure of one or more aortopulmonary collateral vessels (59 vessels), and 4 had closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (4 vessels). Patient follow-up ranged from 1 day to 66 months (median 20 months); follow-up was not available in 6 patients. Five of the 53 patients (9. 3 %; 95 % confidence limits [CL] 3. 1 % to 20. 7 %) died at operation or of end-stage heart failure. Patients with late angiography had no residual flow in 31 of 35 aortopulmonary collateral vessels (88. 6 %; 95 % CL 73. 3 % to 96. 8 %), and 0. 5 mm separated the coil and aortic contrast column in all 12 coils with adequate angiography, suggesting endothelial coverage of the intraaortic coil loop. No episodes of stroke, embolic events, endocarditis or coil migration were reported. Conclusions. Although coil occlusion of aortopulmonary collateral vessels or patent ductus arteriosi may produce intraaortic coil loops, endothelialization appears routine. No late complications associated with intraaortic coil loops were observed...|$|E
