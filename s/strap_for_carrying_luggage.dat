50|$|Tribeni can be {{travelled}} in tri-cycle rickshaws, {{commonly found}} in eastern India, though the cheapest available are shared autos, which might remain overcrowded {{and may not be}} practicable <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>luggage</b> along. The shared autos are a common sight across the town and are very often frequented by the residents to commute even 10 km on a single ride, irrespective of the concerns attached therein.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "de ville" [...] is French for [...] "for town" [...] and {{indicates}} that the vehicle is for use in town or for short distances. When added {{to the end of}} a body style (saloon, coupé, landaulet, etc.), [...] "de Ville" [...] indicated that the top over the driver's compartment could be folded away, retracted, or otherwise removed. As a vehicle for town use, the coupé de ville usually had no facilities <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>luggage.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{back of the}} targe was {{commonly}} {{covered in}} deerskin, and a very few had some packing of straw etc. behind this. Some targes, usually those actually used in battle, had their backs covered {{in a piece of}} red cloth taken from the uniform of a government soldier (a [...] "Redcoat") that the owner had killed in battle. [...] Although all the old targes show signs of handles and arm straps, of various designs including centre-grips, there is very little evidence to indicate that there was any guige <b>strap</b> <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> the targe over the shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the enclosed trunk on automobiles meant the spare tire could be placed out of sight, but this arrangement used up valuable space <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>luggage.</b> Edsel Ford had a special car built after returning {{from a trip to}} Europe that would have a [...] "continental look" [...] - [...] including a spare tire mounted on the trunk. The 1939 Lincoln Continental's short trunk with its external rear spare tire mount became a distinctive design. While {{this was not the first}} car to either carry its spare above the rear bumper or integrated into the rear bodywork, it was the first to do it so elegantly and thus this feature became known as a [...] "Continental tire" [...] even if the design was found on other brands.|$|R
50|$|A doorman (also porter in British English) is an {{individual}} hired to provide courtesy and security services at a residential building or hotel. They are particularly common in urban luxury highrises. At a residential building, a doorman is responsible for opening doors and screening visitors and deliveries.

50|$|The Gillig Low Floor began life in {{the mid-1990s}} as Gillig was {{approached}} by Hertz Corporation to develop a shuttle bus for its rental car parking lots at airports to replace its aging GMC RTS buses. Featuring a carpeted interior, luggage racks, and a central entry door, the primary design requirement of Hertz was a low-floor entry <b>for</b> those <b>carrying</b> <b>luggage</b> or with limited mobility. In 1996, the first buses for Hertz (named the Gillig H2000LF) entered production. Gillig would produce the H2000LF for Hertz through 2005, as the design was replaced by standard Gillig Low Floor buses.|$|R

5000|$|CAF series 8000: Originally {{designed}} for the MetroSur line , 45 trainsets were built and delivered by CAF in 2002. Each one is composed of three cars joined in the [...] "boa" [...] layout, which service line [...] as-is, while MetroSur service uses two such trainsets to form a MRM-MRM configuration for a maximum of 1,070 passengers (144 seated). The interior distribution is rather like that of series 7000, with a bigger clear area (i.e. without seating) in the first car <b>for</b> people <b>carrying</b> <b>luggage</b> to/from the airport and disabled people in wheelchairs. Like the narrower series 3000 trainsets, its bogies are insonorized and feature a hybrid rubber-pneumatic suspension system. Series 8000 primed the introduction of regenerative braking in the Madrid Metro. The system reverses the normal circuit of the electric motors when braking, thus making the deceleration return power to the network. Also, they feature the now-standard informative panels and gate activity warnings in the interior. This model has a stable population, which neither purchases nor retirements planned , though as the most current model from CAF it remains {{on the table for}} future enlargements of the Metro network.

50|$|Following World War II, Raytheon {{developed}} the SCR-536's military replacement, the AN/PRC-6. The AN/PRC-6 circuit used 13 vacuum tubes (receiver and transmitter); {{a second set}} of thirteen tubes was supplied with the unit as running spares. The unit was factory set with one crystal which could be changed to a different frequency in the field by replacing the crystal and re-tuning the unit. It used a 24-inch whip antenna. There was an optional handset that could be connected to the AN/PRC-6 by a 5-foot cable. An adjustable <b>strap</b> was provided <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> and support while operating.|$|R
5000|$|The Sarpac was {{developed}} by the company Hotchkiss-Brandt, and it was primarily designed as an anti-tank weapon, but it is also useful against fortified positions constructed of concrete. The Sarpac comprises a launcher that can fire 68mm anti-tank, dual-purpose anti-armour/personnel or illuminating rocket projectiles. Sarpac {{is one of the few}} light antitank rocket launchers offered in the 1960s and 1970s that offered both a high penetration anti-tank round and a general purpose round, which has a smaller HEAT warhead than the anti-tank round, and in addition has two metal fragmentation collars located around the body of the warhead, and while its penetration is not effective against heavily armoured MBTs it does have sufficient penetration to be effective in the light anti-armour, anti-vehicle and anti-personnel and is considered superior for almost all combat firing missions other than antitank and concrete bunkers. And due to the size and weight of general purpose round there is almost double the effective range of the anti-tank round. [...] The launcher consists of two telescoping tube sections with the inner one extending forward, a trigger mechanism, a sighting unit, a folding shoulder support and a <b>strap</b> <b>for</b> <b>carrying.</b> The sighting mechanism while considered unusual is robust and has the shape of a parallelogram when in firing position. On the front of the sight there is both a ranging scale and a grid which enables the operator to fire at moving targets. The projectile is fin stabilized with eight forward folding fins which lock into position after leaving the tube. The rocket motor burns completely before leaving the tube, so as not to injure the gunner. The Sarpac launcher weighs approximately 1.9 kg empty and was originally meant to be disposable, however tests showed that the improved launcher introduced later could be reloaded for up to 20 firings. And although developed and manufactured in France, the Sarpac was never adopted by the French Army, however it has been exported to a number of countries. The unit cost of the projectile and launcher is reported to be extremely low.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem to}} {{transfer}} handicapped or old people {{is as old}} as the transportation system itself. Earlier and even now they are transferred by many methods like on wheelchairs or with the help of sticks. But all these methods are time consuming and slow and also don’t have any provision <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> the <b>luggage.</b> These methods are good in general use, but on platforms these cannot be used as these methods will complicate the transportation and will disrupt the free movement of the people on platforms. So here our aim is to design a system or device which will be able to transfer the handicapped people from one platform to another, within the given constraints and should also comply with the societies exiting conditions. The system may be semi-manually driven or semi-automatic or may be fully automatic. Here first of all we are defining the Statement of the problem, followed by the analyzation of the need and then we have given various alternatives we have thought off, following it is the description of different alternatives with the problems we are facing in the practical application of the alternatives. The alternatives thus produced has been evaluated and the best one was chosen. Then, morphological analysis, is done on the chosen alternative, thus giving the final design and specification...|$|R
