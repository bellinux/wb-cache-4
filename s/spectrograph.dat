40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports on}} {{the current status of}} the World Space Observatory WSO-UV, a space mission for UV astronomy, planned for launch at the {{beginning}} of next decade. It is based on a 1. 7 m telescope, with focal plane instruments including high resolution <b>spectrographs,</b> long slit low resolution <b>spectrographs</b> and imaging cameras.

50|$|Traditionally astronomical {{observations}} in the optical region have separated into imaging and spectroscopy. The former can cover a wide field of view, {{but at the}} cost of a very coarse resolution in the wavelength direction. The latter has tended to either lose spatial resolution - completely in the case of fibre <b>spectrographs,</b> and partially in the case of long-slit <b>spectrographs</b> - or to have only coarse spatial resolving power in the case of recent Integral field <b>spectrographs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins <b>Spectrograph,</b> {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet <b>spectrograph</b> installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 was {{observed}} between February 11 and 15 in 2008 by the SOPHIE échelle <b>spectrograph</b> at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, determining the radial {{velocity of the}} transiting body. Use of the FIES echelle <b>spectrograph</b> at the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands gained other spectral measurements that yielded {{the characteristics of the}} star. Analysis of the SOPHIE and FIES data were used to constrain some of the orbiting body's characteristics. The discovery of the orbiting body's mass using radial velocity measurements led to its confirmation as the planet WASP-13b.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a team of British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons to the nearby bright star HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE échelle <b>spectrograph</b> at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle <b>Spectrograph</b> on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led to the discovery of the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E
40|$|PUCHEROS (2012, UC observatory) and FIDEOS (2016, ESO- 1 m La Silla Observatory), are optical echelle {{high-resolution}} <b>spectrographs</b> {{developed in}} the AIUC, Chile. A thorium-argon hollow-cathode emission-line lamp is used as wavelength calibration method in the two <b>spectrographs.</b> We show {{the results of the}} study in radial velocity stability of the instruments. Additionally, we identify the main factors that limit the performance of these <b>spectrographs,</b> and how we deal with them in order to achieve a better stability and precision in radial velocity measures. ...|$|R
50|$|The VLT {{instrumentation}} programme is {{the most}} ambitious programme ever conceived for a single observatory. It includes large-field imagers, adaptive optics corrected cameras and <b>spectrographs,</b> as well as high-resolution and multi-object <b>spectrographs</b> and covers a broad spectral region, from deep ultraviolet (300 nm) to mid-infrared (24 µm) wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|The Arizona Imager/Spectrograph {{is a set}} of imaging <b>spectrographs</b> and 2 D imagers {{for space}} flight. Nine nearly {{identical}} <b>spectrographs</b> record wavelengths from 114 to 1090 nm with a resolution of 0. 5 - 1. 3 nm. The spatial resolution along the slit is electronically selectable and can reach 192 elements. Twelve passband imagers cover wavelengths in the 160 - 900 -nm range and have fields of view from 2 to 21 deg. The <b>spectrographs</b> and imagers rely on intensified CCD detectors to achieve substantial capability in an instrument of minimum mass and size. By use of innovative coupling techniques only two CCDs are required to record images from 12 imagers, and single CCDs record spectra from pairs of <b>spectrographs.</b> The fields of view of the <b>spectrographs</b> and imagers are coaligned, and all spectra and images can be exposed simultaneously. A scan platform can rotate the sensor head about two orthogonal axes. The Arizona imager/spectrograph is designed for investigations of the interaction between the Space Shuttle and its environment. It is scheduled for flight on a Shuttle subsatellite...|$|R

5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE <b>spectrograph</b> on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE <b>spectrograph</b> and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} possibility that the detected radial velocity was caused by the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting the possibility that the body orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E
5|$|Later {{observation}} by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to {{the collection}} of 13,768 data points between January and May 2010 and {{to the use of}} the CORALIE <b>spectrograph</b> at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E
