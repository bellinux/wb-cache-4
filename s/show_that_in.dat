5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to <b>show</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

Statistics <b>show</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, but today the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer limited work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, building society and residential care home are based in the village, although the post office closed in January 2011.|$|E

5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies.

This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforesaid}} {{kings of}} Bǫglunga sǫgur most likely refer to Rǫgnvaldr and his son, Guðrøðr (died 1231), {{although it is}} not impossible that the king 'Rǫgnvaldr' in this source may instead refer to Ragnall, and that the king 'Guðrøðr' in it may actually refer to Rǫgnvaldr himself, since the latter's father was named Guðrøðr. Whatever the case, the events depicted in Bǫglunga sǫgur appear to <b>show</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the wake of destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles, which may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Scandinavia, Rǫgnvaldr and his son (or instead perhaps Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr) travelled to Norway where they rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and made compensation for unpaid taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} home {{to at least one}} al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi {{reportedly}} moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003.

However, this account was exposed as an outright lie by American officials who said that satellite photos <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 2004 the site was an empty field.
