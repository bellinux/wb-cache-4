2500|$|Yet {{frequently}} {{he showed}} {{himself to be}} more than a mere sightseer, with the painter, critic, and philosopher in him asserting their influence in turn or at once. A splendid scene on the shore of Lake Geneva, for example, viewed with the eye of both painter and art critic, inspired the following observation: [...] "The lake <b>shone</b> <b>like</b> a broad golden mirror, reflecting the thousand dyes of the fleecy purple clouds, while Saint Gingolph, with its clustering habitations, shewed like a dark pitchy spot by its side; and beyond the glimmering verge of the Jura ... hovered gay wreaths of clouds, fair, lovely, visionary, that seemed not of this world....No person can describe the effect; but so in Claude's landscapes the evening clouds drink up the rosy light, and sink into soft repose!" ...|$|E

She hung over his bed a canopy embroidered with gems which <b>shone</b> <b>like</b> stars; so that every time he intended to rise, he, on looking at the gems, thought it was still night. He continued to sleep, with the keys of the Temple under his pillow; and the priests therefore were unable to offer the morning sacrifice. They informed his mother, Bath-sheba, who roused the king when four hours of the day had flown. She then reprimanded him for his conduct; and the verses of Proverbs 31:1-9 are considered by the Rabbis as having been pronounced by Bathsheba on that occasion." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the essay}} [...] by Hakuchō Nishimura [...] from the Edo period, the mikoshi-nyūdō is a yakubyōgami that inflicts people with fever, {{and there is}} the story as follows. In the Shōtoku era, in Yoshida, Mikawa Province (now Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture), the {{merchant}} Zen'emon, while on the way to Denma in Nagoya, encountered a whirlwind, and the horse he rode on started to have its feet hurt, and when Zen'emon also felt unwell and started crouching, an ōnyūdō with a height of about 1 to and 3 or 4 shaku (about 4 meters) appeared. The nyūdō was almost like Nio, and as the eyes <b>shone</b> <b>like</b> a mirrors, Zen'emon came closer. When Zen'emon trembled in fear and lied down on the ground, the nyūdō jumped over him and went away. At dawn, Zan'emon stopped by a private house and when he asked, [...] "Are there strange things like tengu around here?" [...] he received the reply, [...] "Isn't that what's called a 'mikoshi-nyūdō'?" [...] Afterwards, Zen'emon reached his destination of Nagoya, but he lost his appetite, was afflicted by a fever, and even medical treatment and drugs had no effect, and died on the 13th day.|$|E
2500|$|Since the beginning, Solomos was in {{the center}} of the {{literary}} circles of Zakynthos. [...] After the Hymn to Liberty's publication, his fame spread throughout the Greek state. On the Ionian Islands and in Athens, the poet was known only by his published poems: the Hymn to Liberty, the abstract from Maria's prayer, Lampros, the Ode to the Nun and his poems written in his youth, many of them which were spread by word of mouth and many of them were set to music. [...] This means that his contemporaries' opinion was formed by these works and it was thanks to these works that Solomos gained the fame that lasted until his death. [...] The most important representatives of the First Athenian School admired Solomos' works even though they expressed their objections about the language used by the poet. [...] In 1827, Iakovos Rizos Neroulos wrote in the Cours de la literature grecque moderne: [...] "Dionysios Solomos' poems... have the value of a strong and fascinating inspiration, a fantasy full of courage and fertility". Alexandros Soutsos in the poem Letter to King Otto described Solomos (and Andreas Kalvos) as a great maker of odes who, however, neglected the beauties of the language and presented rich ideas poorly clad. Alexandros Rizos Ragkavis in Esquisses de la literature grecque moderne wrote: his spirit makes him one of Greece's greatest glories... Solomos <b>shone</b> <b>like</b> the most beautiful gem of Greece's poetical crown. [...] Even before his death, Solomos' poetical work was identified with the fatherland's concept; in 1849, the newspaper Aion wrote: [...] "the poetry of Solomos is not the poetry of a single person but the poetry of a whole nation". [...] Similar judgements were expressed even after the poet's death. [...] The magazine Pandora wrote: [...] "one of the finest poets of Greece and of Europe, the author of the dithyramb to Liberty, Dionysios Solomos from Zakynthos died at a thriving age". [...] The funeral orations of Solomos' students were of course more essential and referred to the poet's unpublished works, many of which they had heard their teacher reciting. Ioulios Typaldos described Solomos as the [...] "first and greatest founder of a new type of literature" [...] and Iakovos Polylas in Solomos' poems [...] "Prolegomena" [...] in 1859 refers to him as [...] "the national poet".|$|E
