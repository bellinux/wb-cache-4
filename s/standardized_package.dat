Material and Methods Data sources were EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, PsycInfo, Medline, and the British Library catalogue, from 01 / 01 / 1987 to 28 / 11 / 2016. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched for additional papers. Search strategies {{were based on the}} terms ‘tobacco’, ‘packaging’ and ‘illicit’. The search was restricted to English language references. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for empirical studies that addressed the topic of <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging</b> and illicit tobacco use. This resulted in 153 full text papers retrieved for screening. Following exclusions, ten papers were included in the review. Two reviewers’ extracted data using piloted standardized data extraction forms. Studies were assessed for quality and relevance using CASP. Results There was little homogeneity between included studies, so a narrative synthesis was employed. Of the relevant studies five reported smokers did not intend to or actually purchase further illicit tobacco following <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging,</b> although one suggested a small number of responders to online news felt smokers would be more inclined to purchase illicit tobacco, following <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging.</b> Two studies reported retailers did not intend to or actually increase sales of illicit tobacco following <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging.</b> Finally, two studies reported industry data on illicit tobacco were of poor quality and not supported by independent data.

A novel, improved and highly integrated cooling strategy for electronic packages is presented. <b>Standardized</b> <b>package</b> types, as for instance ball grid array packages, are equipped with a directly injected cooling support. The developed concept is a new and very cost effective concept, as fewer productions steps and fewer procured parts are required compared to traditional cooling concepts. The new concept is also easily scalable, as multiple components on an electronic product can be cooled both uniformly across the product and simultaneously. This increases design flexibility and results in electronic products with advantages in terms of performance, compactness, weight and production efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Given their {{commitment}} to practices science studies have bestowed considerable attention upon objects. We have the boundary object, the <b>standardized</b> <b>package,</b> the network object, the immutable mobile, the fluid object, even a fire object has entered the scene. However, these objects do not {{provide us with a}} way of understanding their historicity. They are timeless, motionless pictures rather than things that change over time, and while enacting 'historical moments' they do not make visible the histories they contain within them. What kind of object could embody history and make that history visible? We might learn from Michel Serres about objects and time, and about the way that histories cannot be left behind. The image of a dog cadaver, constantly orbiting a projectile in space, might turn out helpful here. Inspired by Serres, I suggest the folded object is a way to attend to the temporality and spatiality of objects. In this paper, I explore this new object by unravelling the history of a DNA reference sequence.

40|$|Background: This paper proposes an {{approach}} to estimating the costs of demand creation for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) scale-up in 13 countries of eastern and southern Africa. It addresses two key questions: (1) {{what are the elements}} of a <b>standardized</b> <b>package</b> for demand creation? And (2) what challenges exist and {{must be taken into account}} in estimating the costs of demand creation? Methods and Findings: We conducted a key informant study on VMMC demand creation using purposive sampling to recruit seven people who provide technical assistance to government programs and manage budgets for VMMC demand creation. Key informants provided their views on the important elements of VMMC demand creation and the most effective funding allocations across different types of communication approaches (e. g., mass media, small media, outreach/ mobilization). The key finding was the wide range of views, suggesting that a standard package of core demand creation elements would not be universally applicable. This underscored the importance of tailoring demand creation strategies and estimates to specific country contexts before estimating costs. The key informant interviews, supplemented by the researchers ’ field experience, identified these issues to be addressed in future costing exercises: variations in the cost of VMMC demand creation activities by country and program, decisions about the quality and comprehensiveness of programming, and lack of data on critical elements needed to ‘‘trigger the decision’ ’ among eligible men...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the CubeSat program, developers have been pushing the envelope of the capabilities that can be achieved in such a small and <b>standardized</b> <b>package.</b> As CubeSat missions have become more complicated the external surface area of these cubes has become a limiting factor for the missions. In order to harvest as much power as possible, the external surfaces are usually dedicated solely to solar arrays, thus limiting the external surface area {{that can be used for}} the primary mission. The ALL-STAR mechanical team has developed an innovative and unique system that allows for both the electrical power subsystem engineer and the science instrument engineer to have full access to the exterior of the satellite without sacrificing any of the quality or capabilities of the CubeSat and its overall mission. In order to accomplish this, the ALL-STAR team has developed mechanisms that deploy both solar arrays and the payload section from the standard 3 U CubeSat. The PEZ (Payload Extension Zone) effectively doubles the available area for the solar array on the CubeSat as well as allowing the payload to have access to the exterior of the satellite. These mechanisms are also innovative in that they use simple concepts and mechanisms to greatly reduce their impact on the mass and volume of the CubeSat as a whole. Through this cooperative design between maximum power collection and payload access, the ALL-STAR bus will allow for even greater CubeSat capabilities to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Using an {{isolated}} Milky Way-mass galaxy simulation, we compare results from 9 state-of-the-art gravito-hydrodynamics codes {{widely used in}} the numerical community. We utilize the infrastructure we have built for the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. This includes the common disk initial conditions, common physics models (e. g., radiative cooling and UV background by the <b>standardized</b> <b>package</b> Grackle) and common analysis toolkit yt, {{all of which are}} publicly available. Subgrid physics models such as Jeans pressure floor, star formation, supernova feedback energy, and metal production are carefully constrained across code platforms. With numerical accuracy that resolves the disk scale height, we find that the codes overall agree well with one another in many dimensions including: gas and stellar surface densities, rotation curves, velocity dispersions, density and temperature distribution functions, disk vertical heights, stellar clumps, star formation rates, and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. Quantities such as velocity dispersions are very robust (agreement within a few tens of percent at all radii) while measures like newly-formed stellar clump mass functions show more significant variation (difference by up to a factor of ~ 3). Systematic differences exist, for example, between mesh-based and particle-based codes in the low density region, and between more diffusive and less diffusive schemes in the high density tail of the density distribution. Yet intrinsic code differences are generally small compared to the variations in numerical implementations of the common subgrid physics such as supernova feedback. Our experiment reassures that, if adequately designed in accordance with our proposed common parameters, results of a modern high-resolution galaxy formation simulation are more sensitive to input physics than to intrinsic differences in numerical schemes.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{offers a}} {{detailed}} legal and policy {{analysis of the}} most far-reaching and already controversial measures presently envisaged by the reform of the EU Tobacco Products Directive, <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging</b> and visual display bans of tobacco products, under EU law. In line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - the former prohibits logos, colors, brand images, and promotional elements on packaging other than brand names displayed in a mandated size, font and place, whereas the latter forbids the display of tobacco products at points of sale. Although the analysis predominantly focuses on the adoption of EU-wide schemes mandating these measures {{within the framework of}} the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, it also discusses the legal implications stemming from the adoption of similar mechanisms at the national level. While the actual case law may effectively substantiate the EU's competence to embrace both <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging</b> and display ban, the introduction of these measures, by revealing the shifting nature of the EU overall tobacco policy from the free movement imperative to a public health objective, questions the almost limitless EU's authority to harmonize pursuant the internal market legal basis.

Once more, a legislative initiative in the field of tobacco is set to test, under the pressure of the relevant industry, the outer limits not only of EU's legislative action but also of its underlying decision-making process...|$|R
40|$|Background: To curb smoking rates, the World Health Organizations’ Framework Convention on Tobacco Control {{recommends}} that countries ban {{all forms of}} tobacco advertising and restrict the use of certain terminology on packaging and branding. However, in many countries, including the United States, tobacco {{remains one of the}} most heavily marketed consumer goods. Through a series of studies I explore several issues pertaining to the marketing of tobacco products including: whether some brands act as “starter-brands” for young adults (Chapter 2), whether certain marketing practices make cigarettes seem “safer” (Chapter 3) or more appealing (Chapter 4) than other brands and how removing branding from packaging impacts these perceptions (Chapters 3 and 4). 	Methods: This document is composed of three independent studies. The data for Chapter 2 are derived from a national survey of US adults known as the Population Assessment of Tobacco Use and Health (“the PATH study”), while the data for Chapters 2 & 3 were gathered using a web-based marketing experiment. Results: In Chapter 2 we identified 13 sub-brands on the US market that were used more frequently by young adults than among the rest of adult smokers. Nine of these 13 sub-brands were menthol-flavored, three contained menthol “crush” capsules and two were from a new lower-cost Marlboro line called “Marlboro Black. ” The second study suggested that packaging of a brand of cigarettes called Natural American Spirit conveys the brand is safer and that removing tobacco branding alters this perception. The final study suggests that the packaging of US cigarette brands differentiate in terms the perceived attractiveness of the pack, the perceived taste and harshness, and the social image they convey about their consumers and that <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging</b> both reduces these perceptions and forces brands to appear more similar in terms of these perceptions. Conclusion: These data suggest that many US cigarette brands contain marketing features that are appealing to health-concerned smokers and young adults. The data also suggest that <b>standardized</b> <b>packaging</b> would constrain the ability of manufacturers to market to these consumer groups through their packaging...|$|R

Healthcare workers in the CP arm received 3 days of training in quality improvement of CPs and in use of a <b>standardized</b> <b>package</b> including information on evidence-based key interventions and indicators. Healthcare workers in the usual-care arm followed their standard procedures. The teams in the CP arm developed their CPs over a 6 -month period. The primary end point was mortality. Secondary end points were: use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, implementation of organized care, length of stay, re-admission and institutionalization rates after discharge, dependency levels, and complication rates. Results Compared with the patients in the UC arm, the patients in the CP arm had a significantly lower risk of mortality at 7 days (OR = 0. 10; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 95) and significantly lower rates of adverse functional outcomes, expressed as the odds of not returning to pre-stroke functioning in their daily life (OR = 0. 42; 95 CI 0. 18 to 0. 98). There was no significant effect on 30 -day mortality. Compared with the UC arm, the hospital diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were performed more appropriately in the CP arm, and the evidence-based key interventions and organized care were more applied in the CP arm. Conclusions CPs can significantly improve the outcomes of patients with ischemic patients with stroke, indicating better application of evidence-based key interventions and of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} organization of primary health care for children in South Africa. The study is founded on a central research question: how has the injection of global humanitarian funding directed toward mitigating AIDS reshaped {{the organization of}} care for children in South Africa? Social science scholarship on global AIDS policy has largely focused on patients or service recipients; limited work, however, has been directed at the interface between care-workers and service recipients. In focusing on care-worker and service recipient interactions in local settings in South Africa, this dissertation contributes to scholarship concerned {{with the quality of}} care provision in the midst of widespread suffering {{as a result of the}} AIDS epidemic. The investigation is based on a twenty-one-month ethnographic field study, from August 2007 to June 2009, undertaken in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data collection methods included interviews with policymakers and policy implementers; participant-observation in English and Zulu of local groups engaged in orphan projects; document analysis of policy texts; and historical archival research. The results of the study are threefold: First, document analysis on orphan policy reveals how in South Africa it is based on a <b>standardized</b> <b>package</b> of interventions imported from global policy. This standard package adopts market-based forms of governance that transfer the responsibility for orphan health and welfare service delivery from the state to 2 ̆ 2 the community 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 the family. 2 ̆ 2 A second finding, derived from ethnographic observations, is that humanitarian policy designed to improve the life conditions of South African children is undermined by initiatives to ensure program efficiency through the reliance on unpaid community care-workers, which leads to conflict, competition, and the reproduction of racial inequality in care-work organizations. Third and finally, participant-observation in a rural village and an urban township reveal how 2 ̆ 2 orphan 2 ̆ 2 became a productive category for an array of groups involved in the implementation of AIDS orphan policy. However, the dissertation argues that orphan policy produces new forms of social exclusion amongst families, devastated by apartheid and AIDS, who do not qualify for orphan health and welfare support. ...|$|E
