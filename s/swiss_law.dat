5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, <b>Swiss</b> <b>law</b> is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.|$|E

25|$|When {{the fifth}} series lost its {{validity}} {{at the end}} of April 2000, the banknotes that had not been exchanged represented a total value of 244.3 million Swiss francs; in accordance with <b>Swiss</b> <b>law,</b> this amount was transferred to the Swiss Fund for Emergency Losses in the Case of Non-insurable Natural Disasters.|$|E
50|$|Today, typical Swiss cider {{consists}} of fermented apple juice mixed with 30% fresh juice which is added for sweetness. This drink is then pasteurised and force-carbonated. Imported cider is not common as according to <b>Swiss</b> <b>laws</b> cider must contain more than 70% of juice.|$|R
50|$|The Tibet Institute Rikon is a Tibetan monastery {{located in}} Zell-Rikon im Tösstal in the Töss Valley in Switzerland.

40|$|Switzerland {{has very}} {{detailed}} laws regulatingthe use {{of animals in}} agriculture, entertainment and science. There are also many <b>Swiss</b> <b>laws</b> governing the genetic modification of animals, protecting human embryos, and criminalising the creation of human/animal chimeras or hybrids. Despite all these regulations, {{the creation of an}} animal embryo that will develop a human organ using induced pluripotent stem cells and the subsequent birth of the resulting chimera would actually be permitted by current legislation. While this might appear to be an unhappy accident due to insufficient scientific foresight, I argue here that this loophole should not be closed, as the creation of human organs inside animals will probably be possible within 10 years, and <b>Swiss</b> <b>Laws</b> would currently enable the use of this process to save human lives through this allogenic or autologous organ source...|$|R
25|$|When Franz Joseph {{received}} the telegram informing him of Elisabeth's death, his first {{fear was that}} she had committed suicide. It was only when a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, that he was relieved of that notion. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and the answer was that whatever procedures were prescribed by <b>Swiss</b> <b>Law</b> should be adhered to.|$|E
25|$|The {{proceedings}} of debt collection by bankruptcy under <b>Swiss</b> <b>law</b> are roughly {{comparable to those}} under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. Bankruptcy (Konkurs / faillite) must be declared by the competent cantonal court on {{the request of the}} creditor. Once it is declared, the debtor loses all control over his assets and business, and the cantonal bankruptcy office (BO) establishes a provisional inventory of the assets.|$|E

25|$|<b>Swiss</b> <b>law</b> {{distinguishes between}} tax evasion (non-reporting of income) and tax fraud (active deception). International legal {{assistance}} {{used to be}} granted only with respect to tax fraud. Under pressure from the OECD and the G20, the Swiss government decided in March 2009 to abolish the distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud in dealings with foreign clients. Switzerland adheres to the international OECD standards with regard to administrative assistance in tax matters (decision {{to take over the}} OECD Model Tax Convention, in particular Article 26).|$|E
25|$|In his 19th footnote, Blackmun had {{admitted}} {{there was in}} the case a possible reason not to compel arbitration, raised in the federal government's brief: that, since the contract was governed by <b>Swiss</b> <b>law,</b> the arbitration panel could therefore decide to disregard the Sherman Act entirely and consider Soler's claims under that body of law. On the other side, the International Chamber of Commerce had conceded in its amicus brief that that could occur as well, though it considered the possibility unlikely. Blackmun allowed {{that this was a}} valid concern but countered that Mitsubishi had already stipulated at oral argument that American law would control the antitrust claims, mooting it in the instant case.|$|E

25|$|Qualifications, diplomas and titles {{earned from}} Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Zurich, EPFL), from cantonal (state-run) {{universities}}, from private universities recognized by state authorities, and from Fachhochschule-institutions (Universities of Applied Sciences run or recognized by official authorities, federal and cantonal) are protected. Accreditation is conferred by the Conference of University Rectors of Switzerland (CRUS) and the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (OAQ). Under <b>Swiss</b> <b>law,</b> it {{is a criminal}} offense, under unfair competition legislation, to profit by any unfounded academic or occupational qualifications. The private use of such a title, however, is legal. Thus, one can call oneself an LL.M., but one must not use the title when competing for clients.|$|E
25|$|This {{distinction}} {{is of particular}} importance {{with respect to the}} level of international judicial assistance afforded by Swiss authorities to foreign states that prosecute their own citizens for tax evasions committed in Switzerland, such as by depositing undeclared income with a Swiss bank. Up until recently, <b>Swiss</b> <b>law</b> prohibited all support to foreign jurisdictions for the prosecution of fiscal offences, except to the U.S. under the terms of a 1973 agreement. Since 1983, enforcement assistance is provided (such as the search and seizure of accounts and documents) for the prosecution of fiscal crimes (notably, tax fraud) but not for the prosecution of fiscal misdemeanours (notably, tax evasion). Under pressure from the G20 and the OECD, the Swiss government announced in March 2009 that it will abolish the distinction between tax fraud and tax evasion in dealings with foreign clients. The Swiss authorities will from now on also provide judicial assistance in the event of tax evasion by a foreign client. The distinction remains valid for domestic clients.|$|E
500|$|In January 1997, Christoph Meili, a night {{watchman}} at the Union Bank of Switzerland, found employees shredding archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with Nazi Germany. The shredding was in direct {{violation of a}} recent <b>Swiss</b> <b>law</b> adopted in December 1996 protecting such material. UBS acknowledged that it had [...] "made a deplorable mistake", but an internal historian maintained that the destroyed archives were unrelated to the Holocaust. [...] Criminal proceedings then began against the archivist for possible violation of a recent Federal Document Destruction decree and against Meili for possible violation of bank secrecy, which is a criminal offence in Switzerland. Both proceedings were discontinued by the District Attorney in September 1997.|$|E

500|$|In January 1997, Christoph Meili, a {{night guard}} at the Union Bank of Switzerland (precursor of UBS) in Zürich, Switzerland, {{discovered}} that bank [...] officials were destroying documents about orphaned assets, {{believed to be the}} credit balances of deceased Jewish clients whose heirs' whereabouts were unknown, as well as books from the Nazi German Reichsbank. The books listed real-estate records for Berlin property that had been seized by the Nazis, placed in Swiss accounts, and then claimed to be owned by UBS. The destruction of such documents is illegal under <b>Swiss</b> <b>law.</b> This edict was the legal basis and foundation of the Bergier commission, constituted on 19 December 1996. Articles 4, 5, and 7 made the destruction or withholding of documents relating to orphaned assets illegal.|$|E
500|$|The shows Tzara {{staged in}} Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, {{and he was}} in {{permanent}} conflict with the <b>Swiss</b> <b>law</b> enforcers. Hans Richter speaks of a [...] "pleasure of letting fly at the bourgeois, which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" [...] (see Épater la bourgeoisie). In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized {{that they were going to}} fight a duel in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist Jakob Christoph Heer for their witness. Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the Allies and Central Powers against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective propaganda efforts. While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 Vingt-cinq poèmes ("Twenty-five Poems").|$|E
