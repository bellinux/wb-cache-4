40|$|To {{elucidate}} microscopic {{details of}} proton cancer therapy (PCT), we apply the simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics (<b>SLEND)</b> method to H+ + (H 2 O) 1 - 6 at ELab = 100 keV. These systems are computationally tractable prototypes to simulate water radiolysis reactions-i. e. the PCT processes that generate the DNA-damaging species against cancerous cells. To capture incipient bulk-water effects, ten (H 2 O) 1 - 6 isomers are considered, ranging from quasi-planar/multiplanar (H 2 O) 1 - 6 to "smallest-drop" prism and cage (H 2 O) 6 structures. <b>SLEND</b> is a time-dependent, variational, non-adiabatic and direct method that adopts a nuclear classical-mechanics description and an electronic single-determinantal wavefunction in the Thouless representation. Short-time SLEND/ 6 - 31 G* (n = 1 - 6) and / 6 - 31 G** (n = 1 - 5) simulations render cluster-to-projectile 1 -electron-transfer (1 -ET) total integral cross sections (ICSs) and 1 -ET probabilities. In absolute quantitative terms, SLEND/ 6 - 31 G* 1 -ET ICS compares satisfactorily with alternative experimental and theoretical results only available for n = 1 and exhibits {{almost the same}} accuracy of the best alternative theoretical result. SLEND/ 6 - 31 G** overestimates 1 -ET ICS for n = 1, but a comparable overestimation is also observed with another theoretical method. An investigation on H+ + H indicates that electron direct ionization (DI) becomes significant with the large virtual-space quasi-continuum in large basis sets; thus, SLEND/ 6 - 31 G** 1 -ET ICS is overestimated by DI contributions. The {{solution to this problem}} is discussed. In relative quantitative terms, both SLEND/ 6 - 31 * and / 6 - 31 G** 1 -ET ICSs precisely fit into physically justified scaling formulae {{as a function of the}} cluster size; this indicates SLEND's suitability for predicting properties of water clusters with varying size. Long-time SLEND/ 6 - 31 G* (n = 1 - 4) simulations predict the formation of the DNA-damaging radicals H, OH, O and H 3 O. While "smallest-drop" isomers are included, no early manifestations of bulk water PCT properties are observed and simulations with larger water clusters will be needed to capture those effects. This study is the largest <b>SLEND</b> investigation on water radiolysis to date...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a project {{designed}} to enhance the employability and wellbeing of a marginalised community: the Deaf. It is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council/Department for International Development in the UK (ES/M 005186 / 1). The project adopts a Deaf-led approach to developing English literacy. This one year project features {{the development of an}} online platform: Sign Language to English by the Deaf (<b>SLEND).</b> The project’s ethos stems from a conviction that learning is situated in the demands and contexts of everyday life. People’s learning will develop optimally in situations where their existing purposes and abilities are recognised, and where they can collaborate, including with peers. Nowadays, online environments are significant in everybody’s everyday lives and offer particular opportunities for the Deaf to participate. This paper explains how the project has been piloted in five centres in India, through a combination of peer to peer face to face and online activities. The different groups contribute their learning activities to the <b>SLEND,</b> finding value in both process and sharing outcomes. The project includes research in Uganda and Ghana, among Deaf communities. This paper reports on the first elements of the research in those locations. Data were collected using intensive focus groups. Processes of recruitment and activities are described. Findings of this research show how access to the internet is particularly important for the Deaf, including the improvement of their literacy development. The findings suggest the fruitfulness of an approach to Deaf people’s English literacy needs. It recommends capacity building that is grounded on a “real literacies” approach, which is firmly rooted in an understanding of the place of English literacy in their lives. It also recommends the opportunities that exist for enhancement of their communicative capabilities and social participation in all spheres of life...|$|E
40|$|This {{report of}} {{research}} in progress introduces the project: Literacy development with deaf communities using sign language, peer tuition, and learner-generated online content: Sustainable educational innovation. The rationale, aims, and participatory approach to learning and teaching English literacy to deaf learners in India are described. Deaf learners are particularly marginalised in the mainstream educational systems of developing countries. This project responds through designing a participatory, peer tutor system addressing the ethnographic identification of authentic literacy needs. A virtual/mobile learning platform, Sign Language to English by the Deaf (<b>SLEND)</b> is used for sharing learning materials as they are created and to host assessment and other resources. The project includes deaf researchers in Ghana and Uganda as well as India, {{with the aim of}} generating sustainable approaches to developing this work...|$|E
40|$|In {{much of the}} world, English {{instruction}} is delivered to deaf signers by teachers who cannot sign themselves. This makes deaf people's English acquisition, which is very difficult (Kempt & Maxwell 1989; Schmitz & Keenan 2005), virtually impossible in many locations. This pilot project aims to provide English-language teaching {{for members of the}} deaf community in India including deaf young people in high poverty contexts, and draft a model of effective language-teaching interventions for them, to guide policy and further innovation. The focus is improving the quality of educational outcomes for a specific community which may not derive adequate benefit from traditional interventions. Peer education can lead to improved academic and cognitive abilities for both learners and tutors, and decreased absenteeism and isolation (Bruffee 1978; Falchikov 2001). The project proposes a model which departs from existing traditional language teaching practices in India, and takes an ethnographic approach which will see the development of materials and teaching led by local deaf tutors supported by trainers both in-country and from the UK, to ensure responsiveness to learner needs. It is an interdisciplinary collaboration between specialists in (applied) sign linguistics/Deaf Studies, TESOL, cross-cultural research on literacies, and learning technologists. The development of a virtual/mobile learning platform (Sign Language to English by the Deaf - <b>SLEND)</b> combined with the use of sign language and support from deaf peer tutors constitute a learner-driven, innovative methodology based on a functional approach to learning that will emphasise using language to do things (rather than grammar-driven). Adaptation of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) for the expression of learning outcomes will allow achievements to be expressed in terms of an internationally understood tool. To examine transferability across cultures, small-scale investigative fieldwork will take place in Uganda and Ghana to reveal literacy needs there and pave the way for future South-South collaboration. Using mixed methods from action research and ethnographic research, the project addresses the following research questions: 1. How can we develop and implement a deaf-led, community based, learner-focussed teaching programme that meets local community needs in a sustainable way? 2. How can we capture and measure, in a standardised way, the effectiveness of the combination of peer tuition, a dedicated virtual learning environment, and a staged training programme on teaching English literacy in this particular socio-cultural context? 3. How can we best understand and conceptualise the interrelated elements that characterise this approach and how they interact to facilitate effective teaching in this context? Qualitative data including classroom observations, analysis of interactions on the <b>SLEND,</b> and interviews inform the answers to this question. Community teachers/peer tutors will be trained in data collection and analysis, enhancing the research capacity of the deaf community. In India, the study has four overlapping phases: (1) Ethnographic study into existing literacy practices to identify the types of communication which are valued by deaf sign language users proceeds alongside (2) content development based on this needs assessment. Course delivery (3) is then carried out by local tutors with pre- and post- assessment to measure learner attainment. Compiling the interim and final quantitative-qualitative evidence for dissemination (4) informs national policy and ensures the project's on-going influence. In Uganda and Ghana, smaller case studies into literacy needs and practices will be carried out using the same ethnographic research tools. Focus groups in these countries alongside dissemination workshops will review the <b>SLEND</b> and discuss possible adaptation/scalability to teaching situations in deaf communities in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandins E (PGEs) are abundantly {{produced}} in the skeletal tissue, the turnover of which they can modulate acting on both bone deposition and resorption. We compared the effects of PGE 1 and PGE 2 on the growth and differentiation of rat bone-marrow osteoblast-like cells cultured in vitro. Both PGEs stimulated cultured cell growth, PGE 2 being more effective than PGE 1. PGE 1 inhibited and PGE 2 enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity. Both PGEs markedly raised osteocalcin synthesis, without apparently affecting collagenase-digestible protein production. Scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated cultured osteoblast-like cells were arranged in clusters and displayed a polygonal shape. PGE 1 did not alter cell morphology, while PGE 2 provoked elongation of cultured cells and sprouting of <b>slend</b> cytoplasmic processes. Morphometric analysis indicated that PGE 1 decreased and PGE 2 increased cultured-cell dimensions. Collectively, these findings allow us to conclude that PGE 1 and PGE 2, although being both able to enhance proliferation of osteoblast-like cells cultured in vitro, exert divergent effects on their differentiation. PGE 1 seems to slow-down osteoblast maturation, while PGE 2 appears to stimulate osteoblast differentiation to mature osteocytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This project provided English-language teaching for young deaf {{adults in the}} Indian Sign Language using community, using peer tuition and a bilingual online learning environment (<b>SLEND</b> – Sign Language to English by the Deaf). In addition, smaller pilot studies in Uganda and Ghana investigated the feasibility of using this approach for English literacy provision in these countries. Data relating to work in India include: a) Pre-, post- and delayed comprehension and writing tests from deaf learners, and test instruments; b) Self-assessment skills questionnaires, and questionnaire instrument; c) Annotations, using ELAN multimedia annotator, of filmed classroom interaction samples; d) Written English translations of group interviews/discussions; e) Observation notes by peer tutors in written English; f) Frequency data automatically stored in SLEND; g) Samples of learner-generated content on SLEND; Data relating to work in sub-Saharan Africa include written English translations of four focus groups in Uganda and Ghana. Project description: The pilot project was a multi-disciplinary collaboration between academics from the areas of applied (sign language) linguistics, ethnography, digital literacy and TESOL, together with deaf-led NGO partners in India and sub-Saharan Africa. The interrelated research questions revolved around how to implement a sustainable community-based and learner-centred English literacy programme for young deaf adult learners (research question RQ 1), how to measure the effectiveness of peer tuition and a virtual learning environment (RQ 2), and how to conceptualise the interrelated elements of the approach (RQ 3). The project took an ethnographic approach drawn from Literacy Studies in order to explore with all participants their current practices with English literacy and develop materials based on authentic identification of need ('real literacies approach', Street, 2012). Underpinning this was a commitment shared with the transformative mixed methods paradigm (Mertens, 2010) towards social justice and the furtherance of human rights. Teaching interventions were implemented at five field sites across India, {{and a series of}} exploratory scoping workshops was conducted with stakeholders in Ghana and Uganda. The project employed five deaf research assistants (RAs) and five deaf peer tutors (PTs) ...|$|E
