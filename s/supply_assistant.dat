Vzgojni zavod Planina opravlja svoje poslanstvo vzgoje in izobraževanja otrok in mladostnikov s tako imenovanimi kombiniranimi motnjami – to so motnje vedenja in osebnosti, lažje motnje v duševnem razvoju ter v vedno več primerih diagnosticirane psihiatrične motnje in sumi na duševno bolezen. Vzgojni zavod Planina izvaja program osnovne šole s prilagojenim programom z nižjim izobrazbenim {{standard}}om intri programe nižjega poklicnega izobraževanja, in sicer: pomočnik v tehnoloških procesih, obdelovalec lesa in pomočnik v biotehniki in oskrbi. V diplomskem delu smo najpej opredelili teoretična izhodišča kakovosti, sistema managementa kakovosti, procesnega pristopa v šolstvu in standardov ISO 9001. Še posebej smo analizirali standard ISO 9001 : 2015, saj smo na osnovi standarda podali ustrezne rešitve za organizacijo. V empiričnem delu smo si zadali cilj, da s pomočjo vprašalnika samoevalviramo kakovost dela v Vzgojnem zavodu Planina, analiziramo stanje in ugotovimo, na katerih področjih moramo kakovost dela še izboljšati ter podamo smernice za nadalnje delo. V drugem delu diplomske naloge smo s pomočjo vprašalnika podrobno analizirali stanje dela, počutja in motiviranosti zaposlenih učiteljev v Vzgojnem zavodu Planina. Ugotavljali smo, ali so se učitelji kdaj srečali s pojmom kakovosti, kaj kakovost pomeni, zanimalo nas je ali so učitelji seznanjeni s standardom ISO 9001 itd. Vprašalnik smo nato analizirali in predlagali ustrezne rešitve, predvsem na osnovi standarda ISO 9001 : 2015 ter podali ustrezne smernice za nadalnje delo. The {{purpose of}} this bachelor thesis was to analyze {{the current state of}} quality management deployment as well as to prepare guidelines for the design of quality management system in the Residential Treatment Institution Planina. The Residential Treatment Institution Planina carries out its mission of upbringing and education of children and adolescents with multiple disabilities - these are behavioral and personality disorders, mild intellectual disabilities and the growing number of cases diagnosed psychiatric disorders and suspected mental illnesses. The Residential Treatment Institution Planina carries out a basic education with adapted curriculum for children with special needs and three programs of lower vocational education, namely the Technological processes Assistant, the Wood processor and the Biotechnology and <b>supply</b> <b>Assistant.</b> In this thesis we firstly identified the theoretical foundations of quality, quality management system, process approach in education and standards of ISO 9001. In particular, we analyzed the ISO 9001 : 2015 as a basis on which we developed appropriate solutions for the organization. In the empirical part we are using a questionnaire to assess the quality of work in the Residential Treatment Institution Planina, analyzing the situation, noting in which areas we need to further improve the work quality and providing guidelines for further work. In the second part of this thesis we have analyzed (on the basis of the questionnaire) working conditions, welfare and the motivation of employed teachers in the Residential Treatment Institution Planina. We tried to determine whether the teachers have ever met with the concept of quality and what quality means. We were also interested whether teachers are familiar with ISO 9001, etc. The questionnaire was then analyzed, appropriate solutions proposed based mainly on ISO 9001 : 2015 and guidance for further work given...|$|E

The {{goal was to}} identify factors associated with Indiana PAs working in medically underserved, rural, and primary-care medicine. The study evaluated characteristics of PAs who chose initially to work in rural versus urban areas and who have continued to do so. From the literature {{and as a result}} of study outcomes, a framework was developed, upon which recommendations were made for effective methods of increasing and retaining the number of PAs in primary care within rural areas. Subjects: Data were obtained from applications for PA licensure submitted to the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency between the years 2000 and 2010. Additionally, PAs working in Indiana who graduated during this period were surveyed. Methods: Descriptive statistics quantitatively defined the Indiana PA workforce. Survey questions to this population focused on provider upbringing, education, and specialization interest, as well as recruitment and retention to rural, primary-care, or underserved areas. Chi Square tests and logistic regression were used, where appropriate, to examine the influence of independent variables on the choice of practicing in rural, primary-care, and medically underserved areas.

This study was established to determine the feasibility and impact of decentralizing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC) services in underserved rural areas using associate clinicians. Ten health centres (HCs) were upgraded by constructing and equipping maternity blocks, operating rooms, laboratories, staff houses and installing solar panels, standby generators and water <b>supply</b> systems. Twenty-three <b>assistant</b> medical officers (advanced level associate clinicians), and forty-four nurse-midwives and clinical officers (associate clinicians) were trained in CEmONC and anaesthesia respectively. CEmONC services were launched between 2009 and 2012. Monthly supportive supervision and clinical audits of adverse pregnancy outcomes were introduced in 2011 in these HCs and their respective district hospitals. After launching CEmONC services from 2009 to 2014 institutional deliveries increased in all upgraded rural HCs. Mean numbers of monthly deliveries increased by 151 % and obstetric referrals decreased from 9 % to 3 % (p = 0. 03) in HCs. A total of 43, 846 deliveries and 2, 890 caesarean sections (CS) were performed in these HCs making the mean proportion of all births in EmONC facilities of 128 % and mean population-based CS rate of 9 %. There were 190 maternal deaths and 1, 198 intrapartum and very early neonatal deaths (IVEND) in all health facilities. Generally, health centres had statistically significantly lower {{maternal mortality}} ratios and IVEND rates than district hospitals (p < 0. 00 and < 0. 02 respectively). Of all deaths (maternal and IVEND) 84 % to 96 % were considered avoidable. These findings strongly indicate that remotely located health centres in resource limited settings hold a great potential to increase accessibility to CEmONC services and to improve maternal and perinatal health...|$|R
5000|$|During {{his last}} year in the Philadelphia area, Paley began experimenting with metal again, {{specifically}} forging iron. He and Lechtzin pulled together a small workshop for forging in the garage of Lechtzin’s home, and spent the summer of 1969 reading about forging and learning how to work with different tools. Paley’s big breakthrough was in 1973, when he was awarded a commission from the Smithsonian to design the portal gates for the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C. [...] In order to build the gates, Paley found a space to rent and filled it with machinery. He hired a past student, Richard Palmer, as a full-time assistant, and they spent a year creating the famous Portal Gates for the Renwick.After the Portal Gates, Paley’s career in metalworking took off, with a focus in functional design: tables, lamps, and other usable forms of sculpture. Paley had created an array of decorative objects before the Renwick Gates, using his garage-shop. But after the gates were finished for the Renwick, Paley was left with a much larger work-space, in addition to a full-time <b>assistant,</b> <b>supplies,</b> and machinery. Paley already had another museum commission from the Hunter Museum of American Art in Tennessee for an 85-foot long ornamental fence. Since then, Paley has done many private commissions for driveway, garden, and fence gates in addition to his numerous public commissions. Some of his gates to note are the Portal Gates for the New York State Senate Chamber of the State Capitol (1980); the Victoria and Albert Gates for the Victoria and Albert Museumhttp://www.vam.ac.uk/(1982); and the Animals Always Gateway Sculpture for the St. Louis Zoo (2006), currently the largest sculpture at any zoo in the U.S.|$|R
40|$|Background: The United States is {{experiencing}} a primary care physician shortage that will grow {{in the next decade}} as demand for primary care services is projected to increase. The growth in physician, Nurse Practitioner, and Physician <b>Assistant</b> <b>supply</b> alone will not be adequate to meet the demand for primary care services by 2020. Creating pharmacist-inclusive collaborative care teams for outpatient clinical care can help alleviate this health care delivery shortage. Methods: A qualitative mixed-methods case study was conducted in Tucson, Arizona to determine the supports and structures behind the Pharmacy-Based Diabetes Management Program (PBDMP) at El Rio Community Health Center. Using key informant interviews from El Rio, other outpatient clinical pharmacy programs (OCPPs), and the Tucson Accountable Care Organization, coupled with Lean Management brainstorming group sessions, the study elicited information about how the experience of El Rio with the PBDMP can inform nationwide development and implementation guidelines for other OCPPs. Results: The PBDMP at El Rio provides a blueprint for other programs interested in creating an OCPP. Key contributing factors to program success within El Rio and the other OCPPs interviewed included a focus on six key practices. Challenges inhibiting success were pharmacist provider status and reimbursement of clinical services provided. Translation: Three public health practice products were developed as a framework to provide future OCPPs interested in implementing a pharmacist-inclusive practice model: 1) implementation guidelines, 2) a self-assessment outpatient clinical pharmacy program worksheet for clinics looking to create or expand an OCPP, and 3) a student management decision case study. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the value of considering all potential members of a care team for diabetes care management. The decision by a clinic to create an OCPP should be based on team-based approaches to patient-centered chronic disease care management. Clinics looking to participate in a CDTM model OCPP need to identify if organizational transformation is needed for program buy-in and consider relational coordination between clinical roles as a major component of the coordinated work needed for a successful OCPP...|$|R

Point C above resulted in the publication of “enemy” manuals like Technical Manual, TM E 9 - 803, 1944, for the German Volkswagen. TM 9 - 803 was the manual for the famous jeep. Similarly, TM E 9 - 369 A, 1943, is the technical manual for the German 88 -mm Antiaircraft Gun materiel. According to Field Manual, FM 21 - 6, List and Index of War Department Publications, 10 May 1945, Para II of Training Circular, 6 November 1942, was still in force...|$|R

The Aims of {{this study}} are: 1 - To verify the {{effectiveness}} of MuGardTM as a mucoadhesive, capable to heal the oral autoimmune ulcers. 2 - To verify the effectiveness of MuGard to decrease erythema. 3 - To verify the effectiveness of MuGard to decrease pain 4 - To verify the effectiveness of MuGard to decrease infection Background. Inflammation and ulceration of the oral mucosa occur {{in a number of}} different conditions. Oral 28 mucositis (OM) can be both painful and dangerous. The pain is often present both at rest and upon swallowing, or even talking. Painful swallowing can cause patients to stop eating and drinking, leading to both malnutrition and dehydration. Open wounds (ulcerations) can allow the ingress of micro-organisms, leading to infection. Quality of life for these patients is poor 1. OM frequently occurs soon after the initiation of chemo- or radiation-therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancers. Previous studies have shown that an oral rinse, Mugard 2 ̆ 2, started at the beginning of such treatments, greatly reduces the incidence and severity of OM signs and symptoms 2, 3. The unique aspect of the present study will be to begin evaluating the ability of Mugard 2 ̆ 2 to reduce the signs and symptoms of OM in patients who have already developed the condition due to having an autoimmune disease, such as Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, mucus membrane pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and erosive lichen planus. Methods. This pilot study is to gather data that will enable us to perform a sample size analysis for a future full-blown randomized control, double blind, trial (RTC). The patients recruited from the Dental Clinics at NSU, with documented diagnosis of immune mediated ulcerative or blistering conditions, who are not receiving systemic steroids, participate in the study. Exclusion criteria: Patients using other oral rinses to coat the mucosa, patients taking systemic steroids, infants and pregnant patients, because there have been not studies regarding these users. Two outcome measures were employed. The first was the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS), introduced by Sonis, et al, 1999; and validated as reliable. The second outcome measure was a visual analogue scale (VAS) in which patients rate subjectively the pain they are experiencing. Since pain due to mucositis is experienced both at rest as well as on speaking and swallowing, patients rated their pains separately for all three conditions (Appendix B). Each of these measures was obtained: 1) At initial intake, that is, prior to being randomized into either of the two groups (experimental or placebo) and therefore before treatments begin. 2) These measures were repeated three times, namely on days 2, 7, and 14 following the initiation of treatment. Blinding After each patient 2 ̆ 7 s initial evaluation, he/she was randomly assigned to either treatment group by a research assistant who is not otherwise involved with patient treatment or evaluation. This assistant assigned each patient a unique ID number which only the assistant knew. Based on this ID number, the <b>assistant</b> <b>supplied</b> the patient with the appropriate “medication”, which is either the Mugard itself, or the placebo Mugard. Thus, the patient did not know his/her treatment, and the investigator performing all subsequent evaluations did not know the patient 2 ̆ 7 s treatment category. After all data have been collected, but still without knowing treatment assignments, Drs. So-and-so and soand- so will compile, for each patient, his/her initial OMAS scores and VAS ratings, and also their three subsequent follow-up studies. Only after all such individual evaluations and scores were determined, the code was broken so that the subjects were placed into their assigned treatment categories. Next, the initial OMAS and VAS scores of the two groups was compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test to determine if the two groups were statistically similar before actual treatments began. Each group was first be compared to its own baseline values using the Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s test, which is a non-parametric equivalent of the repeated measures ANOVA. This gave light on whether either group improved statistically compared to its own baseline (a within-group measure). Then, the final values (i. e., those after 14 days of treatment) were compared statistically, again using the Mann-Whitney test, to determine if a significant difference was present. Results. The preliminary results are promising. The initial analysis shows that there is a statistically significant difference between the placebo and the MuGard group Conclusion. At this point, this research suggests that MuGard is effective in the healing of autoimmune ulcerative conditions. Grants. HP...|$|R
