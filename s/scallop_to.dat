After morning greetings had passed on both sides, and Evan, looking at Waverley, had said something in Gaelic to Alice, which made her laugh, yet colour up to her eyes, through a complexion well en-browned by sun and wind, Evan intimated his commands that the fish should be prepared for breakfast. A spark from the lock of his pistol produced a light, and a few withered fir branches were quickly in flame, and as speedily reduced to hot embers, on which the trout was broiled in large slices. To crown the repast, Evan produced {{from the pocket of}} his short jerkin a large scallop shell, and from under the folds of his plaid a ram's horn full of whisky. Of this he took a copious dram, observing he had already taken his MORNING with Donald Bean Lean before his departure; he offered the same cordial to Alice and to Edward, which they both declined. With the bounteous air of a lord, Evan then proffered the <b>scallop</b> <b>to</b> Dugald Mahony, his attendant, who, without waiting to be asked a second time, drank it off with great gusto. Evan then prepared to move towards the boat, inviting Waverley to attend him. Meanwhile, Alice had made up in a small basket what she thought worth removing, and flinging her plaid around her, she advanced up to Edward, and with the utmost simplicity, taking hold of his hand, offered her cheek to his salute, dropping at the same time her little curtsy. Evan, who was esteemed a wag among the mountain fair, advanced as if to secure a similar favour; but Alice, snatching up her basket, escaped up the rocky bank as fleetly as a roe, and, turning round and laughing, called something out to him in Gaelic, which he answered in the same tone and language; then, waving her hand to Edward, she resumed her road, and was soon lost among the thickets, though they continued for some time to hear her lively carol, as she proceeded gaily on her solitary journey.|$|E

Also, Valencina de la Concepción has a big Calcolithic deposit, one of the biggest of Spain. In Valencina there are two very famous dolmens, the dolmen of Matarrubilla and the Dolmen de la Pastora. A dolmen is a megalithic tomb with several upright stones supporting a flat table or capstone. Many date back to pre 3000BC. Originally the dolmens were covered with earth to form a barrow, but time has eroded everything leaving just the stones intact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Concerted {{evolution}} has been believed {{to account for}} homogenization of genes within multigene families. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the homogenization have been under debate. Use of interspecific hybrid system allows detection of greater level of sequence variation, and therefore, provide advantage for tracing the sequence changes. In this work, we have used an interspecific hybrid system of <b>scallop</b> <b>to</b> study the sequence homogenization processes of rRNA genes. Results Through {{the use of a}} hybrid scallop system (Chlamys farreri ♀ × Argopecten irradians ♂), here we provide solid molecular and cellular evidence for homogenization of the rDNA sequences into maternal genotypes. The ITS regions of the rDNA of the two scallop species exhibit distinct sequences and thereby restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, and such a difference was exploited to follow the parental ITS contributions in the F 1 hybrid during early development using PCR-RFLP. The representation of the paternal ITS decreased gradually in the hybrid during the development of the hybrid, and almost diminished at the 14 th day after fertilization while the representation of the maternal ITS gradually increased. Chromosomal-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in the hybrid revealed the presence of maternal ITS sequences on the paternal ITS-bearing chromosomes, but not vice versa. Sequence analysis of the ITS region in the hybrid not only confirmed the maternally biased conversion, but also allowed the detection of six recombinant variants in the hybrid involving short recombination regions, suggesting that site-specific recombination may be involved in the maternally biased gene conversion. Conclusion Taken together, these molecular and cellular evidences support rapid concerted gene evolution via maternally biased gene conversion. As such a process would lead to the expression of only one parental genotype, and have the opportunities to generate recombinant intermediates; this work may also have implications in novel hybrid zone alleles and genetic imprinting, as well as in concerted gene evolution. In the course of evolution, many species may have evolved involving some levels of hybridization, intra- or interspecific, the sex-biased sequence homogenization could have led to a greater role of one sex than the other in some species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) assay {{was used}} in three species of {{scallops}} for quantifying their ability to neutralise peroxyl (ROO*) and hydroxyl (*OH) radicals and per‐oxynitrite (HOONO). Adamussium colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for comparison with a related temperate species. TOSC values for ROO* were significantly higher in A. colbecki, indicating that this species is the most efficient ROO* scavenger. Mediterranean scallops had the lowest TOSC for ROO*. Adamussium colbecki also exhibited the highest scavenging capacity for *OH with values more than two‐fold greater than for C. islandicus and P. jacobaeus. TOSC values for HOONO were lower for all scallops as compared to those for ROO* or *OH; for microsomes they {{were not significantly different}} among the species for any reactive oxygen species studied, and the percentage contribution to the specific TOSC for the various oxidants of microsomes of all scallops accounted for 1 – 3 % of the total TOSC of the post‐mitochondrial fraction. The specific TOSC of scallop microsomes for *OH was ‐ 10 times lower than that for ROO* or HOONO. The higher basal capability of the Antarctic <b>scallop</b> <b>to</b> neutralise different reactive oxygen species is discussed in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment, and TOSC is validated as a quantifiable measure of susceptibility to oxidative stress in marine organisms. In a second part of this study, the seasonal fluctuations of susceptibility to oxidative stress were analysed in the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki by the TOSC Assay. A marked increase in the capability to neutralise peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals was demonstrated at the end of December, while resistance towards peroxynitrite did not show significant variations during the Antarctic summer. The increased resistance to these specific oxyradicals was almost contemporary with the period of highest feeding activity and the development of gonadic tissues. Sensitivity to hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals toxicity was also influenced by UV‐B and UV‐? wavelengths, as indicated by the lower TOSC values in scallops exposed under laboratory conditions. Toxicity of UV radiation seems partly mediated by formation of reactive oxygen species caused by the direct exposure of mantle edges and/or the photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide in sea water...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} survey indicates that {{much has been}} published on algal symbiosis with animals, however, few accounts have been presented in which the algal partner is considered parasitic. Previous reports on the endozoic algae of the giant scallop, Placopecten magellanicus (Gmelin), indicates that the relationship is parasitic. This definition is maintained here {{with the realization that}} future investigations of both partners are required to fully explain the association. [...] Description of the algal colonies within the tissues of the giant scallop is presented. Quantitative analysis of the colonies within the mantle tissue indicates a definite distribution pattern. Algal colony concentration was found to be highest within a very narrow delicate strip of tissue, the shell fold, which lies in direct contact with the shell. Colonies were more numerous and larger within the mid-mantle regions of the shell fold tissue. Theories involved in this distribution pattern are presented. [...] Description of the alga involved in symbiosis is difficult to accomplish completely since there are differences in morphology from in vivo and in vitro. It is stressed that in newly reported associations it is necessary to describe the alga both from culture and from the animal. Based on morphology in vivo and in vitro a possible taxonomic position is presented. The alga appears to belong to the Class Chlorophyceae, Order Chlorococcales. Evidence for this position is gained from morphology, reproduction and pigmentation as determined by paper chromatography and spectrophotometry. Designation to a Family is hampered by discrepencies in reproduction in vitro as compared with in vivo. The Family Coccomyxaceae and Family Oocystaceae are suggested as possible positions. However, it is pointed out that positive identification of this endozoic alga will have to await electron microscopy studies. [...] Re-infection experiments demonstrate a change in morphology of the algal cells from the in vitro to the in vivo habitat as well as demonstrate the tissue and cellular responses of the giant <b>scallop</b> <b>to</b> the algal cells. [...] Besides the tissues previously reported to be infected by the endozoic algae, colonies were found within the gill filaments illustrating that settlement is possible in tissues where ciliary action occurs. Colonies were also found deep within the adductor muscle and on the anus. Algal cells were observed within blood cells of the circulatory system as well as within phagocytes within the infected tissues. [...] Theories on the mode of infection are presented based on experimental evidence and literature reports. Initial infection is suggested to be more likely via the digestive system than via mantle penetration as previously suggested. Phagocytosis is suggested {{to play a major role}} in the mode of infection and transmission of the algae throughout the scallop tissue as well as spread of the infection to other scallops...|$|E
