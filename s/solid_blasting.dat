40|$|A {{combined}} {{blast fence}} is introduced {{in this paper}} to improve the <b>solid</b> <b>blast</b> fences and louvered ones. Experiments of the jet engine exhaust flow (hereinafter jet flow for short) field and tests of three kinds of blast fences in two positions were carried out. The {{results show that the}} pressure and temperature at the centre of the jet flow decrease gradually as the flow moves farther away from the nozzle. The pressure falls fast with the maximum rate of 41. 7 %. The dynamic pressure 150 m away from the nozzle could reach 58. 8 Pa, with a corresponding wind velocity of 10 m/s. The temperature affected range of 40 °C is 113. 5 × 20 m. The combined blast fence not only reduces the pressure of the flow in front of it but also solves the problems that the turbulence is too strong behind the <b>solid</b> <b>blast</b> fences and the pressure is too high behind the louvered blast fences. And the pressure behind combined blast fence is less than 10 Pa. The height of the fence is related to the distance from the jet nozzle. The nearer the fence is to the nozzle, the higher it is.

40|$|Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) is an {{important}} direct-write technique for printing of materials and devices with micron and sub-micron resolution [1, 2]. In the conventional LIFT technique the material to be printed (the donor) is coated onto a laser-transparent substrate (the carrier). A laser pulse is then focussed at the carrier-donor interface which melts or ablates the donor and transfers it onto a nearby placed substrate (the receiver) as shown in Fig. 1. The inherent disadvantage of the conventional LIFT technique is that the donor acts as its own propellant and hence gets damaged during the transfer.

Flood damage only months after completion of the race completely destroyed the syndicate's finances with the mining operations taken over by John Moffat's Irvinebank Mining Company under manager William Waddell, later manager at Kooraboora Battery. The Irvinebank Mining Company then conducted sluicing operations on the Tate during favourable seasons. This company practiced a policy of preference for public ore designed to ensure a continuous supply of ore for processing at the company's mills. This practice provided quick returns for individual miners and encouraged them to work their claims more effectively. At Fischerton the company purchased the winnings of many of the old prospectors who scratched a living from the area's alluvial deposit.|$|R

Four {{kinds of}} {{industrial}} <b>solid</b> waste, granulated <b>blast</b> furnace slag (GBFS), {{electric furnace steel}} slag (EFSS), semi-dry flue gas desulfurization slag (FGDS) and gypsum were activated by mechanochemistry to prepare a novel kind of cementious material, DA type soil solidification agent (DA agent). Compared to the traditional cementious materials, this paper evaluated DA agent used in silt soil solidification project. Test results showed that DA- 4 was prepared with adding the 40 % CFBA, 39 % GBFS, 11 % OPC clinker and 10 % gypsum by mill and more superior in material characteristics. It was found that compressive strength of DA- 4 paste and mortar specimens at 28 -days cured age were 46. 0 and 27. 3 MPa respectively; 5 % of DA- 4 was used to stabilize the silt soil in lab and the maximum dry unit weight, optimum moisture content, unconfined compressive strength and CBR value were 1. 754 g/cm 3, 15. 35 %, 1. 15 MPa and 95. 5 % respectively. The hardening mechanism of prepared cementious materials is explained by two points: the sulfite or sulfate activation on alkali blast furnace slag; and the hydration product produced from cement clinker hydration process.

40|$|Citation: Dern, Harry Leroy. The salt {{industry}} in Kansas. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1900. Introduction: Salt {{is one of}} most useful minerals that is produced from {{the bowels of the}} earth. It is indispensable to us as an appetizer, and for preserving meat, and from Biblical times down to the present it has been in constant demand. In the first books of the Old Testament, we find salt spoken of, and we have records of its being manufactured by mechanical means before the birth of Christ. In America, the Jesuit missionaries found salt springs while among the Indians, and as early as the middle of the seventeenth century, salt was manufactured by the Indians in New York. It was not until 1878 that rock salt was discovered in New York, and ten years later, inexhaustible beds were found in Kansas, Michigan, Louisiana, Utah, and other states. The salt in Kansas occurs in two relatively distinct forms: (1) That left in the salt marshes when the evaporation takes place during dry seasons; and second, rock salt, found beneath the surface. The area containing salt marshes reaches from Republic county to Barber county. Rock salt is know to exist under an area comprising several counties in the south central part of the state. (See Plate II). Salt was collected from the marshes as early as 1861, but Kansas was not counted with the salt producing states until rock salt was discovered in 1888. Two kinds of salt are sent out from the factories; (1), Rock salt, in which the <b>solid</b> rock is <b>blasted,</b> brought to the surface, crushed, screened, and put on the market; and (2), evaporated salt, in which brine is evaporated in large pans or vats, leaving the crystalized salt ready for the market...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{conditions}} believed to underlie astrophysical phenomena {{have been difficult to}} achieve in a laboratory setting. For example, models of supernova remnant evolution rely on a detailed understanding of the propagation of shock waves with gigabar pressures at temperatures of 1 keV or more where radiative effects can be important. Current models of gamma ray bursts posit a relativistically expanding plasma fireball with copious production of electron-positron pairs, a difficult scenario to experimentally verify. However, a new class of lasers, such as the Petawatt laser,Perry 1996 are capable of producing focused intensities greater than 10 20 W/cm&sup 2; where such relativistic effects can be observed and even dominate the laser-target interaction. There is ample evidence in observational data from supernova remnants of the aftermath of the passage of radiative shock or blast waves. In the early phases of supernova remnant evolution, the radially-expanding shock wave expands nearly adiabatically since it is traveling at a very high velocity as it begins to sweep up the surrounding interstellar gas. A Sedov-Taylor blast wave solution can be applied to this phase,Taylor 1950, Sedov 1959 when the mass of interstellar gas swept up by the blast greatly exceeds the mass of the stellar ejecta, or a self-similar driven wave model can be applied if the ejecta play a significant role. Chevalier 1982 As the mass of the swept up material begins to greatly exceed the mass of the stellar ejecta, the evolution transitions to a radiative phase wherein the remnant can be modeled as an interior region of ldw-density, high-pressure gas surrounded by a thin, spherical shell of cooled, dense gas with a radiative shock as its outer boundary, the pressure-driven snowplow. Blondin et al. 1998 Until recently it has not been feasible to devise laboratory experiments wherein shock waves with initial pressures in excess of several hundred Mbar and temperatures approaching 1 keV are achieved in order to validate the models of the expanding blast wave launched by a supernova in both of its phases of evolution. We report on a new experiment designed to follow the propagation of a strong blast wave launched by the interaction of an intense short pulse laser with a <b>solid</b> target. This <b>blast</b> wave is generated by the irradiation of the front surface of a layered, solid target with N 400 J of 1 pm laser radiation in a 20 ps pulse focused to a N 50,um diameter spot, which produces an intensity in excess of 10 18 W/cm&sup 2;. These conditions approximate a point explosion and a blast wave is predicted to be generated with an initial pressure of several hundred megabars which decays as it travels approximately radially outward from the interaction region. We have utilized streaked optical pyrometry of the blast front to determine its time of arrival at the rear surface of the target. Applications of a self-similar Taylor-Sedov blast wave solution allows the amount of energy deposited to be estimated. By varying the parameters of the laser pulse which impinges on the target, pressures on the order of 1 Gbar with initial temperatures in excess of 1 kev are achievable. At these temperatures and densities radiative processes are coupled to the hydrodynamic evolution of the system. Short pulse lasers produce a unique environment for the study of coupled radiation-hydrodynamics in a laboratory setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the use of inorganic and organic wastes of industry and municipalities as adsorbents and immobilizing agents of heavy metals from aqueous solutions and from a Pb/Zn-contaminated alkaline soil. The use of such materials as adsorbents and immobilizing agents would reduce the cost and need for their disposal as well as reducing pollution of ground and surface waters from contaminated effluent streams and reducing the bioavailability of metals in contaminated soils. In the first study, the adsorption capacity of seven inorganic <b>solid</b> wastes [air-cooled <b>blast</b> furnace (BF) slag, water quenched BF slag, steel furnace slag, coal fly ash, coal bottom ash, water treatment sludge, and red mud] for Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, Zn 2 + and Cr 3 + was determined in batch adsorption experiments. All materials had the ability to remove metal cations from aqueous solution and their relative adsorption abilities increased greatly with increasing pH. The magnitude of adsorption at pH 6. 0 followed the general order: Cr 3 + ≥ Pb 2 + ≥ Cu 2 + > Zn 2 + = Cd 2 +. The quantities of previously adsorbed Pb and Cd desorbed in 0. 01 M NaNO 3 electrolyte were very small but those removed with 0. 01 M HNO 3, and more particularly 0. 10 M HNO 3, were substantial. Water treatment sludge was shown to maintain its Pb and Cd adsorption capability over eight successive cycles of adsorption/regeneration using 0. 10 M HNO 3 as a regenerating agent. By contrast, for BF slag and red mud, there was a pronounced decline in adsorption of both Pb and Cd after only one regeneration cycle. This was explained in terms of residual surface alkalinity being a key factor contributing to the high adsorption capability of the latter two materials and that acid pre-treatment resulted in neutralization of much of this alkalinity. It was concluded that alum water treatment sludge showed greatest potential as an adsorbent. In the second study, the adsorption/desorption and regeneration capacity of two different samples of alum water treatment sludge for removal of Pb(II), Cr(III) and Cr(VI) (i. e. CrO 42 -) from aqueous solution was investigated. Adsorption characteristics of the two samples were generally similar. Adsorption isotherm data for all three ions fitted equally well to Freundlich and Langmuir equations. Maximum adsorption capacity and indices of adsorption intensity both followed the order: Cr(III) > Pb(II) > Cr(VI). Kinetic data correlated well with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model suggesting the process involved in adsorption was chemisorption. Adsorption was pH-dependant with percentage adsorption of Cr(III) and Pb(II) increasing from Cu 2 + > Pb 2 + > Zn 2 + ≥ Cd 2 +. For pine bark, compost, mill mud and prawn shell, quantities of previously adsorbed Pb and Cd desorbed in 0. 01 M NaNO 3 electrolyte were negligible. However, HNO 3 at concentrations of 0. 10 M and 0. 50 M HNO 3 was effective at removing both adsorbed Pb and Cd. When 0. 10 M HNO 3 was used as the regenerating agent, pine bark and compost maintained their Pb and Cd adsorption capacity over 8 successive adsorption/regeneration cycles. By contrast, mill mud and prawn shell showed a noticeable decrease in adsorption capacity after only one regeneration cycle. This was attributed to their significant CaCO 3 content (which is acid-soluble) that contributes substantially to their adsorption capacity. Compost, {{and to a lesser extent}} pine bark, showed great potential as a low-cost adsorbent. In the fourth study, five of the most effective adsorbents identified in the above studies (water treatment sludge, BF slag, red mud, compost and mill mud) were evaluated as metal immobilizing agents in an alkaline Pb/Zn-contaminated soil. Materials were incubated with the soil for a period of 12 months at rates of 5 and 10 % w/w, after which, Rhodes grass was grown in the soils in a greenhouse study. Addition of BF slag, water treatment sludge and red mud markedly reduced acetic acid-, DTPA-, and EDTA-extractable Zn levels, while addition of mill mud, compost and red mud lowered acetic acid and DTPA-extractable Pb concentrations. Applications of red mud, mill mud and compost caused a significant increase in grass yield. Rhodes grass biomass was negatively correlated with both concentrations of extractable Pb in the soil and plant tissue Pb concentrations. Red mud was the most effective material for reducing the extractability of both Pb and Zn. From the research, it was concluded that in relation of both adsorption capacity and desorption/regeneration capability, water treatment sludge and composted green waste showed great potential as effective, low-cost adsorbents, and materials such as water treatment sludge, BF slag, red mud, and mill mud showed good potential as immobilizing agents. Where multielement adsorption or immobilization of metals is required, a combination of adsorbent materials is likely to be most effective...|$|R
