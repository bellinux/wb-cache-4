2500|$|The {{origins of}} the Mirage 2000 could {{be traced back to}} 1965, when France was {{involved}} with Britain [...] "Anglo-French Variable Geometry" [...] (AFVG) <b>swing-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Two years later the country withdrew from the project on grounds of costs, after which Britain would collaborate with Western Germany and Italy to ultimately produce the Panavia Tornado, Dassault focused its energy on its own variable-geometry aircraft, the Mirage G experimental prototype. The design was expected to materialise in the Mirage G8, which would serve as the replacement for the popular Mirage III in French Air Force service.|$|E
50|$|Wing {{stations}} require pylons {{to carry}} objects. Stations on the fuselage {{may not necessarily}} require a pylon, such as the fuselage stations on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, while other aircraft need pylons for certain stations {{in order to provide}} clearance for the landing gear retraction sequence (like in F-14 Tomcat) or to provide necessary item space (like in Mikoyan MiG-27). <b>Swing-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> that mount pylons on the moving portion of the wing (such as the General Dynamics F-111 and the Panavia Tornado) must include a mechanism for swiveling the pylon as the wing sweeps fore or aft, {{in order to keep the}} pylon and store facing directly forwards at all times. The F-111's outermost pair of hardpoints do not swivel, and can only be used while the wing is fully extended. This restricts the aircraft to subsonic flight only while these pylons are fitted, usually fitted with fuel tanks during ferry flights. The pylons are automatically jettisoned if the wing sweep moves past 26 degrees, which would mean that the aircraft is accelerating towards transonic speeds.|$|E
25|$|The Grumman XF10F Jaguar was a {{prototype}} <b>swing-wing</b> fighter <b>aircraft</b> {{offered to the}} United States Navy in the early 1950s. Although it never entered service, its research pointed the way toward the later General Dynamics F-111 and Grumman's own F-14 Tomcat.|$|R
25|$|In a March 1994 {{article on}} Groom Lake in Popular Science, a photo was {{published}} of an Su-22 Fighter in flight. The plane was painted {{in a green}} and tan finish. The Su-22 is a <b>swing-wing,</b> light-attack <b>aircraft.</b> It was in frontline Russian Air Force service {{at the time and}} was exported widely to Eastern European and Third-World countries during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} sightings of foreign aircraft over Nevada {{since the end}} of Constant Peg and the inactivation of the 4477th TES:In a March 1994 article on Groom Lake in Popular Science, a photo was published of an Su-22 Fighter in flight. The plane was painted in a green and tan finish.

25|$|In June 1967, the Anglo French Variable Geometry (AFVG), a {{proposed}} <b>swing-wing</b> strike <b>aircraft,</b> was cancelled {{due to the}} withdrawal of French participation. Britain then turned to a national project, the UK Variable Geometry (UKVG), for which BAC Warton was given a design contract by the Ministry of Technology. These studies eventually {{became known as the}} BAC Advanced Combat Aircraft programme. In 1968, Britain was invited to join Canada and the F-104 Consortium (a grouping of Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands), all of whom wished to replace their current aircraft with a common design, subsequently described as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA).|$|R
5000|$|The Science Museum at Wroughton, near Swindon, hold 105 {{boxes of}} papers of Barnes Wallis. The papers {{comprise}} design notes, photographs, calculations, correspondence and reports relating to Wallis's work on airships, including the R100; geodetic construction of aircraft; the bouncing bomb and deep penetration bombs; the [...] "Wild Goose" [...] and [...] "Swallow" [...] <b>swing-wing</b> aircraft; hypersonic <b>aircraft</b> designs and various outside contracts.|$|R
50|$|The X-5 {{successfully}} {{demonstrated the}} advantage of a <b>swing-wing</b> design for <b>aircraft</b> intended to fly at a wide range of speeds. Despite the X-5's stability problems, the concept was later successfully implemented in such aircraft as the General Dynamics F-111 and Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-23 and MiG-27, the Sukhoi Su-17/20/22 and Su-24, the Tupolev Tu-22M and Tu-160, the Panavia Tornado and the Rockwell B-1 Lancer.|$|R
50|$|On the B-52 SRAMs {{were carried}} {{externally}} on two wing pylons (six missiles on each pylon) and internally on an eight-round rotary launcher {{mounted in the}} bomb bay; maximum load-out was 20 missiles. The capacity of the B-1B was eight missiles on up to three rotary launchers (one in each of its three stores bays) for a maximum loadout of 24 missiles, all internal. The smaller FB-111A could carry two missiles internally and four more missiles under the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>swing-wing.</b> The externally mounted missiles required {{the addition of a}} tailcone to reduce aerodynamic drag during supersonic flight of the aircraft. Upon rocket motor ignition, the missile tailcone was blown away by the exhaust plume.|$|R
