40|$|Oysters are an ecologically and {{economically}} important marine species that have contributed over AU$ 107 million (edible oysters only) to the Australian economy in 2011 - 2012. However, as other marine organisms, cultivated and wild oysters are challenged {{by a variety}} of environmental stressors that are quite likely to be exacerbated by anthropogenic and climate influences (e. g. CO 2, extreme weather events). These stressors in general have the potential to weaken oysters, lowering their ability to cope with additional stress, such as disease or pollution. In an aquaculture environment, this could impact on the productivity and profitability of the industry. To maintain and potentially improve the health and resilience of oysters, knowledge needs to be gained regarding not only the physiological but also molecular responses to stress. This study aims to determine which genes are actively expressed in stressed and non-stressed <b>Sydney</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>oysters</b> and to highlight genes potentially involved in the molecular stress response of these <b>oysters.</b> Adult <b>Sydney</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>oysters</b> (economic value of nearly AU$ 30 million in 2012 - 13) were exposed to a range of environmental stressors (CO 2, temperature, salinity, copper and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH]) in a laboratory environment and pools of six tissues (haemolymph, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, digestive system and gonad) of all experimental animals examined with RNA-seq.

During storage, Proteobacteria became abundant with Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio found to be dominant in both oyster species at Day 7. Analysis of the pyrosequencing data showed significant differences in bacterial profiles between oyster species and storage time (both P = 0. 001). As oysters spoiled, bacterial profiles between oyster species became more similar indicating a common spoilage profile. Data presented here provides detailed insight into the changing bacterial profile of shucked oysters during storage and has identified two genera, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio, as being important in spoilage of shucked oysters...|$|R
40|$|QX {{disease is}} a fatal disease in Sydney rock oysters caused by the {{protozoan}} parasite Marteilia sydneyi. The current study investigates the phagocytosis of M. sydneyi by <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> hemocytes. It also compares the in vitro phagocytic activities of hemocytes from oysters bred for QX disease resistance (QXR) with those of wild-type oysters. After ingestion of M. sydneyi, hemocyte granules fused with phagosome membranes and the pH of phagosomes decreased. Significantly (p = < 0. 05) more phagosomes in QXR hemocytes showed obvious changes in pH within 40 min of phagocytosis, when compared with wild-type hemocytes. Phenoloxidase deposition was also evident in phagosomes after in vitro phagocytosis. Most importantly, ingested and melanised M. sydneyi were detected in vivo among hemocytes from infected oysters.

Here, we show that selectively bred lines of the ecologically and economically important estuarine mollusc, the <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> Saccostrea glomerata, are more resilient to ocean acidification than the wild populations. When reared at elevated pCO 2, we found a 25 % reduction in shell growth of the selectively bred population of the <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster,</b> Saccostrea glomerata, compared to a 64 % reduction in shell growth of wild populations.

40|$|Estuarine acidification, {{caused by}} {{disturbance}} of acid sulfate soils (ASS), is a recurrent problem in eastern Australia. Affected waters are characterised by low pH and elevated concentrations of metals, principally aluminium and iron. The effects of acid and elevated metal concentrations associated with ASS, on adult Sydney rock oysters, {{have not been}} previously investigated. This study tested links between ASS-affected drainage, subsequent estuarine acidification and <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> production problems on the Hastings and Manning Rivers, mid north coast New South Wales. The primary objective of this thesis was to establish if estuarine acidification causes mortality and slow growth in individual Sydney rock oysters by exposing oysters to low pH, iron and aluminium using field and laboratory experiments. Water quality data showed that estuarine acidification was spatially extensive in the Hastings and Manning Rivers following heavy rainfall and was due to mineral acids originating from drained or excavated ASS. Estuarine acidification regularly affected areas used for <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> production following heavy rainfall. Field experiments showed that <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> mortality rates were significantly higher at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters compared to locations that were isolated from ASS-affected waters. Oyster mortality increased with the time of exposure and smaller oysters (mean weight = 5 g) experienced significantly higher mortality relative to larger oysters (mean weight = 29 g). This was caused by acid-induced shell degradation resulting in perforation of the smaller oysters under-developed shells. Additionally, <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> growth rates were dramatically reduced at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters and the overall mean condition index of oysters at ASS-affected field sites was {{significantly lower than the}} overall mean condition index of oysters at non-impacted sites. Findings from laboratory experiments showed that ASS-affected water alters oyster valve movements and significantly reduces oyster feeding rates at pH 5. 5. Acidic treatments (pH 5. 1) containing 7. 64 mg L- 1 of aluminium or ASS-affected water caused changes in the mantle and gill soft tissues following short-term exposure. Degenerative effects described in oysters in this study were also due to iron contained in ASS-affected waters. Iron precipitates accumulated on the shell, gills and mantle and were observed in the stomach, intestine, digestive tubules and rectum. This study concluded that Sydney rock oysters are unable to tolerate acidic conditions caused by ASS outflows and cannot be viably cultivated in acid-prone areas of the estuary...|$|E
40|$|Previous work {{suggests}} that larvae from <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> {{that have been}} selectively bred for fast growth and disease resistance are more resilient to the impacts of ocean acidification than nonselected, wild-type oysters. In this study, we used proteomics to investigate the molecular differences between oyster populations in adult <b>Sydney</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> and to identify whether these {{form the basis for}} observations seen in larvae. Adult oysters from a selective breeding line (B 2) and nonselected wild types (WT) were exposed for 4 weeks to elevated pCO 2 (856 μatm) before their proteomes were compared to those of oysters held under ambient conditions (375 μatm pCO 2). Exposure to elevated pCO 2 resulted in substantial changes in the proteomes of oysters from both the selectively bred and wild-type populations. When biological functions were assigned, these differential proteins fell into five broad, potentially interrelated categories of subcellular functions, in both oyster populations. These functional categories were energy production, cellular stress responses, the cytoskeleton, protein synthesis and cell signalling. In the wild-type population, proteins were predominantly upregulated. However, unexpectedly, these cellular systems were downregulated in the selectively bred oyster population, indicating cellular dysfunction. We argue that this reflects a trade-off, whereby an adaptive capacity for enhanced mitochondrial energy production in the selectively bred population may help to protect larvae from the effects of elevated CO 2, whilst being deleterious to adult oysters. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
