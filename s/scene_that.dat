5|$|After informally {{managing}} {{and promoting}} the New York Dolls {{for a few}} months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975. Inspired by the punk <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was emerging in Lower Manhattan—in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell, then with Television—McLaren began taking a greater interest in the Strand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money, when she hands him her license, one can {{momentarily}} see the birth date {{on the back of}} the card; it shows her birth year as 1984. Being that it is 1995 at the time of this <b>scene,</b> <b>that</b> would make her 11 years old.|$|E

5|$|Venues across Houston {{regularly}} host {{local and}} touring rock, blues, country, dubstep, and Tejano musical acts.

5|$|Although {{bands like}} Sarcofago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was {{regularly}} wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable {{violence in the}} early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.|$|E
5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E

5|$|Coexist is the 2012 second studio album by English indie pop {{band the}} xx. After {{a break from}} touring for their 2009 self-titled first album, the band members began to write songs {{individually}} before they recorded Coexist from November 2011 to May 2012. For the album, the xx drew on personal experiences for their songwriting, while their music {{was influenced by the}} electronic dance <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> occurred when they had been away on tour. The album was produced by the band's Jamie Smith, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble {{board for the}} opening <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> would convey {{the idea that the}} Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words. The design of Bart's visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a set design for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E

5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also has}} a music <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> {{is made up of}} groups that operate {{independently}} from the Music Department. These groups include four student-led a cappella groups: Nothin' but Treble, Sympathetic Vibrations, Taal Tadka, and Infinite Harmony. Musician's Network, another student-led group, operates Under the Couch, a live music venue and recording facility that was formerly located beneath the Couch Building on West Campus and is now located in the Student Center.|$|E
5|$|Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill have cameo {{appearances}} as Lois Lane's {{father and}} mother in a deleted <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was restored in later home media releases. Alyn and Neill portrayed Superman and Lois Lane in the film serials Superman (1948) and Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), and were the first actors to portray the characters onscreen in a live-action format. Neill reprised {{her role in the}} 1950s Adventures of Superman TV series, and also appeared as Lex Luthor's elderly wife in the opening scene of the film Superman Returns (2006).|$|E

5|$|On February 4, 2013, Marc Webb {{posted on}} Twitter that {{principal}} photography had begun {{and that the}} sequel was being shot on 35 mm film in the anamorphic format, instead of being filmed digitally as the preceding film was. Sony revealed {{this would be the}} first Spider-Man film to be filmed entirely in New York State, including a car-chase <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was filmed in Rochester because the speed laws are less restrictive in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{sent out}} letters to many politicians, both Democrat and Republican, {{asking them to}} make cameo {{appearances}} in the film. Several of the scenes had already been shot using actors in these roles, but the filmmakers went back and re-shot those scenes when real politicians agreed {{to be in the}} film. Those who agreed, including U.S. Senators Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and Don Nickles, and Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, were filmed in a <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was entirely improvised.|$|E

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|Barbera and {{his wife}} briefly {{separated}} {{when he went to}} California. They reunited but {{were on the verge of}} another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had 4 children: two sons (Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth) and two daughters (Lynn and Jayne). The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, at Musso & Frank's restaurant, where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> Barbera often frequented.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
