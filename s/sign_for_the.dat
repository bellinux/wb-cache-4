5|$|Selected in the 14th {{round of}} the 1997 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the Minnesota Twins, Furniss opted to return to LSU for his senior season, rather than <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> signing bonus {{typically}} given to a player selected in that round.

5|$|The Mets {{performance}} in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued {{this was a good}} <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed that baseball needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership.|$|E

While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} key {{properties of the}} six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (I3), charm (C), strangeness (S, {{not to be confused}} with spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal to spin for point particles) do not change <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> antiquarks.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{scored the}} only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Rushden. Mansfield agreed to extend Graham's loan until January 2010, {{when he would}} <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club permanently. Goals from Carruthers and Brodie gave York a 2–1 home win over Wrexham, a result that equalled the club record for {{successive}} victories in all competitions with eight. Youth-team defender Dean Lisles was promoted to the first-team squad, to provide cover for the injured Sangaré, O'Hare and Purkiss. York drew 0–0 away to Hinckley United {{in the first round}} of the FA Trophy, and the replay at home was won 3–1, in which Brodie scored his second hat-trick of 2009–10. York beat fellow play-off contenders Mansfield 3–0 on Boxing Day, Brodie (2) and Gash scoring.

5|$|Bruce {{began to}} attract the {{attention}} of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all reported to be interested in signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Carlisle {{agreed to}} join {{recently}} relegated Championship club Leeds United on a free transfer. He was offered a new contract by Queens Park Rangers, but he was keen to return to northern England and cut short his summer holiday in Tenerife to <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West Yorkshire club on a two-year contract. His contract with Leeds began on 1 July 2004, and he made his debut for the club in the 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest on 21 August. He scored his first goal for Leeds two matches later, netting the first goal in the team's 3–0 victory against Coventry City. He was a regular in the team {{during the first half}} of the season, playing in every match from the start of September until the end of November. However, he then experienced another major injury set-back, tearing his ankle ligaments during the 1–0 defeat to Rotherham United on 29 November 2004, an injury which left him out of action for a number of weeks.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland opened {{negotiations}} to sign Bent in July 2009. The deal seemed delayed and through social networking website Twitter he accused club chairman Daniel Levy of disrupting his move to Sunderland, although Bent later apologised, saying he acted out of frustration. He travelled to Sunderland to <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club after they agreed a fee with Tottenham, and after passing a medical, Bent signed for Sunderland on 5 August for an initial fee of £10million plus potential additional payments, which later rose to £16.5million. He scored on his Sunderland debut, {{which was the}} only goal in a 1–0 victory against Bolton, and was followed with Sunderland's opening goal against Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat. He scored a brace in the 4–1 win over Hull City to give himself his third and fourth goals in five matches.|$|E

5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of the Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
5|$|The same year, Arsenal became {{embroiled in}} a scandal; footballers' pay {{at the time was}} limited by a maximum wage, but an FA enquiry found that Charlie Buchan had {{secretly}} received illegal payments from Arsenal as an incentive to <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club. Sir Henry Norris was indicted for his part and banned from football, but Chapman escaped punishment, and with the autocratic Norris replaced by the more benign Samuel Hill-Wood, Chapman's power and influence within the club increased, allowing him control over all aspects of the club's business. He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James and Cliff Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing against}} Norwich City on 27 August 2011, Drogba {{suffered}} a concussion in {{a collision with}} Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy. After missing two games, Drogba made {{his return to the}} Chelsea squad on 24 September against Swansea City. Drogba went on scoring his first goal of the season in a 4–1 win. Drogba received a red card on 23 October against Queens Park Rangers, Chelsea ended up losing 1–0. On 29 November, Drogba rejected a new deal with Chelsea and was set to <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> highest bidder. On 31 December 2011, Drogba scored his 150th goal for Chelsea against Aston Villa, putting him level with Peter Osgood and Roy Bentley in terms of the club's top scorers of all time. Even though, Chelsea was leading with the penalty scored by Drobga, the game ended in a 3–1 loss for Chelsea.|$|E

5|$|He {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Cambridge United in August 2007 after playing {{for them in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly.

He was named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for August 2007. He signed for Conference Premier rivals York City on loan until the end of 2007–08 on 31 January 2008, after which he said he was looking to <b>sign</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club permanently in the summer. He scored on his debut, a 2–0 home win over Grays Athletic after coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Richard Brodie on 9 February 2008. He started ahead of Brodie in the following matches against Halifax Town and Histon, but struggled during these matches. Cambridge attempted to recall him from his loan in March 2008, but league rules meant {{that he would not be}} able to return. He returned to Cambridge following the expiration of his loan spell at York in April 2008, in which he made 13 appearances and scored 2 goals. He featured in Cambridge's play-off semi-final second leg 2–1 home win over Burton Albion; this result meant the team reached the final 4–3 on aggregate. He came on for the last 15 minutes of the final against Exeter City at Wembley Stadium on 18 May 2008, but Cambridge lost 1–0. He was released by the club in May 2008 after making 33 appearances and scoring 8 goals.|$|E
