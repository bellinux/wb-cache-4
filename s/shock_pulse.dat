40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is a {{velocity}} amplification machine for high-g shock testing of micro-scale devices. The machine uses multiple sequential impacts to amplify velocity through a system of progressively smaller masses constrained to move in the vertical axis. <b>Shock</b> <b>pulses</b> are created through the finite collinear metal rod impact between the penultimate and ultimate masses, imparting <b>shock</b> <b>pulses</b> in excess of 20, 000 G for an impact velocity of approximately 4. 2 m/s.

40|$|This {{theme of}} this paper is the design and {{characterisation}} of a velocity amplifier (VAMP) machine for high-acceleration shock testing of micro-scale devices. The VAMP applies multiple sequential impacts to amplify velocity through a system of three progressively smaller masses constrained to move in the vertical axis. Repeatable, controlled, mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>pulses</b> are created through the metal-on-metal impact between pulse shaping test rods, which form part of the penultimate and ultimate masses. The objectives are to investigate the controllable parameters that affect the <b>shock</b> <b>pulses</b> induced on collision, namely; striker and incident test rod material; test rod length; pulse shaping mechanisms; and impact velocity. The optimum VAMP configuration was established as a 60 mm long titanium striker test rod and a 120 mm long titanium incident rod. This configuration exhibited an acceleration magnitude and a primary pulse duration range of 5, 800 – 23, 400 g and 28. 0 – 44. 0 μs respectively. It was illustrated that the acceleration spectral content can be manipulated through control of the test rod material and length. This is critical in the context of practical applications, where it is postulated that the acceleration signal can be controlled to effectively excite specific components in a multi-component assembly affixed to the VAMP incident test rod...|$|R

50|$|Vibrating tables or shake {{tables are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to test}} products to determine or demonstrate their ability to withstand vibration. Testing of this type is commonly done in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. These machines are capable of producing three different types of vibration profile sine sweep, random vibration, and synthesized shock. In {{all three of these}} applications, the part under test will typically be instrumented with one or more accelerometers to measure component response to the vibration input. A sine sweep vibration profile typically starts vibrating at low frequency and increases in frequency at a set rate (measured in hertz per second or hertz per minute). The vibratory amplitude as measured in gs may increase or decrease as well. A sine sweep will find resonant frequencies in the part. A random vibration profile will excite different frequencies along a spectrum at different times. Significant calculation goes into making sure that all frequencies get excited to within an acceptable tolerance band. A random vibration test suite may range anywhere from 30 seconds up to several hours. It is intended to synthesize the effect of, for example, a car driving over rough terrain or a rocket taking off. A synthesized <b>shock</b> <b>pulse</b> is a short duration high level vibration calculated as a sum of many half-sine waves covering a range of frequencies. It is intended to simulate the effects of an impact or explosion. A <b>shock</b> <b>pulse</b> test typically lasts less than a second.
