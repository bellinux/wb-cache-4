40|$|Abstract“New Normal” {{is a term}} {{which is}} used to define and name the new form and shape that has come into {{existence}} {{due to the fact that}} the ways of doing business has radically changed as a result of globalization's forming its own organizations in the development process of technology by keeping away from the crises. The economy elite in the world is now discussing about a new order which is directed to the human needs and is more convenient and about a more creative capitalism, and about mechanisms that has become more social and that provides balances with organizations within the countries or with supranational organizations. In the new global system in which more risk will be taken and more precaution will be needed, the “new normal” contains and involves a <b>supervisory</b> <b>measure</b> which is rather regulative. Now the rules of “new normal”ization are being discussed instead of the old standards and systems. In the present era through which we are passing, enterprises have various responsibilities and duties in order to provide the necessary compliance for the state of affairs and in finding solutions for the conflicts. And these are mainly made up of finding answers to the questions with respect to competition, market, technology, and human beings; and at the same time it is necessary that the enterprise should find new ways for its capacity of change and for expanding in the market and for improving. The Strategic cooperation and agreements of organizations and corporate bodies (companies) and sharing knowledge and experience in the new normal are an answer to the indefiniteness brought about by the new normal and to the new form of relationships. When this new approach and constructive management style are implemented, they seem to be one of the most important tools on the way to success in today's world. Those corporations which will be able to establish strategic alliance and be skillful in the management of strategic alliance will have a distinctive feature in comparison to those corporations which will not be able to that. This study aims at finding what the “new normal” brings about and at analyzing the strategic alliance and agreements by scrutinizing them, and it aims, at the same time, at emphasizing the factors that play important roles in the success of those strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} examined, {{for a range}} of {{industrial}} management positions, the relationship of supervisory style patterns at adjacent managerial levels to supervisory performance and job satisfaction. It also investigated the utility of Fiedler’s Contingency Model for determining the supervisory style associated with optimal work group performance at the middle levels of industrial management. Supervisory style was viewed as {{the extent to which a}} supervisor’s job related behaviour was basically task-oriented or human relations-oriented. One hundred and twenty-four production supervisory staff representing six manufacturing companies and six organizational levels completed a multi-faceted questionnaire. Measurement devices included: three indices of <b>supervisory</b> style, <b>measures</b> of satisfaction with four separate aspects of the job, two higher management ratings of job performance and independent ratings of position power and job task structure. The results suggested that, for most levels of industrial management, a subordinate manager’s similarity to his immediate supervisor was unrelated to the subordinate’s job satisfaction. At the third level of management similarity of supervisory style was positively related to this manager’s satisfaction with his work and his coworkers. The results provided considerable support for earlier findings which showed that subordinate job satisfaction was positively related to the supervisor’s “consideration” behaviour as perceived by the subordinate manager.

40|$|One {{important}} element in the operational definition of ESeC is the supervisory status. It is used to allocate workers who otherwise are coded as ESeC 3, 7, 8 or 9 into ESeC 2 or ESeC 6.

In this paper, we basically examine two issues: First, we present findings from a pilot study that examines to which proportion workers identified as supervisors depend on the operational procedure used to code these workers as supervisors.

40|$|Bibliography : leaves 114 - 125. This {{research}} {{explored the}} relationship between role innovation and the perceived employee-organisational relationship. Role innovation is an inclusive perspective of individual innovation in the workplace. The design incorporated an qualitative preliminary phase and a quantitative survey format as suited to the exploratory nature of the research. The exploratory component elicited detailed information from eight R&D professionals. It focused on the construct of role innovation so as {{to ensure that the}} constructs and assessment methods were relevant and meaningful for the sample population. The sample of the subsequent survey research consisted of mid level (N = 51) employees from the administration, production and research and development departments of an electrical manufacturing firm in the Western Cape, South Africa. In the questionnaire role innovation was measured using Janssen's (2000) nine item scale of role innovation, which incorporates separate sub-scales for idea generation, idea promotion and idea realisation. The perceived employee-organisation relationship (PEOR) was assessed according to six factors; three forms of organisational commitment affective, continuance and normative as measured by Meyer, Allen and Smith's (1993) item scale, value congruence (measured using McDonald and Gantz's (1992) comparative values scale), perceived <b>supervisory</b> support (<b>measured</b> using the scale developed by Oldham and Cummins (1996) and perceived organisational support (measured using the Perceived Organisational Support Scale as developed by Eisenburger (2001)). The constructs of intrinsic motivation was incorporated as a moderating factor given the strong evidence of its influence on individual innovation. This was assessed using the Intrinsic/Extrisic Motivation Scale as developed by Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby and Herron (1996). Few significant relationships were found, however those indicated through correlation proved statistically robust through ANOVA, regression analysis and the Kruder-Wallis test for non- parametric means. The role innovation instrument proved reliable for the South African sample, however the sub-scales of idea promotion and idea realisation were combined following strategic factor analysis. The most important finding was a negative relationship between normative commitment and role innovation (idea generation). A positive relationship was also found between intrinsic motivation and role innovation (idea generation and idea promotion and realisation). Subsequent discussion focused on the important of contextual factors as external variables moderating the importance of the PEOR factors in predicting role innovation. The primary limitations of this research are the lack of causal direction and the sample size, which limited the sophistication of the statistical analysis. The findings indicate promise for future innovation research linking affective variables with individual actions...|$|R

A panel regression analysis is also performed in order to identify the main drivers of the liquidity risk measures for the two types of banks. Findings – The paper finds that no significant differences exist between REBs and the overall system if liquidity risk measures used by regulators in order to supervise the banking system are taken into account. Normally liquidity exposure by this type of bank is significantly affected by interbank market dynamics. Research limitations/implications – The paper considers only one market in order to test the fitness of the regulatory approach for the REBs and does not take into account the off balance sheet exposure. Practical implications – Even if REBs suffer from a misalignment between the asset and liability duration, the <b>supervisory</b> authority selects <b>measures</b> that do not penalise them. Originality/value – The paper represents one of the first empirical analyses on the impact of regulatory requirements for liquidity management by the Basel Committee in order to test if the rules proposed could penalise banks specialised in real estate loans...|$|R

The supervisory alliance is a key process within clinical supervision, amd may have a real impact of supervisee development. This may provide a rationale for the use of sessional measures to provide ongoing feedback on the <b>supervisory</b> alliance. Various <b>measures</b> of <b>supervisory</b> alliance exist. However these instruments are too long to be used on a sessional basis. Objectives: To develop a short-form measure (LASS) of the supervisory alliance {{from the perspective of the}} supervisee that has the clinical utility to be used on a sessional basis, and the psychometric properties to be a credible instrument for research. Study 1 : Items from existing <b>measures</b> of the <b>supervisory</b> alliance were qualitatively analysed to produce a 25 -item experimental measure. This was administered to 98 UK trainee Clinical Psychologists. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the data resulted in a 2 -factor solution. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis led to the identification of 3 clusters <b>measuring</b> the <b>supervisory</b> alliance. Representative items were chosen, resulting in the 3 -item LASS. Study 2 : The LASS, and other related measures, were administered to 140 UK trainee Clinical Psychologists. Analysis of this data found that the LASS had acceptable internal consistency and test re-test reliability, but provided evidence that the LASS was sensitive to change. The results of the analysis investigating concurrent and convergent validity indicated that the LASS is a valid <b>measure</b> of the <b>supervisory</b> alliance. Conclusions: The LASS is aEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
