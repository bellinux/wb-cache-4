5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> the purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{comparatively}} easy to dig through limestone {{and there}} are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> the idea of building subways for public transportation. In theory, it could be less expensive in the Twin Cities than in many other places, but the cost would still be much greater than surface projects.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 a citizens' {{initiative}} {{demanding an}} end to mandatory Swedish teaching on all levels of education {{was brought to the}} Finnish Parliament. In 2015 the MPs voted, 134 to 48, to keep mandatory Swedish. In another vote the MPs voted, 93 to 89, to demand that the government <b>should</b> <b>examine,</b> whether a regional experimentation, where another language would be taught instead of Swedish, is possible.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} signs of {{testicular}} cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self-exams. However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> their testicles monthly, especially if they {{have a family history of}} cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self-examinations for all young men.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} All-Age Stake, {{it may be}} very {{difficult}} to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard; therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate the standard. The standard, when applied, <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> the total performance of the dog with range being kept foremost in mind. Range is the “sine qua non” of an all-age dog and it should take precedence over and not be compromised for a short, practical, methodical, unexhilarated, uninspiring performance, no matter how immaculate the bird work of the latter.|$|E
25|$|Melton’s {{scholarly}} works {{concentrate on}} the phenomenology and not the theology of NRMs. Some Christian countercultists criticize Melton for not critiquing the groups he reports on from an evangelical perspective, arguing that his {{failure to do so}} is incompatible with his statements of professed evangelicalism. Some secular anti-cultists who feel that new religious movements are dangerous and that scholars should actively work against them have likewise criticized him. Stephen A. Kent and Theresa Krebs, for example, characterized Gordon Melton, James R. Lewis, and Anson Shupe as biased towards the groups they study. In non-scholarly writings, Melton has recommended that Christian churches <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> new religions in terms of evangelization, and he sees his work as a means to facilitate that end.|$|E

25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E
500|$|On 15 May 1969, a Soviet Government decree (No. 345–209) {{was issued}} [...] "On {{measures}} for preventing dangerous behavior (acts) {{on the part}} of mentally ill persons." [...] This decree confirmed the practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists. Soviet psychiatrists were told whom they <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> and were assured that they might detain these individuals {{with the help of the}} police or entrap them into coming to the hospital. The psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers. Doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting the individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution.|$|E
500|$|Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter, with inner voiceover by Helen Mirren), decides {{she wants}} Artie (Kevin McHale) for her boyfriend, and asks {{him for a}} date. He later {{performs}} for her his idea for Will's proposal—a sexy mash-up of the songs [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] and [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash"—but she informs him that their date also includes dinner. The glee club fears Artie will be raising Becky's hopes, but Artie tells them he had fun on the dinner date, and that they <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> their own prejudices about people with handicaps. However, when Becky tells Artie {{that she wants to}} have sex with him, he panics and asks Sue (Jane Lynch) for advice on how to break off the relationship. She advises him to treat Becky like anyone else and tell her directly. Becky is disappointed, and is later comforted by Sue.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the United States National Research Council {{recommended}} that the cumulative effects of phthalates and other antiandrogens be investigated. It criticized US EPA guidances, which stipulate that, when examining cumulative effects, the chemicals <b>examined</b> <b>should</b> have similar mechanisms of action or similar structures, as too restrictive. It recommended instead {{that the effects of}} chemicals that cause similar adverse outcomes <b>should</b> be <b>examined</b> cumulatively. Thus, the effect of phthalates <b>should</b> be <b>examined</b> together with other antiandrogens, which otherwise may have been excluded because their mechanisms or structure are different.|$|R

500|$|In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, the United States Supreme Court {{established}} {{a framework for}} determining whether a suspect's consent is voluntary. The Court noted that historically, when [...] "determining whether a defendant's will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed the totality of all the surrounding circumstances—both {{the characteristics of the}} accused and the details of the interrogation". Consequently, the Court held that voluntariness should be determined [...] "from the totality of all the circumstances". The Court also clarified that judges <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> the [...] "possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents" [...] to determine whether a suspect was coerced into consenting, and [...] "account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions". However, the Court also held that suspects may still give valid consent even if they do not know that they can refuse to consent to the search.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{environmental}} scales measure an individual's intent to participate in environmental behaviours which does not always translate into behaviour.

2500|$|Other traits like dispositional optimism, a {{tendency}} to believe that things will turn out positively, were also considered but later not included. [...] The reasons behind this decision are not clear, but include {{the fact that this}} construct is not as well represented in literature. [...] It has also been suggested that dispositional optimism may not be distinct from neuroticism or other dispositional traits. [...] Future research <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> the theory more empirically and provide a distinction of how broad, fundamental, and evaluative a trait must be in order to be included in core self-evaluations research.|$|E

2500|$|The {{selector}} of {{dimension stone}} begins by considering stone color and appearance, {{and how the}} stone will match its surroundings. [...] The selector has literally thousands of options to choose from, and <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> many options. [...] In addition to many hundreds of different stones with different colors and patterns, each stone can change radically in color and appearance when a different finish is put on it. [...] A polished finish accentuates the color and makes any pattern more vivid, and the rougher finishes (i.e. honed, thermal) lighten the color and make the patterns more subdued. [...] With thousands of possibilities, the selector must start by looking at many stones in many different finishes, or photos of them. [...] Such photos {{can be found on}} some dimension stone websites, and on DSAN's Architects Stone Selection Helper.|$|E
2500|$|For {{less serious}} cases, {{physicians}} staffed outpatient clinics. Cities also had first aid centers staffed by physicians for emergencies that were often located in busy public places, such as big gatherings for Friday prayers {{to take care}} of casualties. The region also had mobile units staffed by doctors and pharmacists who were supposed to meet the need of remote communities. Baghdad was also known to have a separate hospital for convicts since the early 10th century after the vizier ‘Ali ibn Isa ibn Jarah ibn Thabit wrote to Baghdad's chief medical officer that [...] "prisons must have their own doctors who <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> them every day". The first hospital built in Egypt, in Cairo's Southwestern quarter, was the first documented facility to care for mental illnesses while the first Islamic psychiatric hospital opened in Baghdad in 705.|$|E
