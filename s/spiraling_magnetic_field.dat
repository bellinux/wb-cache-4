40|$|We present new Fabry-Perot {{images of}} the HH 47 jet that show the first clear {{evidence}} for entrainment in a jet from a young star. The material in the jet moves faster down the axis of the flow and slower at the edges, similar to viscous flow in a pipe. The higher excitation lines occur {{along the edges of}} the jet, as expected if entrainment accelerates and heats the ambient material. We confirm previous observations of multiple bow shocks in this system. Together, time variability and entrainment produce much of the observed shock-excited gas in this object. Our data show that the 'wiggles' along the jet are not caused by jet material tied to a <b>spiraling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> but instead result from time variability, variable ejection angles, or inhomogeneities in the flow.

Acceleration process and synchrotron losses combined together form power law energy spectrum of ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons with index between 2 and 3 depending upon initial energy of injected particles. Synchrotron emission of these electrons and positrons in <b>spiral</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of rotating force-free jet has been calculated. Polarization properties of the radiation has been obtained and compared with existing VLBI polarization measurements of parsec-scale jets in BL Lac sources and quasars. Our results give explanation of observed bimodality in alignment between electric field vector and jet axis. Degree of polarization and velocity of observed proper motion of bright knots depend upon angular rotational velocity of the jet. Thus, comparing them to each other, we can estimate angular rotational velocity in jets. We obtain that the fact, that generally in BL Lac objects electric field vector is oriented parallel to the jet axis while in quasars perpendicular to the jet axis, may be due to intrinsically larger angular rotational velocity and large winding of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in BL Lac jets than in quasar jets.

The normalized peak intensities at each spacecraft Rj = Ij /[Sigma]Ij (the subscript j corresponds to the spacecraft STEREO A, B, and WIND), which are defined as the directivity factors are determined using the time profiles of the type III bursts. It is shown that the distribution of the viewing angles divides the type III bursts into: (1) bursts emitting into a very narrow cone centered around the tangent to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> with angular width of approximately 2 deg and (2) bursts emitting into a wider cone with angular width spanning from [approx] - 100 deg to approximately 100 deg. The plots of the directivity factors versus the viewing angles of the sources from all three spacecraft indicate that the type III emissions are very intense along the tangent to the <b>spiral</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines at the source, and steadily fall as the viewing angles increase to higher values. The comparison of these emission patterns with the computed distributions of the ray trajectories indicate that the intense bursts visible in a narrow range of angles around the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> directions probably are emitted in the fundamental mode, whereas the relatively weaker bursts visible {{to a wide range of}} angles are probably emitted in the harmonic mode...|$|R
