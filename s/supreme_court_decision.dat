Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E

5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise measure {{that opened the}} Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; according to an 1884 <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>decision,</b> Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E
5|$|This {{argument}} {{is based in}} part on the U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>decision</b> in the case of United States v. Bevans.

No issues regarding federal income taxation or the Internal Revenue Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of civil rights}} groups began a court challenge of the bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the State <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>decision</b> in the case of Crawford v.

Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>decision</b> which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

Neff that helped define the law of personal jurisdiction. In 1885, Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon, though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar on technical grounds. Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E
