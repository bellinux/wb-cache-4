40|$|UWV (Employee Insurance Agency) is an {{autonomous}} administrative authority (ZBO) and is {{commissioned by the}} Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (SZW) to implement employee insurances and provide labour market and data services in the Netherlands. The Dutch employee insurances are provided for via laws such as the WW (Unemployment Insurance Act), the WIA (Work and Income according to Labour Capacity Act, which contains the IVA (Full Invalidity Benefit Regulations), WGA (Return to Work (Partially Disabled) Regulations), the Wajong (Disablement Assistance Act for Handicapped Young Persons), the WAO (Invalidity Insurance Act), the WAZ (Self-employed Persons Disablement Benefits Act), the Wazo (Work and Care Act) and the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefits</b> <b>Act.</b> The data in this collection pertains to customer contacts {{over a period of}} 8 months and UWV is looking for insights into their customers' journeys. Data has been collected from several different sources, namely: 1) Clickdata from the site www. werk. nl collected from visitors that were not logged in, 2) Clickdata from the customer specific part of the site www. werk. nl (a link is made with the customer that logged in), 3) Werkmap Message data, showing when customers contacted the UWV through a digital channel, 4) Call data from the callcenter, showing when customers contacted the call center by phone, and 5) Complaint data showing when customers complained. All data is accompanied by data fields with anonymized information about the customer as well as data about the site visited or the contents of the call and/or complaint. The texts in the dataset are provided in both Dutch and English where applicable. URL's are included based on the structure of the site during the period the data has been collected. UWV is interested in insights on how their channels are being used, when customers move from one contact channel to the next and why and if there are clear customer profiles to be identified in the behavioral data. Furthermore, recommendations are sought on how to serve customers without the need to change the contact channel...|$|E
40|$|When the public-law <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefits</b> <b>Act</b> (Dutch Ziektewet) was privatised, {{this created}} the {{question}} of how to protect sick employees’ privacy in their labour-law relationship. It is now the employers' responsibility to carry out the labour-law scheme governing sickness, which is part of Title 7 : 10 of the Dutch Civil Code (Dutch Burgerlijk Wetboek). These new rules have caused tension in labour-law relations, since the instructions and measures issued by the employer may affect employees’ personal lives, thus restricting their fundamental right to privacy which follows from the Dutch Constitution and human rights treaties. Regulations should offer sick employees sufficient protection against the employer and any other parties who might violate their rights while executing the rules. Effective instruments should be available to act against violations. This thesis focuses on the question to what extent the privacy of sick employees is sufficiently protected by existing regulations. In order to answer this question, this thesis develops a normative assessment method. This method is necessary to answer {{the question of}} when the protection of privacy is ‘sufficient’. This method is based on the regulations and case law concerning the right to privacy. The result of the thesis is that on a large number of points, the execution of the legal scheme governing sickness meets the criteria concerning privacy protection. Violations are only committed on the basis of the legal powers granted by law to the employer and experts. The legislator has laid down additional rules regarding the provision of information as part of reintegration processes. Moreover, guarantees are in place to ensure confidential treatment of medical information. The relevant rules are based on the assumption that employers must not receive any medical information. Medical information is processed only by medical experts who are bound by medical professional secrecy. The medical profession has itself set very clear rules outlining which information can be provided to which party in the execution of the regulations governing sickness, this in order to guarantee medical secrecy. However, the analysis has also shown that on several other points the execution of the rules fails to meet the normative criteria, and where there is thus no sufficient protection of privacy. The answer to the research question is that in several respects legislation fails to meet some of the important criteria of privacy. The possible solutions consist of additions to or clarifications of several aspects of the law and regulations. The concluding chapter describes which legal provisions should be expanded or clarified and how. It would also be necessary to tighten the rules of the medical profession on some points, something which will be up to the professional medical organisations. In addition, the courts have an important role in offering the employee legal protection. This thesis makes also several recommendations regarding how courts can protect privacy...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{outline the}} {{principles}} underlying changes overtime in entitlement to <b>sickness</b> absence <b>benefit</b> in Denmark. Methods The Danish <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> scheme {{during the past}} 30 years has been studied based on {{a comprehensive review of}} the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>Act</b> from 1973, and all later amendments to the act. Results Entitlement to <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> in Denmark has undergone considerable changes during the past 30 years. The guiding principles of the reforms have been financial savings in combination with an assumption that human behaviour can be controlled through bureaucratic administration with focus on monitoring and evaluation. Conclusions The <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>Act</b> was initially based on a broad concept of disease but the implementation underwent major changes. In the 1970 s and 1980 s entitlement to benefit depended very much on medical diagnosis. This practice changed and today's policy is to some extent a return to the biopsychosocial approach {{in the sense that the}} citizen is not regarded a passive victim of disease but an active player in influencing own working capacity. Added to this is, however, a new element of much tighter control leaving less room for autonomy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a multidimensional public-private partnership intervention, focussing on improving the quality and efficiency of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> case management, reduced the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> duration and the duration until self-support. Methods We used a difference-in-difference (DID) design with six intervention municipalities and 12 matched control municipalities in Denmark. The study sample comprised 282, 103 <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> spells exceeding four weeks. The intervention group with 110, 291 spells received the intervention, and the control group with 171, 812 spells received ordinary <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> case management. Using register data, we fitted Cox proportional hazard ratio models, estimating hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI). Results We found no joint effect of the intervention on the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> duration (HR 1. 02, CI 0. 97 – 1. 07) or the duration until self-support (HR 0. 99, CI 0. 96 – 1. 02). The effect varied among the six municipalities, with <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> HRs ranging from 0. 96 (CI 0. 93 – 1. 00) to 1. 13 (CI 1. 08 – 1. 18) and self-support HRs ranging from 0. 91 (CI 0. 82 – 1. 00) to 1. 11 (CI 1. 06 – 1. 17). Conclusions Compared to receiving ordinary <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> management the intervention had on average no effect on the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> duration or duration until self-support. However, the effect varied considerably among the six municipalities possibly due to differences in the implementation or the complexity of the intervention...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} to becoming ‘incapacitated’ and receiving <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> represents a significant shift in an individual's narrative. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 long-term <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> recipients in North-East England, {{this article focuses}} upon how individuals perceived and managed becoming ‘incapacitated’, particularly in relation to stigma and identity. The findings show that participants negotiated changes to their identity in varying ways – constructing new dimensions of self, validating their illness and pursuing aspirations. Importantly, the transition onto <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> does not inevitably result in a shift to a negative identity. The term incapacity can include many realities, challenging the notion of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients as being passively dependent. Instead, an active, sometimes very functional sense of self can {{be accompanied by a}} positive identity for recipients, which is especially important, in a context of the rhetoric surrounding ongoing welfare reform and <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> recipients in the UK...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we ask whether the level of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> {{provision}} protects the health of employees, particularly those who are most exposed to hazardous working conditions or who have a little education. The study uses the European Working Condition Survey that includes information on 20, 626 individuals from 28 countries. Health was measured by self-reported mental wellbeing and self-rated general health. Country-level <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> provision was constructed using spending data from Eurostat. Group-specific associations were fitted using cross-level interaction terms between <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> provision and physical and psychosocial working conditions respectively, {{as well as those}} with little education. The mental wellbeing of employees exposed to psychosocial job strain and physical hazards, or who had little education, was better in countries that offer more generous <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit.</b> These results were found in both men and women and were robust to the inclusion of GDP and country fixed effects. In the analyses of self-reported general health, few group-specific associations were found. This article concludes that generous <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> provision may strengthen employee's resilience against mental health risks at work and risks associated with little education. Consequently, in countries with a generous provision of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit,</b> social inequalities in mental health are smaller...|$|R
