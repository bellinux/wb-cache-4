5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|The IMF forced Madagascar's {{government}} to accept <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies and liberalization {{of the economy}} when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized {{over the course of}} the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} occasional {{outbreaks of}} acute diseases (such as plague in 1994). The gains {{on the national}} health were eroded by <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the 1990s, {{the impact of the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since the year 2000. In 2006, Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies in the world according to UN figure – 44 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990, but this has since recovered to 53 and 54 respectively. The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Infant mortality rose from 6% in the late 1990s to 12.3% by 2004. By 2014 HIV/AIDS prevalence had been reduced to 15% compared to 40% in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} organizations began {{to admit that}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted {{as an extension of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{policies}} on poor countries {{has been one}} of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.|$|E

The RCA rankings of commodities with various FTA scenarios and those with the global trade liberalization are correlated to examine how “natural ” each grouping would be. The results suggest that the ASEAN+ 3 FTA, with relatively large welfare gains and small <b>structural</b> <b>adjustments,</b> could be a facilitating interme-diate step towards global free trade.

Such changes in relative prices include movements in both intertemporal and cross-sectional dimensions, which interacted crucially to lower the economy’s trend growth. This aspect of Japan’s asset price bubble, with its consequences for <b>structural</b> <b>adjustments</b> since the 1990 s, is important because it illustrates the specific environment in which the Bank of Japan has to conduct monetary policy: namely, not a standard stabiliza-tion policy around a stable growth trend.

50|$|The {{consumer}} movement in Africa {{came into being}} over time {{as a result of}} three factors: the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the deregulation of markets by governments which are implementing <b>structural</b> <b>adjustments,</b> and the influence of external activist organizations like Consumers International supporting community efforts to promote consumer protection. The lessening influence of the Soviet Union made economies open to change, <b>structural</b> <b>adjustments</b> took governmental control out of markets, and activist groups put community control into markets. Consumer organizations in Africa often call for global integration of foreign economies into Africa and increased external consumption of Africa goods to improve local markets. They are frequently combined with human rights interests to increase democratization, economic development, and women's rights. The marketplace in Africa does not naturally promote economic democracy to the extent markets elsewhere would because frequently African markets provide few choices, and many activist groups tie the right to access goods with the right to enjoy benefits of democracy and economic development.|$|R
