A desaturase from the <b>spotted</b> <b>fireworm</b> moth Choristoneura parallela also operates on myristic acid substrate but produces almost pure (E) - 11 -tetradecenoate. The two desaturases share 92 % amino acid identity and 97 % amino acid similarity. There are 24 amino acids differing between these two desaturases. We constructed mutations at all of these positions to pinpoint the sites that determine the product stereochemistry. We demonstrated with a yeast functional assay that one amino acid at the cytosolic carboxyl terminus of the protein (258 E) is critical for the Z activity of the C.  rosaceana desaturase. Mutating the glutamic acid (E) into aspartic acid (D) transforms the C.  rosaceana enzyme into a desaturase with C.  parallela-like activity, whereas the reciprocal mutation of the C.  parallela desaturase transformed it into an enzyme producing an intermediate 64 : 36 E/Z product ratio. We discuss the causal link between this amino acid change and the stereochemical properties of the desaturase {{and the role of}} desaturase mutations in pheromone evolution...|$|E
