The number of both types of sites continues to grow, indicating the issue is unlikely to disappear.

A pattern of clues were identified within the irregularities. Clues indicating essay mill purchases included the misrepresentation of bibliographic material where information was omitted or changed, inappropriate references out of the subject area, the style and types of references used, in addition to generalised discussion that did not answer a specific question. File <b>swapping</b> <b>site</b> usage was identified through the inclusion of inappropriate and irrelevant material, bibliographic 2 ̆ 7 mashups 2 ̆ 7 where academic journal and book information was blended into a single reference, and cross matching identified by Turnitin where students relied on the same file swapping source.

Although the apparent consensus sequence of DNA binding sites for NF-κB (κB sites) is very broad, the sites active in any one gene show remarkable evolutionary stability. Using a lentivirus-based methodology for implantation of gene regulatory sequences we show that for genes with two κB sites, both are required for activity. <b>Swapping</b> <b>sites</b> between κB-dependent genes altered NF-κB dimer specificity of the promoters and revealed that two κB sites can function together as a module to regulate gene activation. Further, although the sequence of the κB site is important for determining κB family member specificity, rather than determining the ability of a particular dimer to bind effectively, the sequence affects which coactivators will form productive interactions with the bound NF-κB dimer.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor NF-kappaB is a regulator {{of a wide}} variety of processes including inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity, apoptosis, and learning. How can one factor be accurately involved in so many different processes and generate without exception precise and appropriate responses? Four members of the NF-kappaB {{transcription factor}} family are involved in gene activation, and they hetero- or homodimerize with each other to bind DNA. This allows for many different potential combinations of NF-kappaB dimers. To test whether NF-kappaB-dependent genes require specific NF-kappaB family members for gene activation, cell lines were generated lacking in individual and multiple NF-kappaB proteins. Using TNFalpha as an inducer, a panel of endogenous NF-kappaB responsive genes showed a wide range of subunit specificities. Given that the NF-kappaB consensus binding site sequence is very broad and that crystal structures of NF-kappaB have not identified enough dimer-specific DNA-binding contacts to rationalize specific NF-kappaB binding sites, kappaB sites were compared from a single gene to another and no direct correlation was found between kappab site sequence and kappaB family member requirements. However when interspecies comparisons were made of the same gene, a remarkable constancy of the kappaB site sequence was found, which suggested that individual sites have important functional characteristics. To test this theory, a novel lentiviral system was created that incorporated regulatory sequences into cellular DNA. Then by simply <b>swapping</b> <b>sites</b> between kappaB-dependent genes, NF-kappaB dimer specificity of the promoters was altered and revealed that two kappaB sites can function together as a module to regulate gene activation. Further, although the sequence of the kappaB site is important for determining kappaB family member specificity, rather than determining the ability of a particular dimer to bind effectively, the sequence affects which co-activators will form productive interactions with the bound kappaB dimer. My findings suggest that a particular DNA-binding site may impart a specific configuration to bound transcription factors that specifies the requirement for particular co-activators. Taken together, I have taken the first steps to dissecting how the promoter code influences individual NF-kappaB family members to function on NF-kappaB responsive genes and to regulate gene expression...|$|R

Studies of FXIa and trypsin inhibition by PN 2 KPI and BPTI and P 1 <b>site</b> <b>swap</b> mutants (PN 2 KPI-R 15 K, BPTI-K 15 R) demonstrated that FXIa inhibition by PN 2 KPI and P 1 <b>site</b> <b>swap</b> mutants and trypsin inhibition by PN 2 KPI and BPTI conform to a single-step, slow equilibration inhibitory mechanism, whereas FXIa-inhibition by BPTI follows a classical, competitive inhibitory mechanism.

A direct role for PacC in activating the expression of an alkaline-expressed gene has previously been demonstrated, but the mechanism by which alkaline ambient pH prevents the expression of any eukaryotic acid-expressed gene has never been reported.

In order to define the regions of the hLIF molecule responsible for species-specific interaction with the hLIF-R and for the unusual high-affinity binding to the mLIF-R, a series of 15 mouse/human LIF hybrids has been generated.

40|$|Abstract. Using {{a simplistic}} model of juggling based on physics, a natural map is {{constructed}} {{from the set}} of periodic juggling patterns (or <b>site</b> <b>swaps)</b> to links. We then show that all topological links can be juggled. 1. Juggling sequences The art of juggling {{has been around for}} thousands of years. Over the past quarter of a century, the interplay between juggling and mathematics has been well studied. There has even been a book [6] devoted to this relationship, dealing with several combinatorial ideas. Numerous juggling software is also available; in particular, Lipson and Wright's elegant and wonderful JuggleKrazy [4] program helped motivate much of this paper. Most of the information useful to juggling can be accessed via the Juggling Information Service webpage [3]. The goal {{of this paper is to}} construct and study a map from juggling sequences to topological braids. An early form of this idea providing motivation can be found in the work of Tawney [7], where he looks at some classic juggling patterns. In our discussion, we remove everything that is not mathematically relevant. Thus, as-sume the juggler in question is throwing identical objects, referred to as balls. By convention, there are some basic rules we adhere to in juggling. J 1. The balls are thrown to a constant beat, occurring at certain equally-spaced discrete moments in time. J 2. At a given beat, at most one ball gets caught and then thrown instantly. J 3. The hands do not move while juggling. J 4. The pattern in which the balls are thrown is periodic, with no start and no end to this pattern. J 5. Throws are made with one hand on odd-numbered beats and the other hand on even-numbered beats. A throw of a ball which takes k beats from being thrown to being caught is called a k-throw. Condition J 5 implies that when k is even (or odd), a k-throw is caught with the same (or opposite) hand from which it was thrown. Thus, a 5 -throw starting in the left hand would end in the right hand 5 beats later, while a 4 -throw starting in the left hand would end back in the left hand after 4 beats. In this notation, a 0 -throw is a placeholder so that an empt...|$|R

Amidases are a {{group of}} carbon-nitrogen hydrolysing enzymes that catalyze the conversion of amides to corresponding carboxylic acids and ammonia. These enzymes are of great interest in synthetic industries where they are used for mass production of acidic products. Aliphatic amidase from Geobacillus pallidus RAPcS (RAPcS amidase), which belongs to the nitrilase superfamily of enzymes, has recently been characterised biochemically. It shows both amide hydrolysis and acyl transfer activities, and also exhibits stereo selectivity for some enantiomeric substrates. This enzyme can therefore be exploited in large-scale production of enantio-pure compounds. Structural characterization of this amidase would yield insights into {{the basis of this}} substrate selectivity and activity. This would inform future experiments that aims at modifying this enzyme to alter its substrate specificity. This work presents structural characterization of RAPcS amidase. Gel filtration chromatography and electron microscopic analyses provided useful information on the quaternary structure of RAPcS amidase. Crystals were grown, and an X-ray diffraction dataset to 1. 9 Å collected using an in-house X-ray source. The space group of this data was determined to be primitive cubic P 4 ₂ 32, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the backbone of the hypothetical protein PH 0642 from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PDB ID, Ij 31) that had all non-identical side chains substituted with alanines, as a search probe. The molecular replacement rotational and translational searches were performed using PHASER. The model was rebuilt with PHENIX before refinement using REFMAC 5. The final model was of high quality with minimal errors. RAPcS amidase is homohexameric in solution and has a four-layer α-β-β-α structural fold that highly resembles nitrilase superfamily enzymes. It has an extended C-terminal tail that is essential for strengthening the interacting dimer interfaces by participating in domain <b>swapping.</b> The active <b>site</b> pocket has Glu, Lys, Cys catalytic triad that is conserved in the nitrilase superfamily. The substrate binding pocket is small in size, explaining the specificity of this enzyme for short aliphatic amides. These findings have made steps towards understanding the catalytic mechanism, and the basis for substrate specificity in this enzyme. It has also provided useful information on the overall structure, as well as the structure of the active site, not only for RAPcS amidase but also for related enzymes, which will form the basis for designing future structural characterization work in the nitrilase-related amidases...|$|R
40|$|High {{erucic acid}} {{rapeseed}} (HEAR) cultivars have regained interest for industrial purposes because erucic acid (22 : 1) {{is a valuable}} feedstock {{with a wide range}} of applications especially if it is available in sufficient quantities and in sufficiently pure form. In HEAR oil, however, the 22 : 1 content is limited to 67 % because 22 : 1 is excluded from the sn- 2 position of the glycerol backbone. To overcome this theoretical limit in HEAR oil and, thus, to improve its oleochemical properties combined efforts in plant breeding and genetic engineering have been undertaken. Co-expression of an 22 : 1 -CoA specific lysophosphatidate acyltransferase gene with a ß-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) gene in developing seeds of HEAR plants resulted in the channeling of 22 : 1 into each position of the glycerol backbone but hardly improved the total 22 : 1 content. The enzymic investigations with microsomal fractions of developing seeds conducted in the present study clearly showed that the introduced KCS gene was functionally expressed in the developing seeds of the transgenic HEAR plants and affected a threefold increase in KCS as well as elongase activity catalyzing the malonyl-CoA dependent elongation of oleoyl(18 : 1) -CoA via eicosenoyl(20 : 1) -CoA to 22 : 1 -CoA. These data provide further evidence that KCS rather than the further three enzymes of the elongase systems catalyzes the rate limiting step. Analysis of the acyl-CoA and fatty acid composition in the course of seed development, however, revealed that during the phase of maximal oil accumulation the improved elongase activity of the developing seeds from the transgenic HEAR plants was no longer reflected in their 22 : 1 levels. These data suggest that the elongase activity and, thus, the formation rate of 22 : 1 -CoA is limited by other factors such as the substrate pools available to the elongase complex. In order to improve the cytosolic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA pool, chimeric gene constructs encoding ATP:citrate lyase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were developed and introduced into HEAR lines. An overall increase in the 22 : 1 content of seed oil from transgenic plants was achieved by the over-expression of the chimeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene. According to these data it is likely that a further increase in the 22 : 1 content can be achieved by the co-expression of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene with the ATP:citrate lyase, KCS and 22 : 1 -CoA specific lysophosphatidate acyltransferase gene. In addition, the sink-source relationship is important for the increase of unusual fatty acids in seed oils. Oil yield is decisively determined by the activities of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT) which catalyzes the acylation reaction at the sn- 3 position of diacylglycerol in the final step of TAG synthesis. Hence, to improve the source strength by over-expressing a DAGAT that effectively channels 22 : 1 into TAG, DAGAT cDNAs were cloned and functionally characterized from Brassica napus, Tropaeolum majus and Lesquerella lindheimeri, the seed oils of which almost exclusively carry very long chain acyl groups at the sn- 3 position. Six cDNAs, namely three of B. napus, two of L. lindheimeri and one of T. majus, were analyzed. The DAGATs encoded by these cDNAs possess very similar molecular masses, and apart from their N-terminal hydrophilic regions, their sequences are very similar to each other. The analysis of the properties of the DAGATs over-expressed in yeast revealed differences between the isofunctional enzymes especially with regard to their acyl-CoA specificities and selectivities. The DAGAT from T. majus displayed the lowest and those from L. lindheimeri the highest preference for very long chain acyl groups. Moreover, in spite of the high sequence identity between the two DAGATs of L. lindheimeri, DAGAT 1 showed a more pronounced specificity for 20 : 1 -CoA and 22 : 1 -CoA in comparison to 18 : 1 -CoA than DAGAT 2. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of the different acyl-CoA specificities of the two DAGATs from L. lindheimeri, initial domain <b>swapping</b> and <b>site</b> directed mutagenesis experiments were conducted. The analysis of the acyl-CoA specificities of the chimeric and mutated DAGATs compared to DAGAT 1 and DAGAT 2 provided evidence that the acyl-CoA binding domain within the N-terminal region and isoleucine 315 in the fatty acid binding domain, which is substituted by a threonine in DAGAT 1, can essentially determine acyl-CoA specificity. Moreover, these experiments resulted in the development of a DAGAT with an improved 22 : 1 -CoA specificity. Consequently, the respective sequence appears to be better suited for improving the 22 : 1 content of HEAR oil than the DAGAT 2 sequence used for rapeseed transformation in the present study in combination with a B. napus KCS and a 22 : 1 -CoA specific lysophosphatidate acyltransferase gene...|$|R
