40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the paper}} is to study the {{relationship}} of individuals’ <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> consumption to personal income and relative sport price in Hungary in the period 1992 - 2006. It is shown, that the trend of the real <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> consumption in conjunction with real income decreased till 2000 {{and it has been}} increasing since then. Income and price elasticity figures for both periods show, that <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> consumption is price elastic, and <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> are luxury goods for Hungarian households. Thus, without increased income – i. e. the average standard of living – a more sport conscious Hungarian population can hardly be imagined even if <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> remained relatively cheap.

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} {{of international trade}} in <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> {{is still in its}} infancy. In order to alleviate the sports economics ignorance in this area, an entirely new dataset is built up by extracting Comtrade data at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). The dataset covers 41 countries, 36 different <b>sports</b> <b>goods,</b> and 94 - 96 % of global <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> trade (1994 - 2004). The country sample is divided into five regional areas: North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), EU + Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Asia and other emerging countries. A detailed snapshot of global trade in <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> and its distribution by major areas, countries and products provides first empirical evidence about how much industrialisation in emerging countries and de-industrialisation in developed market economies have affected international specialisation, and indirectly tests multinational companies outsourcing and production relocation strategies in low unit cost countries in the <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> industry. Then, studying export/import ratios and country's position in the global market, it appears that major trading areas are Asia, Europe and NAFTA. Major exporters are China, Hong Kong, the USA and France, and major importers are the USA, Japan, Germany, France, the UK and Italy. The biggest market shares are in sportswear, anoraks and gymnastic equipment trade. Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries have an excess balance in <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> trade, whereas NAFTA and Europe are in deficit. Three indexes assess a country's comparative advantages and disadvantages and competitiveness, and describe international specialisation. NAFTA and Europe are specialised in equipment-intensive <b>sports</b> <b>goods,</b> while Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries are specialised in trite <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> and some less equipment-intensive <b>sports</b> <b>goods.</b> NAFTA is not competitive in any <b>sport</b> <b>good,</b> Europe is competitive in skis, emerging countries and Eastern Europe in sportswear and anoraks, and Asia in sportswear, anoraks, rackets, balls, skates and gymnastic equipment. Such an international specialisation pattern fits with both assumptions of industrialisation/de-industrialisation and firms outsourcing strategies. A principal component analysis with hierarchical ascendant classification groups trite <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> as opposed to intensive-equipment <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> in global trade and shows that production relocation influences international trade specialisation. Major policy implications are that developed economies and multinational companies should continue investing in R&D in order to keep their comparative advantages in equipment-intensive <b>sports</b> <b>goods,</b> while Asian and emerging countries should more tightly supervise working conditions and child labour in their subcontracting producers that work for foreign multinational companies...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of international trade}} in <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> {{is still in its}} infancy. Only four articles dealing with the topic have appeared in economic literature so far. In order to alleviate the sports economists ignorance about international specialisation in <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> trade, we started to build up an entirely new dataset based on extracting data available in Comtrade (the UN word trade data basis) at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). After resolving a number of classification and statistical tricks, we have built up a country and <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> dataset (41 countries, 36 goods), which gathers 94 - 96 % of <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> global trade every sampled year (1994, 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2004).

40|$|International audienceThe {{importance}} of {{sport in the}} European countries has increased significantly over the lastdecade. Sport has become more relevant economically and socially for various reasons. Socialaspects include sport participation, sport for health and economic activities directly or indirectlyrelated to sport (Breedveld et al., 2013; Dolles & Söderman, 2011). European sport policyinitiatives such as the White Paper on Sport (Commission of the European Communities, 2007) or the Study on the Contribution of Sport to Economic Growth and Employment in theEuropean Union (SportsEconAustria, 2012) show an increasing interest in sport from a politicalperspective. This chapter focuses on one major economic aspect of sport – the <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> industry. Itconsists of three sections, a case study and conclusions. The first section gives definitions forsport, sport industry and <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> industry. The chapter then follows the expansion of thesport goods industry in Europe {{over the last five}} years (based on MarketLine (2015 a) industryreports). This expansion is analysed by comparing the market value of the <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> industrywithin Europe and the US. We look at the value of trade in the European sport goodsindustry and also compare the <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> industry with other sport industry segments. Wethen discuss the major drivers of growth in the European <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> industry and differentfirm-level strategic approaches.
