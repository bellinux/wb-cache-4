40|$|OBJECTIVE: New {{diagnostic}} criteria for MCI due to AD {{have been developed}} using biomarkers aiming to establish whether the clinical syndrome is likely due to underlying AD. We investigated the utility of MRI and CSF biomarkers in predicting progression from amnesic MCI to dementia, testing the hypotheses that 1) markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration provide distinct and complementary prognostic information over different time intervals, and that 2) evidence of neurodegeneration in amyloid-negative MCI individuals would be useful prognostically. METHODS: Data {{were obtained from the}} ADNI- 1 database on all individuals with a baseline diagnosis of MCI, baseline MRI and CSF data, and at least one follow-up visit. MRI data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a measure known as the AD-signature, as well as hippocampal volume. The CSF biomarkers amyloid-b, total tau, and phospho tau were also examined. We performed logistic regression analyses to identify the best baseline biomarker predictors of progression to dementia over 1 or 3 years, and Cox regression models to test the utility of these markers for predicting time-to-dementia. Results: For prediction of dementia in MCI, the <b>AD</b> <b>signature</b> cortical thickness biomarker performed better than hippocampal volume. Although CSF tau measures were better than CSF amyloid-β at predicting dementia within 1 year, the <b>AD</b> <b>signature</b> was better than all CSF measures at prediction over this relatively short-term interval. CSF amyloid-β was superior to tau and <b>AD</b> <b>signature</b> at predicting dementia over 3 years. When CSF amyloid-β was dichotomized using previously published cutoff values and treated as a categorical variable, a multivariate stepwise Cox regression model indicated that both the AD-signature MRI marker and the categorical CSF amyloid-β marker were useful in predicting time-to-event diagnosis of AD dementia.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} biomarker patterns {{typical for}} Alzheimer disease (AD) in an independent, unsupervised way, without using {{information on the}} clinical diagnosis. Design: Mixture modeling approach. Setting: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Patients or Other Participants: Cognitively normal persons, patients with AD, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Main Outcome Measures: Cerebrospinal fluid derived p-amyloid protein 1 - 42, total tau protein, and phosphorylated tau(181 p) protein concentrations were used as biomarkers on a clinically well-characterized data set. The outcome of the qualification analysis was validated on 2 additional data sets, 1 of which was autopsy confirmed. Results: Using the US Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set, a cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid protein 1 - 42 /phosphorylated tau(181 P) biomarker mixture model identified 1 feature linked to AD, while the other matched the "healthy" status. The <b>AD</b> <b>signature</b> was found in 90 %, 72 %, and 36 % of patients in the AD, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal groups, respectively. The cognitively normal group with the <b>AD</b> <b>signature</b> was enriched in apolipoprotein E 64 allele carriers. Results were validated on 2 other data sets. In 1 study consisting of 68 autopsy-confirmed AD cases, 64 of 68 patients (94 % sensitivity) were correctly classified with the AD feature. In another. data set with patients (n= 57) with mild cognitive impairment followed up for 5 years, the model showed a sensitivity of 100 % in patients progressing to AD.

The hallmarks of this disease, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are thought to develop early in the disease pathogenesis, up to decades before first clinical symptoms occur. However, these pathological hallmarks are still difficult to detect in vivo, and therefore a definitive diagnosis can only be made post-mortem.

Alzheimer 2 ̆ 019 s disease is the most common dementing disease of adult life causing disorientation in person, time and place. The histopathological hallmarks of AD are the formation of neuritic plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the grey matter regions of the brain. Neuritic plaques are roughly spherical consisting of a core of amyloid peptide (3 ̆b 2 A 4 -amyloid peptide) surrounded by irregular, loosely arranged aggregates of neuronal and glial processes. 1 Neurofibrillary tangles are bundles of abnormal filaments composed of paired helical chains of hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein intertwined to form paired helical filaments. 1 The abnormalities of NP and NFT serve as biochemical markers amenable to characterisation by IR spectroscopy and may provide diagnostic infrared <b>signatures</b> of <b>AD</b> tissue.

40|$|The {{algebraic}} graph transformation approach {{originates in}} the so-called double pushout approach. There, {{the application of a}} rule to a graph is defined by the corresponding double pushout in the category of graphs and total graph morphisms. The algebraic framework provides both an operationally intuitive behaviour and a considerably rich theory. Recently the double has been extended to the single pushout approach where transformations are defined as single pushouts within a category of graph structures and partial morphisms. Graphs, hypergraphs, and similar graph-like structures are subsumed by the notion of a graph structure as an algebra w. r. t. an appropriate algebraic <b>signature.</b> <b>Adding</b> conditional equations to an arbitrarily given graph structure signature - as this is know from abstract data type specification - results in a category of equationally defined graph structures with partial morphisms. We fundamentally define graph transformations in such equationally constraint categories as the corresponding single pushouts. As the main result we show that each pushout w. r. t. a graph structure signature with conditional equations is characterized by the corresponding pushout in the supercategory of graph structures without conditional equations if and only if the pushout object already satisfies the given equations. For equations w. r. t. categories of labelled graph structures and label-preserving morphisms the situation becomes much more complex. However, for a fairly general class of such equations, the pushout characerization can be reobtained from the unlabelled case. Since the single pushout approach without conditional equations is embedded into the newly investigated, a number of theoretical results does no longer hold in the extended setting. But for a restricted class of so-called local equations it is shown that essential theoretical results carry over to the new framework. From a software specification point of view conditional equations appear as application conditions forbidding the application of a rule whenever the derived graph would not be consistent w. r. t. these equations.

We investigated {{whether there is}} an imaging <b>signature</b> of <b>AD</b> pathology in these atypical subjects. We identified 14 subjects that had pathological AD, a non-amnestic presentation (i. e. atypical AD), and MRI. These subjects were matched to 14 with clinical and pathological AD (i. e. typical AD), 14 with the same non-amnestic presentations with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, and 20 controls. Voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis were used to assess patterns of grey matter loss. Loss was observed in the temporoparietal cortex in both typical and atypical AD, and showed significantly greater loss than FTLD. However, the medial temporal lobes were more severely affected in typical AD and FTLD compared to atypical AD. A ratio of hippocampal and temporoparietal volumes provided excellent discrimination of atypical AD from FTLD subjects. Temporoparietal atrophy may therefore provide a useful marker of the presence of AD pathology even in subjects with atypical clinical presentations, especially in the context of relative sparing of the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Altered copper {{homeostasis}} and hypercholesterolemia {{have been}} identified independently as risk factors for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD). Abnormal copper and cholesterol metabolism are implicated in the genesis of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are two key pathological <b>signatures</b> of <b>AD.</b> Amyloidogenic processing of a sub-population of amyloid precursor protein (APP) that produces Aβ occurs in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in copper deficient AD brains. Co-localization of Aβ and a paradoxical high concentration of copper in lipid rafts fosters the formation of neurotoxic Aβ:copper complexes. These complexes can catalytically oxidize cholesterol to generate H 2 O 2, oxysterols and other lipid peroxidation products that accumulate in brains of AD cases and transgenic mouse models. Tau, the core protein component of NFTs, is sensitive to interactions with copper and cholesterol, which trigger a cascade of hyperphosphorylation and aggregation preceding the generation of NFTs.

30|$|AD is a {{progressive}} and neurodegenerative brain disorder, {{which is the}} most common cause of dementia resulting in loss of memory, thinking and language skills, and behavioral changes [19]. However, no definitive cure for AD exists due to lack of knowledge of its molecular and intercellular mechanisms. Key <b>signatures</b> of <b>AD</b> progression include deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, neurofibrillary tangle formation of phosphoric tau proteins, and detrimental neuroinflammation in brains leading to synaptic impairment and neuronal loss [20]. The Aβ plaques around AD brains, soluble Aβ in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs), tau proteins presenting in the CSF are major biochemical markers, which have been targeted for the diagnosis purposes. Current therapeutic approaches are focusing on the inhibition of Aβ plaque/tau tangle formation and neutralization of their aggregations around neurons (Table  1) [21 – 23]. Other clinically approved drugs can only alleviate symptoms and delay AD progression by providing neurotransmitters, which promote interactions between neurons in AD brains [24].

40|$|Background: Current network-based {{microarray}} analysis {{uses the}} information of interactions among concerned genes/gene products, but still considers each gene expression individually. We propose an organized knowledge-supervised approach- Integrative eXpression Profiling (IXP), to improve microarray classification accuracy, and help discover groups of genes {{that have been}} too weak to detect individually by traditional ways. To implement IXP, ant colony optimization reordering (ACOR) algorithm is used to group functionally related genes in an ordered way. Results: Using Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as an example, we demonstrate how to apply ACOR-based IXP approach into microarray classifications. Using a microarray dataset- GSE 1297 with 31 samples as training set, the result for the blinded classification on another microarray dataset- GSE 5281 with 151 samples, shows that our approach can improve accuracy from 74. 83 % to 82. 78 %.

Our understanding of this disease would thus benefit from an approach that addresses this complexity by elucidating the regulatory networks that are dysregulated in the neural compartment of AD patients, across distinct brain regions. Here, we use a Systems Biology (SB) approach, which has been highly successful in the dissection of cancer related phenotypes, to reverse engineer the transcriptional regulation layer of human neuronal cells and interrogate it to infer candidate Master Regulators (MRs) responsible for disease progression. Analysis of gene expression profiles from laser-captured neurons from AD and controls subjects, using the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe), yielded an interactome consisting of 488, 353 transcription-factor/ target interactions. Interrogation of this interactome, using the Master Regulator INference algorithm (MARINa), identified an unbiased set of candidate MRs causally responsible for regulating the transcriptional <b>signature</b> of <b>AD</b> progression.
