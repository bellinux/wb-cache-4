25|$|King Janamejaya's {{ancestor}} Shantanu, {{the king}} of Hastinapura, has a short-lived marriage with the goddess Ganga and has a son, Devavrata (later to be called Bhishma, a great warrior), who becomes the heir apparent. Many years later, when King Shantanu goes hunting, he sees Satyavati, {{the daughter of the}} chief of fisherman, and asks her father for her hand. Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death. To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prince's children honouring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but could not be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary {{because she was so}} responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E

25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|E

Musgrave called the music [...] "outstanding", and found the monster characters to look fantastic, having benefited greatly from the updated 3D graphics; he was less <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> art direction for the human characters, but still thought that they looked better {{than they did in}} Sword of Mana.|$|E

Plutarch argued that Demosthenes accepted the bribe out of fear of Meidias's power.* E.M. Harris, [...] "Demosthenes' Speech against Meidias", 118. Philipp August Böckh also accepted Aeschines's account for an out-of-court settlement, and concluded that the speech was never delivered. Böckh's position was soon endorsed by Arnold Schaefer and Blass. Weil agreed that Demosthenes never delivered Against Meidias, but believed that he dropped the charges for political reasons. In 1956, Hartmut Erbse partly challenged Böckh's conclusions, when he argued that Against Meidias was a finished speech that could have been delivered in court, but Erbse then sided with George Grote, by accepting that, after Demosthenes secured a judgment in his favour, he reached some kind of settlement with Meidias. Kenneth Dover also endorsed Aeschines's account, and argued that, although the speech was never delivered in court, Demosthenes put into circulation an attack on Meidias. Dover's arguments were refuted by Edward M. Harris, who concluded that, although we cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the trial, the speech was delivered in court, and that Aeschines' story was a lie.|$|E

Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else.

Thus, the only colours commonly found in these birds are black, white and various shades of grey. Some have patches of iridescent feathers, or brownish or reddish hues, but these are rare and limited in extent, and those species in which they are found (e.g. bitterns, ibises or the hammerkop) are generally only found in freshwater habitat.|$|E
