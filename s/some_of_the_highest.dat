5|$|Cambodia has no proven {{fossil fuel}} reserves, and is almost {{completely}} dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> energy {{prices in the}} world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.|$|E

Black Down is a moorland area, with its steeper slopes covered in bracken (Pteridium) and its flatter summit in heather (Calluna) and grasses rather than the pasture which covers much of the plateau. The {{main body of the}} range is an extended plateau, 6–8km (4–5miles) wide and generally about 240metres (800ft) above sea level.|$|E
5|$|The major global {{track and}} field {{competitions}} are both held under the scope of athletics.

5|$|At the Council of Hieria in 754, Constantine V had {{declared}} the adoration of icons to be a heresy, and had thereby elevated iconoclasm to official imperial policy. No persecution of iconophiles was launched at first, but iconophile resistance grew, until from 765 on, Constantine began persecuting iconophiles, and especially monks. The {{discovery of a}} wide-ranging iconophile plot against him involving <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> civil and military officials {{of the state in}} 766 provoked an extreme reaction. Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed, jailed, publicly humiliated, and finally executed, replaced by new, uncompromisingly iconoclast officials. In addition, the veneration of sacred relics and prayers to the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned.|$|E

5|$|Dorset {{is largely}} rural with many small villages, few large towns and no cities. The only major urban {{area is the}} South East Dorset conurbation, which is {{situated}} at the south-eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole. It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth, the historic port and borough of Poole, the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages. Bournemouth, the most populous town in the conurbation, {{was established in the}} Georgian era when sea bathing became popular. Poole, the second largest settlement (once the largest town in the county), adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> land values by area in the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, {{they are the first}} to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E

5|$|The RKO General radio lineup {{included}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> rated, {{most influential}} popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, KHJ (AM) in Los Angeles introduced the Boss Radio {{variation of the}} top 40 format. The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country. RKO's FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats {{under a variety of}} call letters, including WOR and WXLO ("99X"); in 1983, as WRKS ("98.7 Kiss FM"), it {{became one of the first}} major stations to regularly program rap music. In 1979, RKO General created the RKO Radio Network, reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite.|$|E
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} Cameroon contain <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> {{population}} density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki is no different, with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined.

5|$|Nevertheless, {{largely the}} {{fighting}} went {{in favour of}} the Allies, and finally the Japanese assault ground to a halt. Despite forcing a contraction of the Australian forces defending the beachhead, on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, although the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it. Fierce resistance from the 2/28th halted them and eventually the attack was called off on 24 October, with the Japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies, poor co-ordination and operational security, {{and a lack of}} artillery. Meanwhile, the Allied response was hampered by poor working relationships at <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> levels between Australian and US commanders– particularly between I Corps commander Lieutenant General Edmund Herring and the VII Amphibious Force commander Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey– the lack of a unified command structure, over cautiousness amongst naval staff, and a poor appreciation of overall Japanese strength and intentions by the highest level of the Allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it was almost too late. Casualties during the attack amounted to at least 679 Japanese killed with another 821 estimated as wounded, while the Australians lost 49 killed and 179 wounded.|$|E
5|$|They usually winter along coasts and on inland lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, {{with birds}} {{migrating}} {{to the nearest}} body of water that will not freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large inland lakes and reservoirs. They appear {{in most of the}} inland waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine have <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> concentrations of common loons. Occasional vagrants are recorded inland in Mexico, in San Luis Potosí and Coahuila, as well as in Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south. They are accidental in northern Japan and the Commander Islands in northwestern Pacific, and Cuba in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|For Kinkladze, {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season {{followed}} a similar pattern to the previous season, comprising a mixture of starts and substitute appearances. Jim Smith resigned from his managerial position at Derby on 7 October 2001, leaving Kinkladze, a Smith favourite, bitterly disappointed. The appointment of new manager Colin Todd signalled a change in the club's playing style. Todd did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd's first two months in charge. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took the unusual step of using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team. Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy. According to Kinkladze's agent, Manchester City, as well as Spanish clubs Valencia, Mallorca and Málaga, were all interested in signing Kinkladze. However, Todd was sacked on 14 January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League, and John Gregory was appointed as manager on 30 January 2002. Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation {{for the third time in}} his career. The club, who were £35 million in debt, started an end-of-season clear-out to reduce their annual £17 million wage bill. Derby's actions included off-loading of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> earners, and the manager informed Kinkladze that he had no future at the club. However, Kinkladze, whose contract ended in summer 2003, was reluctant to leave the club and turned down a move to Turkish champions Galatasaray.|$|E
