5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|<b>Signal-to-noise</b> {{ratios of}} shear-wave {{splitting}} above small earthquakes {{can be improved}} by stacking.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{a camera}} <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio or dynamic range of 40dB {{represents}} a power ratio of 100:1 between signal power and noise power, not 10,000:1.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{innovations}} in photocathode technology significantly increased the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio, with newly developed tubes starting to surpass {{the performance of}} Gen 3 tubes.|$|E
25|$|CW {{spectroscopy}} is inefficient {{in comparison}} with Fourier analysis techniques (see below) since it probes the NMR response at individual frequencies in succession. Since the NMR signal is intrinsically weak, the observed spectrum suffers from a poor <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio. This can be mitigated by signal averaging i.e. adding the spectra from repeated measurements. While the NMR signal is constant between scans and so adds linearly, the random noise adds more slowly – proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} spectra (see random walk). Hence the overall <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio increases as the square-root of the number of spectra measured.|$|E
25|$|Typically in MRS {{a single}} {{spectrum}} is acquired by averaging enough spectra {{over a long}} acquisition time. Averaging is necessary because of the complex spectral structures and relatively low concentrations of many brain metabolites, which result in a low <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio (SNR) in MRS of a living brain.|$|E
25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to noise ratio. Improving the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
25|$|The {{electrode}} {{was tested}} on an electrical test bench and on human subjects in four modalities of EEG activity, namely: (1) spontaneous EEG, (2) sensory event-related potentials, (3) brain stem potentials, and (4) cognitive event-related potentials. The {{performance of the}} dry electrode compared favorably {{with that of the}} standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation, no gel requirements (dry), and higher <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio.|$|E
25|$|ECoG {{is a very}} {{promising}} intermediate BCI modality because it has higher spatial resolution, better <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio, wider frequency range, and less training requirements than scalp-recorded EEG, {{and at the same}} time has lower technical difficulty, lower clinical risk, and probably superior long-term stability than intracortical single-neuron recording. This feature profile and recent evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{analytic}} QC methods {{serve as}} a gatekeeper for excellent quality assays. In a typical HTS experiment, {{a clear distinction between}} a positive control and a negative reference such as a negative control is an index for good quality. Many quality-assessment measures have been proposed to measure the degree of differentiation between a positive control and a negative reference. Signal-to-background ratio, <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio, signal window, assay variability ratio, and Z-factor have been adopted to evaluate data quality.|$|E
25|$|These 'hearing glasses' {{incorporate}} a directional microphone capability: four microphones {{on each side}} of the frame effectively work as two directional microphones, which are able to discern between sound coming from the front and sound coming from the sides or back of the user. This improves the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio by allowing for amplification of the sound coming from the front, the direction in which the user is looking, and active noise control for sounds coming from the sides or behind.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the decibel {{is based on the}} measurement of power in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. One decibel is one tenth (deci-) of one bel, named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used {{for a wide variety of}} measurements in science and engineering, most prominently in acoustics, electronics, and control theory. In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, and <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratios are often expressed in decibels.|$|E
25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher <b>signal-to-noise.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, read {{range is}} both a {{function}} of the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.|$|E
25|$|Newer systems, however, usually now adopt near-optimal {{types of}} error {{correction}} codes {{that use the}} turbo decoding principle, where the decoder iterates towards the desired solution. Examples of such error correction coding types include turbo codes and LDPC codes, which perform close to the Shannon limit for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Some systems that have implemented these codes have concatenated them with either Reed-Solomon (for example on the MediaFLO system) or BCH codes (on the DVB-S2 system) to improve upon an error floor inherent to these codes at high <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratios.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography {{is one of}} a {{class of}} optical tomographic techniques. A relatively recent implementation of optical coherence tomography, frequency-domain optical coherence tomography, provides advantages in <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio, permitting faster signal acquisition. Commercially available optical coherence tomography systems are employed in diverse applications, including art conservation and diagnostic medicine, notably in ophthalmology and optometry where {{it can be used to}} obtain detailed images from within the retina. Recently, it has also begun to be used in interventional cardiology to help diagnose coronary artery disease. It has also shown promise in dermatology to improve the diagnostic process.|$|E
25|$|Radar systems must {{overcome}} unwanted signals {{in order to}} focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E
25|$|The lateral cut NAB curve {{was remarkably}} similar to the NBC Orthacoustic curve that evolved from {{practices}} within the National Broadcasting Company since the mid-1930s. Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100Hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16dB at 10,000Hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate, lacquer–aluminum, and vinyl disc media. When the record was played back using a complementary inverse curve, <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio was improved and the programming sounded more lifelike.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{excitation}} of {{the sample}} with a radio frequency (60–1000MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. A spectrum from a single FID has a low <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio, but fortunately it improves readily with averaging of repeated acquisitions. Good 1H NMR spectra can be acquired with 16 repeats, which takes only minutes. However, for elements heavier than hydrogen, the relaxation time is rather long, e.g. around 8 seconds for 13C. Thus, acquisition of quantitative heavy-element spectra can be time-consuming, taking tens of minutes to hours.|$|E
25|$|REM {{sleep is}} {{also related to}} the firing of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (also called phasic {{activity}} or PGO waves) and activity in the cholinergic ascending arousal system. The PGO waves have been recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex during the pre-REM period and are thought to represent dream content. The greater <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio in the LG cortical channel suggests that visual imagery in dreams may appear before full development of REM sleep, but this {{has not yet been}} confirmed. PGO waves may also play a role in development and structural maturation of brain, as well as long term potentiation in immature animals, {{based on the fact that}} there is high PGO activity during sleep in the developmental brain.|$|E
25|$|FM {{provides}} improved <b>Signal-to-noise</b> ratio (SNR), {{as compared}} for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E
25|$|The transit timing {{variation}} method considers whether transits occur with strict periodicity, {{or if there}} is a variation. When multiple transiting planets are detected, they can often be confirmed with the transit {{timing variation}} method. This is useful in planetary systems far from the Sun, where radial velocity methods cannot detect them due to the low <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio. If a planet has been detected by the transit method, then variations in the timing of the transit provide an extremely sensitive method of detecting additional non-transiting planets in the system with masses comparable to Earth's. It is easier to detect transit-timing variations if planets have relatively close orbits, and when {{at least one of the}} planets is more massive, causing the orbital period of a less massive planet to be more perturbed.|$|E
25|$|Suitable gamma-ray sources {{consist of}} a {{radioactive}} parent that decays to the desired isotope. For example, the source for 57Fe consists of 57Co, which decays by electron capture to an excited state of 57Fe, which in turn decays to a ground state emitting a gamma-ray of the appropriate energy. The radioactive cobalt is prepared on a foil, often of rhodium. Ideally the parent isotope will have a convenient half-life. Also, the gamma-ray energy should be relatively low, otherwise the system will have a low recoil-free fraction resulting in a poor <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio and requiring long collection times. The periodic table below indicates those elements having an isotope suitable for Mössbauer spectroscopy. Of these, 57Fe {{is by far the}} most common element studied using the technique, although 129I, 119Sn, and 121Sb are also frequently studied.|$|E
25|$|FTICR-MS differs {{significantly}} from other mass spectrometry techniques {{in that the}} ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an electron multiplier but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion cyclotron resonance (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with time-of-flight instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides {{an increase in the}} observed <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E
500|$|For {{telephone}} engineers, {{what was}} then called [...] "fluctuating noise", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio and introduced a figure of merit for noise.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} matched filters is to {{maximise}} the <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio (S/N) {{at the expense}} of pulse shape. Pulse shape, unlike many other applications, is unimportant in radar while S/N is the primary limitation on performance.
