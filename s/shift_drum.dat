5000|$|Changes for the 1994 model {{comprise}} a new <b>shift</b> <b>drum</b> to improve notchy gear shifts. The second-generation CB900RR, which debuted in 1995, incorporated changes in damping rates and spring rates. The front fork was upgraded with a compression adjuster. The upper cowl stay went from steel to aluminum, and the {{cylinder head cover}} went from aluminum to magnesium. The styling of the bike also became more aggressive: The independent dual lights became irregular-shaped multi-reflector lights known as [...] "fox eyes" [...] and the bike had fewer of the RR's unique fairing holes. The foot pegs were firmer and slimmer {{like that of the}} RC45 and the reversed pedal on the original was replaced with a shift linkage. Instead of measuring speed from the front wheel the speed is measured from the countershaft sprocket with an electronic speedometer.|$|E
50|$|Honda {{released}} automated electric shift ATVs {{starting in}} model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting {{is accomplished by}} pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal {{and the addition of}} an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, <b>shift</b> <b>drum,</b> etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been. This electric shift technology was later applied to their complete line of ATVs.|$|E
50|$|Pandya {{was born}} in 1970s in England. In recent years he has championed a new subgenre of drum and bass known as drumfunk, which focuses on either finding obscure breakbeats or re-sampling much used drum-and-bass breakbeats from their {{original}} source and transforming them into constantly <b>shifting</b> <b>drum</b> patterns, noticeably different from traditional drum and bass.|$|R
50|$|A moving drum hoist, or {{traveling}} drum hoist, is {{a variation}} on the traditional drum hoist. Moving drum hoists effectively eliminate the fleet angle between drum and block by <b>shifting</b> the <b>drum</b> along its axis as it spins. The amount of <b>shift</b> per <b>drum</b> revolution is equal to the pitch of the drum's helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving drum hoists can combine drum and head block into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.|$|R
50|$|On {{the eve of}} Anathema's 2013 tour of the United States, {{the band}} {{announced}} that drummer John Douglas and bass player Jamie Cavanagh would be unavailable. In response, Daniel <b>shifted</b> to <b>drums</b> and the band recruited Tobel Lopes for bass duties.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{version of}} [...] "Baby's on Fire" [...] is 5 minutes 19 seconds long. The song {{begins with a}} tense high-hat and bass line, along several {{different}} kinds of electronic sounds. Eno's vocals enter after this, being described as [...] "nasal" [...] and [...] "slightly snotty." [...] Following this first section of lyrics there is a 3 minute guitar solo by Robert Fripp with <b>shifting</b> <b>drum</b> beats as backing; Eno's vocal returns as the song ends. The last line sung by Eno is, [...] "The temperature's rising, and any idiot would know that." [...] In the 801 Live version performed by 801, the last line says, [...] "But any idiot could see that!" ...|$|R
50|$|Often the {{character}} sequences are staggered around the <b>drum,</b> <b>shifting</b> with each column. This obviates the situation whereby {{all of the}} hammers fire simultaneously when printing a line that consists of the same character in all columns, such as a complete line of dashes ("----").|$|R
5000|$|Sharks Island {{were able}} to secure a record {{development}} deal. They were signed by A&M Records to a development deal for one year with no promise of being permanently signed to an official record contract. During this time, the line-up continued to <b>shift</b> with <b>drummer</b> Walt Woodward III leaving to join The Scream and on-and-off guitarist K.K. Martin parting ways due to [...] "artistic differences". Rob Pace, from Chicago, filled in on drums during this time. Sercombe also did studio work with Sparks, playing guitar on the band's 1988 Interior Design album.|$|R
5000|$|The Curta {{calculator}} {{used the}} method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides {{along the side of}} the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating [...] "echelon drum" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "step drum"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its [...] "6" [...] position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the <b>drum</b> was <b>shifted</b> slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines' complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 cams. The <b>shifted</b> <b>drum</b> also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for {{the method of}} complements). The always present tens' complement [...] "overflow 1" [...] which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the results register was, in effect, discarded.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media {{described}} [...] "A-Punk" [...] {{as having}} a [...] "spunky drive, pogo-inducing rhythm, and subtle but hugely effective sonic accents" [...] and said that [...] "while solid, it isn't one of the stronger songs on Vampire Weekend". Drowned in Sound writer Alex Denney, commented that [...] "A-Punk" [...] was not the best song from their debut album due to it being [...] "a little too uptempo to let their disarmingly clever melodies breathe", but stated [...] "for the flute-aping synths and bottled-sunshine guitars alone you need this in your life." [...] The review from Greg Rose of Gigwise, was mixed. Rose said that although the song lacked originality, it [...] "manages to sound unique" [...] due to the lyrical inventiveness of lines by Ezra Koenig such as, [...] "His honor drove southward seeking exotica/cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas", which were described as being [...] "perky" [...] and gave the song [...] "a buzzing zip."Prefix magazine writer, Jeff Klingman, said the song's [...] "cool organ breeze and a <b>shifting</b> <b>drum</b> beat save the day", preventing [...] "too much snark from being slung at their New York Times featured, digitally distributed exclusively by Other Music, Columbia University, golden boy asses." [...] In reference to [...] "A-Punk", The Times writer Ben Blackmore, said, [...] "Do believe the hype." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brutus {{formed in}} 2007, when Johan Forsberg, Christian [...] "Krille" [...] Hellqvist and Knut-Ole Mathisen got {{together}} {{to start a}} band. Mathisen was originally bassplayer, but <b>shifted</b> to <b>drums</b> when a drummer could not be found. The band solidified by 2008 when they found second guitarist Kim Molander. After seeing a concert with short lived band The Ritual, Hellqvist was so amused with charismatic singer Joakim Stenby that he hunted him down later that same night, threatening him to sing in the band. He said yes, and the lineup was complete. The band recorded their first demo. later that year (2008) ...|$|R
25|$|Since bebop {{was meant}} to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. <b>Drumming</b> <b>shifted</b> to a more elusive and {{explosive}} style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2012 interview, Matt Chang {{talked about}} his music making process:"Digging through records, and {{deciding}} what to use and what not to use is the most labor intensive and time consuming part of the music making process for me. The chopping and arranging of the samples is the fun part. ... As a beat maker, my first impulse is always to have the drums bang, but I realized early on {{that one of the}} keys to getting the songs to sound other-than-contemporary was to have the drums low in the mix, but to still have them very present. It took a lot of time to find the drums that gave me the sound that I wanted. ... Sample selection was also important because I needed samples that were flexible enough for me to make a lot of variations to sequences. I wanted the sequences to be constantly changing - building, breaking down and then building back up again. Sometimes I would spend hours on a section or transition that would play for like two seconds and never comes back in.""I wanted to compose songs rather than just make beats ... so in straining for a substitute for the emcee, it felt natural to study jazz musicians and the way instruments can become vocalizations. As a part of that process, many of these songs in a very organic way took on the form of jazz numbers, with frequent tempo changes (sometimes obvious and sometimes barely noticeable), subtle and <b>shifting</b> <b>drums,</b> minimal effects, and something like the thrill of improvisation." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Psychedelic Shack" [...] was {{the only}} single from this album, and was a {{complete}} departure from previous Temptations recordings. Setting the tone {{for much of the}} album, [...] "Psychedelic Shack's" [...] vocals, guitar lines and <b>drums</b> <b>shift</b> {{back and forth across the}} stereo spectrum, and all five Temptations trade lead vocal duties at irregular intervals. Keyboardist Earl Van Dyke remembered [...] "Psychedelic Shack" [...] as one of his favorite recording sessions.|$|R
5000|$|Abramis Brama (Latin for carp bream) {{formed in}} 1997 when Dennis Berg and Fredrik Jansson got {{together}} {{to start a}} band. Jansson was originally slated to play bass in the new band but <b>shifted</b> to <b>drums</b> when a drummer could not be found. The band solidified by 1998 when they recorded their first demo. The band recorded their first album later that year. Dansa Tokjävelns Vals (Dance the Mad Devil's Waltz) was released the following year. All the lyrics for this album are written in Swedish. Following the release of this album original vocalist Christian Anderson left the band {{and was replaced by}} Ulf Torkelsson. A second demo, Mamma Talar, was recorded in late 1999 and was not widely distributed.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the album}} has been mixed, {{with most of}} the polarization coming from Pendulum's <b>shift</b> from <b>drum</b> and bass to a more rock and pop-imbued electronic sound. Allmusic praised that [...] "Pendulum is determined to heal the breach" [...] between rock and electronica; however, The Guardian felt that the sound was [...] "a little dated". Many fans of the first album have criticized In Silico for the change of genre; however, because of the album's popularity, and with singles being played on television music channels such as Kerrang!, Pendulum have managed to attract a new group of fans. Q Magazine named both lead single [...] "Granite" [...] and [...] "Propane Nightmares" [...] in the top 50 songs of the months in which they were released.|$|R
5000|$|... "Jane Says" [...] {{uses only}} two chords {{for most of}} the song. The {{original}} recording from Jane's Addiction features bongos and is sung in a lower register than later versions. The version that appears on Nothing's Shocking makes extensive use of steel drums played by Stephen Perkins in place of the original's bongos. The live version from Kettle Whistle interpolates the two versions, opening with an extended bongo introduction, over Perry Ferrell's scat vocals, before abruptly <b>shifting</b> to steel <b>drum</b> one measure before starting the verse.|$|R
500|$|Carey {{composed}} the gospel-influenced ballad [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] with James Wright. The lyrics {{are in the}} form of a prayer that conveys a message of unconditional love for God. The song features a verbal recording of Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, who reads two verses from the Bible. The singer wrote the album's fifth cut [...] "Say Somethin, which features rap verses from Snoop Dogg and was produced by The Neptunes. Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as [...] "a musical oddity", and characterized the production as [...] "strange instrumentation, weird melodic <b>shifts,</b> hectic <b>drum</b> patterns and a bed of synths." [...] Lyrically, the protagonist makes sexual advances to a romantic interest with the line [...] "If it's worth your while, do something good to me." [...] When interpreting the lyrics in the female role, Cummings noted [...] "a shy woman who doesn't need to say anything at all to get a man's attention." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{emergence}} of modern agriculture in twentieth century Lincolnshire as represented by the <b>shift</b> from threshing <b>drums</b> to combine harvesters and from real horse power to motor horse power. It attempts to historically resituate {{the emergence of}} modern agriculture in the county, demonstrating that change did not uniformly take place across the county just before, during, or immediately after World War Two. It also offers {{a new perspective on}} a well-covered historical topic; that of the human experience of modernisation as told by the people who bore witness to a monumental shift in methods of agricultural production...|$|R
5000|$|After two name changes (Suppressed Emotion and Stigma) and lineup <b>shifts</b> (a new <b>drummer,</b> Peter Gould, {{was brought}} onboard and Pankhurst {{switched}} to saxophone), the band finally {{settled on a}} permanent lineup and the name Ritual in 1981. The new lineup consisted of Errol Blyth (vocals), Mark Bond (bass), Pankhurst (saxophone), Ray Mondo (simply referred to as [...] "Ray", drums), and the newly recruited 17-year-old Jamie Stewart (guitar). The band's name did not carry any religious significance but was instead chosen for its [...] "sharpness" [...] and the fact [...] "it goes with the music to an extent".|$|R
5000|$|By the 1940s, jazz {{music as}} a form of popular music was on the decline, and so was the {{popularity}} of jazz clubs. In the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging [...] "musician's music." [...] Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. <b>Drumming</b> <b>shifted</b> to a more elusive and explosive style and highly syncopated music. While bebop did not draw the huge crowds that had once flocked to Swing-era dance clubs, the bebop style was based around small combos such as the jazz quartet. With these smaller combos on stage, smaller clubs could afford to pay the ensembles even with much smaller clubs than were common in the 1930s heyday of the Cotton Club.|$|R
50|$|From {{an early}} age, Avenaim began {{studying}} classical percussion and ranked in several Australian classical competitions. As a teenager, his focus <b>shifted</b> to the <b>drum</b> set {{and as his}} education continued, he was granted a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Music where he majored in contemporary performance and Jazz. In 2009, Avenaim signed with the band Porcelain (Universal/Motown) and in 2010 he won the Australian Billy Hyde Drummers Playoff. Shortly after this, he decided to re-locate to the USA and focus on being a Studio and Touring Musician. Since living in America, {{he has been on}} multiple national and international tours with Troy Harley, Emblem3 on the Selena Gomez Stars Dance Tour and Scott Weiland.

5000|$|The TR-606 {{was part}} of Roland's line of {{computer-controlled}} musical instruments that are now very highly sought after. The TB-303 and TR-606 launched in 1981 as a matched pair to provide solo artists the chance to practice without other individuals, solely using the TR-606 and TB-303 as drums and bass lines to practice to, but the programming and artificial sounds made the boxes uncomfortable to use and they soon lost their luster. The group was doomed to an early demise as popular music soon <b>shifted</b> to sampled <b>drum</b> sounds and real bass lines for hit songs, as sample capabilities were the newest development of the late 1980s. At one time, the TR-606 {{could be found in}} pawn shops for as little as US$50; since the resurgence in popularity of analog drum sounds for electronic music, however, the TR-606 will commonly sell for US$400 to US$500.|$|R
500|$|... "Say Somethin'" [...] is a mid-tempo song lasting {{three minutes}} and forty-four seconds, while drawing {{influence}} from R and hip-hop music genres. It incorporates its beat from several musical instruments, including the organ, bass drum and several electronic and computerized sound effects. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute. Written by Carey, Snoop Dogg, Chad Hugo, and Pharrell Williams, and produced by The Neptunes, the song is composed in the key of E minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of F3 to the high-note of B5. The song's chorus has a chord progression of Emaj7 to Amaj7, while altering to a B minor during the bridge. Dimitri Ehrlich from Vibe called the song [...] "a musical oddity" [...] and described its production as [...] "strange instrumentation, weird melodic <b>shifts,</b> and hectic <b>drum</b> patters".|$|R
5000|$|The {{band that}} {{eventually}} became the Black Diamonds {{was founded in}} Lithgow, a mining town in New South Wales. [...] In 1959, Alan Stuart Oloman and Allen Michael Keogh, who were both twelve year's old, learned to play guitar from a friend, Brandt Newton, who {{was a couple of}} years older. [...] The three started playing together regularly, doing primarily instrumentals. [...] They found a drummer, Johnny Kett, but had no bassist at this point. Alan Oloman's father, Bill Oloman, became the group's manager and provided space at his family house for the band to rehearse. He came up with the name for the band, [...] "Johnny Kett's Black Diamonds", as a reference to the mining industry in their home town and drummer Kett, who at the time was their leader. [...] The group started playing live gigs, and got a Saturday night residency at Scottish Reunion Dance, a local dancehall. In 1963, Brandt Newton departed and Alan Oloman's brother, Neil Oloman joined on guitar, while Allen Keogh switched over to bass, filling out their sound, which now largely consisted of surf instrumentals. With the onslaught of the Beatles and the British Invasion in 1964, they recognized that they would need a lead vocalist, and chose Glen Christopher to fill the role. Glen Bland joined the group on rhythm guitar, allowing Alan Oloman to concentrate on his lead parts. The group's leadership role <b>shifted</b> from <b>drummer</b> Kett to Alan Oloman, whose increasingly virtuosic lead guitar playing was emerging as a key feature in the band's sound. Christopher later departed and Bland took over on lead vocals (and harmonica).|$|R

Its lyrics are arranged to portray the singer during a celebration: [...] "I came to have a party / Open off that Bacardi ... Purple taking me higher / I'm lifted and I like it." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised its lyrics and beat, and felt the song prepares listeners for the album's [...] "party theme".

5000|$|Sears was {{inspired}} to sing and play guitar after receiving a copy of Phil Thornalley's Swamp album at age four. He asked for a guitar at age five and the following Christmas he received one but his interest soon <b>shifted</b> to <b>drums</b> and he began playing drums after his parents bought him a drum set when he was eight. Inspired by blues artists, notably Buddy Guy, B.B.

At age 12, Sears asked his father to take him to an open-mic at a local club and Sears began gaining recognition as a young blues guitarist. Sears began sitting in with local bands and soon began appearing with Hubert Sumlin, Ronnie Baker Brooks (once referring to Sears as a [...] "young Rico Suave"), Guitar Shorty, Bob Margolin, Chris Beard, Ana Popovic, Michael Burks, G. Love and Special Sauce, Fruteland Jackson, Lil' Ed Williams, Charlie Musselwhite, Bobby Rush, Inner Circle, Henry Gray, John Primer, Jimmy [...] "Bo" [...] Horne, Pinetop Perkins, backed up The Temptations, and even appeared with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Solomon Burke who dubbed Sears [...] "the future Soul and Blues" [...] and referred to him as [...] "godson". Within a few months he was playing professionally. In early 2004 Sears assembled a band of veteran musicians and he began booking shows at local clubs and festivals on the weekends and developed a loyal fan base and attracted the attention of several independent labels.|$|R
