Both quadrupoles {{can be used in}} scanning or <b>static</b> <b>mode,</b> {{depending on the type of}} MS/MS analysis being performed. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (sometimes referred to as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)) and neutral loss scan. For example: When Q1 is in <b>static</b> <b>mode</b> (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called [...] "daughter spectrum"). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a [...] "transition" [...] and forms the basis for SRM.

The motivation for the <b>static</b> <b>modes</b> sliding comes from a necessity due to some problems related to the STATIC MODES SWITCHING.

Three approaches to obtain modal derivatives are presented, including a newly introduced numerical way.

40|$|When marching-on-in-time (MOT) {{method is}} applied to solve the time-domain {{electric}} field integral equation, spurious internal resonant and <b>static</b> loop <b>modes</b> are always observed in the solution. The internal resonant modes have recently been studied by the authors; this letter investigates the <b>static</b> loop <b>modes.</b> Like internal resonant <b>modes,</b> <b>static</b> loop <b>modes,</b> in theory, should not be observed in the MOT solution since they do not satisfy the zero initial conditions; their appearance is attributed to numerical errors. It is discussed in this letter that the dependence of spurious <b>static</b> loop <b>modes</b> on numerical errors is substantially {{different from that of}} spurious internal resonant modes. More specifically, when Rao-Wilton-Glisson functions and Lagrange interpolation functions are used as spatial and temporal basis functions, respectively, errors due to space-time discretization have no discernible impact on spurious <b>static</b> loop <b>modes.</b> Numerical experiments indeed support this discussion and demonstrate that the numerical errors due to the approximate solution of the MOT matrix system have dominant impact on spurious <b>static</b> loop <b>modes</b> in the MOT solution. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Model {{reduction}} techniques {{provide for}} a computationally inexpensive method for solving elastic dynamic problems with complex structures. The elastic nested gimbal problem is a problem which requires model reduction techniques {{as a means to}} reduce the dynamic equations. This is done using two methods: one technique employs mode ranking criteria to select modes which influence the dynamics of the problem the most. The second involves the use of <b>static</b> correction <b>modes</b> along with vibration modes to simulate the dynamics of this nested gimbal model. A model of the structure is described in terms of a lumped-parameter finite element model. This mathematical model of the physical system serves as the ha. sis for developing model reduction techniques for the nested gimbal problem. A truth model based on given initial conditions is used to compare the accuracy of the model reduced problem. A number of model reduction theories are described and applied to the gimbal simulation. The equations for the mode ranking techniques and the <b>static</b> and vibration <b>mode</b> analysis are developed as well as a quantitative error measure. Comparisons are made with the truth model using the mode ranking criteria base on the momentum coefficients and the frequency cutoff criteria. Test cases are also run using the <b>static</b> correction <b>modes</b> with vibration <b>modes</b> and <b>static</b> correction <b>modes</b> with the ranked vibration modes using momentum coefficients. The use of various <b>static</b> <b>modes</b> is discussed during the implementation of the <b>static</b> correction <b>mode</b> method. Applying the model reduction theories to a set of elastic, nested gimbals, the mode ranking criteria provides better results based on the error measure than the frequency cutoff criteria when the simulation is run using less than twenty-five <b>modes.</b> Using <b>static</b> <b>modes</b> along with ranked modes to represent the elastic dynamics of the problem does not provide better results than using the unranked vibration <b>modes</b> with the <b>static</b> <b>modes.</b> Modeling the dynamics using <b>static</b> correction <b>modes</b> with the unranked vibration modes provides the best results while using the lea. st number of modes. It is advantageous {{to take into account the}} given conditions applied to the system when reducing the model of a complex dynamic problem. by Phillip James Balucan. Thesis (S. M.)
