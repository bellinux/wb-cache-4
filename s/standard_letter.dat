5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} with the Russian Federation are currently on a good or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The Cyrillic alphabet originated during 9th century and it was created by Clement and Naum, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their <b>standard</b> <b>letter.</b> Relations between Russia and Bulgaria have dated {{back as far as}} the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition of calling monarchs tsars, a Slavic word for caesar or emperor. The Russian Empire was the first country to recognize Bulgaria, and greatly helped Bulgaria in its war of independence from Ottoman Empire in 1908. During the Cold War, Bulgaria became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E
25|$|Mail sent internationally {{is known}} as letter-post. It can only contain paper {{documents}} (See Light Packet and Small Packet below). The 2015 and 2016 rate for a <b>standard</b> <b>letter</b> is $1.20 if sent to the United States and $2.50 if sent to any other destination.|$|E
25|$|The lettermail service {{allows the}} {{transmission}} of virtually any paper document. The 2015 and 2016 rate was 85 cents for a <b>standard</b> <b>letter</b> (30 g or less) and $1.20 for a letter between 30 g and 50 g. Rates usually increase in mid-January of each year (in 2014 the increase was delayed {{to the end of}} March); for ordinary letters (30 g or less), the 2014 rate was originally scheduled to be $0.65. The rate was regulated by a price-cap formula, linked to the inflation rate. The Corporation now has a “permanent” stamp that is valued at the domestic rate forever, eliminating the need to buy 1 cent stamps after a rate increase. The rates for lettermail are based on weight and size and determine whether the article falls into the aforementioned standard format or in the oversize one.|$|E

25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a <b>standard</b> <b>letter.</b> The seven {{separate}} and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E
2500|$|Scribes in Ugarit {{appear to}} have {{originated}} the [...] "Ugaritic alphabet" [...] around 1400 BC: [...] 30 letters, corresponding to sounds, were inscribed on clay tablets; although they are cuneiform in appearance, they bear no relation to Mesopotamian cuneiform signs.

[...] While the letters show little or no formal similarity, the <b>standard</b> <b>letter</b> order (preserved in the Latin alphabet as A, B, C, D, etc.) shows strong similarities between the two, suggesting that the Phoenician and Ugaritic systems were not wholly independent inventions.|$|E
