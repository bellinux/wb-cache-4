50|$|In {{the first}} 10 years {{following}} the influential 1976 publication, soil <b>solarization</b> was investigated in at least 24 countries and has been now been applied in more than 50, mostly in the hot regions, although there were some important exceptions. Studies have demonstrated effectiveness of <b>solarization</b> with various crops, including vegetables, field crops, ornamentals and fruit trees, against many pathogens, weeds and a soil arthropod. Those pathogens and weeds which are not controlled by <b>solarization</b> were also detected. The biological, chemical and physical changes that take in solarized soil {{during and after the}} <b>solarization</b> have been investigated, as well as the interaction of <b>solarization</b> with other methods of control. Long-term effects including biological control and increased growth response were verified in various climatic regions and soils, demonstrating the general applicability of <b>solarization.</b> Computerized simulation models have been developed to guide researchers and growers whether the ambient conditions of their locality are suitable for <b>solarization.</b>|$|E

50|$|As the {{electrons}} rapidly decelerate inside the acrylic, they also generate powerful X-rays. Residual electrons and X-rays darken the acrylic by introducing defects (color centers) {{in a process}} called <b>solarization.</b> <b>Solarization</b> initially turns acrylic specimens a lime green color which then changes to an amber color after the specimen has been discharged. The color usually fades over time, and gentle heating, combined with oxygen, accelerates the fading process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solarization</b> {{refers to}} a {{phenomenon}} in physics where a material undergoes a temporary change in color after being subjected to high-energy electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet light or X-rays. Clear glass and many plastics will turn amber, green or other colors when subjected to X-radiation, and glass may turn blue after long-term solar exposure in the desert. It is believed that <b>solarization</b> {{is caused by the}} formation of internal defects, called color centers, which selectively absorb portions of the visible light spectrum. In glass, color center absorption can often be reversed by heating the glass to high temperatures (a process called thermal bleaching) to restore the glass to its initial transparent state. <b>Solarization</b> may also permanently degrade a material's physical or mechanical properties, {{and is one of the}} mechanisms involved in the breakdown of plastics within the environment.|$|E

50|$|Biosolarization is an {{alternative}} technology to soil fumigation used in agriculture. It {{is closely related to}} biofumigation and soil <b>solarization,</b> or the use of solar power to control nematodes, bacteria, fungi and other pests that damage crops. In <b>solarization,</b> the soil is mulched and covered with a tarp to trap solar radiation and heat the soil to a temperature that kills pests. Biosolarization adds the use of organic amendments or compost to the soil before it is covered with plastic, which speeds up the <b>solarization</b> process by decreasing the soil treatment time through increased microbial activity. Research conducted in Spain on the use of biosolarization in strawberry fruit production has shown it to be a sustainable and cost effective option. The practice of biosolarization is being used among small agricultural operations in California. Biosolarization is a growing practice in response to the need for methods for organic soil <b>solarization.</b> The option for more widespread use of biosolarization is being studied by researchers at the Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety at the University of California at Davis in order to validate the effectiveness of biosolarization in commercial agriculture in California, where {{it has the potential to}} greatly reduce the use of conventional fumigants.|$|E

50|$|Soil <b>solarization</b> is {{the third}} {{approach}} for soil disinfestation; the two other main approaches, soil steaming and fumigation; were developed {{at the end of}} the 19th century. The idea of <b>solarization</b> was based on observations by extension workers and farmers in the hot Jordan Valley, who noticed the intensive heating of the polyethylene-mulched soil. The involvement of biological control mechanisms in pathogen control and the possible implications were indicated in the first publication, noticing the very long effect of the treatment. In 1977, American scientists from the University of California at Davis reported the control of Verticillium in a cotton field, based on studies started in 1976, thus denoting, for the first time, the possible wide applicability of this method.|$|E
5000|$|Soil <b>solarization</b> is {{a simple}} method of weed control that is {{accomplished}} by covering the soil {{with a layer of}} clear or black plastic. The plastic that is covering the ground traps heat energy from the sun and raises the temperature of the soil. [...] Many weed seeds and vegetative propagules are not able to withstand the temperatures and are killed. For this method to be most effective, it should be implemented during the summer months and the soil should be moist. [...] Also, cool season weeds are more susceptible to soil <b>solarization</b> than are warm season weeds. [...] Using black plastic as a cover excludes light which can help to control plants that are growing whereas clear plastic has been shown to produce higher soil temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Around {{her time}} with the Mamas & the Papas, Gibson {{returned}} to photography, which {{she had begun to}} take seriously back in 1965 when she met photojournalist Ralph Gibson (no relation). During this same period, Gibson studied with Edmund Teske, a photographer working with the technique of <b>solarization.</b>|$|E
50|$|He formed {{relations}} with other vanguardists in Berlin and practiced various experimental techniques such as <b>solarization,</b> multiple images and photograms, for which reason twelve of his works were considered degenerate art by the Nazi regime and were prohibited. Among the artists with whom he interacted are Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, El Lissitzky and Alexander Archipenko.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, the BBFC forced THQ {{to further}} extend the <b>solarization</b> {{effect on the}} scenes, {{distancing}} the camera before the killings and adding a zoom effect during them, in order to pass it with an 18 certificate, making The Punisher {{one of the only}} games to require BBFC cuts in order to be rated 18.|$|E
50|$|As Teske {{continued}} {{to contemplate the}} complex teachings of Vedanta, his delved further into using his photography to translate his feelings into imagery. Throughout the 1950s he experimented with new chemical and manipulative techniques, culminating in 1958 when he perfected a combination of photographic print toning and <b>solarization.</b> Edward Steichen coined the term “duotone solarization” to describe this new technique.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} {{alternatives}} to fungicides that are especially preferred by organic farmers, {{such as a}} combination of soil <b>solarization</b> and organic amendment. Soil <b>solarization</b> is a method of using solar power for controlling pathogens in the soil by mulching the soil and covering it with a large, usually transparent polyethylene tarp to trap solar energy and heat the soil. In studies, this method {{has proven to be}} as effective as fungicides. Additionally, crop rotation can be an effective management practice. According to researchers, “Rotation out of soybeans for three years may effectively reduce microsclerotia numbers and is useful for managing charcoal rot” because “corn is not as good of a host to M. phaseolina as soybean so rotation with corn for three years may help reduce populations but not eliminate the pathogen from the soil” Finally, tillage practices can reduce moisture in the soil and make the environment less favorable for the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Some farmers attack {{this problem}} with a “burn-down” {{herbicide}} such as glyphosate in lieu of tillage for seedbed preparation and because of this, no-till {{is often associated with}} increased chemical use in comparison to traditional tillage based methods of crop production. However, there are many agroecological alternatives to increased chemical use, such as winter cover crops and the mulch cover they provide, soil <b>solarization</b> or burning.|$|E
50|$|Genzō Kitazumi (18 December 1898 - 12 March 1982) was an {{influential}} Japanese photographer. Kitazumi's work {{is characterized by}} manipulation of photographic process for aesthetic rather than representational or documentary effect. His pre-war work features the use of lith print process and <b>solarization.</b> Photograms feature frequently in his post-war work. Kitazumi is also noted for his pioneering work in the commercial use of color photographic processing and printing in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Savage {{explored}} {{variations in}} color and texture in her work often by using inked and intaglio relief prints. Many of her works were created by combining media such as collage, negative images, texture screening, multiple exposure, photograms, <b>solarization,</b> toning, printing on metallic foils. Her works focus {{on a variety of}} subject matter and imagery, which has included portraits, landscapes, human figures, mannequins, masks, toys, kitchen utensils, dental and opthalmological equipment.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1920s Man Ray experimented with the Sabattier, or <b>solarization</b> process, a {{technique}} that won him critical esteem, especially from the Surrealists. Many of the central figures of Surrealism—Breton, Magritte, Dalí—followed his example in using photography {{in addition to other}} media. Other photographers, such as Maurice Tabard and Raoul Ubac, were directly inspired by Man Ray’s techniques, while photographers such as André Kertész and Brassaï were indirectly influenced by his innovative approach to the medium.|$|E
50|$|He {{began to}} {{experiment}} with the concept that a regular photographic image could not define a moment in life, and that only multiple images portrayed together could convey what he called “universal essences.” Throughout {{the rest of his}} life he continued to produce composite prints made by sandwiching two or more negatives together. Many of these images are now his signature photographs. Also during this time he experimented with a variety of other photographic techniques, including <b>solarization</b> and collages.|$|E
50|$|Wood had {{the ability}} to work across a variety of artistic forms, from {{straight}} photography, collage, cliché verre, <b>solarization,</b> mixed media, offset lithography to drawing. Wood moved freely between conceptual and visual exploration, not adhering to a single style. Although he often raised questions about political, social and environmental issues, he avoided promoting personal solutions or adding narratives to the images. The artist instead preferred to focus on the viewer’s interpretation and the possibility for multiple meanings.|$|E
50|$|Soil <b>solarization</b> is an {{environmentally}} friendly method of using solar power for controlling pests such as soilborne plant pathogens including fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and insect and mite pests along with weed seed and seedlings {{in the soil}} by mulching the soil and covering it with tarp, usually with a transparent polyethylene cover, to trap solar energy.It may also describe methods of decontaminating soil using sunlight or solar power. This energy causes physical, chemical, and biological changes in the soil.|$|E
