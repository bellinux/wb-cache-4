[...] For diplomatic reasons, few such pictures appeared before 1790, after which the Company's visits ended. [...] They stayed at the Nagasakiya inn in the Hongoku-chō neighbourhood in the Nihonbashi district of Edo, and many <b>stopped</b> <b>by</b> <b>to</b> {{take a look at}} the foreigners. [...] Utamaro may have seen Dutch people on one of these visits, and thus may have based the man's portrait on observation; women on the other hand were rare visitors to Japan, and the woman's garb is anachronistic.|$|E
