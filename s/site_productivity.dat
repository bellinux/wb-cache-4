40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the central part of Nestos Valley in northeastern Greece. The main {{objective}} was to examine the effect of different position (dominant, suppressed, side-shaded) and <b>site</b> <b>productivities</b> on the height growth of young Populus tremula L. clonal ramets in low elevation formations of the species. Fifty-four ramets growing in different positions and sites were cut and studied. Stem analysis was conducted and the height of each ramet at the age of 10 years was calculated. The main results of this research indicate that the dominant ramets on good <b>productivity</b> <b>sites</b> have greater height at the age of 10 years, when compared with the corresponding ramets on medium <b>productivity</b> <b>sites.</b> On the contrary, in suppressed and side-shaded ramets, there is no statistically significant difference in height at the age of 10 years between the two site types. This pattern indicates that competition is the procedure that characterizes the relationships between ramets in the investigated formations. The heights of dominant P. tremula ramets presented in this study are very satisfactory for the species, compared with the height of P. tremula trees from other regions of the species expansion reported in other studies...|$|R

The results suggest that when the resources are abundant as in the rainy season, the trophic niche breadth is reduced in <b>sites</b> with high <b>productivity</b> and, in the same sites, the trophic niche breadth increases when the resources are limited as in the dry season. In contrast, the trophic niche breadth is similar in both conditions of resource availability (i. e., rainy and dry seasons) at <b>sites</b> with low <b>productivity.</b> During the dry season, populations of P. barbatus showed a similar foraging behavior in sites with high and low productivity. Thus, the particular characteristics of a site can significantly affect the foraging strategies of the ants in those environments...|$|R

40|$|Indicators {{of forest}} <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> may exhibit {{considerable}} {{spatial and temporal}} variability {{that should be considered}} in sustainable forest management. It is generally assumed that natural site conditions and, in turn, <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> changes gradually and predictably. Our review illustrates many exceptions to this paradigm. Consequently, uni-dimensional productivity indicators such as the commonly used site index (estimated based on stand height) is not always sufficient to characterize <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> for apparently homogeneous forest stands. To alleviate this problem, we suggest a hierarchical procedure for the estimation of forest <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> including site mapping, unthinned reference stands (against which to measure growth performance) and adaptive modelling. The level and detail at which site mapping should be conducted (region, forest, management unit or subunit), depends on the objective (research vs. operational forestry), forest type and expected deviations in <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> estimates compared with the cost of site mapping. Unthinned reference plots should preferably be maintained in the long term and the number of plots should increase with increasing site or stand heterogeneity (for homogeneous land we recommend one plot in 10 ha, two in 100 ha, etc.). With adaptive modelling site specific parameters can be updated at any time when new information has become available. Finally, the review indicates a need to re-define traditional measurement procedures to achieve a contemporary and rational statistical basis for the estimation of <b>site</b> <b>productivity...</b>|$|E

We chose Larix olgensis in northeast China to investigate the responses of forest <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> to regional climate change using a generalized additive model (GAM). Based on site index data and climate variables from 335 townships across the Jilin Province, we developed a climate-sensitive forest site index model, which accounted for 72. 9 % of the variation in the site index at the referred age of 20 (SI 20). Our results indicated that climatic and geographic factors significantly affect forest <b>site</b> <b>productivity.</b> The geographic location, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and mean temperature differential were found to be statistically significant explanatory variables. We predict that the change of mean SI 20 would vary from 0. 3 m to - 0. 8 m (2. 2 % to - 5. 9 %) by 2050 and from 0. 5 m to - 1. 6 m (3. 7 % to - 11. 8 %) by 2070 under three BC-RCP scenarios with rising temperature and increasing precipitation.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of sustainable forest management, measuring site quality and predicting <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> remain a major forestry topic. Over the past years, it has been fostered {{by a number of}} site-growth modelling studies seeking to establish quantitative relationships between site index and explicit biophysical indicators. In addition, comparative modelling studies of site index and <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> have highlighted limited accordance of their environmental determinism, questioning site index as a reliable indicator of site quality. Lastly, process-based modelling approaches have recently arisen as a means to predict <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> over large regions. All these investigations have however drawn limited attention in recent syntheses. In this review, we provide an overview of the literature on these site-growth studies. Concepts and vocabulary related to <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> are introduced. Taking regional studies as a baseline, we first highlight recent progress regarding the geographic areas encompassed, and the major role played by NFI programmes and spatialized environmental information. A trade-off between model accuracy and geographic extent is suggested, pointing out potential deficiencies in the modelling of site-growth associations, insufficient accuracy or resolution in climatic data, or uncontrolled factors in site-growth models that emerge on a higher spatial scale. Inappropriate use of biophysical classifications where environmental factors remain implicit is also emphasized. In a next step, we discuss early and most recent indications on weaknesses of the site index concept when applied over large regions, including its differential response to climate relative to <b>site</b> <b>productivity,</b> regional variations in site index curves, site index dependence on stand density and subsequently on regional silvicultural practices. The role of genetic structure of tree populations and its integration into site-growth studies is also reviewed and discussed. The interests, limits and recent advances of process-based models as an alternative to evaluate <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> are considered, as they may overcome some of the previous limitations. We last draw challenges and perspectives on the issue. We suggest that the accuracy and the need of site index as a founding concept of forestry science is questioned, by building direct productivityenvironment relationships based on NFI databases as a realistic option at hand. We formulate perspectives regarding the accuracy, resolution and enlargement of environmental indicators currently used, the inclusion of information on genetic structure of tree populations in the context of adaptation to future climate change, as well as the use of <b>site</b> <b>productivity</b> models in forest management...|$|E
