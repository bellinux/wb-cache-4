5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part {{swallows}} are insectivorous, taking flying insects on the wing. Across the whole family {{a wide range of}} insects are taken from most insect groups, but the composition of any one prey type in the diet varies by species and with the time of year. Individual species may be selective, they do not scoop up every insect around them, but instead select larger prey items than would be expected by random sampling. In addition the ease of capture of different insect types affects their rate of predation by swallows. They also avoid certain prey types; in particular stinging insects such as bees and wasps are generally avoided. In addition to insect prey a number of species will occasionally consume fruits and other plant matter. Species in Africa have been recorded eating the seeds of Acacia trees, and these are even fed to the young of the greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
500|$|No other {{streaked}} swallow species {{occur within}} the island breeding {{range of the}} Mascarene martin, and in Africa the lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head. The brown-throated sand martin [...] has similar structure and plumage colour to the Mascarene martin, but has plain, unstreaked underparts. The small Mascarene swiftlet has longer, narrower wings than the martin, and a much lighter flight. The Brazza's martin is smaller, has a plainer back and finer dashing on the throat and chest, {{but there is no}} range overlap.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} swallows, Brazza's martin feeds on flying insects, {{including}} termites, and may hunt over rivers or open savanna. It {{can occur in}} single-species flocks or with other swallows including barn <b>swallows,</b> lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallows,</b> or rock martins.|$|R
50|$|The nest may be reused {{in later}} years, {{and one was}} {{utilised}} for 30 years. The nest is built in natural cavities or man-made structures such as buildings, culverts and shafts, but its preference for isolated and abandoned buildings means that this species has not benefited from artificial sites {{to the same extent}} as, for example, the greater or lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallows.</b>|$|R
50|$|A bird list is {{available}} at reception. In summer, {{the best time to}} go birding in Mokala National Park is at sunrise, particularly between 07h30 and 09h00. The level of endemism at Mokala is high. The Kalahari sandveld habitats hold more bird species than the rocky areas, especially during times of higher rainfall. The endemic black-chested prinia thrives in the arid conditions of the park. Chestnut-vented warblers are attracted to the lawns surrounding the lodges. A fairly tame pair of Cape buntings frequent Mosu Lodge, using the buildings as an artificial nest structure, while greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallows</b> nest beneath the eaves of the restaurant's thatched roof.|$|R

50|$|The lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> has {{heavier and}} darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and a {{brighter}} head colour than the larger greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow.</b> The lesser also prefers less open habitats. It feeds mainly on flying insects, {{but has been}} known to eat small fruits. The flight is erratic, and the call is a nasal zeh zeh zeh zeh zeh.|$|E

50|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest, taking {{about a week}} to {{construct}} an open cup built over a foundation of twigs, leaves, roots and feathers and lined with the hair of mammals. They often use the nests of <b>striped</b> <b>swallows</b> frequently evicting the swallows while they are still using the nest. The nest is usually positioned below a rock overhang, bridge, culvert or in a cave and it may sometimes {{be placed in a}} hole in a wall or in a cavity in agricultural machinery.In southern Africa the eggs are laid from August-December, with a peak during September-November. The normal clutch size is 2-4 eggs, which the females incubates for about 14-16 days. Both parents feed the chicks which fledge at about three weeks old.|$|R
5000|$|The scroll on {{the flag}} flying from the RAC ship IMPERATOR NIKOLAI I, {{painted in the}} 1850s, also does not dip into the blue stripe, but the eagle appears to have its wings [...] "up" [...] rather than down as in the Bartram version. This could reflect the {{official}} change in 1857 to a [...] "wings up" [...] version of the Imperial eagle, and would correspond to another, very interesting and possibly unique version of the RAC flag depicted in a painting of the RAC ship SITKA in 1855. Once again the eagle is depicted in the upper quarter, with the scroll extending into the blue <b>stripe,</b> but the <b>swallow</b> tail of the flag's fly in unknown in other versions.A depiction of the RAC flag on a stock certificate dated 1845, issued in St. Petersburg shows another eagle with the [...] "wings up" [...] variation, but evidently without the scroll beneath. As this is an official document of the Company, the flag depicted must be considered an official representation. With the official State changes to the [...] "All Russian State Coat of Arms" [...] occurring {{at least four times}} between 1806 and 1881, one can appreciate the difficulty in identifying one particular design as representative for the entire period.|$|R
5000|$|The greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> [...] (Cecropis cucullata) {{is a large}} swallow that is {{native to}} Africa south of the equator.|$|E
50|$|This is a bird of wooded, mainly lowland habitats, and is {{replaced}} in montane grassland by the greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow,</b> Hirundo cucullata. It is common and often found around human habitation. The lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a tubular entrance {{on the underside}} of a suitable structure. The nest has a soft lining, and may be reused in later years. The nest may be built in a cave or under a rock overhang or a tree branch. This species has benefited from its willingness to use buildings, bridges, culverts and similar structures. Given the choice, it will select a high nest site.|$|E
50|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from the smaller lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow,</b> Hirundo abyssinica, in that the latter species has heavier and darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and rufous rather than buffy ear coverts. Lesser also prefers less open habitats.|$|E
50|$|This is a bird of dry scrub, {{farmland}} and clearings. It {{is often}} found around human habitation. The pearl-breasted swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest reinforced with grass or hair {{and with a}} soft lining. It sometimes uses old nests of the greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow,</b> Hirundo cucullata.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> (Cecropis abyssinica) {{is a large}} swallow. It breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa from Sierra Leone and {{southern}} Sudan south into eastern South Africa. It is partially migratory with South African birds wintering further north. West African birds leave {{the north of the}} breeding range in the dry season.|$|E
50|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E
50|$|The greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> is common, unafraid of humans, and {{has benefited}} from the {{availability}} of nest sites around habitation. It feeds mainly on flying insects, but {{has been known to}} eat small fruits. It is a bird of dry open country, such as grassland, and has a preference for hills and mountains. It avoids more wooded areas, but is often found around human habitation.|$|E
50|$|The greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> {{builds a}} bowl-shaped mud nest with a tubular {{entrance}} {{on the underside}} of a suitable structure. The nest has a soft lining, and is often reused in later years. The nest may be built in a cave or under a rock overhang or fallen tree. This species has benefited from its willingness to use buildings, bridges, culverts and similar man-made structures. Given the choice, it will select a high nest site.|$|E
5000|$|Brazza's martin can be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows within its range by the heavy streaking on the underparts. [...] Although the lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> also has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head. Compared to the Mascarene martin, this species is smaller, has a plainer back and finer dashing on the throat and chest, {{but there is no}} range overlap.|$|E
50|$|Bates's swift forages {{above the}} canopy of the {{rainforest}} using a fluttering flight, with short periods of gliding occasionally interrupting the rapid wing beats. It may be seen singly, or in small flocks and in mixed flocks with other swifts and hirundines. It nests solitarily in the old nests of hirundines and other swifts, mainly forest swallow and possibly mottled spinetail and lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow.</b> Breeding has been recorded in September to March in Gabon and egg laying has been noted in Cameroon in May and June.|$|E
50|$|The greater <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> is 18-20 cm long. It has {{dark blue}} upperparts with a pale orange rump and a {{chestnut}} crown, nape {{and sides of}} the head. The underparts and underwing coverts are creamy white with dark streaking, and the upper wings and underwing flight feathers are blackish-brown. The blackish tail has very long outer feathers; these are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner, with less contrast and shorter outer tail feathers. The flight is slow and buoyant, and the call is a twittering chissick.|$|E
5000|$|The lesser <b>striped</b> <b>swallow</b> is 15-10 cm long. It has {{dark blue}} upperparts {{with a red}} rump and a rufous-chestnut crown, nape and sides of the head. The underparts are white with dark streaking, and the upper wings and underwing flight {{feathers}} are blackish-brown. The underwing coverts are tawny. The blackish tail has very long outer feathers; these are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner, with less contrast and shorter outer tail feathers.
