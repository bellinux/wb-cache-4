5|$|The Fringe team discovers a Triad {{gang member}} and ties to several shell {{companies}} the gang {{has set up}} in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but she seems unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand <b>sanitizer.</b> Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him {{to be able to go}} outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins.|$|E
25|$|Hand washing using hand {{sanitizing}} wipes is {{an alternative}} during traveling {{in the absence of}} soap and water. Alcohol-based hand <b>sanitizer</b> must contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is used {{in medical}} wipes and most common {{antibacterial}} hand <b>sanitizer</b> gels as an antiseptic. Ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi, and many viruses. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol-free hand <b>sanitizer</b> {{efficacy}} {{is heavily}} dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs. More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride {{have been shown to}} have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA {{recommends}} {{hand washing}} over hand <b>sanitizer</b> rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty. The {{increasing use of}} these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve {{as a replacement for}} proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.|$|E
25|$|A hand <b>sanitizer</b> or hand {{antiseptic}} is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In {{the late}} 1990s and {{early part of}} the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity. Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Hand <b>sanitizers</b> {{containing}} {{a minimum of}} 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers. Alcohol rub <b>sanitizers</b> kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi. Alcohol rub <b>sanitizers</b> containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 Log reduction, similar to 35 Decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.|$|R
50|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to benzalkonium chloride {{has been linked}} to the development of asthma. In 2011, a large clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of hand <b>sanitizers</b> based on different active ingredients in preventing virus transmission amongst schoolchildren was re-designed to exclude <b>sanitizers</b> based on benzalkonium chloride due to safety concerns.|$|R

25|$|Chloramine can {{be removed}} from tap water by {{treatment}} with superchlorination (10ppm or more of free chlorine, such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool <b>sanitizer)</b> while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid). Hypochlorous acid from the free chlorine strips the ammonia from the chloramine, and the ammonia outgasses {{from the surface of}} the bulk water. This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of chloramine. Residual free chlorine can then be removed by exposure to bright sunlight for about 4 hours.|$|E

500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand <b>sanitizer</b> readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{contamination}} of cantaloupes {{has become a}} serious concern as contaminated cantaloupes led to a deadly outbreak in the United States in 2011. To reduce cross-contamination between cantaloupes and to reduce resident populations on contaminated melons, application of <b>sanitizers</b> in packing shed wash water is recommended. The sanitizing agent of 5 % levulinic acid and 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) applied as a single hurdle in either a simulated dump or dip treatment significantly reduced L. monocytogenes to lower levels at the stem scar compared to a simulated dump treatment employing 200 ppm chlorine; however pathogen reductions on the rind tissue were not significantly different. Double hurdle approaches employing two sequential packing plant treatments with different <b>sanitizers</b> revealed decreased reduction of L. monocytogenes at the stem scar. In contrast, application of <b>sanitizers</b> both {{in the field and}} at the packing plant led to greater L. monocytogenes population reductions than if <b>sanitizers</b> were only applied at the packing plant...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the Pulsed Light technology (PL) for its efficiency {{to reduce the}} microbial loads on mung bean sprouts and endive salad during a simulated wash process for up to 60 s. The microbicidal action of PL {{proved to be more}} efficient than the <b>sanitizers</b> electrolyzed water (40 ppm free chlorine) and chlorine dioxide (15 ppm) within the same treatment time. Reductions of the microbial count up to 2. 5 log were found in case of PL treated endive salad while both <b>sanitizers</b> only caused maximum reductions by about 1. 5 log. A combination of PL and <b>sanitizers</b> did not have pronounced additional effect for both endive salad and mung bean sprouts. Overall, the decontamination treatments were more effective in case of endive salad compared to mung bean sprouts. It was also shown that the microbial loads in the washing water may be kept on a low level during PL treatments as count reductions of approx. 3 log were found in relation to simply washing in tap water. This study reveals that PL may be a suitable approach to reduce microbial hazards of industrially manufactured fresh produce. The application during the washing process not only reduces microbial loads on the product surface but also efficiently inactivates suspended microorganisms in the wash water and may therefore be an alternative to <b>sanitizers</b> for the prevention of cross contaminations...|$|R
2500|$|In {{swimming}} pools, chloramines {{are formed}} by the reaction of free chlorine with organic substances, such as urine and sweat.

25|$|Frequent use of alcohol-based hand <b>sanitizers</b> {{can cause}} dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers {{are added to}} the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or {{eliminated}} by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand <b>sanitizers</b> containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur. The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.|$|R
