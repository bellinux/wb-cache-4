40|$|Thesis {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} using MEMS microphones in measuring systems. Describes the characteristics of MEMS components and shows possible realization of analog to digital <b>signal</b> <b>convertor</b> when a microphone with analog output is used. Design of the amplifier is made with respect to low noise and low power consumption. Also is shown {{the possibility of using}} antialliasing filter as microphone frequency response correction at the same time...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{consists of}} theoretic basics and describes {{the design and}} construction of one-channel membraneless speaker. Absence of mechanical components gives the membraneless speaker no frequency limitation. The design consists of power source, control electronics, which modulates the <b>signal,</b> <b>convertor</b> and output transformer. The power source is realized by transformer, which lowers the voltage and stabilizators. Modulation is provided by integrated circuit TL 594, its duty is adjusted by potentiometer P 1 and frequency by potentiometer P 2. Power conversion provides dual forward converter. As a output transformer was used transformer from color television...|$|E
40|$|Increase of {{bandwidth}} {{demand in}} data networks, {{driven by the}} continuous growth of the Internet and the increase of bandwidth greedy applications, {{raise the issue of}} how to support all the bandwidth requirements in the near future. Three optical switching paradigms have been defined and are being investigated: Optical Circuit Switching (OCS); Optical Packet Switching (OPS); and Optical Burst Switching (OBS). Among these paradigms, OBS is seen as the most appropriate solution today. However, OBS suffers from high burst loss as a result of contention in the bufferless mode of operation. This issue was investigated by Coutelen et al., 2009 who proposed the loss-free CAROBS framework whereby <b>signal</b> <b>convertors</b> of the optical signal to the electrical domain ensure electrical buffering. Convertors increase the network price which must be minimized to reduce the installation and operating costs of the CAROBS framework. An analysis capturing convertor requirements, with respect to the number of merging flows and CAROBS node offered load, was carried out. We demonstrated the convertor location significance, which led to an additional investigation of the shared wavelength convertors scenario. Shared wavelength convertors significantly decrease the number of required convertors and show great promise for CAROBS. Based on this study we can design a CAROBS network to contain a combination of simple and complex nodes that include none or some convertors respectively, a vital feature of network throughput efficiency and cost...|$|R
