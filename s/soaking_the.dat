5|$|The {{damage to}} {{specimens}} is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> specimens in water, {{followed by a}} very thorough drying.

5|$|The {{essential}} {{process of}} dyeing requires <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> material containing the dye (the dyestuff) in water, adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution (the dyebath), and bringing {{the solution to}} a simmer for an extended period, often measured in days or even weeks, stirring occasionally until the color has evenly transferred to the textiles.|$|E

5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{have been}} raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The main product locally was felt, produced by <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried and cut into lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration from occurring in peeled or sliced potatoes. This is performed by <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after the bottles are opened.|$|E

50|$|To {{properly}} bend a {{sheet of}} wood, {{there are a few}} techniques that will help. The hardness of the wood will determine how long is required to <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> wood in water.

25|$|The main {{impregnation}} {{techniques are}} wet impregnation and dry impregnation. During wet impregnation, the porous particles are dissolved in the extractant {{and allowed to}} soak with the respective fluid. In this approach, the particles are either contacted with a precalculated amount of extractant, which completely soaks into the porous matrix, or the particles are contacted with an excess of extractant. After <b>soaking,</b> <b>the</b> remaining extractant, which is not inside the pores, is evaporated.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} making blue with woad was long and noxious – it {{involved}} <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine, ideally urine from {{men who had been}} drinking a great deal of alcohol, which was said to improve the colour.

25|$|<b>Soaking</b> <b>the</b> maize in limewater is {{important}} because it makes available the B vitamin niacin and the amino acid tryptophan. When maize was brought to Europe, Africa and Asia from the New World, this crucial step was often omitted.

25|$|The {{development}} of bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) by Scottish chemist Charles Tennant in about 1800, {{based on the}} discoveries of French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet, revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after <b>soaking</b> <b>the</b> textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North Glasgow, became the largest chemical plant in the world.|$|E
