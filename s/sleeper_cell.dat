500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN rated it {{seven out}} of ten, noting that American viewers {{do not have to}} see the first series to be caught up, but added [...] "British fans might lament the absence of Richard Armitage's John Porter who was the ass-kicking hero of the {{original}} series." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times described the series as a [...] "variation on [...] "24" [...] that offers reasonably competent action scenes, depressingly casual depictions of torture and death, and a comic-book conspiracy story line while also being an efficient nudity delivery system." [...] Brent MacKnight rated the series five out of ten, calling it a [...] "decent enough action yarn with slick production values," [...] but was critical that the series was [...] "more concerned with gratuitous nudity [...] each episode includes a lifetime's worth of breasts and butt cheeks–than creating a story with any substance, character, or emotional weight." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was more critical of the series, stating [...] "At first, [...] "Strike Back" [...] seems like a highbrow series on the order of [...] "," [...] but after a few minutes it [...] "conforms to the Skinemax nickname with a graphic sex scene," [...] with [...] "multiple exclamations of the f-word and bloodshed galore." [...] Owen summed [...] "Strike Back shows off high production values and an intense, fast-paced story reminiscent of 24 or <b>Sleeper</b> <b>Cell</b> that occasionally dips into the ridiculous [...] It's too bad the show's graphic nature, especially the bloodshed, is so off-putting as to make the series unwatchable." ...|$|E
