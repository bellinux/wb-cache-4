5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E

Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016.

5|$|All runways {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a more durable {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last runway to be resurfaced. This runway is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is runway 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are runways 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short runway suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between the two sets of parallel runways was runway 14/32, which has been decommissioned. Runways 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The runways were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> planet's magnetic poles by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{state of}} {{hostilities}} existed between the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K'iche' allies prior to European contact, when the conquistadors arrived there was a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political landscape. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king Kayb'il B'alam was received with great honour in Q'umarkaj while he was there. The expedition against Zaculeu was apparently initiated after K'iche' bitterness at their failure to contain the Spanish at Q'umarkaj, with the plan to trap the conquistadors in the city having been suggested {{to them by the}} Mam king, Kayb'il B'alam; the resulting execution of the K'iche' kings was viewed as unjust. The K'iche' suggestion of marching on the Mam was quickly taken up by the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|As the {{industrialisation}} of {{the valleys}} began {{there was little}} <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of Welsh as a first language. Initial immigrants were Welsh {{and it was not}} until the 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, but it wasn't these new workers who changed the language; the erosion of Welsh had already begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars, and that Welsh was a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity. In 1901 35.4% of Rhondda workers spoke only English but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1%, while Welsh speaking monoglots had dropped from 11.4% to 4.4% in the same period.|$|E
5|$|Back in Salisbury, the Southern Rhodesian {{government}} was coming {{under pressure from}} Britain to put its armed forces under the purview of a regional command. Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa's Jan Smuts. This choice was motivated {{by a combination of}} strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring. Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical, logistical and cultural terms, Huggins feared that the alternative—joining the British East Africa Command—might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia's war effort, with possible constitutional implications. A <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deployment of the colony's troops duly occurred. For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations, prominently the 6th Armoured Division.|$|E

A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E

5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, {{there may be a}} distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
