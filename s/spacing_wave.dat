40|$|Discrete wave {{mechanics}} describes {{the evolution of}} classical or matter waves on a lattice, which is governed by a discretized version of the Schrödinger equation. While for a vanishing lattice <b>spacing</b> <b>wave</b> evolution of the continuous Schrödinger equation is retrieved, spatial discretization and lattice effects can deeply modify wave dynamics. Here we discuss implications of breakdown of exact Galilean invariance of the discrete Schrödinger equation on the bound states sustained by a smooth potential well which is uniformly moving on the lattice with a drift velocity v. While in the continuous {{limit the number of}} bound states does not depend on the drift velocity v, as one expects from the covariance of ordinary Schrödinger equation for a Galilean boost, lattice effects can lead to a larger number of bound states for the moving potential well as compared to the potential well at rest. Moreover, for a moving potential bound states on a lattice become rather generally quasi-bound (resonance) states. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Using {{the first}} microstrip-line higher order mode as an example, mode {{distinction}} and radiation efficiency of leaky-wave line {{sources in the}} radiation region are presented in this paper. The spectral-domain approach {{is used to calculate}} complex power flows, leaving the line source in the transverse directions and those guided down the line source. By observing the behavior of these complex power flows in different frequency regions, the leaky-wave line source can be distinguished into the antenna mode and the reactive mode in the radiation region. Experimental results are shown to confirm this mode distinction. Moreover, by comparing the power carried away by the surface and the <b>space</b> <b>waves,</b> radiation efficiency of the first microstrip-line higher order mode of various structural parameters is analyzed. The microstrip line is more efficient as a leaky-wave line source when its substrate is thin, the dielectric constant of the substrate is low, and the antenna main beam is away from the end-fire direction.
