5|$|While {{the other}} Visegrád members {{were invited to}} join NATO at its 1997 Madrid summit, Slovakia was {{excluded}} based on what several members considered undemocratic actions by nationalist Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. Romania and Slovenia were both considered for invitation in 1997, and each had the backing of a prominent NATO member, France and Italy respectively, but support for enlargement was not unanimous, particularly in the US Congress. In {{an open letter to}} US President Bill Clinton, more than forty foreign policy experts including Bill Bradley, <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn,</b> Gary Hart, Paul Nitze, and Robert McNamara expressed their concerns about NATO expansion as both expensive and unnecessary given the lack of an external threat from Russia at that time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E

The concept was that unnecessary spending (which is hard to define in a law) can be taxed by taxing income minus all net investments and savings, and minus an allowance for essential purchases, thus making funds available for investment.|$|E
25|$|Lugar {{has been}} {{influential}} in gaining Senate ratification of treaties {{to reduce the}} world's use, production and stockpiling of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and has spearheaded many bipartisan nonproliferation initiatives. In 1991 he initiated a partnership with then-Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> aiming to eliminate latent {{weapons of mass destruction}} in the former Soviet Union. To date, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has deactivated more than 7,500nuclear warheads. In 2004, Lugar and Nunn were jointly awarded the Heinz Awards Chairman's Medal for their efforts. He was an integral figure in the passing of the New START Treaty (which passed 71-26).|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 2008, Bloomberg {{announced}} that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who takes an independent and non-partisan approach. He had also stated unequivocally, live on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, December 31, 2007, {{that he was not going}} to run for president in 2008. Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run, many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn,</b> both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates – to pressure the major party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Justice {{decision}} to not prosecute Presser prompted members of Congress {{to investigate the}} handling of the politically sensitive case. Some congressmen were concerned that Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration had led to favorable treatment, while others wanted to know why so much time and so many resources had been expended when DOJ had no intention of prosecuting Presser. Additionally, many members of Congress had spent years telling voters that the Teamsters were corrupt, and now voters were demanding an answer as to why Presser was not being called to account. DOJ defended its actions by pointing to Presser's long-time role as a criminal informant, but members of Congress were unhappy that DOJ seemed willing tolerate corruption in the nation's largest labor movement. Senators William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Delaware) and <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> (D-Georgia) ordered the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) to look into {{the handling of the}} case, and Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) asked the Judiciary Committee to probe the matter. The PSI quickly asked the FBI, DOJ and DOL to turn over their files on the Presser probe.|$|E

[...] He has endorsed the Global Zero Initiative, a plan to eliminate all nuclear weapons by 2030. Matlock has also signed an open letter of May 13, 2011 asking the implementors of the New START treaty between the U.S. Russia to make public the locations and aggregate numbers of nuclear weapons, {{in order to promote}} transparency and reduce mistrust.|$|E
500|$|The {{prize is}} awarded {{whenever}} the academy recognizes a significant achievement {{in either of}} the two fields. It has been given 62 times to 79 individuals, and once to a tri-group committee of 21 people. Awardees receive a gold-and-silver medal. Previous prizewinners include Thomas Alva Edison, for his investigations in electric lighting; Enrico Fermi, for his studies of radiation theory and nuclear energy; and Charles H. Townes, for his development of the laser. One man, Samuel Pierpont Langley, has won both the Rumford Prize and the related Rumford Medal (the European equivalent of the Rumford Prize), both in 1886. Because the prize is awarded by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, all of the recipients are American, except for one, John Stanley Plaskett, who is from British Columbia. The most recent award was given in 2008 to Sidney D. Drell, <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn,</b> William J. Perry, and George P. Shultz [...] "for their efforts to reduce the global threat of nuclear weapons".|$|E
500|$|That month, Clinton {{implemented}} a Department of Defense directive known as [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which allowed {{gay men and}} women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that [...] "the President should lift the ban... even though [...] was sure to be overridden by the Congress". Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not [...] "out of whack". The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{nominally}} Republican, Lugar often worked {{across the}} aisle, working alongside Democrats on many initiatives. For this reason, he commonly broke with traditional Republican lines, especially on non-domestic issues. Lugar's most well-known piece of legislation, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Agreement, was co-sponsored with <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn,</b> a Democratic Senator from Georgia. Lugar's bipartisan efforts earned him 24th place of 227 Senators' lifetime scores from 1993-2014 {{according to the}} Lugar Bipartisan Index, with a score of [...]668.

[...] On June 20, 2008, The Associated Press reported that according to a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the names of Edwards and <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> were on Obama's vice presidential shortlist. Ultimately, then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware was tapped to become Obama's running mate.|$|E
2500|$|Ridding {{the world}} of nuclear weapons has been a cause for pacifists for decades.

In January 2007 {{an article in the}} Wall Street Journal, authored by Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn.</b> These men were veterans of the cold-war who believed in using nuclear weapons for deterrence. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme concern.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her last}} decade, Hurston {{worked as a}} {{freelance}} writer for magazines and newspapers. In the fall of 1952 she was contacted by <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn,</b> editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, to go to Florida to cover the murder trial of Ruby McCollum. McCollum was charged with murdering a white doctor and politician, who McCollum said had forced her to have sex and bear his child. Hurston recalled what she had seen of white male sexual dominance in the lumber camps in North Florida, and discussed it with Nunn. They both thought the case might be about such [...] "paramour rights," [...] and wanted to [...] "expose it to a national audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Congress, Democratic Senator <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> of Georgia led the {{contingent}} that favored maintaining the absolute ban on gays. Reformers {{were led by}} Democratic Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who favored modification (but ultimately voted for the defense authorization bill with the gay ban language), and Barry Goldwater, a former Republican Senator and a retired Major General, who argued on behalf of allowing service by open gays and lesbians. In a June 1993 Washington Post opinion piece, Goldwater wrote: [...] "You don't have to be straight to shoot straight," [...] after Congressional phone lines were flooded by organized anti-gay opposition, indicating substantial public opposition to Clinton's open service proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scientists}} and engineers have [...] opposed nuclear weapons, including Paul M. Doty, Hermann Joseph Muller, Linus Pauling, Eugene Rabinowitch, M.V. Ramana and Frank N. von Hippel. In recent years, many elder statesmen have also advocated nuclear disarmament. <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn,</b> William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz—have called upon governments to embrace {{the vision of a}} world free of nuclear weapons, and in various op-ed columns have proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Organizations such as Global Zero, an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model on}} which the Democratic Leadership Council was built was the Coalition for a Democratic Majority. Founded by [...] "Scoop" [...] Jackson Democrats in {{response}} to George McGovern's massive loss to Richard Nixon in 1972, the CDM was dismayed by two presidential election losses and the organization's goal was to steer the party away from the New Left influence that had permeated the Democratic party since the late 1960s {{and back to the}} policies that made the FDR coalition electorally successful for close to 40 years.

Robb.|$|E
2500|$|Upon his {{exit from}} the Senate {{at the end of}} 1996, Nunn was the {{recipient}} of bipartisan praise from his colleagues. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia concluded, [...] "Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on national security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our country and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where I think he will make his greatest contribution in the years to come, wherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker. His approach to national security issues has been guided by one fundamental criteria: What <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> believes {{is in the best interest}} of the United States of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the August recess of 2005, Lugar and then-freshman Senator Barack Obama of {{neighboring}} Illinois visited Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine to inspect nuclear facilities there.

He was released after a brief dialogue between U.S. and Russian officials, and the Russians later apologized for this incident. In January 2007, President Bush signed into law the Lugar-Obama Proliferation and Threat Reduction Initiative, which furthered Lugar's work with Senator <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn</b> in deactivating weapons in the former Soviet Union.

2500|$|On 15 January 2008, Shultz co-authored (with William Perry, Henry Kissinger and <b>Sam</b> <b>Nunn)</b> {{an opinion}} paper in The Wall Street Journal, that called on governments {{to embrace the}} vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. [...] The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. [...] Nunn {{reinforced}} that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, [...] "I’m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers. You can’t deter a group who is willing to commit suicide. We are in a different era. You have to understand the world has changed." [...] In 2010, the four were featured in the documentary film Nuclear Tipping Point, which discussed their agenda.|$|E
2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{assumed the}} office of Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.

Clinton was floated in emails by Obama transition officials as a possible {{secretary of health and}} human services. On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for Secretary of State. Clinton said she was reluctant to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a [...] "difficult and exciting adventure". The appointment required a Saxbe fix, as Clinton was then a member of the United States Senate. As part of the nomination, Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and Clinton Global Initiative.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1994, Nunn, former President Jimmy Carter {{and former}} Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were asked by President Bill Clinton {{to go to}} Haiti in order to force the {{departure}} of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul Cédras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge Cédras to step down and leave the country. Cédras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country’s elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. [...] "As all of you know, at my request, President Carter, Gen.
