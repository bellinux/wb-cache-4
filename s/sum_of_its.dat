5|$|Paley {{considers}} how {{the whole}} of a system {{is more than the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E

50|$|The theorem {{can fail}} without the {{condition}} that the coefficients are non-negative. For example, the functionis asymptotic to 1/4(1-x) as x tends to 1, but the partial <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> coefficients are 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4... and are not asymptotic to any linear function.|$|R
5|$|Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{is named after}} James Joseph Sylvester, who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially, and the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with {{the same number of}} terms. The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian Einstein manifolds, and hard instances for online algorithms.|$|E
25|$|In number theory, {{a perfect}} number is a {{positive}} integer that {{is equal to the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> proper positive divisors, that is, the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) i.e. σ1(n)=2n.|$|E
25|$|As a {{differentiable}} {{function of a}} complex variable {{is equal to the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Taylor series (that is, it is analytic), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, holomorphic functions).|$|E

In particular, we treat the weak invariance principle for partial <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> linear processes with short memory.

25|$|Gromov's Betti number theorem. There is a {{constant}} C = C(n) such that if M is a compact connected n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature then the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Betti numbers is at most C.|$|E
25|$|The G8 summits {{during the}} 21st century have {{inspired}} widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes {{more than the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} unique decomposition, {{one has to}} combine all the {{irreducible}} subrepresentations that are isomorphic to each other. That means, the representation space is decomposed into a direct <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> isotypes. This decomposition is uniquely determined. It is called the canonical decomposition.|$|E
50|$|In August 2012 it was {{revealed}} by the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that the foundation had spent large <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> money on a party and pr rather than research grants. Between 2009 and 2012, a total of SEK 9,300,000 was paid out to the party organizer and pr-consultant Micael Bindefeld.|$|R

30|$|Theorem 4 {{indicates}} that, {{although a}} system’s capability {{to carry out}} a work is more powerful than any <b>of</b> <b>its</b> components, the total work done by the system cannot exceed the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> components because the existence of overheads or no system may reach the ideal efficiency where η (S_i) = 1. In other words, in the term of abstract work done by a system, the whole of the system is not always greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> parts.|$|R
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of a function symbol is a function. For example, if the domain of discourse consists of integers, a function symbol f of arity 2 {{can be interpreted as}} the function that gives the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> arguments. In other words, the symbol f is associated with the function I(f) which, in this interpretation, is addition.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business {{is equal to the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} reduce {{everything}} to simple fundamental laws {{does not imply}} the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but {{very different from the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts.|$|E
50|$|For an {{equilateral}} polygon, the circumcenter of {{mass and}} {{center of mass}} coincide. More generally, the circumcenter of mass and center of mass coincide for a simplicial polytope for which each face has the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> squares <b>of</b> <b>its</b> edges a constant.|$|R

25|$|Gloucestershire {{was very}} {{successful}} in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E
25|$|In penalized regression, 'L1 penalty' and 'L2 penalty' {{refer to}} penalizing either the L1 norm of a solution's vector of {{parameter}} values (i.e. the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> absolute values), or its L2 norm (its Euclidean length). Techniques which use an L1 penalty, like LASSO, encourage solutions where many parameters are zero. Techniques which use an L2 penalty, like ridge regression, encourage solutions where most parameter values are small. Elastic net regularization uses a penalty term {{that is a}} combination of the L1 norm and the L2 norm of the parameter vector.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{integral}} of the Gaussian curvature over some region of a surface {{is called the}} total curvature. The total curvature of a geodesic triangle equals the deviation of the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> angles from π. The sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of positive curvature will exceed π, while {{the sum of the}} angles of a triangle on a surface of negative curvature will be less than π. On a surface of zero curvature, such as the Euclidean plane, the angles will sum to precisely π radians.|$|E

25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the metabolic syndrome is anything more than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in metabolic syndrome factor combinations among individuals with metabolic syndrome) has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) {{can contribute to the}} development of multiple metabolic abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in metabolic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Lawler {{developed}} her individual style {{during the}} early 1980s, a time of intense growth in the overall economy and in the art market. In 1981 Lawler had her first West Coast gallery solo exhibition at Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1982, for her first solo exhibition at Metro Pictures, Lawler showed a small suite of artworks pulled from the gallery’s stockroom. The pieces were to be sold together, as a single work called Arranged by Louise Lawler, and it was priced at the literal <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, plus an extra 10 percent commission for Lawler; the piece did not sell.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the Young–Fibonacci graph and Young–Fibonacci lattice, {{named after}} Alfred Young and Leonardo Fibonacci, are two closely related {{structures}} involving sequences of the digits 1 and 2. Any digit sequence {{of this type}} can be assigned a rank, the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> digits: for instance, the rank of 11212 is 1+1+2+1+2=7. As was already known in ancient India, the number of sequences with a given rank is a Fibonacci number. The Young–Fibonacci lattice is an infinite modular lattice having these digit sequences as its elements, compatible with this rank structure. The Young–Fibonacci graph is the graph of this lattice, and has a vertex for each digit sequence. As the graph of a modular lattice, it is a modular graph.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the localization of the Perron root of a nonnegative irreducible matrix A. A new localization method that utilizes the relationship between the Perron root of a nonnegative matrix and the estimates <b>of</b> the row <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> generalized Perron complement is presented. The method is efficient because it gives the bounds on ρ(A) only by computing the estimates <b>of</b> the row <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> the generalized Perron complement rather than the generalized Perron complement itself.
