40|$|Although {{circadian}} rhythms in mammalian {{physiology and}} behavior are dependent upon a biological {{clock in the}} suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the molecular <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> this <b>clock</b> is in fact cell autonomous and conserved in nearly all cells of the body. Thus, the SCN serves in part as a "master clock," synchronizing "slave" clocks in peripheral tissues, and in part directly orchestrates circadian physiology.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} Period (PER) protein {{regulation in}} the brain of the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi. PER expression is restricted to the cytoplasm and axons of eight neurons, with no evidence of temporal movement into the nucleus. These neurons appear to be circadian clock cells, because PER and per mRNA are colocalized and their levels oscillate in these cells, Timeless protein immunoreactivity is coexpressed in each PER-positive neuron, and clock protein and mRNA oscillations are all suppressed in these neurons by constant light. A per antisense RNA oscillation was detected that is spatially restricted to PER-expressing cells, suggesting a novel <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> PER regulation. PER-positive neurons and their projections are strategically positioned for regulating prothoracicotropic hormone and eclosion hormone, two neurohormones under circadian control. Differences in the molecular details of PER expression and regulation between the brains of silkmoths and fruitflies provide insights into the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>clock</b> gene regulation...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have implicated that {{autophagy}} was activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our previous report indicated that CLOCK increased the accumulation of ROS under hypoxic conditions. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which CLOCK mediated endothelial damage, focusing on the involvement of oxidative damage and autophagy. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>CLOCK</b> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) showed inhibition of cell proliferation and higher autophagosome with an increased expression of Beclin 1 and LC 3 -I/II under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, CLOCK silencing reversed these effects. Interestingly, pretreatment with 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA) resulted in the attenuation of CLOCK-induced cell autophagy and but did not influence the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, Tiron (4, 5 -dihydroxy- 1, 3 -benzene disulfonic acid-disodium salt), a ROS scavenger, significantly attenuated CLOCK-induced cell autophagy. In addition, we found that overexpression <b>of</b> <b>CLOCK</b> had no significant effects on the production of ROS and expression of Beclin 1 and LC 3 -I/II under normoxic conditions in HUVEC.

40|$|Exploration of chronobiological systems {{emerges as}} a growing {{research}} field within bioinformatics focusing on various applications in medicine, agriculture, and material sciences. From a systems biological perspective, the question arises whether biological control systems for regulation of oscillatory signals and their technical counterparts utilise similar mechanisms. If so, modelling approaches and parameterisation adopted from building blocks can help to identify general components for frequency control in circadian clocks along with gaining insight into <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>clock</b> synchronisation to external stimuli like the daily rhythm of sunlight and darkness. Phase-locked loops could be an interesting candidate in this context. Both, biology and engineering, can benefit from a unified view resulting from systems modularisation. In a first experimental study, we analyse a model of coupled repressilators. We demonstrate its ability to synchronise clock signals in a monofrequential manner. Several oscillators initially deviate in phase difference and frequency with respect to explicit reaction and diffusion rates. Accordingly, {{the duration of the}} synchronisation process depends on dedicated reaction and diffusion parameters whose settings still lack to be sufficiently captured analytically...|$|R

We found that Prkca-deficient mice show an impairment <b>of</b> light-mediated <b>clock</b> resetting. In the SCN of wild-type mice, light exposure evokes a transient interaction between PRKCA and PERIOD 2 (PER 2) proteins that affects PER 2 stability and nucleocytoplasmic distribution.
