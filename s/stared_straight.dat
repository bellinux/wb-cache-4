25|$|The album's {{front cover}} {{is taken from}} {{photographer}} Peter Sutherland's Sightings series. Sutherland has described his photograph as being a chance encounter with a wild fox that momentarily stopped and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> into his lens {{while he was in}} the back garden at a friend's wedding party. Lacey acknowledged that the decision to use Sutherland's fox photograph reflected a running theme of darkness and nature that had subconsciously crept into the album. Additional photographs were provided by Alexa Lambros and Accardi, while Lacey worked with Jason Noto of Morning Breath Inc. on the packaging and layout of the album. Due to an increased popularity in vinyl, the band's label rush released production of the vinyl, leaving the band out of the process - with Lacey later commenting that he would have liked to have made the release differ from the CD version.|$|E
25|$|It was {{approaching}} 09:30, {{and the first}} part of the battle was over. So far Liprandi had enjoyed mixed fortunes: although his cavalry had been repulsed by Campbell's 'Thin Red Line' and Scarlett's Heavies, his troops under Gribbe, Semyakin, Levutsky, and Skyuderi were still in possession of redoubts Nos. 1–3, and had destroyed redoubt No.4. In all, the Russians had 11 infantry battalions and 32 guns on the Causeway Heights, while to the north, on the Fedioukine Heights, Zhabokritsky had positioned eight battalions, four squadrons, and 14 guns (some sources state 10 guns). In front of Ryzhov's cavalry — drawn up across the eastern end of the North Valley – Liprandi placed the eight guns of the 3rd Don Cossack Battery, commanded by Prince Obolensky. These guns, 6- and 9-pounders, served by 200 men, <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> down the North Valley. Liprandi now also had at his disposal six squadrons of Lancers divided into two bodies: three squadrons on the Fedioukine Heights; three others in a ravine on the side of the Causeway Heights.|$|E
60|$|He ceased abruptly, and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> before him, {{a frightened}} {{expression}} on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if they <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> {{the other}} way?" [...] Mrs. Medwin {{continued}} to object. [...] "You can't simply {{go up to}} them and twist their heads about." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{terracotta}} group {{appears to}} be the earliest work of Greek art in which the eyes are depicted in an expressive way and the figures do not simply <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> ahead as previously the norm.|$|R
5000|$|The General {{has come}} to ask Vorenus to stand for {{magistrate}} on his slate. Vorenus <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> ahead in shock before boldly declining the offer. [...] "Sir, respectfully, your politics are not mine...I'll not speak against my belief." ...|$|R
60|$|Jon nodded. His {{face had}} become {{extremely}} set, his eyes <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> before him.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise {{pushed forward}} and {{sat beside her}} friend. Josie <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> ahead, stolidly.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} head--the masked head {{that seemed to}} {{have nothing to do with}} the busy feet--and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> at the children.|$|E
50|$|The Venus <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> at the viewer, unconcerned {{with her}} nudity. In {{her right hand}} she holds a posy of roses whilst she holds her other hand over her genitals. In the near {{background}} is a dog, often a symbol of fidelity.|$|R
50|$|E {{turns around}} and, {{for the first}} time, we are {{face-to-face}} with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All {{of a sudden he}} wakes and <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch.|$|R
50|$|A bronze bust of Edwin Barret Hay {{with close}} cut hair he <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> ahead. He wears a coat with wide lapels with an {{insignia}} {{on the proper}} left lapel and an ascot around his neck. The bust sits on a three-tiered granite base and the top tier is adorned with decorative scroll work.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you would}} n't; you 'd have whisked {{round the corner}} when you saw me coming or have <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> before you, utterly {{unconscious}} {{of the young woman}} in the baggage wagon." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{postmistress}} made tedious explanations that Letty did {{not seem}} to hear. She <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> in front of her at nothing. Then in a pause in the conversation she picked up her parcel.|$|E
60|$|I {{waited for}} him to unleash the topic of the day, but he didn't seem to want to get going. Conversation languished. He <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> ahead of him in a glassy sort of manner.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} a {{newspaper}} owned by the Oklahoma Publishing Company. Caption: "White Persian Simbelair Carla of Northbrook <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> ahead while owner Peggy Blackburn of Winston-Salem, N. C. smiles and displays the ribbon her pet won at the 65 th Annual Championship cat Show that was held Sunday at Madison Square garden in new York. ...|$|R
60|$|These {{last words}} he roared out exultingly, then {{jumped up and}} glared. The door {{to the left of}} the bar had swung open, and Mrs. Schomberg, dressed for duty, stood facing him down the whole length of the room. She clung to the handle for a moment, then came in and glided to her place, where she sat down to <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> before her, as usual.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think the}} people who say they want a new {{religion}} are the last to accept anything new. They want novelty right enough. But to <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> at this life that we've brought upon ourselves, and reject it, absolutely smash up the old idols of ourselves, that we sh'll never do. You've got very badly to {{want to get rid of}} the old, before anything new will appear--even in the self.' ...|$|R
60|$|She sat {{upon one}} horse-cloth, wrapped in another, and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> before {{her at the}} fire-lit scene. At the offer of food she started, like one awakened from a dream, and then silently refused.|$|E
60|$|The canyon narrowed as it deepened; the jutting walls leaned together, {{shutting}} out the light; the {{sky above}} was now a ribbon of blue, only to be seen when Hare {{threw back his head}} and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> up.|$|E
60|$|Grief <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> {{before him}} with lustreless {{eyes for a}} full minute, as if {{summoning}} some vision to his inner sight. Then {{the corners of his}} eyes wrinkled and the ends of his yellow mustache lifted in a smile.|$|E
5|$|While {{hunting the}} boar, Michael is wounded {{by one of}} the animals. Kate starts leading Michael back to the beach, while Locke goes on his own into the jungle. As Kate and Michael head back, she climbs up a tree to attach the antenna. However, before she can finish, she hears the sounds of the monster, causing her to drop and break the equipment. The Monster heads {{straight}} for Locke, who <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> at it.|$|R
50|$|The image's {{subject is}} Chase's 11-year-old daughter, Dorothy, {{wearing a white}} dress with {{full-length}} sleeves, a straw hat with a green bow, a black belt, black tights, and black shoes. She is standing against a brown background without any detail, so the viewer's eye is focused only on her. Dorothy <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> out at the viewer, engaging them. With a 6' canvas, Dorothy is reminiscent of full-length Baroque paintings of emperors, giving the young girl a grandiose image.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of songwriter Cary Jacobs Bond in Hollywood, California, [s. d. ]. Here, the composer of "A Perfect Day", "I Love You Truly" and "Just a Wearying for You" {{sits in a}} lavish gown made of {{what appears to be}} satin and lace, holding sheet music with her left hand and supporting herself to the side with her right. Her hair is up. She wears a bracelet on her left wrist, and <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> ahead with her upturned features...|$|R
60|$|Harding did so, and for {{ten minutes}} Tony, who <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> {{in front of him}} at the blue Bougainvillea on the moonlit wall, spoke with quiet conciseness, while Harding sat in the shadow {{watching}} him. At last he turned to Harding.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> out afar, {{and after}} looking at him Carter felt moved by a bit of {{youthful}} intuition to murmur, [...] "That's bad," [...] {{in a tone that}} almost in spite of himself hinted at the dawning of a befogged compassion.|$|E
60|$|His {{forehead}} wrinkled, {{his eyes}} contracted, and he <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> before him, seeing neither the luminous {{green of the}} maples nor the whispering cedars, but far off in the misty future a golden possibility, which, if well worth winning, must be painfully earned. His reverie was broken suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "He just {{rolled out}} of ’is bunk and, {{standing}} in front of Bill, put ’is fists up at ’im and <b>stared</b> ’im <b>straight</b> in the eye.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of this victory, writes Plum Warner, the [...] "fame of Australian cricket was established for all time." [...] Spofforth became known forever as [...] "The Demon Bowler" [...] (a title which first adorned John [...] "Foghorn" [...] Jackson in the 1850s). He was the bowler whom English batsmen most feared and is also regarded {{as the one who}} first brought into the game, as a scaring technique, eye-to-eye contact with the batsman. Spofforth would often <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> into the batsman's eyes to scare and shake him.|$|R
50|$|Luks {{portrays the}} ability of working-class {{children}} to experience pleasure despite their circumstances. Sentimental or otherwise, he painted the truth, as he saw it, as his friend Everett Shinn wrote. The Wrestlers, on the other hand, {{is a testament to}} masculine bravado, a massive, sumptuously painted canvas in which one beefy man has been pinned to the mat by another; the face of the defeated wrestler, turned upside down, <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> at us. The pose is contorted, every muscle bulges, and the paint reflects the sweat and strain of the match.|$|R
60|$|Birkin {{went and}} kindled it. It {{was of a}} lovely deep blue colour, with a red floor, and a great white cuttle-fish flowing in white soft streams all over it. The cuttle-fish had a face that <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> {{from the heart of}} the light, very fixed and coldly intent.|$|E
60|$|This naive {{suggestion}} did {{not affect}} {{him as much as}} the fact that this fair young girl had confessed herself his friend. He did not look at Myrtle now; he <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> ahead, at the wall paper, and his brow was furrowed as if he was thinking deeply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, we know that.' they answered, and (it {{was very}} rude of them, {{but they could}} not help it) they <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> at Kadmiel's mouth to see if his teeth were all there. It stuck in their lesson-memory that King John used to pull out Jews' teeth to make them lend him money.|$|E

6000|$|ANDERSON. Don't speak so strangely, my love. It sounds insincere to me. (She looks unutterable reproach at him.) Yes, dear, {{nonsense}} {{is always}} insincere; and my dearest is talking nonsense. Just nonsense. (Her face darkens into dumb obstinacy. She <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> before her, {{and does not}} look at him again, absorbed in Richard's fate. He scans her face; sees that his rallying has produced no effect; and gives it up, making no further effort to conceal his anxiety.) I wish I knew what has frightened you so. Was there a struggle? Did he fight? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And they {{looks very}} firm, and Tranter Dewy do turn neither {{to the right}} hand nor to the left, but <b>stares</b> quite <b>straight</b> and solemn with his mind made up!" ...|$|R
