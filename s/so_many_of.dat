5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E

5|$|Iftah Ya Simsim was {{the first}} children's {{educational}} TV program {{of its kind in}} the Arab world and the first Sesame Street co-production in the region. It {{was the first}} co-production to use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its development was similar to that of the American version of Sesame Street in the late 1960s. The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do <b>so.</b> <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E

Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when another candidate also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E

Brown too {{has described}} the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than {{had been done to}} them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E

5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E

The Marines claimed 115 North Vietnamese killed while their own casualties amounted to 10 dead, 100 wounded, and two missing. At 08:00 the following day, Operation Scotland was officially terminated. Operational control of the Khe Sanh area was handed over to the US Army's 1st Air Cavalry Division for the duration of Operation Pegasus.|$|E

In Gaeldom, where arable land is scant and scattered, the variations in the acreage, of particular ‘dabhachs’ or ‘ounces’ must have been very great, still the extent of land represented by these terms seems to have been, as a rule, about 104 Scots acres, or 120 English acres km2”.|$|R

5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae.

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them.
