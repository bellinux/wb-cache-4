5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. <b>Serious</b> <b>concerns</b> have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> were being raised by some {{observers}} regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some {{about the consequences of}} the company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, {{a number}} of <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> confronted the company. Enron had {{recently}} faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E

5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> were raised about whether the show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial.|$|E
5000|$|... The {{government}} of India expressed concern over wave of terror attacks in Pakistan. Defence Minister A. K. Antony termed PNS Mehran attack {{a matter of}} <b>serious</b> <b>concern</b> for India. According to Antony, the developments in Pakistan, especially in Karachi, were a matter of <b>serious</b> <b>concern.</b> Defence Minister also said: [...] "We are closely monitoring and we are taking precautions also. But at the same time, we don t want to overreact." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. <b>Serious</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had <b>serious</b> <b>concerns.</b> The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E

25|$|Los Angeles is {{also home}} to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells located within 1,500 feet of homes, churches, schools and {{hospitals}} in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced <b>serious</b> <b>concerns.</b>|$|E
25|$|Saakashvili {{remained}} under significant {{pressure to}} deliver on his promised reforms. Organisations such as Amnesty International have pushed <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> over human rights. Discontent over unemployment, pensions and corruption, and the continuing dispute over Abkhazia, have greatly diminished Saakashvili's popularity in the country.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{security}} {{and its effects on}} voter registration, polling station accessibility, and voter turnout – mainly in regions populated by Afghanistan's Pashtun tribes, which make up 32-37% of the country's population – have raised <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> about an ethnic imbalance in the Afghan election.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the German special forces (KSK) was killed in action and another wounded on June 6, 2013, the first combat losses in that unit's history.

25|$|By 1948, however, {{there were}} <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> about {{communist}} infiltration of the GNYIU.

25|$|Because of the {{enormous}} productivity growth in intensive agriculture and meat industry, meat {{has become a major}} part of the diet in most developed countries and is on the rise in developing countries. Red meat consumption has been linked to colon cancer; besides, growth hormone and antibiotics treatment of cattle and poultry has raised <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> about the adverse effects of those substances in industrially produced meat.|$|E
25|$|The {{governments of}} India and Iran {{generally}} maintain good relations. In 2001, {{the government of}} India voted against the United Nations resolution Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran raised {{in response to the}} persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran, and it has voted against many such resolutions since that time. Despite this, many officials and prominent citizens of India have expressed <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> about the persecution of Bahá'ís.|$|E
25|$|Sharp {{pronounced}} {{declines in}} tropical euglossine bee populations {{at both the}} native and human-managed levels, have raised <b>serious</b> <b>concerns</b> over a possible global pollination crisis. Since many tropical plant taxa, especially flowering orchid plants, strongly rely on euglossine bee pollinators for cross-fertilization, declining euglossine bee populations could lead to widespread pollen limitation and low reproductive rates. This decline is most likely attributable to human activity such as habitat disturbance—habitat degradation, pervasive pesticide use, pathogen spillover, forest fragmentation, and climatic alteration.|$|E
