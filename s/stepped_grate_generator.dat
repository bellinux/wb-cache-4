40|$|Biological {{processes}} {{that occur in}} MSW produce odorous gas emissions affecting health {{of the people and}} environment. Bio filters are bioreactors most commonly used for odour management. This study focused on evaluation of mature compost based bio filter {{that can be used in}} biological treatment facilities in Sri Lanka. The first experiment was with one layer of filter media, whereas the second with two layers having a 10 cm gap in between them. One wet and the other dry were maintained at 40 % (w/w) and 20 % (w/w) moisture contents, respectively. The odorous gases were obtained from an Inclined <b>Step</b> <b>Grate</b> (ISG) composting system. Ammonia was the reference gas. When one layer filter was used 90 % of incoming ammonia gas filtered. After modifications due to high moisture content of 40 %, high filtration efficiency of 95 % from wet bed and remaining 5 % from dry bed were achieved. The wet bed prevented cracking and air channelling effect. The temperatures between 22 â€“ 270 C and pH 6 to 9 of both filter media and stability of volatile compounds were favourable for microbial growth and survival. Doubled or layered filters with smaller depths and gaps between them would be the best design to achieve higher odour filtration efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{boiler plant}} of a heating station {{operated}} with crude brown coal was converted, {{in order to}} comply with the requirements of the German Immission Protection Law. The existing grates were converted to feed <b>step</b> <b>grates,</b> in order to improve the efficiency and also to reduce the carbon monoxide content in the crude gas by better burn-up. To reduce the sulphur dioxide emission, an additive (limestone) is mixed with the fuel. To judge the effectiveness of the modernisation and the additive inclusion, emission measurements were carried out. The results of the measurements and available results from other firms lead {{to the conclusion that the}} requirements of the Technical Instruction Air are not complied with by the offered modernisation measures and therefore that a further conversion is not recommended.

5000|$|In the film, {{the white}} dress {{appears in the}} {{sequence}} in which Marilyn Monroe and co-star Tom Ewell exit the Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theatre, then located at 586 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, having just watched the 1954 horror film Creature from the Black Lagoon. When they hear a subway train passing below the grate in the sidewalk, Monroe's character <b>steps</b> onto the <b>grate</b> saying [...] "Ooo, {{do you feel the}} breeze from the subway?", as the wind blows the dress up exposing her legs. Originally the scene had been scheduled to shoot on the street outside the Trans-Lux at 1:00 am on 15 September 1954. However, the presence of the actress and the movie cameras caught the curiosity of hundreds of fans, so the director Billy Wilder was forced to reshoot the moment on a set at 20th Century Fox. The depiction of Monroe over the grate has been compared to a similar event in the 1901 short film What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City. It has also been described as one of the iconic images of the entire 20th century.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{function}} of a cement clinker cooler must always be the adequate cooling of the clinker product; however {{from the point of}} view of fuel economy, such coolers are also designed to utilise the sensible heat of the clinker to preheat the secondary air necessary for combustion. In modern, large capacity plant, the efficiency of heat recuperation has assumed a growing importance because of two related economic factors. The first is cutting fuel costs via the well understood benefits of heat recuperation; the second factor is the gradual improvement in fuel economy of cement kilns in general. As kilns become more finely tuned, the air required for combustion is reduced in direct proportion to the fuel usage, i. e. less air is available to cool a unit quantity of clinker. Hence, in order to avoid the situation where more air is supplied to the cooler than is required for complete combustion of the fuel, more efficient heat recuperation is needed. The Fuels and Energy Research Group at the University of Surrey (FERGUS), first became aware of these kiln/cooler problems in the late 1960 's, during the course of their pioneer work on the aerodynamics of rotary cement kilns. Consequently during the last decade, FERGUS has actively investigated the limitations of grate cooler systems, in general. In the initial stages of the research, a perspex water model was constructed at the University, based on some of the largest kilns in the world, those at. Northfleet Works of Blue Circle Industries. These coolers were experiencing "air sliding" of the clinker bed, causing red hot clinker to be dumped onto the rubber belt conveyors. Using suitable flow tracing media under controlled, scaled flow conditions, the aerodynamics of the Fuller grate cooler were studied, thus revealing that the air flow balance through the chambers at the hotter end of the cooler was more significant in its effect on the clinker bed than the balance at the colder end. A solution to this problem could then be achieved by using a three <b>step</b> <b>grate.</b> Water modelling, although giving quick visual solutions to aerodynamics problems, is only qualitative. In order to quantify results, various models of rotary kiln cooler systems have been constructed, in particular a 1 / 24 th scale model of the No. 2 kiln of Rugby Cement's South Ferriby Works. This kiln had for some time suffered from excessive wear rates in the burning zone refractory lining, an expensive problem in terms of down-time and rebricking. Air model pitot static measurements indicated that the air jet (representing the fuel/primary air stream) was exhibiting a peculiar "corkscrewing" effect, which could possibly be the cause of impingement on the refractory lining, leading to premature failure of the refractory coating. Correct kiln firing practice is to promote recirculation of combustion products; these gases, being cooler than the flame, protect the brickwork from overheating. It was already understood that the primary cause of flame impingement was a lack of recirculation due to insufficient burner momentum flux, the solution being a costly change in the firing system. However, the air model results were later verified by full scale plant trials and a solution was proposed to eliminate the "corkscrewing" effect by means of a wedge- shaped bluff body welded along the jet axis. This study has quantified the macro aerodynamic effects of grate cooler systems, through the media of air and water modelling. Considerable information has also been obtained on the dynamic behaviour and heat transfer mechanisms of a particular polysize bed of clinker particles. From this information, putative predictions can be made regarding the general behaviour of clinker in beds. Recommendations have been made for further studies in this area.

2500|$|August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old {{man from}} Long Island {{got out of}} his tipped kayak on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he <b>stepped</b> on a <b>grate</b> that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live wiring for the {{underwater}} fans that somehow became exposed and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into cardiac arrest. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby Warwick, New York where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest. The park at first disputed that the electric current caused his death, saying there were no burns on his body, but the coroner responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based electrocution. The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was [...] "just a nick", while others argued it was closer to 8inches (20cm). The state's Labor Department found that the fan was properly maintained and installed and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however, it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances. The park claimed it had been vindicated, although it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.|$|R
