500|$|According to Branco, the show's past writing {{teams had}} {{proposed}} creating a Marty and Todd love story, {{but it never}} happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He later issued an apology for the comment: [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than to ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. I intended no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1918, LDS {{president}} Joseph F.

In his 1966 book Mormon Doctrine, LDS theologian (and, later, apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote that [...] "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than to believe or spread such false information.

[...] He further expressed that David Yates [...] "transmutes [...] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle." [...] Another review was released {{on the same day}} from Evening Standard, who rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated [...] "Millions of children, parents, and those who <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> won't need reminding what a Horcrux is– and director David Yates does not let them down. In fact, in some ways, he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book." [...] The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases [...] "a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed {{a lawsuit}} {{for the first time}} in her life. It was filed against Hartford, Connecticut {{personal}} injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin's producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued to be produced. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin further stated, [...] "Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>better.</b> The unauthorized use of my name is outrageous and requires legal action." [...] Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney's fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin.
