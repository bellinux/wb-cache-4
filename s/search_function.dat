5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing <b>search</b> <b>function</b> switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the software package, the HMMER <b>search</b> <b>function</b> {{is available in the}} form of a web server. The service facilitates searches across a range of databases, including sequence databases such as UniProt, SwissProt, and the Protein Data Bank, and HMM databases such as Pfam, TIGRFAMs and SUPERFAMILY. The four search types phmmer, hmmsearch, hmmscan and jackhmmer are supported (see Programs). The <b>search</b> <b>function</b> accepts single sequences as well as sequence alignments or profile HMMs.|$|E
25|$|As of May 2013, Exploring Music {{also offers}} {{the option to}} stream any of its past and current {{programs}} on demand on its website. The on-demand archive includes a <b>search</b> <b>function</b> which can search for terms and names throughout all series and episodes, and also includes a feature which can separate the music from an episode from McGlaughlin's commentary and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|<b>Search</b> <b>functions</b> {{are also}} {{evaluated}} {{on the basis}} of their complexity, or maximum theoretical run time. Binary <b>search</b> <b>functions,</b> for example, have a maximum complexity of , or logarithmic time. This means that the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space.|$|R

25|$|In February 2011, the BBC iPlayer {{was once}} again {{modified}} to include links to programmes from other broadcasters, including ITV, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, Channel 4, E4, More4, Film4, Channel 5, 5*, 5USA and S4C. The feature {{was added to the}} <b>search</b> <b>function</b> and the channels function. When users click on a programme by another broadcaster, they are redirected to the relevant broadcaster's catch up service (either the ITV Hub, All 4 or My5).|$|E
25|$|As the AIS team {{once again}} {{returned}} their attention full-time to the airborne interception task, they had {{by this time}} produced what was a complete radar system. However, the system could only {{be used in the}} manner of a flashlight, pointed in the direction of its target. This was fine for Gun Laying, but in order to be useful in the interception role, the system had to be able to find the target anywhere in front of the fighter. The team began to consider different ways to scan the radar beam to produce a <b>search</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions {{and access to}} databases. It requires less resources and often accompanies network layer attacks. An attack is disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets. The attack on the {{application layer}} can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or <b>search</b> <b>function</b> as well as web browser function, email services and photo applications. In order to be deemed a distributed denial of service attack, more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks should be used; using fewer than 3–5 nodes qualifies as a Denial-of-service attack and not a DDoS.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} role of spatial <b>searching</b> <b>function</b> before and after arrangements of constructional elements and its developmental characteristics in constructional activity. One hundred forty children (from {{the second half of}} 3 to 10 years old) and 10 adults were given the task to construct a human face under blindfolded conditions. The movements of their fingers before and after arrangements of constructional elements were recorded by VTR and analyzed. The result showed that the <b>searching</b> <b>function</b> before arrangements contributed to get roughly and partially spatial relationships between elements; and after arrangements it also contributed to correct more extensively detailed relationships between elements. The following developmental characteristics of <b>searching</b> <b>function</b> were suggested : (1) The acquisition of the <b>searching</b> <b>function</b> after arrangements was later than those before arrangements; (2) regardless of age, arranging position of each element was determined on the basis of only a few other parts; (3) in many cases the most suitable parts for determining arranging position were selected immediately before and after arrangements...|$|R

25|$|In 2004, SfN {{announced}} the Neuroscience Database Gateway (NDG) {{as a universal}} resource for neuroscientists through which almost any neuroscience databases and tools may be reached. The NDG was established with funding from NIDA, NINDS and NIMH. The Neuroscience Database Gateway has transitioned to a new enhanced platform, the Neuroscience Information Framework. Funded by the NIH Neuroscience BLueprint, the NIF is a dynamic portal providing access to neuroscience-relevant resources (data, tools, materials) from a single search interface. The NIF builds upon {{the foundation of the}} NDG, but provides a unique set of tools tailored especially for neuroscientists: a more expansive catalog, the ability to search multiple databases directly from the NIF home page, a custom web index of neuroscience resources, and a neuroscience-focused literature <b>search</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

500|$|Whenever {{a player}} {{correctly}} answers {{a question or}} solves a puzzle in a minigame, they gain [...] "mastery points" [...] on the word they successfully answered. The minigames can be increased in difficulty; on higher difficulty levels, players will acquire more mastery points when successfully completing a minigame. For instance, in Multiple Choice, the player has 50 seconds to select an answer for a question on the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty, and will receive two mastery points for each correct answer. On the [...] "Medium" [...] difficulty, the player has 40 seconds to select an answer and receives three mastery points for each correct answer. The process continues until the player scores fifteen mastery points for every word, allowing the player to proceed to the next lesson. Following the completion of all fifty lessons, the player can continue to learn new words through [...] "open lessons" [...] that contain ten new vocabulary words apiece; the dictionaries of both games each hold nearly 10,000 words. The player can freely access the reference section, which contains a dictionary and phrasebook, at any time. Both the dictionary and phrasebook hold all of the words and phrases in each game, as well as meanings and audio files for both; the player can look through different categories of words and phrases, use a <b>search</b> <b>function,</b> and bookmark chosen phrases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{rapid growth}} of on-line {{information}} including multimedia contents {{during the last decade}} caused a major problem for Web users- there is too much information available, most of it poorly organized and hard to find. To help a user to find proper information, web news <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> are devised and developed. Although those search engines provide some solutions, users still suffer from reading huge amounts of hyperlinks. Also, users of new media now have great expectations of what they can see on the Web. To provide better user satisfaction, we proposed a story model (story structures) that can be dynamically instantiated for different user requests from various multi-modal elements. The proposed story model defines four domain-independent story types. We compared traditional web news <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> and our story model by using usability test. The result shows that our multimedia presentation methodology is significantly better than the current <b>search</b> <b>functions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} four index {{structures}} for music data retrieval. Based on suffix trees, we develop two index structures called Combined Suffix Tree and Independent Suffix Trees. These methods still show shortcomings for some <b>search</b> <b>functions.</b> Hence we develop another index, called Twin Suffix Trees, {{to overcome these}} problems. However, the Twin Suffix Trees lack of scalability when the amount of music data becomes large. Therefore we propose the fourth index, called Grid-Twin Suffix Trees, to provide scalability and flexibility for {{a large amount of}} music data. For each index, we can use different <b>search</b> <b>functions,</b> like exact <b>search</b> and approximate search, on different music features, like melody, rhythm or both. We compare the performance of the different <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> applied on each index structure by a series of experiments.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate whether focal attention can be guided by {{an analysis of the}} emotional expression in a face. Participants searched displays of 7, 11, 15, and 19 schematic faces for the location of a unique face expressing either a positive or a negative emotion located among distractor faces expressing a neutral emotion. The slopes of the <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> for locating the negative face were shallower than the slopes of the <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> for locating the positive face (Experiments 1 A and 2 A). When the faces were inverted to reduce holistic face perception, the slopes of the <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> for locating positive and negative faces were not different (Experiments 1 B and 2 B). The results suggest that the emotional expression in a face can be perceived outside the focus of attention and can guide focal attention to the location of the face. A considerable amount of research has established that the visual system is highly efficient at perceiving both faces and facial expressions (e. g., Bruce, Desimone, &...|$|R
