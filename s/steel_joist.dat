25|$|On 18 February, Empire Duchess was in port at Ghent, Belgium {{when there}} was an {{explosion}} and fire in the No. 2 hold. This was caused by a <b>steel</b> <b>joist</b> striking a 25-pounder shell and detonating it whilst the ship was being unloaded. Her Captain, Lieutenant Walter Denton, was Mentioned in Despatches for his actions in fighting the fire and preventing a larger explosion without regard to his personal Safety. She arrived at Hull on 26 February, for repairs which were carried out at Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Empire Duchess departed from Hull on 13 March and resumed service between Southend and Antwerp. She arrived at Southend with Convoy ATM 155 on 16 May.|$|E

50|$|I-beams are {{commonly}} made of structural steel {{but may also}} be formed from aluminium or other materials. A common type of I-beam is the rolled <b>steel</b> <b>joist</b> (RSJ)—sometimes incorrectly rendered as reinforced <b>steel</b> <b>joist.</b> British and European standards also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, {{as opposed to the}} varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for tapering washers. UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.|$|E

40|$|Prefabricated modular housing {{structures}} {{have become}} a promising alternative to site-built structures with equal or higher engineering quality and durability. Major advantages of this technology are fast and cost-efficient construction, reduced labor requirements, and superior quality control due to factory production. The modular design of these prefabricated structures offers the opportunity for research and application of innovative composite materials and structural concepts. Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) in combination with light gage <b>steel</b> <b>joists</b> have been utilized {{in the development of}} modular wall and floor panels for prefabrication of housing structures. The need for steel reinforcement in conventional reinforced concrete thin shell construction creates a technological difficulty as the placement of the reinforcing steel is very labor intensive and proper positioning of the reinforcing mats is difficult. The use of fiber reinforced Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) helped eliminate these constraints and lead to more economical and structurally reliable floor and wall elements. The ECC/light gage steel floor panel is a novel precast, modular panel system consisting of an ECC slab and light gage <b>steel</b> <b>joists</b> integrally cast with the slab. The unique features of this panel system are: 1) Light weight due to reduced slab thickness and use of light gage <b>steel</b> <b>joists,</b> 2) Modularity and precast construction method of the system, 3) Reduced cost, 4) Applicability in steel and concrete frame systems, masonry and wood construction, 5) Fiber reinforcement eliminates the need for steel reinforcing bars or welded wire mesh, and 6) Highly effective crack control can be provided by the fiber reinforcement...|$|R

50|$|While OWSJs can {{be adapted}} to suit a wide variety of {{architectural}} applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilizing standard details, which may vary from one joist manufacturer to another. Some other shapes, in addition to the parallel top and bottom chord, are single slope, double slope, arch, gable and scissor configurations. These shapes may not be available from all joist manufactures, and are usually supplied at a premium cost that reflects the complexity required.The fabrication of OWSJ in North America is overseen by the <b>Steel</b> <b>Joist</b> Institute (SJI). The SJI has worked since 1928 to maintain sound engineering practice throughout the industry. As a non-profit organization of active manufactures, the Institute cooperates with governmental and business agencies to establish <b>steel</b> <b>joist</b> standards. Continuing research and updating are included in this work. Load tables and specifications are published by the SJI in five categories: K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series, CJ-Series, and Joist Girders.
