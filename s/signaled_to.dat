5|$|From the {{day that}} Speaker arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an {{important}} move without consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie year with the Indians. Speaker often <b>signaled</b> <b>to</b> Fohl when he thought that a pitcher should be brought in from the bullpen. One day, Fohl misread Speaker's signal and brought in a different pitcher than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker felt bad for contributing to Fohl's departure.|$|E
5|$|In week eight, the Triangles {{played against}} the Rock Island Independents. The Independents had six players {{returning}} from injuries this game. In the first quarter, Rube Ursella for the Independents fumbled a punt on the 40-yard line, and the Triangles gained possession. On that possession, Bacon scored a rushing touchdown. The Independents controlled the football {{for a majority}} of the second quarter. On their final possession of the half, they traveled to the Triangles' four-inch line, but the referee <b>signaled</b> <b>to</b> end the first half. In the fourth quarter, Ed Novack and Arnold Wyman for the Independents left the game due to injury. The Triangles scored two passing touchdowns in the final 10 minutes of the game; the first was caught by Dave Reese, and the second was caught by Roudebush.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this <b>signaled</b> <b>to</b> the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access to blacks. Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to the blacks in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the beating of}} signal and idler waves, which have imbalanced <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratios, in a phase-sensitive parametric amplifier. Imbalanced <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratios are achieved in two ways; first by imbalanced noise loading; second by varying idler <b>to</b> <b>signal</b> input power ratio. In the case of imbalanced noise loading the phase-sensitive amplifier improved the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio from 3 to 6 dB, {{and in the case}} of varying idler <b>to</b> <b>signal</b> input power ratio, the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio improved from 3 to in excess of 20 dB...|$|R

The inability of the messengers to reach communities outside Israel before mid-month High Holy Days (Succot and Passover) led outlying communities to celebrate scriptural festivals for two days rather than one, observing the second feast-day of the Jewish diaspora because of uncertainty of whether the previous month ended after 29 or 30 days.|$|E

50|$|The {{implication}} {{is that when the}} radar is noise limited the variation of <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio is an inverse fourth power.

She crossed the bar and anchored just inside. However, when the pursuers crossed the bar and anchored some 300 to 400 yards away, she surrendered.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the Ad-Hoc networks is highly impacted with the <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> Noise Ratio. The PSNR (Peak <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> Noise Ratio) is an important parameter {{for the evaluation of}} multimedia traffic in Ad-Hoc Networks. With the increase of bandwidth of the channels, it becomes necessary to take care of other network parameters like PSNR and ASNR (Average <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> Noise Ratio). Enhanced bandwidth with higher channel error rates demand a careful analysis of <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio for optimum performance.

40|$|We {{test the}} IDL package EZ_Ages for {{validity}} on spectra with low <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratios.

We run Monte Carlo simulations {{on the low}} <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio spectra to gain statistical uncertainties in age and [Fe/H]. A threshold <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio is found that yields uncertainties to within {{the limitations of the}} software.

40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an innovative,benchmarking tool based on genetic {{algorithm}} to evaluate robustness of visible and invisible watermarking techniques. Image fidelity metrics such as mean square error(MSE), <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(SNR),peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(PSNR), weighted peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(WPSNR) are being used. However, when large quantities of data are to be assessed, subjective metrics such as mean opinion score(MOS),signal <b>to</b> noise ratio(SNR),peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(PSNR) are not pragmatic since it needs experts and inordinate amount of time. PSNR and WPSNR are independent of human visual system(HVS) parameters and hence they are inappropriate scales to measure potential research results. This brings out a new image fidelity metric called Enhanced Weighted peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(EWPSNR) which is experimentally proven to be better than PSNR and WPSNR...|$|R

Knowing Stephens' reputation for being quite well armed, his Klan assassins had assembled between eight and twelve men who lay in wait in a darkened room on the Caswell County Courthouse's first floor.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fall}} of Troy, Helen's role is ambiguous. In Virgil's Aeneid, Deiphobus gives an account of Helen's treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was {{admitted}} into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she <b>signaled</b> <b>to</b> the Greeks from the city's central tower. In Odyssey, however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated {{the voices of the}} Greek women left behind at home—she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) with the memory of their loved ones, and brought them to the brink of destruction.* Hughes, Helen of Troy, 220; Suzuki, Metamorphoses of Helen, 99–100.|$|E

Moses thought that he could busy himself with the Torah — the whole of which is life — and then the sun would set and the decree for his death would lapse. God <b>signaled</b> <b>to</b> the sun, but the sun refused to obey God, saying that it would not set and leave Moses alive in the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The Ad-hoc {{wireless}} {{networks are}} assuming great importance {{because of the}} ease of operation and their operation without any infrastructure. On the other hand, {{it has its own}} characteristics like operation from low-capacity battery, frequent change of routing and connectivity etc [...] Bit Error Rate (BER) of any wireless data network is critically dependent on the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise and distortion(SINAD) ratio or <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(SNR) or <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> interference ratio(SIR) parameters of a receiver. The degradation in receiver performance can be made up theoretically by boosting the transmitter power level but the maximum power level is also highly regulated. Consequently, solution by reducing the interference is more relevant for Ad-hoc nodes.

After collecting Mixon's driver's license, Sergeant Dunakin became suspicious that the license was fake and <b>signaled</b> <b>to</b> his partner, Officer Hege, to arrest Mixon. Mixon accessed a semiautomatic pistol, leaned out of the vehicle's side window, and opened fire without warning, methodically shooting both officers twice. After the officers collapsed to the ground, {{he got out of}} the vehicle, approached them, and fired execution-style directly into their backs.
