5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in <b>soft</b> <b>substrates</b> such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which ECM elasticity induces lineage specification of stem cells has not been clearly understood. Integrins are well-documented mechanosensors that are positioned {{at the beginning of}} the sensing pathway. By using an antibody specifically recognizing the active conformation of β 1 integrin, we observed that β 1 integrin activation in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) was induced by <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> to a significantly greater degree than by stiff substrate. In contrast, however, the level of cell surface integrin on <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> was significantly lower than that on stiff <b>substrate.</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>substrate</b> markedly enhanced the internalization of integrin, and this internalization was mediated mainly through caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis. The inhibition of integrin internalization blocked the neural lineage specification of BMMSCs on <b>soft</b> <b>substrate.</b> Furthermore, <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> also repressed the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) /Smad pathway at least partially through integrin-regulated BMP receptor endocytosis. A theoretical analysis based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) data indicated that integrin–ligand complexes are more easily ruptured on soft substrate; this outcome may contribute to the enhancement of integrin internalization on <b>soft</b> <b>substrate.</b> Taken together, our results suggest that ECM elasticity affects integrin activity and trafficking to modulate integrin BMP receptor internalization, thus contributing to stem cell lineage specification...|$|R
40|$|B cells use B-cell receptors (BCRs) {{to sense}} antigens {{that are usually}} {{presented}} on substrates with different stiffness. However, {{it is not known}} how substrate stiffness affects B-cell proliferation, class switch, and in vivo antibody responses. We addressed these questions using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different stiffness (20 or 1100 kPa). Live cell imaging experiments suggested that antigens on stiffer substrates more efficiently trigger the synaptic accumulation of BCR and phospho-Syk molecules compared with antigens on <b>softer</b> <b>substrates.</b> In vitro expansion of mouse primary B cells shows different preferences for substrate stiffness when stimulated by different expansion stimuli. LPS equally drives B-cell proliferation on stiffer or <b>softer</b> <b>substrates.</b> Anti-CD 40 antibodies enhance B-cell proliferation on stiffer substrates, while antigens enhance B-cell proliferation on <b>softer</b> <b>substrates</b> through a mechanism involving the enhanced phosphorylation of PI 3 K, Akt, and FoxO 1. In vitro class switch differentiation of B cells prefers <b>softer</b> <b>substrates.</b> Lastly, NP 67 -Ficoll on <b>softer</b> <b>substrates</b> accounted for an enhanced antibody response in vivo. Thus, substrate stiffness regulates B-cell activation, proliferation, class switch, and T cell independent antibody responses in vivo, suggesting its broad application in manipulating the fate of B cells in vitro and in vivo...|$|R

25|$|This mussel is {{native to}} the Pacific Ocean from Siberia to Singapore, {{but it has also}} been accidentally {{introduced}} and become an invasive species in numerous other areas worldwide.

25|$|To {{move from}} place to place, the velvet worm crawls forward using its legs; unlike in arthropods, both legs of a pair are moved simultaneously. The claws of the feet are only used on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on <b>soft</b> <b>substrates,</b> such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot {{cushions}} {{at the base of}} the claws. The actual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. Macroperipatus can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second, although speeds of around 6 body-lengths per minute are more typical. The body gets longer and narrower as the animal picks up speed; the length of each leg also varies during each stride.|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> induced apoptosis in polarized cells, but not in transformed cells by disturbance of Ca 2 � homeostasis. This study aims to further investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying the disruption of Ca 2 �-signaling integrity in soft substrate–induced epithelial apoptosis. <b>Soft</b> <b>substrate</b> up-regulated the store-operated Ca 2 � (SOC) entry across the plasma membrane of normal cervical epithelial cells, which resulted in increased cytosolic Ca 2 � levels. Concomitantly, <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> induced the aggregation and translocation of stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM 1) toward the cell periphery to colocalize with Orai 1, an essential pore subunit of SOC channel, detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach and confocal image analyses. The disturbed Ca 2 � homeostasis resulted in the activation of �-calpain, which cleaved �-spectrin, induced actin disorganization, and caused apoptosis. In contrast, <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> did not disturb Ca 2 � homeostasis or induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Chelating extracellular Ca 2 � by EGTA and down-regulated SOC entry by small interfering RNA targeting STIM 1 or inhibitors targeting Ca 2 �-binding site of calpain significantly inhibited soft substrate–induced activation of �-calpain and epithelial cell apoptosis. Thus, <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> up-regulates the interaction of STIM 1 with SOC channels, which results in the activation of �-calpain and subsequently induces normal epithelial cell apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Controlled {{buckling}} enables stretchable characteristic for {{brittle materials}} by integrating stiff device films on a <b>soft</b> <b>substrate.</b> Being permeable to fluids, the <b>soft</b> <b>substrate,</b> however, cannot encapsulate the device {{well and the}} system is also hard to be integrated with liquid components. In addition, {{the strength of the}} device system with a <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> is unsatisfactory in many biomedical applications. By introducing a bilayer substrate, we are able to provide a robust, high strength system while maintaining the stretchable characteristic, with a soft layer on top of a relatively stiff layer in the substrate. Theoretical investigation shows the design requirement for each substrate layer and it can guide the experimental design for a device to be used in a target application...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurements}} of thin-film mechanical properties are generally {{influenced by the}} elastic and plastic responses of substrates and consequently may be inaccurate. Thus in this study, the effects of three different substrates, including sapphire, glass and polyimide, on the mechanical characterizations of aluminum-doped zinc oxide transparent conducting films are evaluated. From nanoindentation tests, {{it was found that}} a high film/substrate hardness ratio contributed an early-initiated substrate effect. For a hard film/soft substrate system (zinc oxide on polyimide), the measured hardness and elastic modulus markedly dropped at very small indentation depths due to the insufficient strength of the <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> to sustain the applied stress. A modification of the Bhattacharya model and the calibration of the King model were also made in this study; some important factors were established. Moreover, the interface adhesion energy between the film and <b>soft</b> <b>substrate,</b> measured by nanoscratch, was high because the compliant deformation of the <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> released accumulated stresses and then retarded interface delamination.

40|$|The {{topographical}} and hydrological {{complexity of}} submarine canyons, coupled with high substratum heterogeneity, make them ideal environments for cold-water coral (CWC) habitats. These habitats, including reefs, {{are thought to}} provide important functions for many organisms. The canyons incising the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay have distinct morphological differences from the north to the south. CWCs have been reported from this basin in the late 19 th century; however, {{little is known about}} their present-day distribution, diversity and environmental drivers in the canyons. In this study, the characteristics and distribution of CWC habitats in the submarine canyons of the Bay of Biscay are investigated. Twenty-four canyons and three locations between adjacent canyons were sampled using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) or a towed camera system. Acquired images were annotated for habitat type (using the CoralFISH classification system), substrate cover and coral identification. Furthermore, the influence of hydrological factors and geomorphology on the CWC distribution was investigated. Eleven coral habitats, formed by 62 morphotypes of scleractinians, gorgonians, antipatharians and seapens, inhabiting hard and/or <b>soft</b> <b>substrate,</b> were observed. The distribution patterns were heterogenous at regional and local scales; the south Bay of Biscay and the southeastern flank favored <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> habitats. Biogenic and hard substrate habitats supported higher coral diversities than <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> habitats and had similar species compositions. A higher coral species turnover characterized <b>soft</b> <b>substrate</b> habitats. Substrate type was the most important driver of the patterns in both distribution and composition. Observations of coral reefs on steeper areas in the canyons and coral rubble on flatter areas on the interfluve/upper slope, support the hypothesis that canyons serve as refuges, being less accessible to trawling, although natural causes may also contribute to the explanation of this distribution pattern.
