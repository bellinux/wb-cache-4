The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction. Many other plants are under construction or planned, mainly in Spain and the USA. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> and the 100 MW Andasol <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of the Shams <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> built in 2013 near Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, all other 100MW or larger CSP plants are either located in the United States or in Spain.|$|E
25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (150MW), the Andasol <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> (150MW), and Extresol <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (100MW).|$|E

25|$|As of June 2017, 31 solar PV {{projects}} {{with a combined}} generation capacity of around 2,593 MW were either under construction, constructed or due to start construction in 2017 having reached financial closure. Two recent projects which illustrate co-operation between industry and government are the <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> planned for north-western Victoria, {{and the development of}} new solar cells. Queensland Solar and Lighting is a major importer of Chinese and European solar products for the Brisbane region in Queensland, Australia.

500|$|Commercial concentrating {{solar power}} (CSP) plants, also called [...] "solar thermal power stations", were first {{developed}} in the 1980s. The 377MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world’s largest solar thermal power plant project. [...] Other large CSP plants include the Solnova <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (150MW), the Andasol <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> (150MW), and Extresol <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (150MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP {{is the ability to}} efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5hours of thermal storage.|$|E
500|$|In {{some cases}} several {{different}} solar power stations, with separate owners and contractors, are developed on adjacent sites. This can offer {{the advantage of}} the projects sharing the cost and risks of project infrastructure such as grid connections and planning approval. [...] Solar farms can also be co-located with wind farms. Sometimes the title 'solar park' is used, rather than an individual <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

[...] After the National Infrastructures Ministry announced it would expand its feed-in tariff scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations ranging from 50 kilowatts to 5 megawatts, Sunday Solar Energy {{announced that it would}} invest $133 million in photovoltaic solar arrays for installation on kibbutzim. [...] In December 2008, the Sunday company announced that Kibbutz Reim in the western Negev would be the first community in the world to rely entirely on solar energy. The Reim installation, costing NIS60-100 million, would generate at least 2.5 megawatts during peak consumption. [...] Excess energy would be sold to the Israel Electric Company.

2500|$|Solar Systems was {{a leader}} in high {{concentration}} solar photovoltaic applications, and the company built a photovoltaic Mildura Solar concentrator power station, Australia. This project will use innovative concentrator dish technology to power 45,000 homes, providing 270,000 MWh/year for A$420million. Solar Systems has already completed construction of three concentrator dish power stations in the Northern Territory, at Hermannsburg, Yuendumu, and Lajamanu, which together generate 1,555 MWh/year (260 homes, going by the energy/home ratio above). This represents a saving of 420,000litres of diesel fuel and 1550tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. The {{total cost of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was [...] "A$7M, offset {{by a grant from the}} Australian and Northern Territory Governments under their Renewable Remote Power Generation Program". The price of diesel in remote areas is high due to added transportation costs: in 2017, retail diesel prices in remote areas of the Northern Territory averaged $1.90 per litre. The 420,000 litres of diesel per year saved by these power stations in the first decade of operation would thus have cost approximately $8,000,000.|$|E
