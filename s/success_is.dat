5|$|Although he {{was also}} Prime Minister of Romania for three {{mandates}} (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political <b>success</b> <b>is</b> not as spectacular as the military one. Averescu ended up {{as one of the}} pawns maneuvered by Brătianu. Argetoianu later repeatedly expressed his distaste for Averescu's hesitant stance and openness to compromise.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{call for}} a shift in how {{economic}} <b>success</b> <b>is</b> measured. These changes include an increased focus on a policy's ability to bring society toward social justice and improve people's lives, through specific goals including distributive fairness, equity, the universal provisioning of needs, elimination of poverty, freedom from discrimination {{and the protection of}} human capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker Barry Levinson {{paid tribute}} to Sweet Smell of Success in his 1982 film Diner, with one {{character}} wandering around saying nothing but lines from the film. In an early scene from Levinson's 1988 movie, Rain Man, Sweet Smell of <b>Success</b> <b>is</b> seen playing on television.|$|E

30|$|Clutch size, {{hatching}} and emergence <b>successes</b> <b>were</b> determined {{following the}} methodology described by Miller (1999) using records from all beaches. We calculated {{the number of}} eggs laid per year, average of nests/year and average of nests/month. Hatching <b>success</b> <b>was</b> defined as “the proportion of hatchlings that hatched out of their shells respectively” (Miller 1999). Emergence <b>success</b> <b>was</b> defined as “the proportion of hatchlings that reached the beach surface” (Miller 1999). The formulas {{used to calculate the}} clutch size, hatching and emergence <b>successes</b> <b>were</b> described by Miller (1999).|$|R
30|$|This paper extends upon {{previous}} {{work with this}} data set in which the effect of participatory behaviors on <b>success</b> <b>was</b> investigated wherein <b>success</b> <b>was</b> measured singularly with expected course grade and affective components of <b>success</b> <b>were</b> not considered. The limited explanatory power of the model, coupled with the seemingly contradictory results, indicates that participatory behaviors alone might be insufficient to capture {{the complexity of the}} success response variable.|$|R
5|$|Sweet Smell of <b>Success</b> <b>is</b> a 1957 American {{film noir}} made by Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions and {{released}} by United Artists. It {{was directed by}} Alexander Mackendrick and stars Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison and Martin Milner. The screenplay was written by Clifford Odets, Ernest Lehman and Mackendrick from the novelette by Lehman. Mary Grant designed the film's costumes.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study by}} Forbes ranked the Sounders {{number one in}} the league in terms of annual {{revenues}} ($50million) and operating income ($10million). Consequently, the Sounders were also ranked as the most valuable franchise ($245million) in MLS– a 717% increase over the expansion fee it paid to join the league. The Sounders financial <b>success</b> <b>is</b> driven in large part by their high attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting <b>success</b> <b>is</b> low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E

30|$|Technical <b>success</b> <b>was</b> {{achieved}} in 27 / 30 patients, {{with an overall}} technical success rate of 90 %. Three patients (2 AVMs, 1 VAA) required re-intervention.

5|$|Eugene Harold Krabs is {{commonly}} known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The restaurant's <b>success</b> <b>is</b> built on little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab's signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, engaging in price gouging and charging his own employees for use of the building's services.|$|E
5|$|Lily van Java was {{released}} in 1928. Its <b>success</b> <b>is</b> disputed. The reporter Leopold Gan wrote that the film was highly successful, {{to the point that}} after several years copies were worn through from overplaying. However, Joshua Wong later recalled in an interview that the film had been a failure; David Wong is reported to have avowed to no longer fund any films after Lily van Java. Lacking a backer, the Wong Brothers went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} <b>success</b> <b>is</b> that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

5|$|One such <b>success</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study {{has shown that}} SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of <b>success)</b> <b>is</b> a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Argonauts {{currently}} {{lead the}} Canadian Football League in total wins and in winning percentage in the Grey Cup. Early {{success in the}} final can partly {{be attributed to the}} weakness of western teams: between 1921 and 1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances, including six straight against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The team's <b>success</b> <b>is</b> not merely an historical aberration, however: they have won six of their nine appearances since the formation of the CFL, including their last five straight.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the label's existence, a certain amount of {{commercial}} <b>success</b> <b>was</b> garnered from releases by such artists as David Kramer, Robin Auld and later the neo-traditional African band Amampondo. This <b>success</b> <b>was</b> partly due to the label's involvement in the live presentation of these artists.|$|R

5|$|The largest {{breeding}} {{populations are}} in Russia (up to 500,000pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines {{in much of}} the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding <b>success</b> <b>is</b> higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} than 1000 adult birds in Tasmania, where {{the species is}} listed as Vulnerable under Schedule 3.1 of the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. In Tasmania it is {{threatened}} by nest disturbance, loss of suitable nesting habitat, shooting, poisoning, trapping, and collision with power lines and wind turbines, as well as entanglement and environmental pollution. Estuaries are a favoured habitat, and these are often subject to environmental disturbance. white-bellied sea eagles have been observed to increase their hunting ranges to include salmon fish farms, but {{the effect of this}} on breeding <b>success</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} less {{critique}} of Bray’s musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, {{he points out that}} the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its <b>success</b> <b>is</b> derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.|$|E

5|$|Mating <b>success</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} {{on a variety of}} factors that range from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the-rock displayed sexual selection based off sequential comparisons or threshold standards. The hens engaged in a “pool–comparison” tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males. The females in the study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger, more centrally concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting <b>success</b> <b>is</b> associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive <b>success</b> <b>is</b> {{strongly}} {{affected by}} insects that infest the flower spikes and fruiting structures. Infestation {{of the flower}} spikes is not as severe as in other Banksia species: one study found less than 10% of B.telmatiaea inflorescences to be infested, compared to over 50% for B.attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.littoralis and B.menziesii (Menzies' Banksia), and over 90% for B.grandis (Bull Banksia). Also, whereas other species were attacked by a range of insects, the inflorescence of B.telmatiaea was attacked only by the tortrix moth Arotrophora arcuatalis (Banksia Boring Moth), which burrows into the woody axis, rendering the spike barren. On the other hand, the same study observed heavy infestation of fruiting structures, with over 90% of spikes with follicles found to contain at least one larva of an unidentified species of moth of the genus Xylorycta. These larvae burrow from follicle to follicle to eat the seed, resulting in 100% seed loss for infested spikes.|$|E
