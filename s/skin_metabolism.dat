40|$|Skin, {{being the}} largest {{organ of the}} body, {{represents}} an important route of exposure, {{not only for the}} abundance of chemicals present in the environment, but also for products designed for topical application such as drugs and personal care products. Determining whether such incidental or intentional exposure poses a risk to human health requires consideration of temporal concentration, both externally and internally, in addition to assessing the chemical’s intrinsic hazard. In order to elicit a toxic response in vivo the chemical must reach its site of action in sufficient concentration, as determined by its absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) profile. Whilst absorption and distribution into and through skin layers have been studied for decades, only more recently has <b>skin</b> <b>metabolism</b> become a subject of intense research, now recognised as playing a key role in both toxification and detoxification processes. The majority of information on metabolic processes, however, has generally been acquired via studies performed on the liver.

The strategies outlined demonstrate how an array of in silico tools may be used in concert to resolve a significant challenge in predicting toxicity following dermal exposure. The use of in vitro methods for determining <b>skin</b> <b>metabolism,</b> both to provide further experimental data for modelling and to verify predictions is also discussed.

40|$|The {{exposure}} of the skin to consumer products, drugs, and environmental chemicals can result in their penetrating the skin barrier and entering systemic circulation, potentially resulting in adverse effects in the skin and other organs. The assessment of dermal penetration and bioavailability (including penetration, metabolism, and entry into the systemic circulation) is therefore an important consideration in the risk assessment of chemicals. The skin is a heterogeneous organ with a multilayer structure. Based on its architecture and physiology, substances can penetrate through three major ways but can also be blocked in the different skin layers and in the skin appendages, which act as reservoir. In addition to that, as the skin is a metabolically competent organ, substances can undergo metabolism.

Activation of ATGL initiates the hydrolytic catabolism of cellular triacylglycerol (TG) stores to glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids.

Surgically removed skin from patients undergoing abdominoplasty was immediately dermatomed (800 μm) and mounted on flow-through diffusion cells (1. 77 cm(2)) operating at 32 °C with cell culture media (aqueous solution) as the reservoir liquid. The cells were dosed either with neat DEHP or emulsified in aqueous solution (166 μg/ml). Samples were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS. DEHP permeated human viable skin only as the metabolite MEHP (100 %) after 8 h of exposure. Human skin was able to further oxidize MEHP to 5 -oxo-MEHP. Neat DEHP applied to the skin hardly permeated skin while the aqueous solution readily permeated skin measured in both cases as concentration of MEHP in the receptor liquid. DEHP pass through human skin, detected as MEHP only when emulsified in aqueous solution, and to a far lesser degree when applied neat to the skin.

Results: We demonstrate that while sites with low differentiation represent sampling effects rather than balancing selection, sites showing extremely high population differentiation are enriched for positive selection events and that one half {{may be the result of}} classic selective sweeps.
