The paper not only synthesises existing European documentation, but also incorporates some of the key experiences of ICZM from the COREPOINT project and its partners.

These adjustments must still obey the double-entry rule: for example, the inventory account and asset account might be changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a <b>stocktake.</b> At the same time, the expense account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted by an equal and opposite amount. Other adjustments such as posting depreciation and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the adjusted trial balance. It is the accounts in this list, and their corresponding debit or credit balances, that are used to prepare the financial statements.|$|E

This six part series highlighted {{the findings of the}} diversity <b>stocktake</b> research report written by Mai Chen, constitutional law expert and the Chair of Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business. This <b>stocktake</b> is now publically available at [URL] providing policy recommendations and addressing the implications of the current and future projections of the New Zealand cultural and ethnic landscape. The term superdiversity was first introduced by sociologist Steven Vertovec in 2007, referring to population diversity that is much higher than anything previously experienced and according to Mai Chen, New Zealand is now the fourth most diverse country among OECD nations. By 2038, Statistics NZ estimates that 51 per cent of New Zealanders will be Asian, Maori and Pasifika. As I read through the Superdiversity Series and later the diversity <b>stocktake</b> report I began to think not only about the super diverse nature of English language learners, but also the super diverse nature of NZ's English language practitioners. What experiences, skills, and lessons can these practitioners contribute to discussions of the social, political, and economic implications of superdiversity in New Zealand? The influx of migrants from various areas will require more robust English learning and cultural support to tackle the needs of the steady stream of new comers. As such, my colleague Jono Ryan and I wanted to uncover the stories and lessons of English language practitioners from a range of multicultural backgrounds and share their experience of teaching English in New Zealand. In this article we profile eight teachers contributing to the field of ESOL in NZ, presenting - in their own words - insights from their many and varied teaching experiences...|$|E

40|$|Introduction In May, 2006, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Library {{submitted}} a project proposal titled 2 ̆ 2 Automation of the KNUST Library system toward effective {{science and technology}} research 2 ̆ 2 to the Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF) to solicit funding to undertake a library automation project. The idea to automate its services, resources and operations {{is part of the}} re-engineering processes by the KNUST Library to provide the platform to offer efficient and effective e-service to its ever growing users. In November, 2006, the project contract was awarded to Nala Consultancy Services for work to commence. Currently the automation process, according to the systems librarian, is about ninety percent complete. With the completion of the automation network it was imperative to feed it with the necessary data to make it operational. Starting from 11 th May, 2009 to August, 2009, the Library embarked on a seventy day massive exercise of stocktaking, relabeling, bar coding and accessioning of the library resources to generate the requisite data. Stocktaking or stock inventory is done for various reasons. According to New South Wales Department of Education and Training (2000) and Braxton (2004) stock is taken, among other reasons, to assess, control and evaluate the resources; track purchases, losses and disposals; to provide information on weaknesses in the collection that need redressing; measure the collection numbers, age and ratio: student; examine each resource and determine its future based on age, relevance, currency and condition, which may include repair, replacement, disposal or cleaning, to ensure that attractive, up-to-date resources are available to users; and prioritize future purchases and begin sourcing these. Reporting on the <b>stocktake</b> project of the Whitireia Community Polytechnic, New Zealand, Parker (2007) expounds on the aim, preparation and planning, method, results and problems of the project. She ends with a nine-point recommendation. The highlights of the project are that it was aimed at identifying the amount of loss since 2000 (the last <b>stocktake)</b> and to match shelves with the catalogue. <b>Stocktake</b> was done mainly electronically and during the quiet Christmas period.
