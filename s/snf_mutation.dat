Previous genetic evidence suggested that SNF 2 and SNF 5 have functionally related roles. We cloned both genes by complementation and showed that the cloned DNA was tightly linked to the corresponding chromosomal locus. Both genes in multiple copy complemented only the cognate <b>snf</b> <b>mutation.</b> The SNF 2 gene encodes a 5. 7 -kilobase RNA, and the SNF 5 gene encodes a 3 -kilobase RNA. Both RNAs contained poly(A) and were present in low abundance. Neither was regulated by glucose repression, {{and the level of}} SNF 2 RNA was not dependent on SNF 5 function or vice versa. Disruption of either gene at its chromosomal locus still allowed low-level derepression of secreted invertase activity, suggesting that these genes {{are required for}} high-level expression but are not directly involved in regulation. Further evidence was the finding that snf 2 and snf 5 mutants failed to derepress acid phosphatase, which is not regulated by glucose repression. The SNF 2 and SNF 5 functions were required for derepression of SUC 2 mRNA...|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila snf gene is a {{positive}} regulator of the sex determination gene Sex-lethal in both the germline and the soma. Its role in the soma is only evident when the probability of Sex-lethal activation has been reduced. For instance, in an otherwise wild-type background, females homozygous for a weak <b>snf</b> <b>mutation</b> produce {{both male and female}} progeny; however, when mated to males hemizygous for a null allele of Sex-lethal, they produce only male progeny. We demonstrate that the lack of female progeny is due to aberrant Sex-lethal regulation in late embryogenesis. In these mutant embryos, there is little accumulation of the late female-specific spliced RNAs and proteins. In contrast, in early embryogenesis, Sex-lethal regulation is not affected. The accumulation of both the early Sex-lethal transcripts and proteins is normal. These results suggest that the wild-type product of snf {{plays an important role in}} establishing the female-specific RNA splicing pattern of Sex-lethal. Whether snf influences the female-specific splice site choice directly or indirectly remains to be determined.

40|$|In Drosophila, the spliceosomal protein SNF {{fulfills}} {{the functions}} of two vertebrate proteins, U 1 snRNP-UlA and U 2 snRNP-U 2 B". The structure and sequence of SNF, U 1 A, and U 2 B" are nearly identical with two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) separated by a short linker region, yet they have different RNA-binding properties: U 1 A binds U 1 snRNA, U 2 B" binds U 2 snRNA, and SNF binds both snRNAs. Structure/function studies on the human proteins have identified motifs in the N-terminal RRM that are critical for RNA-binding specificity but have failed to identify a function for the C-terminal RRM. Interestingly, SNF is chimeric in these motifs, suggesting a basis for its dual specificity. Here, we test {{the importance of these}} motifs by introducing site-directed mutations in the snf coding region and examining the effects of these mutations on assembly into the snRNP and on snf function in vivo. We found that an N-terminal RRM mutant protein predicted to eliminate RNA binding still assembles into snRNPs and is capable of rescuing snf's lethal phenotype only if the normally dispensable C-terminal RRM is present. We also found that the mixed motif in the "RNA-specificity" domain is necessary for SNF's dual function whereas the mixed motif in the U 2 A'-protein-binding region is not. Finally, we demonstrate that animals carrying a <b>snf</b> <b>mutation</b> that converts SNF from a bifunctional protein to a U 1 snRNP-specific protein are viable. This unexpected result suggests that SNF's presence within the U 2 snRNP is not essential for splicing...|$|E
40|$|We have {{selected}} 210 mutants {{able to grow}} on sucrose {{in the presence of}} 2 -deoxyglucose. We identified recessive mutations in three major complementation groups that cause constitutive (glucose-insensitive) secreted invertase synthesis. Two groups comprise alleles of the previously identified HXK 2 and REG 1 genes, and the third group was designated cid 1 (constitutive invertase derepression). The effect of cid 1 on SUC 2 expression is mediated by the SUC 2 upstream regulatory region, as judged by the constitutive expression of a SUC 2 -LEU 2 -lacZ fusion in which the LEU 2 promoter is under control of SUC 2 upstream sequences. A cid 1 mutation also causes glucose-insensitive expression of maltase. The previously isolated constitutive mutation ssn 6 is epistatic to cid 1, reg 1 and hxk 2 for very high level constitutive invertase expression. <b>Mutations</b> in <b>SNF</b> genes that prevent derepression of invertase are epistatic to cid 1, reg 1 and hxk 2; we have previously shown that ssn 6 has different epistasis relationships with <b>snf</b> <b>mutations.</b> The constitutive mutation tup 1 was found to resemble ssn 6 in its genetic interactions with <b>snf</b> <b>mutations.</b> These findings suggest that CID 1, REG 1 and HXK 2 are functionally distinct from SSN 6 and TUP 1...|$|R

Disruption of the chromosomal locus causes a fewfold decrease in invertase derepression, a growth defect on raffinose, temperature-sensitive growth on glucose, and a sporulation defect in homozygous diploids.

40|$|Our {{analysis}} {{demonstrates that}} snf {{is a positive}} regulator of Sex-lethal in both the germline and the soma. In the germline, unregulated expression of Sex-lethal can bypass the requirement for snf(+) gene function, implying that snf is required for Sex-lethal activity in the germline. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} finding that the Sex-lethal transcription pattern is abnormal in a snf mutant background. In the soma, activation of Sex-lethal appears to be sensitive to snf gene dosage only when the probability of Sex-lethal activation has been otherwise reduced. We also show that the activity of one of the constitutive Sex-lethal alleles (Sxl(M 1)) is sensitive to snf gene dosage, demonstrating that, in spite of its constitutive behavior in some assays, Sxl(M 1) is still subject to some regulation. In spite of snf's role in the somatic activation of Sex-lethal, no lethal alleles of snf were isolated in a screen of ~ 25, 000 chromosomes. The observation that the existing <b>snf</b> <b>mutations</b> present a lethal phenotype only in certain genetic backgrounds suggests that snf is required, but is not essential, for the activation of Sex-lethal in the soma.

Snf 1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of AMPâ€“activated protein kinase (AMPK), plays {{a crucial role}} in the response to various environmental stresses. However, the role of Snf 1 in ER stress response remains poorly understood. In this study, we charac-terize Snf 1 as a negative regulator of Hog 1 MAPK in ER stress response. The snf 1 mutant cells showed the ER stress resistant phenotype. In contrast, Snf 1 -hyperactivated cells were sensitive to ER stress. Activated Hog 1 levels were increased by <b>snf</b> 1 <b>mutation,</b> although <b>Snf</b> 1 hyperactivation interfered with Hog 1 activation. Ssk 1, a specific activator of MAPKKK functioning upstream of Hog 1, was induced by ER stress, and its induction was inhibited in a manner dependent on Snf 1 activity. Furthermore, we show that the SSK 1 promoter is important not only for Snf 1 -modulated regulation of Ssk 1 expression, but also for Ssk 1 func-tion in conferring ER stress tolerance. Our data suggest that Snf 1 downregulates ER stress response signal mediated by Hog 1 through negatively regulating expression of its specific activator Ssk 1 at the transcriptional level.

To identify factors that regulate TBP, we selected for suppressors of a TBP mutant that exhibits promoter-specific defects in activated transcription in vivo and severely reduced affinity for TATA boxes in vitro. Dominant <b>mutations</b> in <b>SNF</b> 4 and recessive mutations in REG 1, OPI 1, and RTF 2 were isolated that specifically suppress the inositol auxotrophy of the TBP mutant strains. OPI 1 encodes a repressor of INO 1 transcription. REG 1 and SNF 4 encode regulators of the Glc 7 phosphatase and Snf 1 kinase, respectively, and have well-studied roles in glucose repression. In two-hybrid assays, one <b>SNF</b> 4 <b>mutation</b> enhances {{the interaction between}} Snf 4 and Snf 1. Suppression of the TBP mutant by our reg 1 and <b>SNF</b> 4 <b>mutations</b> appears unrelated to glucose repression, since these mutations do not alleviate repression of SUC 2, and glucose levels have little effect on INO 1 transcription. Moreover, mutations in TUP 1, SSN 6, and GLC 7, but not HXK 2 and MIG 1, can cause suppression.

For {{the main}} ESCRT-III subunit Snf 7, an additional role in {{activation of the}} transcription factor Rim 101 ("Rim pathway") is now firmly established. Here, we investigate how the two Snf 7 functions are related to each other. By generating <b>SNF</b> 7 <b>mutations</b> that severely affect endocytic trafficking, but leave the Rim pathway function intact, we show that the two functions of SNF 7 can be separated genetically. We analyzed in detail, how the <b>SNF</b> 7 <b>mutations</b> affect the interaction of Snf 7 with its various binding partners. While interactions with Rim-related functions (Rim 13, Rim 20) were not altered by the mutations, {{there was a strong}} effect on interactions with components of the ESCRT pathway. The interaction with the ESCRT-III subunits Vps 20 and Vps 24 was strongly increased by the mutations, while the interaction with functions acting downstream of ESCRT-III (Vps 4 and Bro 1) was reduced. Since Vps 4 is required for disassembly of ESCRT-III, these data suggest that ESCRT-III is more stable in our SNF 7 mutants. In line with this notion, a higher fraction of mutant Snf 7 was detected at the membrane. Upon shift to alkaline pH, a stronger binding signal for virtually all interaction partners (except for Vps 4) was observed. This indicates that the ESCRT network at the endosomal membrane is more extensive under these conditions...|$|R

We show that oligonucleotides containing sequences from two regions of URS(G) confer glucose repression upon a heterologous promoter. Repression caused by URS(G) is dependent on trans-acting factors of the glucose repression pathway and is independent of orientation or location within a promoter, suggesting that URS(G) contains binding sites for a glucose-activated repressor protein(s). Genetic analysis identified three apparently novel genes (URR 1, URR 3 and URR 4) that are specifically required for URS(G) -mediated repression and may encode such repressor proteins.

40|$|Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with {{defects in}} sucrose or {{raffinose}} fermentation were isolated. In addition to mutations in the SUC 2 structural gene for invertase, we recovered 18 recessive mutations that affected {{the regulation of}} invertase synthesis by glucose repression. These mutations included five new snf 1 (sucrose nonfermenting) alleles and also defined five new complementation groups, designated snf 2, snf 3, snf 4, snf 5 and snf 6. The snf 2, snf 4 and snf 5 mutants produced little or no secreted invertase under derepressing conditions and were pleiotropically defective in galactose and glycerol utilization, which are both regulated by glucose repression. The snf 6 mutant produced low levels of secreted invertase under derepressing conditions, and no pleiotropy was detected. The snf 3 mutants derepressed secreted invertase to 10 â€“ 35 % the wild-type level but grew less well on sucrose than expected from their invertase activity; in addition, snf 3 mutants synthesized some invertase under glucose-repressing conditions. â€”We examined the interactions between the different <b>snf</b> <b>mutations</b> and ssn 6, a mutation causing constitutive (glucose-insensitive) high-level invertase synthesis that was previously isolated as a suppressor of snf 1. The ssn 6 mutation completely suppressed the defects in derepression of invertase conferred by snf 1, snf 3, snf 4 and snf 6, and each double mutant showed the constitutivity for invertase typical of ssn 6 single mutants. In contrast, snf 2 ssn 6 and snf 5 ssn 6 strains produced only moderate levels of invertase under derepressing conditions and very low levels under repressing conditions. These findings suggest roles for the SNF 1 through SNF 6 and SSN 6 genes in the regulation of SUC 2 gene expression by glucose repression...|$|R

Nine complementation groups were identified, falling into two broad groups: those unable to significantly derepress high-affinity (low-Km) glucose uptake (lgn 1, lgn 4, lgn 5, lgn 7, and lgn 8), {{and those with}} elevated repressed levels of high-affinity uptake that either derepress to normal or near normal levels of high-affinity uptake with loss of low-affinity transport (lgn 2 and lgn 3) or derepress only slightly, appearing to have an intermediate yet constitutive level of high-affinity transport (lgn 6 and lgn 9). Further analysis of the lgn mutations revealed pleiotropic phenotypes most consistent with the true defect being in regulation or expression of glucose repression and derepression. The kinetics of glucose uptake in strains carrying known mutations preventing derepression of glucose-repressible functions (snf 1, snf 2, snf 4, and snf 6) demonstrated that three of these <b>mutations</b> (<b>snf</b> 1, snf 4, and snf 6) were similarly defective in derepression of high-affinity glucose uptake. The snf 2 and <b>snf</b> 5 <b>mutations</b> had no apparent effect on glucose uptake. Two mutations resulting in constitutive expression of glucose-repressible functions, cid 1 and reg 1, resulted in constitutive expression of high-affinity glucose uptake. These data support the conclusion that high-affinity glucose uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is under general glucose repression control. The implications of other properties of these mutants are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Utilization of sucrose as {{a source}} of carbon and energy in yeast (Saccharomyces) is {{controlled}} by the classical SUC genes, which confer the ability to produce the sucrose-degrading enzyme invertase (Mortimer and Hawthorne 1969). Mutants of S. cerevisiae strain S 288 C (SUC 2 +) unable to grow anaerobically on sucrose, but still able to use glucose, were isolated. Two major complementation groups were identified: twenty-four recessive mutations at the SUC 2 locus (suc 2 -); and five recessive mutations defining a new locus, SNF 1 (for sucrose nonfermenting), essential for sucrose utilization. Two minor complementation groups, each comprising a single member with a leaky sucrose-nonfermenting phenotype, were also identified. The suc 2 mutations isolated include four suppressible amber mutations and five mutations apparently exhibiting intragenic complementation; complementation analysis and mitotic mapping studies indicated that all of the suc 2 mutations are alleles of a single gene. These results suggest that SUC 2 encodes a protein, probably a dimer or multimer. No invertase activity was detected in suc 2 mutants. â€”The SNF 1 locus is not tightly linked to SUC 2. The <b>snf</b> 1 <b>mutations</b> were found to be pleiotropic, preventing sucrose utilization by SUC 2 + and SUC 7 + strains, and also preventing utilization of galactose, maltose and several nonfermentable carbon sources. Although snf 1 mutants thus display a petite phenotype, classic petite mutations do not interfere with utilization of sucrose, galactose or maltose. A common feature of all the carbon utilization systems affected by SNF 1 is that all are regulated by glucose repression. The snf 1 mutants were found to produce the constitutive nonglycosylated form of invertase, but failed to produce the glucose-repressible, glycosylated, secreted invertase. This failure cannot be attributed to a general defect in production of glycosylated and secreted proteins because synthesis of acid phosphatase, a glycosylated secreted protein not subject to glucose repression, was not affected by <b>snf</b> 1 <b>mutations.</b> These findings suggest that the SNF 1 locus is involved in the regulation of gene expression by glucose repression...|$|R

Strains carrying a <b>snf</b> 1 <b>mutation</b> are unable to grow on sucrose, galactose, maltose, melibiose, or nonfermentable carbon sources; utilization of these carbon sources is regulated by glucose repression. The inability of snf 1 mutants to utilize sucrose results from failure to derepress expression of the structural gene for invertase at the RNA level. We isolated recombinant plasmids carrying the SNF 1 gene by complementation of the snf 1 defect in S. cerevisiae. A 3. 5 -kilobase region is common to the DNA segments cloned in five different plasmids. Transformation of S. cerevisiae with an integrating vector carrying {{a segment of the}} cloned DNA resulted in integration of the plasmid at the SNF 1 locus. This result indicates that the cloned DNA is homologous to sequences at the SNF 1 locus. By mapping a plasmid marker linked to SNF 1 in this transformant, we showed that the SNF 1 gene is located on chromosome IV.

Multicopy HXT 4 increases both high and low affinity glucose transport in snf 3 strains and increases low and high affinity transport in wild-type strains. Characterization of HXT 4 led {{to the discovery of}} a new class of multicopy suppressors of glucose transport defects: regulatory elements in the promoters of the HXT genes. We have designated these sequences DDSEs (DNA sequence dependent suppressing element). Multicopy HXT 4 and DDSEs in the HXT 1 HXT 2, HXT 3 and HXT 4 promoters were found to restore growth to snf 3 and grr 1 strains on low glucose media. The DDSE in the HXT 4 promoter was refined to a 340 -bp sequence 450 bp upstream of the HXT 4 translational start. This region was found to contain an 183 -amino acid open reading frame. Extensive analysis indicates that the DNA sequence itself and not the encoded protein is responsible for suppression. The promoters of SNF 3 and of other glycolytic genes examined did not suppress snf 3 in multicopy. Suppression of snf 3 by DDSE is dependent on the presence of either HXT 2 or HXT 3...|$|R

We have reported the isolation of a cloned gene that complements the snf 1 defect in S. cerevisiae and that is homologous to DNA at the SNF 1 locus (J. L. Celenza and M. Carlson, Mol. Cell.

In this work we identified a 2. 4 -kilobase polyadenylate-containing RNA encoded by the SNF 1 gene and showed that its level is neither regulated by glucose repression nor dependent on a functional SNF 1 product. The position of the SNF 1 RNA relative to the cloned DNA was mapped, and the direction of transcription was determined. The cloned DNA was used to disrupt the SNF 1 gene at its chromosomal locus.

Genetic characterization of these revertants showed that the suppressor mutations were all recessive and defined eight complementation groups, designated ssn 1 through ssn 8 (suppressor of snf 1).

So far, no complete Swi/Snf-type complex has been characterized in plants. Arabidopsis contains a single SNF 5 -type gene, BSH, which has been shown to complement the yeast <b>snf</b> 5 <b>mutation.</b> Here we describe the characterization of AtSWI 3 B, the smallest of the four Arabidopsis homologs of SWI 3.

When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cDNA encoding AtSWI 3 B partially complements the swi 3 mutant phenotype. However, like BSH, AtSWI 3 B is unable to activate transcription in yeast when tethered to DNA. The analysis by yeast two-hybrid indicates that AtSWI 3 B is capable of forming homodimers and interacts with BSH as well as with two other members of the Arabidopsis SWI 3 family: AtSWI 3 A and AtSWI 3 C. The results of phage display screen using recombinant protein, confirmed by direct yeast two-hybrid analyses, indicate that AtSWI 3 B interacts with FCA, a regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis.

Reg 2 p interacts with Glc 7 p in vivo, and epitope-tagged derivatives of Reg 2 p and Glc 7 p coimmunoprecipitate from cell extracts. The predicted protein product of the REG 2 gene is similar to Reg 1 p, a protein believed to direct PP 1 activity in the glucose repression pathway. Mutants with a deletion of reg 1 display a mild slow-growth defect, while reg 2 mutants exhibit a wild-type phenotype. However, mutants with deletions of both reg 1 and reg 2 exhibit a severe growth defect. Overexpression of REG 2 complements the slow-growth defect of a reg 1 mutant but does not complement defects in glycogen accumulation or glucose repression, two traits also associated with a reg 1 deletion. These results indicate that REG 1 has a unique role in the glucose repression pathway but acts together with REG 2 to regulate some as yet uncharacterized function important for growth.

Glucose repression acts at three levels to reduce GAL 1 expression: (i) {{it reduces the}} level of functional inducer in the cell; (ii) it lowers cellular levels of Gal 4 p by repressing GAL 4 transcription; and (iii) it inhibits Gal 4 p function through a repression element in the GAL 1 promoter. We quantified the amount of repression provided by each mechanism by assaying strains with none, one, two, or {{all three of the}} repression mechanisms intact. In a strain lacking all three repression mechanisms, there was almost no glucose repression of GAL 1 expression, suggesting that these are the major, possibly the only, mechanisms of glucose repression acting upon the GAL genes. The mechanism of repression that acts to reduce Gal 4 p levels in the cell is established slowly (hours after glucose addition), probably because Gal 4 p is stable. By contrast, the repression acting through the upstream repression sequence element in the GAL 1 promoter is established rapidly (within minutes of glucose addition). Thus, these three mechanisms of repression collaborate to repress GAL 1 expression rapidly and stringently. The Mig 1 p repressor is responsible for most (possibly all) of these repression mechanisms. We show that for GAL 1 expression, mig 1 mutations are epistatic to <b>snf</b> 1 <b>mutations,</b> indicating that Mig 1 p acts after the Snf 1 p protein kinase in the glucose repression pathway, which suggests that Snf 1 p is an inhibitor of Mig 1 p...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{positional cloning}} of genes carried on yeast artificial chromosomes that span a human translocation breakpoint {{associated with a}} human disease and isolated by chance human and bovine genes with strong homology to the S. cerevisiae genes, SNF 2 /SWI 2 and STH 1, and the D. melanogaster gene brahma. We report here sequence analysis, expression data, and functional studies for this human SNF 2 -like gene (hSNF 2 L) and its bovine homolog (bovSNF 2 L). Despite strong homology at the amino acid level, hSNF 2 L is not capable of complementing the yeast <b>mutations</b> <b>snf</b> 2 or sth 1 in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, in contrast to SNF 2 itself, a fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of LexA and hSNF 2 L did not transactivate a reporter gene downstream of LexA binding sites in a yeast expression system. The strong similarity between hSNF 2 L and these yeast and drosophila genes suggest that the mammalian genes {{are part of an}} evolutionarily conserved family that has been implicated as global activators of transcription in yeast and fruitflies but whose function in mammals remains unknown...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia has {{critical}} {{effects on}} the physiology of organisms. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycolytic enzymes, including enolase (Eno 2 p), formed cellular foci under hypoxia. Here, we investigated the regulation and biological functions of these foci. Focus formation by Eno 2 p was inhibited temperature independently {{by the addition of}} cycloheximide or rapamycin or by the single substitution of alanine for the Val 22 residue. Using mitochondrial inhibitors and an antioxidant, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was shown to participate in focus formation. Focus formation was also inhibited temperature dependently by an <b>SNF</b> 1 knockout <b>mutation.</b> Interestingly, the foci were observed in the cell even after reoxygenation. The meta-bolic turnover analysis revealed that [U- 13 C]glucose conversion to pyruvate and oxaloacetate was accelerated in focus-forming cells. These results suggest that under hypoxia, S. cerevisiae cells sense mitochondrial ROS and, by the involvement of SNF 1 / AMPK, spatially reorganize metabolic enzymes in the cytosol via de novo protein synthesis, which subsequently increases car-bonmetabolism. The mechanismmay be important for yeast cells under hypoxia, to quickly provide both energy and substrates for the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins independently of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and also to fit changing environments. Hypoxia is a condition of inadequate oxygen supply. Manystudies define hypoxia at 2 mg/liter dissolved oxygen (DO) in awater environment (1, 2). Inmammalian culture cells, 1 %and 21 % atmospheric oxygen are considered to be hypoxia and nor...|$|R

40|$|The SNF 1 {{protein kinase}} is {{required}} for expression of glucose-repressed genes in response to glucose deprivation. The SNF 4 protein is physically associated with SNF 1 and positively affects the kinase activity. We report here the characterization of a dominant <b>mutation,</b> <b>SNF</b> 1 -G 53 R, that was isolated as a suppressor of the requirement for SNF 4. The mutant SNF 1 -G 53 R protein is still responsive to SNF 4 but has greatly elevated kinase activity in immune complex assays; in contrast, the activity is wild type in a protein blot assay. Deletion of the region N-terminal to the kinase domain (codons 5 - 52) reduces kinase activity in vitro, but the mutant SNF 1 -Î”N kinase is still dependent on SNF 4. The N terminus is not required for the regulatory response to glucose. In gel filtration chromatography, the SNF 1, SNF 1 -G 53 R and SNF 1 -Î”N proteins showed different elution profiles, consistent with differential formation of high molecular weight complexes. Taken together, {{the results suggest that}} the N terminus positively affects the function of the SNF 1 kinase and may be involved in interaction with a positive effector other than SNF 4. We also showed that the conserved threonine residue 210 in subdomain VIII, which is a phosphorylation site in other kinases, is essential for SNF 1 activity. Finally, we present evidence that when the C terminus is deleted, overexpression of the SNF 1 kinase domain is deleterious to the cell...|$|R
