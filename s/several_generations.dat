5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E

This is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene, which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.|$|E

To reach this aim, a hybrid system including several types of non-dispatchable generation, dispatchable generation resources incorporated with energy storage assets can provide a sustainable necessary electricity/thermal/water pumping power during a green building’s daily operation. The objective {{of this paper is}} to model a dynamic system for a single green building considering <b>several</b> <b>generation</b> resources for feeding of some electrical and thermal specific load demands needed in a sustainable way. The proposed model based on a dynamic decision process is implemented to manage and monitor a complex hybrid system encompassing <b>several</b> <b>generation</b> resources and load demands by considering various uncertainties. In order to handle the uncertainties, scenario generation approach is utilized. The model is developed in The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment in order to determine the optimal solution with scheduling resources by setting up the optimal power set-points for them. The optimization model is applied to a case study where the produced power is also used to supply water pumping for domestic consumption. Furthermore, other capabilities such as extendibility, reliability, and flexibility are examined about the proposed approach...|$|R
