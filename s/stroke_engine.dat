25|$|In {{an article}} in Motor Cycle {{magazine}} in 1914, Alfred Scott wrote that {{he was drawn to}} the two-stroke engine because he was trained on high speed steam and marine engines, and when turning his attention to gas and petrol engines the regular power strokes of the two-stroke (or Day cycle as he sometimes called it), seemed preferable to the one power stroke in four of the Otto cycle. He said this attraction to the two stroke was further enhanced by the reliable and excellent service from a two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> designed by his brother (A. F. Scott M.I.M.E) and used to drive machinery in his experimental workshop.|$|E
25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885, Karl Benz {{developed}} a petrol or gasoline powered automobile. This is also {{considered to be}} the first [...] "production" [...] vehicle as Benz made several other identical copies. The automobile was powered by a single cylinder two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Unlike races {{such as the}} TT Formulae, or Moto-Cross, {{where two}} and four strokes had {{different}} engine size limits in the same class, until 2002 GP racing set the upper limit the same for both types of engines in all its classes. After that, MotoGP gave the four-strokes a 490cc advantage over the two-strokes. A 2 <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> produces power with every rotation of the crank, where as the 4 <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> produces power every second rotation. In theory, a 500cc 2stroke produces the same power as a 1000cc 4 stroke, however there are many {{differences between the two}} configurations. Carburation vs fuel injection, engine mapping, power/torque curves, and throttle response are a few major differences.|$|E

50|$|Midi motos, {{also called}} super pocket bikes, {{are similar to}} pocket bikes, but {{slightly}} larger. They are still smaller than the street bikes they mimic, but the seat height is about a foot to two feet higher than a mini moto's seat height. They started off with 47cc 2 <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> (capable of around 48-64 km/h/30-40 mph) in the midi motos and then included 110cc 4 <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> (capable of around 86-105 km/h/55-65 mph). Most midi bikes are made in China and usually equipped with a Honda engine or copy of a Honda engine.|$|R

The multi-cylinder models can become enormous, such as the Saito five cylinder radial.

The company fared better making two-stroke engines for fishing boats. In 1911 the firm collapsed and Ralph departed for India. Ricardo continued to design engines for small electric lighting sets; these were produced by two companies until 1914.|$|E

40|$|A very {{stringent}} {{problem in}} most of European cities is the individual mobility. This problem is mainly caused by traffic jam and arising from this are two particularly interesting environmental issues: pollution and noise [1]. Use of two wheeler vehicles does not represent the final solution to these problems, nevertheless they can supply a useful aid to ease them. Recently, two <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> are being replaced with four <b>stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> For small capacity engines this means a true reduction in exhaust emissions, especially unburned hydrocarbons (HC), but, {{on the other hand}} it involves a performance reduction, particularly for sudden accelerations, which constitute an essential requirement for these vehicles [2, 3, 4, 5]. Hybridisation can help to fill the gap between two <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> and cleaner, but less performing four <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> [6]. At the same time, it can help to lower fuel consumption, by means of a reduction in the revolution speed [2, 5]. This paper presents a study on a parallel hybrid scooter prototype {{from the point of view}} of a better matching between the characteristics of the internal four <b>stroke</b> combustion <b>engine</b> and of the electric motor. Wave fluid-dynamic 1 D code was used in order to create a model of the internal combustion engine. The model validation was carried out by the comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data obtained with the roller test bench. Then, some modifications were analysed in order to optimise the behaviour of the engine at a lower revolution speed of the engine, thus diminishing the specific fuel consumption of the vehicle. Finally, such modifications were introduced in a Simulink (Matlab) model to evaluate their influence on the behaviour of the whole hybrid vehicle when running on different road cycle tests...|$|R
