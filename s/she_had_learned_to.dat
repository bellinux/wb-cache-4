5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned.</b> <b>To</b> get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E

After their ranch was foreclosed on, the family relocated to {{the small town of}} Kooskia, Idaho, where Lena spent her early years. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> sing {{by the time she was}} three years old by impersonating her brothers, which accounts for her later ability to master deeper registers in her vocal range.|$|E

"Moreover, because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love you, white thief, {{wanderer}} {{without a}} kraal as you are, at your bidding <b>she</b> <b>has</b> also <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> hate me. Beware, White Man, I am of this people, {{and you know}} their temper, it is not gentle; when they hate they find a means to be revenged," [...] and she ceased, gasping with rage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A foolish baggage! A silly little romantic baggage! She's {{been reading}} novels till <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> think <b>she</b> couldn't settle down quietly till <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{run off with}} somebody.' ...|$|R
500|$|Hügel-Marshall became {{active in}} the women's rights {{movement}} while in Frankfurt. But even among her feminist activist colleagues she felt isolated, {{because she was the}} only black woman there. She had never met another black German, and from her years in the children's home <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> think of blacks (including herself) as inferior and immoral. Years later she commented that [...] "the most disastrous thing I learned at the home was self-hatred." [...] In 1986, she attended a meeting of Afro-Germans; she was 39 years old {{and it was the first}} time she had ever seen [...] "a black face that wasn't my own." [...] She was empowered by the sense of community and became an activist for Afro-Germans, studying their history and asserting their legitimacy in a society that still assumed that all Germans must be white.|$|E
500|$|Sue Brown was {{selected}} to cox the Oxford boat, {{and became the first}} female competitor {{in the history of the}} Boat Race. Although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> cox at Wadham, she had already been selected to represent Great Britain in the Women's coxed fours at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. [...] She had impressed Oxford coach Dan Topolski who chose her for the Dark Blues. [...] Her selection caused a furore; [...] according to Dodd, [...] "Sue Brown must have passed before more shutters than anyone except for Lady Diana Spencer". [...] She was advised by Colin Moynihan who had coxed Oxford to their largest victory of the century in the 1977 race. Boris Rankov was making his fourth appearance, but this time as a junior fellow of St Hugh's, rather than as an undergraduate at Corpus Christi. [...] In doing so, he became the first representative of a women's college in the men's Boat Race.|$|E
2500|$|Disliking the {{attention}} she was attracting, Bernadette {{went to the}} hospice school run by the Sisters of Charity of Nevers where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a postulant and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at Nevers. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister Marie Therese Vauzou. The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde in honor of her godmother who was named [...] "Bernarde".|$|E
50|$|In the end, {{it matters}} not that Lino finds {{his wife for}} he has found himself. And alas, it matters not for Jenny that she sacrifices for love, for <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> give, {{in order to live}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't see her," [...] {{she said}} desperate-like. [...] "She doesn't {{want to see}} you. You went and left her and never wrote, and she knew you weren't worth {{fretting}} over, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> care for a better man." ...|$|R

Mrs. Coulter plans to destroy Lyra rather than risk a second Fall.|$|R
2500|$|Frances Fisher {{was born}} in Salisbury, North Carolina. Her parents were Colonel Charles Frederick and Elizabeth Clarissa (Caldwell) Fisher. Her mother was a Catholic; her father an Episcopalian. Colonel Fisher, {{was killed in the}} {{beginning}} of the American Civil War at the battle of Manassas, and his daughter remained loyal to his Confederate ideals to the end. The mother having died during Tiernan's infancy, the child was early on left as an orphan. The Fisher family was rich but the war caused the family to lose much of its money. The family lived at the northwest corner of Fulton and Innes Streets in Salisbury, North Carolina. [...] As a child of three or four, before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> form her letters, she would spin out long tales of fanciful invention, which she persuaded her aunt to transcribe.|$|E
2500|$|Deciding {{to give up}} his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell {{retained}} {{only two}} students, six-year-old [...] "Georgie" [...] Sanders, deaf from birth, and 15-year-old Mabel Hubbard. Each pupil would {{play an important role in}} the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to [...] "experiment". Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in. Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Bell's junior but became the object of his affection. Having lost her hearing after a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read lips but her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.|$|E

60|$|Jo's angles {{are much}} softened, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> carry herself with ease, if not grace.

Could I not arrange to visit Croyden in the summer? Until then we would better continue on our present footing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{read every}} line on Percy's face, every {{expression}} of his lazy, heavy-lidded eyes.
