An English translation of the document, the original of which is in the Tigrinya language, extends to 17 pages. The bishops spoke of the emigration of the many young Eritreans who risk their lives in the hope of emigrating to other countries. They repeated what they had written in 2001: [...] "o-one leaves a land of milk and honey to seek another country offering the same opportunities. If one's homeland is a place of peace, jobs and freedom of expression {{there is no reason to}} leave it to suffer hardship, loneliness and exile in an effort to look for opportunity elsewhere." [...] They spoke also of [...] "the delusion engendered as result of the non-achievement of the ends proposed, the uselessness of one’s own aspirations, looking to distant lands as the only alternative for <b>self-fulfilment,</b> are bringing a growing number of people to frustration and desperation. They find themselves looking at a horizon that grows always darker and heavier. Alongside this, the breakup of the family unit inside the country – through military service unlimited in terms of time and monetary reward and through the imprisonment of many young people in actual prison or in punishment camps – is exposing to misery not only elderly parents with no visible means of support, but also entire families and it is having serious consequences at the economic level as well as at the psychological and mental levels." ...|$|E

50|$|The Awakening was {{particularly}} controversial upon publication in 1899. Although the novel was never technically banned, it was censored. Chopin's novel was considered immoral {{not only for}} its comparatively frank depictions of female sexual desire but also for its depiction of a protagonist who chafed against social norms and established gender roles. The public reaction to the novel was similar to the protests that greeted the publication and performance of Henrik Ibsen's landmark drama A Doll's House (1879), a work with which The Awakening shares an almost identical theme. Both contain a female protagonist who abandons her husband and children for <b>self-fulfilment.</b>|$|E

Considering {{the fact that many}} Charismatic and Pentecostal churches have entertaining worship services, and that the focus of preaching is not necessarily an exposition of the Bible but a positive message of <b>self-fulfilment,</b> this part of the Declaration is also evidence of a critical attitude towards this section of the Christian church.|$|E

5000|$|As Popenoe {{maintained}} his traditional values (e.g., chastity before marriage), changes {{in popular culture}} such as feminism and sexual revolution challenged his approach. At the same time, thought leaders in the helping professions tended {{more and more to}} favor <b>self-fulfilment</b> over preservation of the family. This led Popenoe to ally increasingly with religious conservatives—even though he was not religious himself. For example, one of his assistants was James Dobson, who founded Focus on the Family in 1977. In contemporary US society of the third millennium, the approach Popenoe developed to marriage counseling—educational and directive rather than medical or psychological—is coming back into fashion. [...] In the end, the American Institute of Family Relations turned out to be highly dependent on Popenoes leadership. It closed in the 1980s, not long after Paul Popenoes death.|$|E
5000|$|Claus Reschke {{says that}} the male protagonists In Frisch's work are all similar modern {{intellectual}} types: egocentric, indecisive, uncertain in respect of their own self-image, they often misjudge their actual situation. Their interpersonal relationships are superficial {{to the point of}} agnosticism, which condemns them to live as isolated loners. If they do develop some deeper relationship involving women, they lose emotional balance, becoming unreliable partners, possessive and jealous. They repeatedly assume outdated gender roles, masking sexual insecurity behind chauvinism. All this time their relationships involving women are overshadowed by feelings of guilt. In a relationship with a woman they look for [...] "real life", from which they can obtain completeness and <b>self-fulfilment,</b> untrammelled by conflict and paralyzing repetition, and which will never lose elements of novelty and spontaneity.|$|E

50|$|The non-vanity and non-ambition {{claimed by}} Traven was no humble gesture, Jan-Christoph Hauschild writes: By {{deleting}} his former names Feige and Marut, he extinguished his hitherto existences {{and created a}} new one, including a suitable story of personal descent. Traven knew that values like credibility and authenticity were effective criteria in the literary matters he dealt with and {{that he needed to}} consider them. Above all, his performance was <b>self-fulfilment,</b> and after that the creation of an artist. Even as Ret Marut he played parts on stage but also in the stalls and in real life, so he equipped and coloured them with adequate and fascinating stories of personal descent till they became a spleeny mixture of self-discovery, self-invention, performance and masquerade. It seems indisputable that Traven’s hide-and-seek manners became progressively obsessive; although we have to consider that self-presentation is irrevocable. This turned into a trap because he was no longer able to expose his true vita without appearing as a show-off.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of the heroines' efforts to have <b>self-fulfilment</b> in life through job and love in two different novels, Villette and Namaku Hiroko. It examines the background or conditions of each heroine which lead them to have the idea of <b>self-fulfilment</b> and their struggle to have <b>self-fulfilment.</b> Since there are two heroines, {{it is assumed that}} there are some similarities and dissimilarities between both of them. To show those similarities and dissimilarities, a literary approach, by using conflict and characterization, is applied. Besides, library reaserch is also conducted to collect criticisms and books. The first similarity between both heroines, Lucy Snowe and Hiroko, is that they face hard conditions or surroundings which lead them to have the idea of <b>self-fulfilment.</b> The idea of <b>self-fulfilment,</b> as a matter of fact, reveals that both of them are encouraged to have a job and a "heterosexual love". The second similarity is that both of them have to encounter many conflicts in their job and love. Yet, their struggles to have <b>self-fulfilment</b> through their job and love are not exactly the same way. Lucy's struggle to become a teacher is not as complex as Hiroko's struggle to achieve a steady job. Another difference is on the way the heroines gain a heterosexual love. However, both heroines' strong-determination enable them to solve all the conflicts they encounter. As a result, they are able to have <b>self-fulfilment</b> through their job and love. Nevertheless, the roles of the opposite sex's love, Paul's love to Lucy and Yoshida's love to Hiroko, also contribute to their <b>self-fulfilment...</b>|$|E
40|$|In 1991 the United Nations General Assembly {{adopted the}} Principles for Older Persons as a {{framework}} for international policy responses to population ageing. These principles promote independence, participation, care, <b>self-fulfilment</b> and dignity as legitimate entitlements of all older people.

40|$|Why do quality {{initiatives}} work in some organisations {{but not in}} others? In a {{quest to}} discover the heart of quality, this thesis sets change programmes {{within the context of}} a turbulent global environment, where learning to adapt is the key to survival. The research explores how individuals, organisations and government use learning to promote change, as well as respond to it. Two case studies demonstrate how management style can influence learning, and hence the changes needed to achieve 'real' quality. Seeking to achieve quality through systems and procedures provides only nominal quality. This research suggests that, for some people at least, work is used for <b>self-fulfilment,</b> and in the quest for 'real' quality, aspirations for <b>self-fulfilment</b> within the workplace must be addressed. By using the metaphor of 'work as part of the heroic quest' for <b>self-fulfilment,</b> links are made between Maslow's concept of self-actualisation and the new literature on organizational 'soul' and spiritual intelligence. The conclusion is that if 'real' quality is the goal, <b>self-fulfilment</b> is the path. By establishing a community of learners in the workplace, tremendous energy - the spirit of change - is released and that energy leads straight to the heart of quality...|$|E

40|$|The study topic {{undertaken}} was "Enhanced {{access for}} re-entry into education, training {{is seen to}} enable women to achieve <b>self-fulfilment</b> and enhance employment opportunities". Thesis Proposition and Study Problem : The topic was undertaken to study groups of women during different stages of education, training {{to see whether they}} did achieve <b>self-fulfilment</b> and had better employment opportunities if they did have enhanced access for re-entry into education, training. The study briefly looks at the progress by women chronologically, from the late nineteenth century until today, noting the major changes that have given greater gender eguity within the workplace. Methodology : The study focused on four different case studies; each case study focusing on different women who were at different stages of education, training. The study ensured it also focused on women who had gone into nontraditional roles to gain a greater insight as a result of women being given greater access, whether it has played a role in women having the opportunity to gain greater career opportunities and <b>self-fulfilment</b> as a result. Results : Some of the key results were that if women were given the opportunities of education, training {{that they were able to}} achieve <b>self-fulfilment</b> and their employment opportunities were enhanced. It was also evident that women were increasing in numbers to study at university. There were a number of inequalities noted still, although there have been a number of changes in recent times. These changes were also noted, as well as the barriers that are still evident. The study identifies different areas within education/employment whereby there are barriers and inequalities. The changes in training/legislation are also noted. Conclusions : The study is concluded by compiling the results of the four case studies and presenting these as well as other evidence from a variety of sources clarifying the investigation that "Enhanced access for re-entry into education, training is seen to enable women to achieve <b>self-fulfilment</b> and enhance employment opportunities"...|$|E
