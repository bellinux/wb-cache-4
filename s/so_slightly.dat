5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E

25|$|Unusually for a {{football}} club, Rangers have two different official crests. Today the original scroll crest {{appears on the}} club's strips whereas the lion rampant club crest {{is used by the}} media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters RFC overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881–82 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto Ready, which was shortened from Aye Ready (meaning Always Ready in Scots), all surrounded by the team name, Rangers Football Club. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts {{for the start of the}} 1978–79 season.|$|E

500|$|Critics warmly praised Whisky Galore! on its release. The {{reviewer}} C. A.

Several critics identified the script as excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that the main credit for the film {{should be given to}} Mackenzie and MacPhail for the story. Lejeune thought that the story was treated [...] "with the sort of fancy that is half childlike and half agelessly wise: it accepts facts for what they are, and only tilts their representation, ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly,</b> towards the fantastic and the humorous".|$|E
500|$|Built from Portland stone, the {{memorial}} is sited against the ramparts {{of the city}} walls. It consists of a single, [...] obelisk rising from a three-tiered pedestal set into the rear portion of a three-sided screen wall. The wall creates a recess, sheltering a Stone of Remembrance. The two flanking sides terminate with urn-shaped finials; the ends of each wall are decorated with a laurel wreath in relief carving; {{the inside of the}} walls is further decorated with laurel swags below the urns. The rear wall bears further relief swags to either side of the obelisk; the North Eastern Railway Company's coat of arms is engraved on the pedestal of the obelisk, just above the level of the screen wall, which is surrounded by another laurel wreath.

500|$|Two stone flags—painted in {{the form}} of the Union Flag and the flags of the Royal Navy (the White Ensign), Merchant Navy (the Red Ensign), and Royal Air Force (the RAF Ensign)—appear to hang from each obelisk, draping around the cornices; each flag is surmounted by gold wreaths. Lutyens first {{proposed}} stone flags for use on the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but the proposal was rejected in favour of fabric flags (though they were used on several other memorials, including Rochdale Cenotaph and the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester). The stone is a monolith (carved from a single piece of rock), curved <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> as to barely be visible to the naked eye, [...] long and devoid of any decoration beyond the inscriptions. Unusually, the Stone of Remembrance is inscribed on both faces. The east face bears the inscription Lutyens chose for all his Stones of Remembrance: [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH / FOR EVERMORE", as suggested by Rudyard Kipling, truncated from a verse in the Book of Ecclesiastes; the west face is inscribed [...] "THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS / ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD", from The Wisdom of Solomon.|$|E

He had clear, bright eyes... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that [...] "his shoes [...] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was" ...|$|E

[...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action-adventure… but the finale wasn't as mind-bending as [...] season's farewell, during which we received the show's first flash-forward." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> disappointed by all of this."

O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J.

He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye.

2500|$|In 1973, George W. Moore of the USGS and R. C. Bostrom {{presented}} {{evidence for}} a general westward drift of the Earth's lithosphere {{with respect to the}} mantle. He concluded that tidal forces (the tidal lag or [...] "friction") caused by the Earth's rotation and the forces acting upon it by the Moon are a driving force for plate tectonics. As the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon, the moon's gravity ever <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> pulls the Earth's surface layer back westward, just as proposed by Alfred Wegener (see above). In a more recent 2006 study, scientists reviewed and advocated these earlier proposed ideas. It has also been suggested recently in [...] that this observation may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics, as Venus has no moon and Mars' moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on the planet. In a recent paper, it was suggested that, on the other hand, it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward, and that the dominantly westward motion of the Pacific Ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center (which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces). In the same paper the authors admit, however, that relative to the lower mantle, there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates. They demonstrated though that the westward drift, seen only for the past 30Ma, is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate. The debate is still open.|$|E
