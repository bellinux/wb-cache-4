The Chairperson may suggest {{the adoption of a}} decision through a <b>silence</b> <b>procedure.</b> Such a suggestion shall be made during a meeting, with an indication of the exact time for the expiration of the period of silence. If there is no objection expressed by a Representative at that meeting, the decision shall be regarded as placed under a <b>silence</b> <b>procedure.</b> 2. Immediately after that meeting, the Secretariat shall issue an interim text of the decision without a number and with a temporary title reflecting the fact that the decision is subject to a <b>silence</b> <b>procedure.</b> The interim text shall be appended to the journal of that meeting. 3. The silence shall be regarded as broken if an objection or an amendment has been communicated by a participating State to the Chairperson in writing before the expiration of the silence period. In this case, the Chairperson shall immediately inform the participating States in writing that the decision in question has not been adopted. 4. If the silence has not been broken, the Chairperson, immediately after the expiration of the silence period, shall inform the participating States in writing that the decision in question has been adopted. The text of the decision shall not be issued until the next meeting. If urgent administrative actions are to be taken on the basis of that decision, the Chairperson may send the text of the decision to a relevant executive structure strictly for internal use. 5. At the first meeting following the adoption of the decision, the Chairperson shall make an announcement concerning the adoption of the decision. 6. Immediately after that meeting, the decision, with interpretative statements and formal reservations attached, if any, shall be issued by the Secretariat in a standard OSCE format and appended to the journal of that meeting.

Very few of them, however, involve themselves into the "dirty business" of developing practicable and marketable noise control and acoustic comfort tools and materials. A Fraunhofer team in Stuttgart has taken pains to solve acute technical problems in current room acoustics and sound attenuation tasks. On their search for novel <b>silencing</b> <b>procedures</b> and innovative acoustic treatments they learnt from a pioneer of the acoustic art, A. G.

40|$|In Toxoplasma gondii, an {{intracellular}} parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa, two isoforms of enolase (ENO 1 and ENO 2) {{are expressed in}} stage-specific manner. ENO 2 is expressed only in rapidly growing tachyzoites, while ENO 1 is in slowly growing bradyzoites. Interestingly, the localization of ENO 1 and ENO 2 in the nuclear compartment has suggested possible roles of the proteins in gene regulation and/or cell cycle. To understand the physiological role of ENO 2 in T. gondii, the expression of ENO 2 was silenced using a homologous gene <b>silencing</b> <b>procedure.</b> The introduction or expression of ENO 2 dsRNA successfully silenced the expression of ENO 2 at the levels of transcripts and proteins. While there was {{no change in the}} growth rate of both tachyzoites and bradyzoites, a subtle phenotypic change was observed in the localization of the ENO 1 gene product in the bradyzoite stage...|$|R

The NRP is an up-to-date and comprehensive Policy that applies to all NATO Civil and Military Bodies. The NRP has already been incorporated across NATO into information management training programmes and reform activities. 2. As a follow up and {{in the wake of}} Operation Unified Protector (OUP) and in anticipation of the completion of the transition process in Afghanistan, the Archives Committee (AC/ 324) was tasked to develop a supporting Directive on the Management of Records Generated on Operational Deployment. The purpose of this Directive is to: � Establish ownership and custodianship of operational records in a coalition environment; � Define roles and responsibilities with regard to operational records; � Support the planning and decision making at the strategic, operational and tactical levels; � Protect the interest of those contributing to and impacted by an operation; � Support the evaluation of a NATO operation and to provide input for “lessons learned activities”; and � Preserve operational records of permanent value. 3. Following its approval by the Archives Committee, in January 2012 the Military Committee endorsed the Directive and the recommendation to maintain an operational diary at the Operational Command level (IMSM- 0008 - 2012 refers). 4.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is among the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a seminal role in prostate development and homeostasis, and dysregulation of this pathway is intimately linked to prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression. Here, we identify the cytosolic NLR-related protein NWD 1 as a novel modulator of AR signaling. We determined that expression of NWD 1 becomes elevated during prostate cancer progression, based on analysis of primary tumor specimens. Experiments with cultured cells showed that NWD 1 expression is up-regulated by the sex-determining region Y (SRY) family proteins. Gene <b>silencing</b> <b>procedures,</b> in conjunction with transcriptional profiling, showed that NWD 1 is required for expression of PDEF (prostate-derived Ets factor), which is known to bind and co-regulate AR. Of note, NWD 1 modulates AR protein levels. Depleting NWD 1 in PCa cell lines reduces AR levels and suppresses activity of androgen-driven reporter genes. NWD 1 knockdown potently suppressed growth of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, thus showing its functional importance in an AR-dependent tumor cell model. Proteomic analysis suggested that NWD 1 associates with various molecular chaperones commonly related to AR complexes. Altogether, these data suggest a role for tumor-associated over-expression of NWD 1 in dysregulation of AR signaling in PCa...|$|R

40|$|My Ph. D. {{project has}} focused on the {{characterization}} of TPK 3, a putative channel selective for potassium (K+) with a predicted chloroplast localization in higher plants, from biochemical, physiological and electrophysiological point of view. This protein belongs to the TPK channel family (from Tandem-Pore K+ channels) and displays amino acid sequence homology with another K+ channel studied in our laboratory, called SynK (Zanetti et al., 2010). SynK shows thylakoid localization in Cyanobacteria. The SynK channel {{has been shown to be}} critical for photosynthetic performances in Cyanobacteria, given the photosensitive phenotype displayed by the mutants lacking the SynK protein. Given the homology, we hypothesized that similarly, TPK 3 might be involved in the regulation of photosynthetic processes in higher plants. So far, no information is available about the properties of TPK 3, nor about its physiological roles, neither about its possible involvement in photosynthesis; the work presented in this thesis had the aim of clarifying some important aspects of the functions of TPK 3. Following subcellular localization studies carried out using biochemistry and confocal microscopy techniques, the TPK 3 channel was expressed in E. coli cells for subsequent electrophysiological characterization in a planar lipid bilayer setup in order to prove its function as K+ channel. The unavailability of commercial mutants for tpk 3 gene required setting up of a <b>silencing</b> <b>procedure</b> via RNA interference of the messenger for the protein, in order to analyze the possible physiological roles of TPK 3. The resulting silenced plants have been studied under different growth conditions to determine changes in physiology of the plants including their photosynthetic parameters. In parallel with the TPK 3 project, the most important part of my Ph. D., I also followed two other major areas of research: one concerning the study of the functions of two members of plant Glutamate Receptors (GluRs) and the other one concerning the characterization of the plant homologous of the recently identified MCU (Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter) of mammals. This thesis also includes a manuscript (Checchetto et al., 2012) to which I contributed with the heterologous expression of a calcium-activated K+ channel, SynCaK, of Cyanobacteria. ...|$|R
40|$|Proxemia representa neologismo para designar o conjunto das observaÃÃes e teorias referentes ao uso que o homem faz do seu espaÃo, constituindo-se uma modalidade de comunicaÃÃo nÃo-verbal. A comunicaÃÃo proxÃmica estuda o significado social do espaÃo, ou seja, estuda como o homem estrutura inconscientemente o prÃprio espaÃo. Neste estudo aborda-se a comunicaÃÃo proxÃmica entre mÃe-filho em alojamento conjunto. Faz-se um julgamento comparativo entre binÃmios com sorologia negativa e positiva para o HIV. Como objetivo geral, menciona-se analisar as interaÃÃes entre mÃe-filho durante a troca de fraldas do bebÃ em alojamento conjunto, Ã luz dos fatores proxÃmicos. Desenvolveu-se um estudo exploratÃrio, descritivo e quantitativo entre dezembro de 2005 e fevereiro de 2006 em unidade de alojamento conjunto de uma Maternidade pÃblica de Fortaleza-CE, utilizando-se filmagens para avaliar a comunicaÃÃo. As filmagens foram {{realizadas}} em sala do alojamento conjunto, durante as primeiras 48 horas de vida do recÃm-nascido, onde se executa a antropometria, a troca de fraldas, o banho e a vacinaÃÃo dos recÃm-nascidos. A populaÃÃo constituiu-se de uma amostra de conveniÃncia de um grupo de binÃmio (G 1 n= 5), no qual a mÃe nÃo apresenta sorologia positiva para o HIV, e um segundo grupo (G 2 n= 3) em que a mÃe tinha conhecimento da sorologia positiva para o HIV, antes do parto. Pelas filmagens registraram-se as cenas do momento da troca de fraldas dos bebÃs. Estas foram analisadas por juizes, obedecendo-se o referencial teÃrico de Hall (1986) sobre a comunicaÃÃo proxÃmica. Ã medida que se observou repetiÃÃo dos componentes da comunicaÃÃo proxÃmica, elas foram finalizadas. Para anÃlise utilizou-se um roteiro previamente elaborado, que constava de fatores proxÃmicos: tom de voz, distÃncia, comportamento de contato e contato visual. De acordo com os dados, encontrou-se associaÃÃo estatÃstica nos fatores cÃdigo visual e tom de voz. Houve concordÃncia absoluta entre os juÃzes no fator postura. Entretanto, dados relativos (%) permitem inferir algumas suposiÃÃes, como as seguintes: a situaÃÃo de troca de fraldas nÃo foi o momento em que as mÃes demonstraram carinho com seus filhos; houve a presenÃa de um nÃmero elevado de interaÃÃes em eixo lateral; o olhar direcionado ao interlocutor manteve margem prÃxima do desviado; a maioria das interaÃÃes encontradas com o eixo sociopeto pode refletir na necessidade de a mÃe ficar prÃxima do filho para a troca e a presenÃa do silÃncio no procedimento. Estudos poderÃo ser desenvolvidos com vistas a ampliar o processo de avaliaÃÃo da comunicaÃÃo nas fases iniciais da vida, pois o conhecimento do processo comunicativo entre mÃe e filho pode auxiliar no julgamento da validade da implementaÃÃo de esforÃos para tornÃ-la o mais saudÃvel possÃvel desde as primeiras horas pÃs-parto, especialmente em pacientes com HIV/aids, os quais tÃm uma histÃria de vida peculiar, marcada por episÃdios dolorosos diante dos infortÃnios da doenÃa e das incertezas quanto ao seu prognÃstico. Proxemics is a neologism which designates the set {{of observations}} and theories relating to the use man makes of his space, comprising a form of non-verbal communication. Proxemic communication studies the social meaning of space, that is, it studies how man unconsciously structures his own space. In this research, proxemic communication between mother and child in shared accommodation is approached. A comparative judgment is made between binomes with negative and positive blood test results for HIV, the general objective being analysis of mother-child interactions during diaper-changing of babies in shared accommodation, {{in the light of}} proxemic factors. A descriptive and quantitative exploratory study was undertaken, between December 2005 and February 2006, in a shared accommodation unit of a public maternity hospital in Fortaleza, CearÃ, Brazil, using video footage to evaluate communication. Filming was performed in shared accommodation rooms, during the first 48 hours of life of neonates, in which anthropometrics, diaper-changing, bathing and vaccination of newborns take place. The population comprised a convenient sample of a binome group (G 1; n= 5), in which the mother does not test positively for HIV and a second group (G 2, n= 3) in which the mother was aware of positive blood test result for HIV, prior to childbirth. Footage filmed at time of diaper changes was analyzed by judges, in compliance with the theoretical benchmark of Hall (1986) regarding proxemic communication and scenes were finalized when repetition of proxemic communication components was observed. For analysis, a previously-prepared script was used, noting proxemic factors: tone of voice, distance, contact behavior and visual contact. According to the data, a statistical difference was generated for visual code and tone of voice factors. There was absolute concordance amongst judges for the posture factor. Nevertheless, relative data (%) permit inference of certain assumptions, notably: the âdiaper-changeâ situation was not the moment in which mothers demonstrated affection for their children; the presence of a high number of interactions on a lateral axis; gaze directed to interlocutor maintained a margin close to averted; most interactions found with sociopetal axis may reflect need for mother to remain close to child for the change and the need for <b>silence</b> during <b>procedure.</b> Studies may be undertaken with a view to expanding the process of evaluation of communication in initial phases of life, as knowledge of the communicative process between mother and child may assist in judgment of validity of implementation of efforts to make it as healthy as possible from the first hours postpartum, especially as patients with HIV/AIDS have a particular life story, marked by painful episodes in view of the diseaseâs symptoms and the uncertainty regarding prognosis...|$|R
