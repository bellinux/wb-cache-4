In this discussion, mechanical damage means local indentation of a pipe with an extemal gouge.

A significant level of research on mechanical damage has been conducted {{over the past twenty}} years based upon the observation that third-part damage {{is the leading cause of}} pipeline failures in the United States. More recently, effort have addressed the effects of cyclic pressure service on mechanical damage and the number of cycles required for the development of leaks. In this study, mechanical damage was created by insta 11 ng dents in pipes that were previously gouged by an end milL. The gouge depths and dent depths were 15 percent of the pipe wall thicknesses and diameters, respectively. Two pipe sizes and grades were used.

Occasionally unexpected fracture of the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clamps</b> occurs with time-in-service periods as short as 1 year.

It was erected in 1865 by the Benecke brothers from Kirchgellersen. The waisted {{shape of the}} octagonal tower was meant to reduce wind eddies around the sails and so ensure better use of the wind. The mill was initially operated by Herrmann Benecke, but then underwent several changes of ownership. It was bought in 1920 by the mill owner, Heinrich Bornemann, from Luhmühlen, who converted it in 1924 into a motor mill and in 1934 made the millhouse bigger. In 1964 the mill was operated with three rollers and a meal conveyor (Schrotgang). Thereafter it changed hands several times and was gradually closed down and converted into a residence.
