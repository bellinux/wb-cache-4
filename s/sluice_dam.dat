2500|$|The Sow of Atholl is climbed {{directly}} from the A9 road and with a starting altitude of around 400 metres {{it is not a}} hard climb. The most popular point to commence a direct ascent is Dalnaspidal Lodge (...) where there is lay-by parking. The flat area around the lodge is quite boggy and is prone to flooding after wet weather due to presence of a <b>sluice</b> <b>dam.</b> The route goes straight up the SE flanks of the hill which are its least steep. The start at Dalnaspidal gives the opportunity to climb The Sow along with the Corbett Meall na Leitreach which lies five km to the south across Loch Garry. Another possible starting point is 2.5km further north on the A9 at the summit of the Pass of Drumochter although the climb from here is steeper. The Sow can be climbed as part of a round of Coire Dhomhain, taking in the other Munros of [...] Sgairneach Mhòr, Beinn Udlamain and A' Mharconaich. The top of the hill is marked by a small cairn made up of a few rocks. The highlight of the view is a fine prospect both north and south down the Pass of Drumochter.|$|E

In 2003 the Government of the Republic of Belarus adopted the inland water transport and sea transport development program to rebuild the Dnieper-Bug Canal shipping locks to meet the standards of a class Va European waterway. According to the Belarus government (see report below), four <b>sluice</b> <b>dams</b> and one shipping lock have been rebuilt which allow for the passage of vessels 110 meters (361 ft) long, 12 meters (39 ft) wide with a draught of 2.2 meters (7 ft).

2500|$|The future {{state park}} was {{originally}} {{part of the}} reservation, but became tax-forfeit and was bought by whites. In the 1890s the Alger, Smith and Company began logging {{on both sides of}} the border.

[...] The Pigeon River Lumber Company began operations in 1900 and within a few years the two companies had stripped the land of salable timber and moved away, leaving the area afflicted with unemployment, forest fires, and poor hunting. [...] In the early twentieth century a remote fishing resort was located within the future park. [...] In the 1930s plans were made to route Highway 61 across the Pigeon River at the High Falls, but conservation groups like the Izaak Walton League opposed the plan and the bridge and border crossing were ultimately built farther downstream in 1966.|$|R

The area is characterized by many derelict <b>sluices</b> and <b>dams</b> that date back to the period of Arab occupation, during which the whole area was irrigated and agriculture was the predominating activity of this land.

50|$|The Forty Foot Drain, {{also known}} as Vermuyden's Drain, is an {{artificial}} drainage river in Cambridgeshire, {{which is one of}} the key elements in the draining the Middle Level of the Bedford Level, in the Cambridgeshire part of the Fens. It was instrumental in Sir Cornelius Vermuyden's great drainage scheme of 1649-1653. Located near Chatteris and Ramsey, the river runs 10+1/2 mi, from Wells Bridge, where it joins the old River Nene, to Welches <b>Dam</b> <b>Sluice,</b> where it joins the Counter Wash Drain, which then changes identity, becoming the Old Bedford River. These junctions are at grid references TL300880 and TL470858 respectively. When the drain was newly made, its western end was in Huntingdonshire. The waters of the Forty Foot Drain no longer discharge through Welches <b>Dam</b> <b>Sluice.</b> Instead they flow via the Sixteen Foot Drain to Three Holes and thence via the Middle Level Main Drain and the pumping station at Wiggenhall St Germans to the sea. The Sixteen Foot Drain connects to the Forty Foot drain above Horseway Lock.|$|R

Additional flow beyond what the turbines could use was discharged through five tainter gates and two <b>sluice</b> gates. The <b>dam</b> crest had a pneumatically actuated hinged crestgate which was designed to fail catastrophically as a safety relief when flow exceeds 18000ft³/s (510 m³/s).

Newman had spent $600,000 on the construction by that date and expected to spend another $400,000 to build the resort. They built a lock between the lake and the Wisconsin River to allow small boats and canoes to travel between the bodies of water.|$|R
