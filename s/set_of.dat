What I want to do, simply stated, is present a semantics for relational databases. But the semantics is rich, powerful, and oddly familiar, and applies to databases that are quite general. It is a topic whose exploration I wish to recommend, rather than a finished product I simply present. Relational databases generally have entities of some kind as values of attributes, {{though it is a}} small stretch to allow <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> entities as well. I want to consider databases that stretch things further, allowing attributes to have as values <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> entities, and so on, but further, I also want to allow <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> attributes, <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> attributes, and so [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small <b>set</b> <b>of</b> metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> enzymes that produce it, and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
