5000|$|A {{complete}} list in miniature of Russell's world renowned <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> designs., 1880.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of blades made for very light duty saws, typical <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> blades are five inches long. The major types are: ...|$|E
50|$|Dremel {{produces}} {{hot glue}} guns, <b>scroll</b> <b>saws,</b> contour sanders, versatips, and powered screwdrivers.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{what are}} now usually called <b>scroll</b> <b>saws</b> were often {{referred}} to as jigsaws.|$|R
50|$|Along with band saws, jigsaws, and now {{recently}} seen chainsaws, <b>scroll</b> <b>saws</b> {{are used}} with modern intarsia.|$|R
5000|$|Scrollwork is a {{technique}} used in cake decorating. [...] "Albeit a bit baroque, scrollwork lends a charmingly antique quality {{to the sides of}} a cake." [...] Scrollwork in wood may be made using a <b>scroll</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scroll sawing is {{a popular}} hobby for many woodworkers. The tool allows a {{substantial}} amount of creativity and requires comparatively little space. In addition, many <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> projects require little more than the saw itself, reducing the investment in tools.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{artisans}} {{worked on}} piece of cast metal (or hammered metal) such as bronze as medium. In traditional metalworking (chōkin, 彫金 (彫金)), the carving tools they used were the piercing burin (sukashi-tagane, 透かし鏨 (透かし鏨)) and <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> (tsurubiki-noko(?), 弦引鋸 (弦引鋸)).|$|E
50|$|The <b>scroll</b> <b>saw's</b> name {{derives from}} its {{traditional}} use in making scrollwork, sculptural ornaments which prominently featured scroll-head designs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scroll</b> <b>saws</b> are {{comparatively}} safe. In particular, inadvertent {{contact between}} the blade and the operator's fingers is unlikely to result in serious injury.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scroll</b> <b>saws</b> vary {{in price}} from under $100 to close to $2,000. The more costly saws are more {{accurate}} and easier to use, usually because they minimize vibration.|$|R
5000|$|The fretsaw {{is similar}} in many respects to the <b>scroll</b> <b>saw,</b> which is {{essentially}} a powered fretsaw with a table. Blades between the two tools are usually interchangeable, and indeed scroll saws are often known as [...] "fret saws" [...] informally.|$|E
50|$|Files are {{produced}} specifically {{for use in}} a filing machine, which is similar in appearance to a <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> with a vertically reciprocating file mounted {{in the middle of a}} table. A workpiece is manipulated around the file's face as the shape requires.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, {{intarsia}} {{began to}} gain {{popularity in the}} United States as a technique for creating wooden art using a band saw or <b>scroll</b> <b>saw.</b> [...] Early practitioners made money both by selling their art, and also selling patterns used to create intarsia.|$|E
50|$|A jigsaw is a saw {{which uses}} a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut irregular curves, such as stenciled designs, in wood, metal, or other materials. Today they are electrically powered and known as <b>scroll</b> <b>saws,</b> and have been largely displaced by portable power jigsaws.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in about 1890 by Combs & Pearsall, and is a two-story, {{clapboard}} sided, Queen Anne style residence with a cross-gabled roof. It features a three-story square tower with a pyramidal roof with overhanging eaves supported by decorative <b>scroll</b> <b>sawn</b> brackets.|$|R
50|$|Funda & Howard Box Factory, a planing and {{moulding}} mill, was {{in business}} by 1879 {{at the corner}} of Canal and Pearl streets. The proprietors were William Funda and Thomas F. Howard. The company also performed <b>scroll</b> <b>sawing,</b> turning and job work of all kinds.|$|R
50|$|In Atsugai raden, {{the shell}} is often {{cut with a}} <b>scroll</b> <b>saw,</b> then {{finished}} with a file or rubstone before application. In Usugai raden, the thinner shell pieces are usually made using a template and a special punch. Kenma raden is fashioned similarly to Usugai raden.|$|E
5000|$|Scroll saws {{are often}} used to cut {{intricate}} curves and joints, a task they can complete quickly and with great accuracy. They {{can also be used}} to cut dovetail joints and are a common tool for thicker intarsia projects. When a fine blade is used, the [...] of a <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> is all but invisible.|$|E
50|$|A <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a small}} {{electric}} or pedal-operated saw used to cut intricate curves in wood, metal, {{or other}} materials. The fineness of its blade allows it to cut more delicately than a power jigsaw, and more easily than a hand coping saw. Like those tools, {{it is capable of}} creating curves with edges, by pivoting its table.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scroll</b> <b>saws</b> are {{produced}} by numerous manufacturers, including Hegner (Germany), Notable (Germany), Eclipse (made in the USA), DeWalt (originally made in Canada, now in Taiwan), Excalibur (originally made in Canada, now in Taiwan), and Delta, Dremel (Bosch), Craftsman, Ryobi, and others produced variously in Asia.|$|R
5000|$|This house {{shows the}} {{development}} of the Italianate form in Davenport from the Joseph Mallet House and the Joseph Motie House, both of which were built earlier. [...] This house features projections from the box-like form, bracketed eaves, curved window hoods and decorative elements cut by jig and <b>scroll</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in about 1853 or 1854, and is a two-story plus attic, wood-framed house built over a stone basement. It is {{distinguished}} by the extremely steep pitch of its gable, which is decorated with <b>scroll</b> <b>sawn</b> bargeboards and surmounted by its original finial and pendant in the Carpenter Gothic style.|$|R
5000|$|RLF Brands {{continues}} to manufacture and market {{a variety of}} add-on tools that can be run by the [...] headstock. These tools include a bandsaw (little changed from the original 1957 version), wood shaper, jointer, belt sander, strip sander, <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> and thickness planer. Changes from one function to the other is usually less than 90 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Carpenter Gothic {{is largely}} {{confined}} to small domestic buildings and outbuildings and small churches. It {{is characterized by}} its profusion of jig-sawn details, whose craftsmen-designers were freed to experiment with elaborate forms by {{the invention of the}} steam-powered <b>scroll</b> <b>saw.</b> A common but not necessary feature is board and batten siding. A less common feature is buttressing, especially on churches and larger houses.|$|E
5000|$|Completed in July 1949, {{the massive}} structure, which is 238 ½ {{feet long and}} 32 ft wide, {{incorporated}} 745 timbers, posts, and braces, 17000 ft of plank and other boarding, and 9000 sq ft of slate. Carpenters specially cut new clapboards for the exterior siding with an up-and-down saw (see <b>Scroll</b> <b>Saw)</b> to recreate the markings found on the original building.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>scroll</b> <b>saws</b> offer a small {{light on a}} flexible arm that illuminates the work area and a dust blower nozzle to keep the work space clear while working. Table-tilting enables angled cuts to be made precisely and easily. Variable-speed support allows even finer control over cuts when working with delicate materials or when making intricate cuts.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned my}} eyes upon the Future's <b>scroll</b> And <b>saw</b> its pictured prophecies unroll.|$|R
5000|$|In 1884, Howard & Mack {{was owned}} by John R. Howard and Eugene J. Mack who were [...] "successors to Thomas F. Howard." [...] The box factory also was a planing and {{moulding}} mill and performed <b>scroll</b> <b>sawing</b> and turning and job work of all kinds. [...] "Queen Anne Castings" [...] were a specialty. The company was located {{at the corner of}} Canal and Pearl streets.|$|R
50|$|While {{somewhat}} {{similar to a}} band saw, a <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> uses a reciprocating blade rather than a continuous loop. Like a hand coping saw, the scroll saw's blade can be removed and placed through a pre-drilled starting hole, allowing interior cutouts to be made without an entry slot. Also, the fineness in both width and tooth count of a scroll's blade permits significantly more intricate curves than even the narrowest gauge band-saw blade.|$|E
5000|$|... 1882 - The {{population}} of the hospital was one hundred and ninety-two at a monthly cost of $3,967 per inmate. A printing office and a <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> shop were established in which certain inmates were allowed to work. These were for the better class of patients who felt themselves superior to hard manual labor. For another class, who were not to particular, a brush shop was established which rapidly sprung into success.|$|E
5000|$|The rigid arm <b>scroll</b> <b>saw</b> {{was popular}} until the 1970s but {{is no longer}} made. It has a single-piece cast iron frame. The blade is {{attached}} to a pitman arm on the bottom, which pulls the blade down. A spring in the upper arm pulls the blade back up again. This design has a significant weakness in that the tension on the blade changes with every stroke; modern scroll saws are all [...] "constant tension" [...] designs.|$|E
50|$|A single round-arched {{dormer window}} on {{the east of the}} roof is complemented by a gabled dormer with double window next to that itself tops two stories of oriel windows. Next to it, the main {{entrance}} is framed by a porch which wraps around {{the eastern side of the}} house. It is fronted with a balustrade of <b>scroll</b> <b>sawn</b> panels, and a set of stairs drops to the ground in front of the double-doored entrance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1884, Howard & Mack {{was owned}} by John R. Howard and Eugene J. Mack who were [...] "successors to Thomas F. Howard." [...] The {{business}} was a planing and moulding mill and performed <b>scroll</b> <b>sawing</b> and turning and job work of all kinds. Traditional [...] "Queen Anne Castings" [...] were a specialty. The company was located {{at the corner of}} Canal and Pearl streets where they also operated a box factory.|$|R
50|$|Dremel Europe {{also offers}} other power tools in their product range, again {{targeted}} at home improvement or hobby applications. These tools range from glue guns, <b>scroll</b> <b>saws</b> and butane tools. Again, like the Multitools, Dremel offers an extensive range of accessories and attachments {{that can be}} used {{on a wide variety of}} different materials. Dremel Europe separate these products from the Multitool systems by placing them in different categories; Compact Tool Systems and Benchtop Tool Systems.|$|R
