Meanwhile, the concept of smart housing as one of the main issues of intelligent building design development has stimulated various architects and designers to make use of it for the sake of sustainable housing. However, this study represents a gap in <b>smart</b> housing <b>design</b> owing to the lack of a deep consideration on cultural values of users for ensuring the socio-cultural sustainability as one of the objectives of sustainable <b>smart</b> housing <b>designs.</b> Accordingly, the study puts forward the concept of local-smart-housing through utilization of appropriate vernacular architectural features and cultural values of vernacular settlements in <b>smart</b> housing <b>design</b> in order to reinforce the sociocultural sustainability. Meanwhile, this study is limited to the Malay context in order to identify the vernacular features of Malay vernacular settlement’s functional spaces for utilization in <b>smart</b> housing <b>design</b> to make them culturally responsive.

40|$|Sequentially {{randomized}} designs, {{more recently}} known as sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (<b>SMART)</b> <b>designs,</b> {{are widely used}} in biomedical research, particularly in clinical trials, to assess and compare the effects of various treatment sequences. In such designs, patients are initially randomized {{to one of the}} rst-stage therapies. Then patients meeting some criteria (e. g., no relapse of disease) participate in the second-stage randomization to one of the second-stage therapies. The advantage of such a design is that it allows the investigator to study various treatment sequences where the patients' second-stage therapies can be adjusted based on their responses to the rst-stage therapies. In the past few years, substantial improvement has been made in the statistical methods for analyzing the data from SMARTs. Much of the proposed statistical approaches focus on estimating and comparing the survival outcomes of treatment sequences embedded in the <b>SMART</b> <b>designs.</b> In this article, we introduce the R package DTR, which provides a set of functions {{that can be used to}} estimate and compare the effects of different treatment sequences on survival outcomes using the newly proposed statistical approaches. The proposed package is also illustrated using simulated data from SMARTs...|$|R
