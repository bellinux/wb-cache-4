50|$|Within an {{ecological}} food chain, consumers are categorized into three groups: primary consumers, secondary consumers, and the tertiary consumers.

Omnivores, who feed on both plants and animals, {{can also be considered}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer.</b> Tertiary consumers, sometimes also known as apex predators, are usually at the top of food chains, capable of feeding on secondary consumers and primary consumers. Tertiary consumers can be either fully carnivorous or omnivorous.|$|E

50|$|Lead has marked adverse {{environmental}} impacts in aquatic systems. Water {{from the region}} eventually drains into the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, which has raised lead levels in the lake. A health advisory warns people {{to limit the number}} of fish they consume from this area.Estimates in 1982 showed lead and cadmium levels in the underground aquifer of Picher were five times the national standards for drinking water. Mine water has to be treated to prevent its contaminating other clean water sources, such as nearby Grand Lake, which already has elevated levels of lead due to mining activities. Photosynthetic organisms in the water have no means to dispose of heavy metals they absorb and accumulate these. Any animal or fish that feeds on this primary producer accumulates the higher concentrations of these contaminants, as the primary producer has a higher concentration of heavy metals relative to the water. Secondary and tertiary consumers accumulate even higher concentrations of such metals in a process called biomagnification).

50|$|In {{the past}} decade, the Arctic region has faced {{some of its}} highest {{temperatures}} within the instrumental record. Furthermore, within the past 2000 years, summer temperature highs have never been harsher, based on paleo-climate reconstructions. This warming is due to climate feedbacks mechanisms based on sea-ice melt. As sea ice melts, it frees up more open ocean water to be further heated, thus bringing about a positive feedback. Ocean water retains more heat than sea ice; additionally the albedo of sea ice {{is much higher than}} that of ocean water. Ringed seals require sea ice to live and reproduce. They live most of their lives alone, only grouping together into colonies when they are on sea ice to molt, mate, or rest. Without access to sea ice, ringed seals are unable to sustain life, which further affects trophic levels both above and below. Ringed seals are both predators and prey. A predator to zooplankton and fish, the ringed seal is considered a primary consumer as well as a <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer.</b> But the tertiary consumer, or top predator, in the Arctic is the polar bear, feeding mostly on seals, including the ringed seal. Yet through further exploration, the potential fates of this Arctic food web seem to be ambiguous, leading to a very important trade off of polar bear mortality and ringed seal sustenance.|$|E

Livestock grazing can affect insects by altering habitat quality; however, the effects of grazing years and intensities on insect abundance and trophic level during manipulative sheep grazing are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated these effects in a large manipulative experiment from 2014 to 2016 in the eastern Eurasian steppe, China. Insect abundance decreased as sheep grazing intensities increased, with a significant cumulative effect occurring during grazing years. The largest families, Acrididae and Cicadellidae, were susceptible to sheep grazing, but Formicidae was tolerant. Trophic primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer</b> insects were negatively impacted by increased grazing intensities, while secondary consumers were limited by the decreased primary consumers. Poor vegetation conditions caused by heavy sheep grazing were detrimental to the existence of Acrididae, Cicadellidae, primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer</b> insects, but were beneficial to Formicidae. This study revealed variations in insect abundance and trophic level in response to continuous sheep grazing in steppe grasslands. Overall, our results indicate that continuous years of heavy- and over- sheep grazing should be eliminated. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of more flexible sheep grazing management and will be useful for developing guidelines to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.

40|$|Recently {{accumulated}} {{evidence has}} documented a climate {{impact on the}} demography and dynamics of single species, yet the impact at the community level is poorly understood. Here, we show that in Svalbard in the high Arctic, extreme weather events synchronize population fluctuations across an entire community of resident vertebrate herbivores and cause lagged correlations with the <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer,</b> the arctic fox. This synchronization is mainly driven by heavy rain on snow that encapsulates the vegetation in ice and blocks winter forage availability for herbivores. Thus, indirect and bottom-up climate forcing drives the population dynamics across all overwintering vertebrates. Icing is predicted to become more frequent in the circumpolar Arctic and may therefore strongly affect terrestrial ecosystem characteristics...|$|E

50|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} functional groups that range between flora and specific animal populations. Groups that relate to vegetation science, or flora, are known as plant functional types. Also referred to as PFT for short, those of such often share identical photosynthetic processes and require comparable nutrients. As an example, plants that undergo photosynthesis share an identical purpose in producing chemical energy for others. In contrast, those within the animal science range are called guilds, typically sharing feeding types. This could be easily simplified when viewing trophic levels.

40|$|The {{waters of}} the Southern Ocean exhibit extreme {{seasonality}} in primary production, with marine life living below 0 °C {{for much of the}} year. The metabolic cold adaptation (MCA) hypothesis suggests that polar species need elevated basal metabolic rates to enable activity in such cold which should result in higher metabolic rates, or at least rates similar to temperate species. This study aimed to test whether any of the five common marine invertebrates around Adelaide Island (Western Antarctic Peninsula) displayed MCA: the suspension-feeding holothurian Heterocucumis steineni, the grazing limpet Nacella concinna, and the omnivorous brittle star, cushion star and sea-urchin Ophionotus victoriae, Odontaster validus and Sterechinus neumayeri, respectively. We also tested a second hypothesis that <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers</b> will exhibit less seasonal variation of metabolic rate than primary consumers. Routine oxygen consumption was measured in both the austral summer and winter using closed circuit respirometry techniques. Metabolic rates for all the species studied were low compared with temperate species, in a fashion consistent with expected temperature effects on biological systems and, therefore, the data do not support MCA. All the species studied showed significant seasonal differences for a standard mass animal except N. concinna. In two species N. concinna and H. steineni, size affected the seasonality of metabolism. There was no difference in seasonality of metabolism between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Thus, for <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers</b> seasonal factors, most likely food availability and quality, vary enough to impact metabolic rates, and produce seasonal metabolic signals at all trophic levels. Other factors such as reproductive status that are linked to seasonal signals may also have contributed to the metabolic variation across trophic levels...|$|R

50|$|Predators {{are often}} another organism's prey, and {{likewise}} prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes {{may be the}} prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>consumers</b> are a type of carnivore, {{but there are also}} tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quaternary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain is called an apex predator; examples include the sperm whale, Komodo dragon, tiger, and most eagles and owls. Many predators eat from multiple levels of the food chain. A carnivore may eat both <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>consumers,</b> and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons. Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores. Even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat.|$|R

While other theoretical studies have generally demonstrated the importance of predation for coexistence, ours provides the first quantitative demonstration of such effects on assembly process inference, using a trait-based ecological model to simulate the assembly of a competitive primary consumer community with and without the influence of trophic interactions. We quantified and contrasted trait dispersion/clustering of the competitive communities with the absence and presence of <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Trophic interactions most often decreased trait clustering (i. e. increased dispersion) in the competitive communities due to evenly distributed invasions of <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers</b> and subsequent competitor extinctions over trait space.

These effects create considerable problems for process inference from trait distributions; one potential solution is to use more process-based and inclusive models in inference...|$|R

The chain is constituted by unicellular algae (Dunaliella bioculata or Acetabularia mediterranea), a filter feeding organism (Mytilus edulis) and a carnivore (Carcinus maenas).

Under laboratory conditions, the primary consumer (Mytilus) concentrates about 20 times the 60 Co, when this radionuclide is bound to Dunaliella cells or to Acetabularia chloroplasts. However, 50 - 70 % of the 60 Co are rapidly (48 h) lost when the mussels are transferred to normal sea water. After 2 weeks, only 10 % of the initial radioactivity is present in the mussels.
