40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose This case reviews how a {{specialist}} medical organization in Europe {{has been able}} to build sustained positive market value by simultaneously focusing on a market orientation as well as a resource orientation. Design/methodology/approach The case study draws on market orientation, the resource-based view and customer value theories and uses interviews, internal company documentation and secondary research. Findings The case provides an analysis of how an organization has adopted elements of market and customer strategies to survive in an intensely competitive knowledge-driven industry. Findings show that effective differentiation for medical equipment is required to increase client adoption levels and the likelihood of purchase (by medical specialists and patients). From the case, it is apparent that the success of <b>specialist</b> <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> depends on attention to customer value, as well as product and service quality. These are each driven by facets of resource and market orientations. Originality/value This study provides support for emerging research which demonstrates that a dual focus on the resource composition of an organization, as well as the focus on the provision of customer value are able to drive innovation and financial performance. It shows that organizations cannot limit their focus on one strategic orientation to be successful...|$|E

All regulated countries have clearly defined <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> as has the GHTF. Although GHTF has tried to achieve harmonization with respect to <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> some differences still exist in the national laws of the countries of GHTF. Further, regulated countries have classified <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> {{on the basis of}} their associated risk. In the Indian regulatory system, <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> are still considered as drugs. In 2006, the <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> Regulation Bill was recommended to consolidate laws for <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> and to establish the <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> Regulatory Authority of India. In addition, <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> are not classified by any Indian regulatory authority. Although India has moved towards harmonizing its <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> regulations with those of regulated countries, this study aims to identify whether India should have a vigilance system in harmony with those of GHTF or develop its own system for <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> Keywords: <b>medical</b> <b>device,</b> vigilance, regulatory systems, GHTF, Indi...|$|R

40|$|Expenditure on <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> is {{substantial}} {{and is expected}} to grow in the future. This Editorial draws attention to health economic issues surrounding <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> To this effect, opportunities and challenges involved in the economic analysis of the market structure of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> sectors and in the economic evaluation of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> are identified. Markets for <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> tend to be fragmented and suffer from a lack of transparency and competition. In response to this, there is extensive government intervention in many developed countries with a view to keeping down prices, restricting public reimbursement and promoting an efficient use of <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> Studies are called for that evaluate and compare country approaches towards regulating <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> markets with a view to informing medical-device policies. Whereas economic evaluation of medicines is well established, and is used to inform pricing and reimbursement decisions in many developed countries, this is less the case for <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> There is a need for economic evaluations of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> with a view to demonstrating their cost effectiveness.

50|$|Until then, {{regulation}} of reprocessing activities {{is left to}} the individual Member States. Since 2001, Germany has had in place a regulatory framework that does not distinguish between the reprocessing of “reusable” and so-called “single-use” <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> The guidelines, therefore, allow for SUD reprocessing if conformance with certain standards is achieved. The German <b>Medical</b> <b>Devices</b> Law and the <b>Medical</b> <b>Devices</b> Operator Ordinance regulate the reprocessing of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> {{and in doing so}} refer to the mutual recommendation by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the Federal Institute for Drugs and <b>Medical</b> <b>Devices</b> (BfArM) for the reprocessing of <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> As a result, the RKI’s requirements must be observed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Software {{traceability}} {{is central}} to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software develop-ment and essential for regulatory approval. In order {{to comply with the}} regulatory requirements of the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> industry it is essential to have clear linkages and traceability from requirements- including risks- through the different stages of the software development and maintenance lifecycles. The regulatory bodies request that <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development organizations clearly demon-strate how they follow a software development lifecycle without mandating a par-ticular lifecycle. However, due to the traceability requirements of the industry most <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> companies adopt the V-model. Within this chapter we will discuss the importance of traceability to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development, the current state of practice within the industry in relation to traceability and how we feel that traceability could be improved within the industry. The chapter also de-scribes {{the development and implementation of}} a <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> traceability soft-ware process assessment method (Med-Trace) in two <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software de-velopment organizations.

40|$|Purpose – <b>Medical</b> <b>device</b> {{users are}} one of the {{principal}} stakeholders of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technologies. User involvement in <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technology development and assessment is central to meet their needs. Design/methodology/approach – A structured review of literature, published from 1980 to 2005 in peer-reviewed journals, was carried out from social science perspective to investigate the practice of user involvement in the development and assessment of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technologies. This was followed by qualitative thematic analysis. Findings – It is found that users of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> include clinicians, patients, carers and others. Different kinds of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> are developed and assessed by user involvement. The user involvement occurs at different stages of the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technology lifecycle and the degree of user involvement is in the order of design stage > testing and trials stage > deployment stage > concept stage. Methods most commonly used for capturing users’ perspectives are usability tests, interviews and questionnaire surveys.
