5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface coating}} of {{insulation}} resistance {{is one of}} the key technical indexes of electrical <b>steel</b> <b>sheet,</b> and one of the important parameters of the products of electrical <b>steel</b> <b>sheet.</b> Nowadays the surface coating of insulation resistance device is relatively heavy, measurement error is relatively large, and measurement repeatability is not good. To solve these problems, we design an insulation resistance measurement system based on Infineon XE 166 microcontroller. This article analyzes the measuring principle of silicon steel coating surface insulation resistance and includes the three aspects of mechanical, circuit and software. The experimental results validate the feasibility of this system. The measurement system is stable and reliable, high repetition rate, and has a good application prospect. The coating is very important to the quality of silicon <b>steel</b> <b>sheet.</b> Silicon <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> surface by chemical coating, and is attached with a layer of film, can provide insulation, anti-rust and lubrication function.

25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new {{autorack}} cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} changes were made to {{aircraft}} before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems {{that had to be}} addressed in a second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942. Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230rounds and the port gun had 265rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> to minimize the damage inflicted by the large-caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40–50° from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The ammunition box of the UBT was too small, only 30rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An anti-icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of [...] These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels [...] forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.|$|E

50|$|Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> is carbon <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> {{coated with}} aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to <b>steel</b> <b>sheet.</b> Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|R

40|$|Currently, most cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> {{designs for}} {{composite}} slabs incorporate a repeating pattern of embossments {{along the entire}} length of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> ribs. Their function is to hinder the longitudinal slipping, similarly to the corrugation of the rods in reinforced concrete, so that the longitudinal shear forces are transferred between steel and concrete. However, in composite slabs, the wedge effect of the embossments transforms the relative slipping of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> and concrete into forces acting on the interface, causing the transversal bending of the sheet, the separation and relative slipping between steel and concrete and, eventually, the complete detachment and the resistance drop.
