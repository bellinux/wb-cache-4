40|$|An {{experiment}} on gain enhancement {{in the long}} wavelength band erbium doped fiber amplifier (L-band EDFA) is demonstrated. It uses a dual stage technique with dual forward pumping scheme. Compared to a conventional single <b>stage</b> <b>amplifier,</b> the small signal gain for 1580 nm signal can be improved by 5. 5 dB without paying much noise figure penalty. The corresponding noise figure penalty was 0. 3 dB due to the insertion loss of the optical isolator. The optimum pump power ratio for the first pump is experimentally determined to be 33 %. The maximum gain improvement of 8. 3 dB was obtained at a signal wavelength of 1568 nm while signal and total pump powers were fixed at - 30 dBm and 92 mW, respectively.
