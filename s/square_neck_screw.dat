40|$|BACKGROUND.   Extra-articular {{fractures}} of {{the proximal}} femur are severe lower extremity trauma, most patients are of elderly and senile age, {{what makes the}} problem of surgical management actual. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We made a retrospective analysis of surgical treatment in 91 patients treated in 2010 – 2013. Entry criteria were: age over 65 years, application of a standard proximal femoral fixator (PFF) and PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw,</b> postoperative monitoring period up to 36 months. The overall performance was assessed depending on the fracture type in accordance with AO/ASIF classification (A 1, A 2, and A 3). To assess {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> we formed the study group (n= 28) and the comparison group (n= 63). The PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> was applied in the study group. The standard PFF was applied (“Osteosynthesis”, Rybinsk) in the control group. The x-ray, clinical and statistical methods of research were used. To assess the functional status and quality of life, harris hip score was applied. RESULTS.   In overall performance, excellent results occurred in 35. 3 % 12 months postoperatively, good — 29. 7 %, satisfactory — 26 %, unsatisfactory — 8. 8 %. In patients with A 1 type fractures, excellent and good results (77. 7 %) were higher in total than the corresponding figures in patients with A 2 (51. 3 %) and A 3 (75. 0 %) type fractures. Unsatisfactory results more frequently occurred in patients with A 2 type fractures (p= 0. 038). Twelve months after the surgery excellent and good results in the study group (75. 0 %) exceeded the similar data in the comparison group (46. 0 %) by 1. 63 times (p= 0. 039). Unsatisfactory results were observed 3. 08 times more often in patients of the comparison group (3. 6 % and 11. 1 %, respectively), p= 0. 041. CONCLUSION. Application of PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw,</b> allowed 75. 0 % excellent and good results to be achieved in the study group, compared to 46. 0 % in the comparison group. </p...|$|R

30|$|The use {{of one or}} two femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screws</b> for the {{stabilization}} of femoral neck fractures during reconstruction nailing is debated also. In a prospective comparative study, Vidyathara and Rao [20] found that patients treated with a cephalomedullary nail with two, rather than one, femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screws</b> showed slightly, yet not significantly, better results in terms of functional scores, neck fracture displacement and complication rates. In a recent biomechanical study, Wu and Tai [24] found that supplementary {{stabilization of}} the femoral neck fracture with one cannulated screw in front of the reconstruction nail offered better results in terms of load bearing and fracture displacement. In a review of complicated cases, Watson and Moed [21] stressed the poor sliding characteristics of the proximal interlocking screws in second-generation reconstruction nails were accountable for, in their opinion, the varus neck non-unions that occurred in their series. They also suggested that supplementary use of cancellous screws in the femoral neck does not improve neck fracture fixation significantly. Although most of our patients had a single proximal screw, no cases of displacement or malalignment of the neck fracture were met. We conclude that, provided optimal reduction and adequate compression are achieved intra-operatively, a single proximal screw may suffice for the fixation of the neck fracture.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe best {{surgical}} {{strategy for}} extra-capsular proximal femoral fractures (PFFs) is controversial in the elderly. Poor bone quality and <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> instability can adversely affect the results with currently available fixation devices, which predominantly consist in dynamic hip screw-plates and proximal reconstruction nails. HypothesisThe helical blade of the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFN-A™) achieves better cancellous bone compaction in the femoral neck, thereby decreasing {{the risk of}} secondary displacement. Materials and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of PFN-A™ fixation performed between 2006 and 2008 in 102 patients (75 females and 27 males) {{with a mean age}} of 84. 9 ± 9. 5 years (range, 70 – 100 years). Functional outcomes were assessed using the Parker Mobility Score. ResultsMean follow-up in the 102 patients was 21. 3 ± 17. 5 months (4 – 51 months). Fracture distribution in the AO classification scheme was A 1, n= 45; A 2, n= 41; and A 3, n= 16. At last follow-up, Parker Mobility Score values in the 65 survivors were 0 – 3, n= 35; 4 – 6, n= 11; and 7 – 9, n= 19. Fracture union was consistently achieved, after a mean of 10. 3 ± 3 weeks. Blade back-out allowed by the device design occurred in 16 (15. 7 %) patients but caused pain due to screw impingement on the fascia lata in only five patients (of whom two underwent reoperation). Cephalic blade cut-out was noted in three (2. 9 %) patients, of whom one required reoperation because of acetabular penetration. Two hardware-related fractures were recorded. DiscussionThe new PFN-A™ device ensures reliable fixation with low mechanical complication rates. Although our data do not constitute proof that a helical blade is superior over a <b>neck</b> <b>screw,</b> they suggest a decreased rate of construct failure and may serve as a basis for a comparative study.

30|$|Although the {{treatment}} success of hip fractures using modern sliding implants has improved compared with rigid implants [16], considerable {{morbidity and mortality}} still exist especially in comminuted and unstable fractures. Excessive sliding of the femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> {{has been associated with}} suboptimal results [1, 18]. At the December 2005 meeting of the AAOS Evidence Based Practice Committee, it was reported that 18 – 33 % of hip fracture patients die within 1  year and 25 – 75 % do not gain pre-fracture function [9]. A single-centre analysis of 1, 024 patients with pertrochanteric fractures treated with the DHS reported satisfactory results, but the 12  month mortality rate documented was 31 % and the proportion of the surviving patients walking, independently or with walking aides, at 1  year was 51 % [4].|$|R

40|$|Fragility {{fractures}} typically {{occur in}} elderly patients. They {{are related to}} osteoporosis, because of the weakening of the bone structure, and {{are the result of}} low-energy injuries and often involve the metaphyseal segments of bone. The fracture of the upper extremity of the femur {{are one of the most}} typical of the elderly patients. They may be intracapsular (femoral neck fractures) or extracapsular (intertrochanteric fractures). Each kind of fracture can be treated in several ways: the intracapsular fracture can be treated with screws, unipolar or bipolar hemiarthroplasty or even with total arthroplasty. The extracapsular fractures instead can be treated with sliding hip screw, intramedullary nail, femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screws,</b> helical blade or primary arthroplasty. What must be remembered is that osteoporotic bone has distinct morphologic characteristics that influence its biomechanical properties and therefore the choices and techniques for internal fixation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The PerCutaneous Compression Plate (PCCP) was {{developed}} by Gotfried (Israel, Haifa) for minimal-approach osteosynthesis of pertrochanteric fractures. METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients, aged 60 or more, with intertrochanteric fractures (AO type 31 A 1 or 31 A 2) were selected randomly for fixation with either the PCCP (53 patients) or the Dynamic Hip Screw (62 patients). All surviving patients were scheduled for a 1 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Less invasive surgical stabilization of pertrochanteric fractures with the PCCP resulted in shorter theater and surgical time and reduced postoperative pain. The PCCP treatment showed a tendency toward a lower transfusion need and a reduction of fracture impaction; however, results were not statistically significant. There was a trend toward a higher mechanical complication rate with the PCCP: anatomic closed reduction without posterior sagging of the fracture and fluoroscopic control of {{the placement of the}} first <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> in two directions are essential to avoid technical complications.
