Sequence {{data of the}} {{mitochondrial}} cytochrome b gene of <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>terrapins</b> (Mauremys leprosa) {{have been}} compared from localities {{north and south of}} the Atlas Mts. (Ceuta; Morocco) and from Do침ana National Park (Spain). A low maximum sequence divergence (approximately 1 %) corresponds to two major clades; one is represented by localities {{to the north of the}} Atlas Mts. and in Do침ana National Park and the other by localities to the south of the Atlas Mts. Differentiation between populations north and south of the Atlas Mts. is much more pronounced than that found between samples from each side of the Strait of Gibraltar. These findings suggest that the Strait of Gibraltar is, in contrast to the Atlas Mts., not a significant barrier to gene flow in <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>terrapins.</b> The major clades could reflect taxonomic segregation between populations north and south of the Atlas Mts. Sequences from Marrakech (corre-sponding to M. l. marokkensis), Ceuta, and the Do침ana National Park (M. l. leprosa) are only weakly differentiated. South of the Atlas Mts. we found no consistent differences between samples from catchment basins of the Oued Dr칙a (M. l. vanmeerhaghei) and the Oued Noun (M. l. saharica). Our findings imply that taxonomic differentiation within M. leprosa is currently overestimated. Key words.
