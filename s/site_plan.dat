5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a <b>site</b> <b>plan</b> sketch.|$|E

50|$|<b>Site</b> <b>planning</b> in {{landscape}} architecture and architecture {{refers to the}} organizational stage of the landscape design process. It involves the organization of land use zoning, access, circulation, privacy, security, shelter, land drainage, and other factors. This is done by arranging the compositional elements of landform, planting, water, buildings and paving in <b>site</b> <b>plans.</b> <b>Site</b> <b>planning</b> is the design and process of planning for a new development project. Within Community Development, this stage of <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> is the organizing phase where city planners create a tactical/detailed plan of new developments. These <b>site</b> <b>plans</b> are the exact details city planners need to give their proposal to the community. This is the proposal to the community to get development plans approved of. Through site analysis and precise dimensions taken by development engineers, community members are given an exact image of what developers want to do.|$|R

5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a <b>site</b> <b>plan</b> of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{application}} examples or scenarios such as <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> {{need a lot}} of information, especially spatially referenced data (studies {{have shown}} that the amount of spatial information/geodata is 80 - 85 % relating to all new data produced by the actual information society) in order to find a best place for a new building or an industrial area and to solve individual planning tasks such as generating ecological, environmental or traffic reports. Recent initiatives to geospatial data archives or any other necessary information for the <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> process offer access to a wealth of distributed data covered by the widespread information spectrum of different geodata disciplines (e. g. environmental data, geologic data, cadastral data, remote sensing data or socio-demographic data), but offer only basic levels of interactivity and user assistance.

The zoning process could be improved, since many existing businesses downtown are on conditional uses, and <b>site</b> <b>plan</b> approvals should have a time limit, forcing owners to begin development. A Main Street Manager could be appointed to concentrate on downtown, and a business improvement district created.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{planning}} support systems (PSS) {{have emerged as}} a viable information and communication technology extension to geographic information systems in planning, combining geospatial tools and information frameworks to support planning processes or sub-processes for specifically defined spatial scales and planning contexts. This paper addresses the utility of PSS technologies and methods for <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> applications by documenting the process, results and lessons learned from a PSS based alternative scenarios analysis created {{in support of a}} business park <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> process. PSS capabilities are demonstrated within the context of <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> in order to establish and document methods for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of site scale development alternatives. The case study details PSS functionality and methods utilised to address options for spatial land use allocations, environmental mitigation concerns, the role of aesthetics in enhancing and maintaining facility value, and the integration of the site with its surrounding environs. Conclusions identify issues for successful PSS implementation in <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> and recommendations on future research...|$|R

Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.|$|E

Features dug into the natural subsoil are {{normally}} excavated in portions to produce a visible archaeological section for recording.

It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.|$|E
