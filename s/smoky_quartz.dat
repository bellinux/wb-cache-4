25|$|<b>Smoky</b> <b>quartz</b> is a gray, {{translucent}} {{version of}} quartz. It ranges in clarity from almost complete transparency to a brownish-gray crystal {{that is almost}} opaque. Some can also be black.|$|E
25|$|Pure quartz, {{traditionally}} called {{rock crystal}} or clear quartz, is colorless and transparent or translucent, and {{has often been}} used for hardstone carvings, such as the Lothair Crystal. Common colored varieties include citrine, rose quartz, amethyst, <b>smoky</b> <b>quartz,</b> milky quartz, and others.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, <b>smoky</b> <b>quartz,</b> morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|Citrine is {{a variety}} of quartz whose color ranges from a pale yellow to brown due to ferric impurities. Natural citrines are rare; most {{commercial}} citrines are heat-treated amethysts or <b>smoky</b> <b>quartzes.</b> However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, {{as opposed to a}} natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow topaz visually, but they differ in hardness. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The name is derived from the Latin word citrina which means [...] "yellow" [...] and is also the origin of the word [...] "citron". Sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as ametrine. Citrine has been referred to as the [...] "merchant's stone" [...] or [...] "money stone", due to a superstition that it would bring prosperity.|$|R

2500|$|Quartz: Quartz {{refers to}} a family of {{crystalline}} gemstones of various colours and sizes. [...] Among the well-known types of quartz are rose quartz (which has a delicate pink colour), and <b>smoky</b> <b>quartz</b> (which comes {{in a variety of}} shades of translucent brown). A number of other gemstones, such as Amethyst and Citrine, are also part of the quartz family. Rutilated quartz is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smoky</b> <b>quartz</b> {{crystals}} and topaz {{are found}} in many places in the Pikes Peak granite. Probably the most famous mineral from the area is amazonite, a bluish form of microcline feldspar that is relatively rare {{in other parts of}} the world. Many museum collections have stunning specimens of deep blue amazonite crystals studded with jet-black <b>smoky</b> <b>quartz</b> crystals.|$|E

50|$|Crystal Peak {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous mineral {{collecting}} localities in Colorado. Specimens from Crystal Peak are sometimes referred to as coming form Lake George or Florissant, but the actual collecting area is located near Crystal Peak. The area has produced some of the finest <b>smoky</b> <b>quartz</b> and amazonite specimens in the world.

50|$|The Tarryall Mountains {{are located}} about 12 mi north of Lake George. They {{represent}} an intrusive center called the Redskin Stock.

Some can also be black. Like other quartz gems, it is a silicon dioxide crystal. The smoky colour results from free silicon, formed from the silicon dioxide by natural irradiation.|$|E
50|$|The Cheyenne Mining District, {{located on}} Cheyenne Mountain, {{was the site}} of the The Little Suzie gold mine {{established}} in the 1870s and silver and mineral mining that began in 1883.
