40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} pricing of <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> from a systems analytic point of view and to provide an approach to pricing that is based on the value that the customer receives from the service. Firstly, we compare the characteristics between products and services and study the effect of special properties of services on pricing with a literature review. Secondly, the thesis reviews several methods that are applicable to services pricing. The existing methods are examined especially from a viewpoint of value-based pricing of <b>industrial</b> <b>services.</b> Thirdly, we construct a model for value-based pricing of <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> and offer a stepwise framework to apply the model to different service pricing situations. We observe that <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> have a strong process nature and that the production of services most often requires a simultaneous interaction between the supplier and the customer. In addition, the uncertainties and risks related to the production are more significant with <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> than with products. We describe pricing as a utility sharing problem between the supplier and the customer and identify cost-, competitive-, and value-based methods as the three basic approaches to pricing. The pricing methods developed for products are not necessarily suitable as such to process-natured, longterm <b>industrial</b> <b>services.</b> In the proposed model, the customer’s value generation process is formulate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: International {{customer}} {{demands in}} the capital goods industry force providers of <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> to be present on a global market. Often this can only be realised efficiently by cooperating with partners. But the process to configure a cooperation and choose an adequate cooperation alternative still lacks adequate support. Existing approaches to evaluate services or cooperation are not suitable for an assessment of different alternatives prior to their implementation. Simulation approaches for production networks on the other hand, cannot be used for <b>industrial</b> <b>services.</b> This paper deals with an approach to overcome this problem and presents a simulation model based on Petri net theory for the prospective analysis of cooperative provision of <b>industrial</b> <b>services.</b> To achieve this goal, a domain-specific conceptual model of cooperative provision of <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> has been developed that considers the constitutive characteristics of <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> and their cooperative provision and maps them onto the formal notation of coloured Petri nets to form an executable simulation model. As a result, machine and equipment producers {{will be able to}} assess their cooperation alternatives related to integrated service provision in advance and thus avoid cost-intensive false decisions...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, growing {{attention}} has been given to <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> offerings in the marketing literature as well as in many manufacturing firms. This phenomenon is often described as a goods-services transition, in which companies increasingly turn to the provision of <b>industrial</b> <b>services</b> in order to achieve competitive advantage, such a closer customer relationships and higher profit margins. <b>Industrial</b> <b>services</b> span a wide range of offerings, from basic after-sales services to process-orientated solutions consisting of both services and capital goods. With <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> offerings receiving increased attention as their importance is understood, the ability to manage the service business in a manufacturing context becomes ever more vital. The overall purpose of this doctoral thesis is to describe and analyse how capital equipment manufacturing firms strategically manage their <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> offerings in order to achieve long-term competitive advantage. This includes analysing how to organise the firm for the development and production of service, and, {{depending on the type of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> offering, what the requirements on the service processes are. Furthermore the role of information and communication technologies as enablers for new offerings and processes is analysed. The thesis consists of a compilation of five papers, two case descriptions and an extended summary. The research builds on a multiple case study of the service organisations of market-leading manufacturing firms. The main cases are based on in-depth studies at ITT Water & Wastewater and Toyota Material Handling Group. The results suggest that, as the division between goods and services becomes ever more blurred, there is an increasing need for cooperation between the service and the product organisations. Applying a service logic means that the traditional division between goods sales and after-sales services becomes outdated. Instead, the customer relationship becomes the centre of the offering regardless of its combination of services and goods. Further, the infusion of service in manufacturing firms means that more service processes and interfaces have to be managed simultaneously. Theoretically, this research contributes mainly to the fields of <b>industrial</b> marketing and <b>service</b> as a business logic. One contribution is the proposed typologies for <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> offerings which make it possible to better understand the dynamics of service processes. Another important contribution of this research is the <b>service</b> function concept. <b>Industrial</b> <b>services</b> must not be equated with the activities of the <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> organisation only. Although the service organisation most likely is the key entity, it is only one subset of the service function; sales product development, manufacturing, senior management, and other organisational entities, as well as external service providers and customers, are to be seen as part-time service functions that influence the offering. Compared to previously, competitive advantage through <b>industrial</b> <b>service</b> offerings is to a greater extent based on factors outside the service organisation, i. e. in other parts of the service function...|$|R
