40|$|Abstract — The {{combination}} {{of different types}} of sensors to multi-sensor devices offers excellent potential for monitoring applications. This should be demonstrated by means of four different examples of actual developments carried out by Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) : monitoring and indoor localization of relief forces, a micro-drone for gas measurement in hazardous scenarios, sensor-enabled radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags for <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods,</b> and a multifunctional sensor for spatially resolved under-surface monitoring of gas storage areas. Objective of the presented projects is to increase the personal and technical safety in hazardous scenarios. These examples should point to application specific challenges for the applied components and infrastructure, and it should emphasize the potential of multi-sensor systems and sensor data fusion. Keywords- monitoring, multi-sensor, hazardous scenarios, data fusion I...|$|R
40|$|The {{modalities}} that {{active citizenship}} finds to act (in social, environmental, cultural contexts, etc.), {{developed in the}} last few years in Europe, with or without the institutional support, have represented an important resource for the growth and <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> common <b>goods.</b> The territory is the place where individual and community’s needs and rights emerge and they can only be satisfied when citizens participate to public life adopting new modalities. However, active citizenship does not always acquire those features that make it formally recognized as an association with a specific role within the public area. Sometimes, it rather appears as an extemporary mobilization that fades away as soon as the strong call becomes weaker; sometimes, also, it happens to pursue different purposes related to specific pressing urges. This paper will analyze the various forms of active citizenship (from voluntary associations to civic organizations up to defining real collective mobilizations), examining its modalities of intervention and the level of involvement in public policies. Such forms of activism open interesting questions for a survey concerning the capability that citizens have in creating social capitals and in cooperating for the <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> the general interest...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{critical}} analysis of some contemporary attempts {{to bring up the}} issue of God and religion again in philosophical discourse, after the disenchantment of the project of Enlightenment. At first the author analyses G. Vattimo’s recent book Belief, in which he repudiates the violence and oppression of technically manipulating and politically controlling reason. In order {{to put an end to}} this violence, Vattimo argues in favour of a complete historicisation and secularisation of Christianity, which has caritas as its limit. The author criticises Vattimo on the point that his thinking leads to a subjectivation of religion and truth, and therefore is unable to stop the violence of reason. Secondly, Ch. Taylor’s interpretation of the malaise of modernity is analysed. He considers Christianity as a <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> the intrinsically <b>good</b> and true, which enables contemporary thinking to overcome its subjectivism. As a conclusion, the author stresses the importance of the religious idea of irreducible transcendence as confining the violence of self-willed thinking...|$|R
5000|$|Hume next devotes an {{important}} and lengthy section to two questions: First, how is the social convention of justice established? And second, why do we invest the rules of justice with moral significance? His answer {{to the first question}} begins with our need for society. Humans are not strong, skilled, or secure enough to meet our needs alone, and only society can offer additional labor force, specialization, and mutual aid—all important advantages of society learned of through growing up in families. But this necessary social union is threatened both by human selfishness (or rather [...] "confin'd generosity") and by the scarcity and instability <b>of</b> external <b>goods.</b> And since our uncultivated natural affections cannot overcome these obstacles (we see nothing wrong with having a normal amount of selfishness and generosity), it is left to our reason and self-interest to find a solution: through [...] "a general sense of common interest" [...] that is [...] "mutually expressed" [...] and known to everybody, we gradually develop a social convention for the stabilizing and <b>safeguarding</b> <b>of</b> external <b>goods,</b> with improved compliance and stronger social expectations feeding into each other, a process Hume compares to the development of languages and currency. He insists that this convention is not a promise, famously illustrating the point with the example of two men agreeing to row a boat together, simply from a sense of mutual advantage rather than from any promise. And as justice is defined in terms of such a convention, so too the related concepts of [...] "property, or right, or obligation" [...] can mean nothing in its absence.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of a free enterprise system based on an unheardof division of labor, capitalistic society needed a highly elastic legal institution to <b>safeguard</b> the exchange <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services on the market. Common law lawyers, responding to this social need, transformed 2 ̆ 2 contract 2 ̆ 2 from the clumsy institution that it was in the sixteenth century into a tool of almost unlimited usefulness and pliability. Contract thus became the indispensable instrument of the enterpriser, enabling him to go about his affairs in a rational way. Rational behavior within the context of our culture is only possible if agreements will be respected. It requires that reasonable expectations created by promises receive the protection of the law or else we will suffer the fate of Montesquieu 2 ̆ 7 s Troglodytes, who perished because they did not fulfill their promises. This idea permeates our whole law of contracts, the doctrines dealing with their formation, performance, impossibility and damages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractReliable {{global data}} on forest {{degradation}} and disturbances due to fire, insect pests, diseases and severe weather {{are important to}} understand ecosystem health and condition, <b>safeguard</b> production <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services and avoid negative impacts on human livelihoods. This paper presents a global analysis of forest area affected by fire, significant insect pest outbreaks, diseases and severe weather reported by countries {{as part of the}} Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Between 2003 and 2012, approximately 67 million hectares (1. 7 %) of forest land burned annually, mostly in tropical South America and Africa. In a similar reporting period, in total 142 million hectares of forest land were affected by other disturbances than fire. Insect pests affected more than 85 million hectares of forest, of which a major part was in temperate North America. Severe weather disturbed over 38 million hectares, mostly in Asia. About 12. 5 million hectares were reported to be disturbed by diseases, mostly in Asia and Europe. There were strong correlations between burned forest area and the area of partial canopy cover reduction, as well as between burned forest area and net forest loss. Partial canopy cover reduction is used as a proxy for forest degradation, although it also includes land under management that is not degraded. A decreasing trend in burned forest area was found, largely accounted for by decreased area burned within the last ten years in tropical South America. However, an increasing trend in burned forest area was found in the boreal climatic domain. The data on other disturbances was not suitable for determining any year on year correlations and should be improved in future data collection exercises...|$|R
