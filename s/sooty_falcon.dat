50|$|The <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco concolor) is a {{medium-sized}} falcon breeding from northeastern Africa {{to the southern}} Persian Gulf region.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of this ground-nesting bird are {{vulnerable}} to predation by red foxes, pine martens, European hedgehogs, least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls. Snakes, such as common adders, may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by birds of prey including northern goshawks, hen harriers, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common buzzards, peregrine and <b>sooty</b> <b>falcons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{population of}} <b>Sooty</b> <b>Falcons</b> was observed on the Hawar islands from 1998 - 2006. The number of breeding pairs {{and the total}} productivity of the population were recorded annually. The population declined by 33 % during that period, from 15 to 10 breeding pairs. The annual productivity fluctuated between 0. 92 and 1. 33 chicks per pair, but without any apparent trend. These figures are below the mean recorded in other populations. A recent {{review of the literature}} would indicate that the world population of this species has been seriously overestimated and further research is needed as a matter of urgency...|$|R
50|$|The island {{serves as}} a {{breeding}} ground for at least nine known species of birds. The most recent discovery was that of 150 pairs of <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco concolor) in October, 1994.|$|E
50|$|Other {{species of}} Falco - for example, <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon,</b> Eleonora's falcon, and the {{peregrine}} falcon - occur as occasional visitors {{in the region}} during migration. These are generally larger and/or entirely differently colored birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> eats mainly birds, but it {{will take}} large insects, such as dragonflies, which are {{transferred}} from talons to beak and eaten in flight. It nests on a ledge or on rocks, laying up to four eggs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> {{belongs to}} the hobby group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often {{considered}} a subgenus Hypotriorchis. Eleonora's falcon is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly {{belong to the same}} lineage, they {{do not seem to be}} close sister species.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{passerine}} birds breed in the deserts, salt flats, plains, dunes and mountains. Twelve species of wheatear have been recorded in the country as well as warblers, babblers, rollers, bulbuls, the desert lark and many others. The <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> overwinters in Madagascar and breeds in the United Arab Emirates. Other than this, {{there are only a}} small number of raptor species; Bonelli's eagle, barbary falcon, short-toed snake eagle, long-legged buzzard and lappet-faced vulture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{endangered}} species reported are: Atlantic petrel (Pterodroma incerta), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and saker falcon (Falco cherrug).The near-threatened bird species are: The ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), lesser flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor), Jouanin's petrel (Bulweria fallax), white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus), pallid harrier, (Circus macrourus), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), Rueppell's griffon (Gyps rueppellii), red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus), <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco concolor), corn crake (Crex crex), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), white-eyed gull (Ichthyaetus leucophthalmus) and European roller (Coracias garrulus) ...|$|E
5000|$|Inhaca is home {{to about}} 300 bird species, both {{resident}} and migratory. Species of conservation concern are the pink-backed pelican, lesser crested tern, crab plover, greater sand plover, Mongolian plover, Terek sandpiper, southern banded snake eagle, mangrove kingfisher, grey-rumped swallow and spotted ground-thrush. The southerly Nhaquene Swamp and Saco Bay are strongholds for the <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon,</b> while terns roost on northerly Portuguese Island [...] Bird species of limited distribution are Rudd's apalis, Neergaard's sunbird and pink-throated twinspot. House crows are present since the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, the Hawar Islands {{have fewer}} habitat types {{and only about}} 60 migratory species have been {{recorded}} here. Many of these are seabirds and after the spring migrants have departed northwards, the breeding birds start to arrive. The Hawar Islands have been designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International. The main trigger species are the western reef heron, Socotra cormorant, white-cheeked tern, Saunders's tern and the <b>Sooty</b> <b>falcon.</b> It {{is also an important}} wintering area for the great crested grebe and the greater flamingo.|$|E
50|$|Males are {{characteristically}} dark sooty grey above with rufous {{thighs and}} vent. In flight, the wing lining is white, contrasting {{with the dark}} wing feathers. Adult males of the closely related red-footed falcon have a dark grey wing lining. In Africa, males can be confused with melanistic Gabar goshawks, but the chestnut on the vent is distinctive. Also, {{there may be some}} superficial resemblance to the <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> and the grey kestrel, but those two species both have yellow feet and cere. The wings are long as in most falcons (with a span of 63-71 cm) and at rest the wing tip reaches or extends just beyond the tail-tip.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a fairly}} small, stocky kestrel with a large, flat-topped head and fairly short wings that don't reach past {{the tip of the}} tail when at rest. It is 28-33 cm long with a {{wingspan}} of 58-72 cm and a weight of up to 300 grams. The female is 4-11% larger and 5-11% heavier than the male. The plumage of the adult is uniformly dark grey apart from darker wingtips, faint dark streaking on the body and slightly barred flight feathers. The feet and cere are yellow and there is bare yellow skin around the eye. The most similar species is the <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> which has a more rounded head, long wings extending past the tail and less yellow around the eye.|$|E
50|$|Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) is a {{medium-sized}} falcon. It {{belongs to the}} hobby group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis. The <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly {{belong to the same}} lineage, they {{do not seem to be}} close sister species. Eleonora's falcon is named after Eleanor of Arborea, Queen (Juighissa) and national heroine of Sardinia, who granted for the first time in history the protection of bird nests against illegal hunters in 1392 under the jurisdiction conferred by the Carta de Logu. The genus name falco is from Late Latin falx, falcis, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird. The species name eleonorae again commemorates the Sardinian Eleanor of Arborea, who passed a law protecting nesting hawks and falcons.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} avifaunal species {{reported}} is 528 to 530. Threatened {{species of birds}} with the IUCN designations of Least Concern (LC), Near-threatened (NT), Vulnerable (VU) or Endangered (EN) are: North African ostrich (Struthio camelus camelus, LC); ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca, NT); lesser flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor, NT); white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus, NT); Rueppell's griffon (Gyps rueppellii, NT); pallid harrier (Circus macrourus, NT); red kite (Milvus milvus, NT); Stanley bustard (Neotis denhami, NT); Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba, NT); corn crake (Crex crex, NT); black crowned crane (Balearica pavonina, NT); Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata, NT); black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa, NT); great snipe (Gallinago media, NT); African skimmer (Rynchops flavirostris, NT); European roller (Coracias garrulus, NT); red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus, NT); <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco concolor, NT); white-headed vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis, VU); Beaudouin's snake-eagle (Circaetus beaudouini, VU); lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni, VU); and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus, EN).|$|E
50|$|Dubois {{mentioned}} {{three kinds}} of birds of prey extant on Réunion in the early 1670s: in order of decreasing size, papangues (the local marsh harrier which still exists), pieds jaunes ("yellow-feet") and émerillons (a term for small falcons like the merlin). It is not quite clear what name refers to the Réunion kestrel. From reviewing the evidence, the bird was most probably the émerillon, with the pieds jaunes being either migrant falcons (the only species that might occur in the area, the <b>sooty</b> <b>falcon,</b> Eleonora's falcon and the peregrine falcon, are larger than F. duboisi was, if not in overall length, then at least in wingspan) or the juveniles of the marsh harrier, which are distinctly colored and also have yellow feet. The latter explanation seems more likely as the name was unequivocally applied to young marsh harriers in the late 19th century. Nonetheless, it seems remotely possible that the Réunion falcon's sexes were not only of different size, but also differently colored. In this case, the males would be the émerillons and the females the pieds jaunes.|$|E
