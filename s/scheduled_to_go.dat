The cards were <b>scheduled</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on sale at the Shimbashi and Toyosu train stations between October 1 and 31, 2013. They granted a bearer access to the New Transit Yurikamome train which connects to the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo Bay between Minato and Kōtō in Tokyo.|$|E

There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} of very little {{importance}} {{with respect to}} the playoffs as both teams had already locked up their respective spots in the playoffs, with the Patriots in the AFC's #1 seed and the Giants in the NFC's #5 seed. [...] The Patriots had already clinched a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs while the Giants were guaranteed to play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the wild card playoffs. [...] Nevertheless, the Patriots were attempting to become the first team since the NFL's expansion to a 16-game regular season <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> undefeated and thus the game became the most heavily promoted game {{in the history of the}} NFL to that point and the most watched regular season game ever to that point.|$|R

5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was <b>scheduled</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the guns {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next <b>scheduled</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E

All of those factors caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{scientific}} evidence indicating that fisheries can cause evolutionary responses over time periods as short as 1020 years, in particular in traits such as the onset of maturation. As these changes will most likely result in a reduction of the productivity of a fish stock, management objectives and (precautionary) reference points for sustainable exploitation need to be re-defined, and new objectives and reference points for managing fisheries-induced evolution need to be developed. Current knowledge allows for two generalisations. First, reducing harvest rates will almost always slow the rate and extent of fisheries-induced evolution in most life-history traits. Second, raising a stock's minimum size limit for exploitation well above the size range over which maturation occurs will slow down the rate of evolution in its maturation <b>schedule.</b> <b>To</b> <b>go</b> beyond these generic insights, "Evolutionary Impact Assessments" (EvoIAs) are proposed to quantify the effects of management measures, through the evolutionary response of specific stocks, on the utility functions defined by managers. The Study Group on Fisheries Induced Adaptive Change [SGFIAC] proposes to further develop this framework in dialogue with fisheries scientists and managers, with the aim of integrating the effects of fisheries-induced evolution into fisheries management advice. Developing EvoIAs in the context of suitable case studies is considered to be the most efficient way for making progress...|$|R

However, when subjects are free <b>to</b> self-select their <b>schedules,</b> they choose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed at a much later circadian phase, resulting in a lengthening of the sleep/wake cycle period due to the delaying effects of light exposure at these nighttime circadian phases.|$|R
