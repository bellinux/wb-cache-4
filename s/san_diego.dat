5|$|During this period, Hardy {{pushed the}} notion of {{granting}} the school college status. In 1921, the California legislature made the school a four-year teacher's school, which placed it under {{the management of the}} State Department of Education. On July 28, 1921, the <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> Normal School became <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> State Teachers College (usually shortened to <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> State College or SDS). With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city. Also in 1921, the legislature moved <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> Junior College, that was a part of <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> High School, to the college campus due to crowding issues. Administrators moved the junior college believing it would only overlap the same material taught at the teacher's school. The junior college remained with the school until 1947, when it became independent.|$|E
