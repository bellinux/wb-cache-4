40|$|If {{democracy}} {{is to be}} representative, then public policies should reflect what the public wants. But how do we {{determine whether or not}} this is the case? Christopher Wlezien takes a close look at policy representation, arguing that it can be very hard to assess given that support for and opposition to a specific policy may not reflect what the public actually wants. Public preferences for “more” policy (spending for example) also may not tell us much about what the public wants. He warns that in some policy areas, expressed preferences for more spending are completely unrelated to the policy status quo and <b>so</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> nothing about whether the public even wants more or less...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{recognised}} that massive black holes {{must have had}} a fundamental influence on the formation of galaxies and vice versa. With current and imminent missions we aim to unravel much of this relationship for the last 10 Gyr of cosmic history, while the quasar population waned and star formation died down. The picture at earlier times will be more difficult to reconstruct, but will likely be even more exciting: when the first stars shone, the first dust was formed, and quasars were a vigorously rising population. One of the primary goals of XEUS is to allow us to find and study the earliest quasars, however deeply buried in gas and dust they may be. But to understand fully the astrophysical context of these objects, their significance in the grand picture, we must learn how they relate to their environments and their host galaxies. The ESA future Far-InfraRed Mission (FIRM) will provide much of the data we require, revealing the dust heated by star formation in the host galaxy, the relative evolutionary stages of spheroid and black hole, and the total energy budgets posessed by these first quasars. FIRM will reveal star formation in the immediate proto-cluster environment of the quasar and <b>so</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how the formation of the first galaxies and quasars coupled to the earliest large scale structures.

In rescuing the roasted pig, the man burned his fingers and poked them into his mouth to cool them.

40|$|The visual {{representation}} of a network shows us far more than where nodes are or what types of network links connect them.

We have collected a large set of publicly available network maps from a range of operators, countries, and times, and manually transcribed them into a portable data format. The result is a large store of network topology data and associated metadata. In this article we discuss some of the lessons learned both in collecting this data, and in what it can teach us about the priorities of network map makers. Simon Knight, Nickolas Falkner, Hung X.
