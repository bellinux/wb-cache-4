5|$|After the {{graduation}} of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At {{the conclusion of}} spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosion, Lieutenant Commander Bruce McCandless assumed {{operational}} {{command of the}} San Francisco. Earlier in the battle, Rear Admiral Norman <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> been killed, so two US commanders had now been lost, {{as well as several}} of their staff. Despite the deaths of so many senior officers, the battle ended in a strategic victory for the Allied side.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Warner Premiere was {{planning}} a direct-to-video sequel to Deep Blue Sea, {{which would be}} released sometime in 2009.

5|$|In June 1790, Harmar and Arthur St. Clair {{were ordered}} to lead another {{expedition}} against the Indians. Harmar had hoped that Scott, Isaac Shelby, or Benjamin Logan would join the campaign and lead the Kentucky militia, but all three declined. <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> been elected to represent Woodford County in the Virginia General Assembly, and his legislative duty prevented his service. He believed that the Kentucky militiamen would only serve under Colonel Robert Trotter, a veteran of Logan's earlier Indian fighting campaigns. Ultimately, command of the Kentucky militiamen was given to Major John Hardin, and many militiamen refused to join the campaign, just as <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> predicted. During the expedition, Scott's son, Merritt, who was serving as a captain in the Woodford County militia, was killed and scalped. The entire expedition was a failure, and it solidified the Kentucky militiamen's strong distrust of Harmar; most vowed never to fight alongside him again.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John <b>Scott,</b> <b>had</b> {{imported}} progenitors of {{the breed}} from Newfoundland to Europe {{for use as}} gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.|$|E

5|$|Production {{designer}} Arthur Max led the film's design staff. His art {{team were}} tasked with deconstructing {{the art and}} visuals of Alien, and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of Prometheus.

Giger, and designers Ron Cobb and Chris Foss, including their designs for that film which <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> been unable to develop at the time.|$|E
5|$|Scott sat out the 2006 {{season as}} a redshirt. After summer {{training}} camp, the coaching staff moved Scott to wide receiver, a position that lacked depth, but head coach Ralph Friedgen said that <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> some difficulty making the adjustment. He was, however, named the offensive scout team {{player of the week}} for his performance in the practices before the Florida State game.|$|E

5|$|They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> sent Zelda his mother's ring, {{and the two}} {{had become}} engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like {{the fact that he was}} a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt {{him when he was}} working, and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{appointment}} {{to lead the}} Discovery Expedition, <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> followed the career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, {{he had a chance}} encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. Having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.|$|E

5|$|Charles Scott {{was born}} in 1739, {{probably}} in April, {{in the part of}} Goochland County, Virginia, that is now Powhatan County.

5|$|Portland Monthly (also {{referred}} to as Portland Monthly Magazine) is a monthly news and general interest magazine which covers events and culture in Portland, Oregon. The magazine was co-founded in 2003 by siblings Nicole and Scott Vogel. Nicole had previously worked for Cendant Corporation and Time Warner, and <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> been a journalist at The New York Times.

5|$|Scott broke George Pinkney's MLB {{consecutive}} games played streak of 577 on April 26, 1920. He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage. The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous captain, Harry Hooper, {{was traded to}} the Chicago White Sox. During spring training in 1921, Scott dealt with leg cramp that threatened his playing streak, but he was able to continue playing. <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> 62 runs batted in on the season, and stated that it was his goal to play in 1,000 {{consecutive games}}.|$|E

5|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> {{decided on}} a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would {{be in charge of the}} ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{spent most}} of 1759 {{conducting}} escort missions and constructing roads and forts. During this time, Virginia's forces were taken from George Washington and put {{under the control of}} Colonel William Byrd. In July 1760, Scott was named the fifth captain of a group of Virginia troops that Byrd led on an expedition against the Cherokee in 1760. Scott's exact role in the campaign is not known. The expedition was a success, and Virginia Governor Francis Fauquier ordered the force disbanded in February 1762; <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> left the army at some unknown date prior to that.|$|E
5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and <b>Scott</b> <b>had</b> to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
