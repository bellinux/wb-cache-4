5|$|The Normans {{arrived in}} Ceredigion in 1073–1074, {{and from the}} early twelfth century Norman {{political}} and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's. In about the year 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, {{with the exception of}} Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc’s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Gustav {{cannot be}} said to have been well educated, but he read widely; there was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> French author of his day with whose works he was not intimately acquainted. His enthusiasm for the ideas of the French {{enlightenment}} was as sincere as that of his mother, if more critical.|$|E
25|$|Bassman's {{later life}} {{was marred by}} tragedy—his {{personal}} life involved three marriages, and the last had a duration of <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> year. By the late 1970s, he was cut loose from his career, and he later fell in with the wrong people. He died forgotten by his profession and alone in Los Angeles in 1997.|$|E

25|$|In 1421 Bruges {{took part}} in the {{coronation}} of Queen Catherine, and in the following year he officiated at Henry V's funeral. Under Henry VI there was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> year in which he was not sent on at least one mission, sometimes staying abroad for many months. He was usually concerned with France, but he also visited Normandy and Brittany, Flanders, Hainault and Holland, Scotland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|The ephemeral {{qualities of}} operatic success are once more {{exemplified}} by the case of Emilie Ambre. In {{the early days of}} the Mapleson regime she made something of a sensation in New York, particularly as Aida, a role to which her very dark complexion was well suited. Now she is dead. Not long ago her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot. The whole civilized world heard the news, but there was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> sigh from the public, for the singer had been absolutely forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The 14th edition was {{published}} in September 1929, and had 23 volumes with a one-volume Index that also contained a complete atlas. Unfortunately, the Great Depression struck <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> month {{after the release of}} the 14th edition, and sales plummeted. Despite the unfailing support of the Sears Roebuck company, the Britannica almost went bankrupt over the next few years. Rosenwald died in 1932, and General Robert E. Wood took over; Cox was removed as publisher and the Secretary-Treasurer of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell was installed as the new President of the Britannica.|$|E

25|$|In former {{times the}} {{questions}} had {{been devoted to}} many departments of knowledge, both sacred and profane, being concerned with halakic and exegetic themes {{as well as with}} ethical and philosophical problems, so that there was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> subject of human activity or thought on which the responsa might not expatiate. In this period, on the other hand, the responsa were restricted almost entirely to legal regulations. Since the pronouncement of judgment was regarded as a religious duty, and since in most countries the Jews were unwilling to submit to a non-Jewish court, legal questions formed {{a large part of the}} responsa.|$|E
25|$|After a brief {{visit to}} London, the couple {{returned}} to Paris in September, {{buying a house}} in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch) where Debussy resided {{for the rest of his}} life. Their daughter (the composer's only child) Claude-Emma was born there on 30 October. Her parents eventually married in 1908, their troubled union enduring until Debussy's death in 1918. Claude-Emma, more affectionately known as 'Chouchou', was a great musical inspiration to the composer (she was the dedicatee of his Children's Corner suite). Claude-Emma outlived her father by <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> year, succumbing to the diphtheria epidemic of 1919 after her doctor administered the wrong treatment.|$|E
25|$|Jennings {{was elected}} to the {{assembly}} again in 1880 as member for the Bogan and from January to July 1883 was vice-president of the executive council in the Stuart ministry. He was Colonial Secretary from October to December 1885 in the Dibbs ministry, and in February 1886 became the first practising Catholic Premier and was also Treasurer. His administration lasted only 11 months and had a troubled career, having inherited a financial crisis. His attempts to balance the budget included a 5 per cent ad valorem tariff, which came {{to be seen as a}} violation of his free-trade platform. Jennings was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> strong enough man to control a ministry which included Dibbs, Want and Lyne.|$|E

25|$|In November, Napoleon {{directed}} {{the bulk of}} the Grande Armée across the Pyrenees and dealt a series of devastating blows to the vacillating Spanish forces, receiving the surrender of Madrid in <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> month's time. Fate was particularly cruel to the victors of Bailén: Castaños was himself routed by Marshal Lannes at the Battle of Tudela in November 1808, while Reding was ridden down and trampled by the French cavalry at the Battle of Valls in 1809, dying of his wounds. Marshal Soult overran much of Andalusia the following year and on January 21, 1810, his men recovered the lost Eagles from the cathedral of Bailén. Before long, only Cádiz remained firmly in Spanish hands, and a difficult war lay ahead to drive the invader from Spain.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the less}} serious damage to {{property}} in {{the outskirts of the}} town, the force of the explosion left its marks in blown off roofs, thrown down walls and gable ends, broken staircases, shattered doors, demolished windows, framework and sashes, making complete havoc of properties it did not entirely destroy. So widespread was the damage that <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> house in the lower and middle part of Newcastle escaped unscathed. On Sandhill, nine out of every ten shop fronts was blown in. In The Side, Dean Street, Mosely Street, Collingwood Street, Grey Street, Market Street, Pilgrim Street and even in Clayton Street west, the same effects were to a considerable extent observable. In Gateshead the same effects were produced in Pipewellgate, Bridge Street, Church Street, Bottle Bank, Canon Street, Oakwellgate and streets beyond.|$|E
25|$|We were <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> musket-shot {{from the}} shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I {{answered}} in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Except {{one thing}}," [...] I {{answered}} slowly. [...] "There {{is one thing}} which I have always set before me to accomplish some day, but it is <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> ambition and {{it has nothing to}} do with a career." ...|$|R
60|$|There were gloomy deserts {{in those}} {{southern}} skies {{such as the}} north shows <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> example of; sites set apart for the position of suns which for some unfathomable reason were left uncreated, their places remaining ever since conspicuous by their emptiness.|$|R
6000|$|Geoffrey laughed harshly {{before he}} repeated: [...] "You found the breeze nipping! There is <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> air astir. And you {{understand}} the relations existing between Miss Austin and me? I want a better reason. Millicent, you, at least, are not a coward--dare you give it me?" ...|$|R
25|$|By 1415, full English {{rule was}} {{returned}} to Wales. The leading rebels were dead, imprisoned, or impoverished through massive fines. <b>Scarcely</b> <b>a</b> parish or family in Wales, English or Welsh, had not been affected in some way. The cost in loss of life, physical destruction, and ruined lives was enormous. Wales, already a poor country {{on the border of}} England, was further impoverished by pillage, economic blockade and communal fines. Reports by travellers talk of ruined castles, such as Montgomery Castle and Abbeys such as Strata Florida Abbey and Abbeycwmhir. Grass grew in the market squares of many towns such as Oswestry and Welsh commerce had almost ground to a halt. Land that had previously been productive was now empty wasteland with no tenants to work the land. As late as 1492, a Royal Official in lowland Glamorgan was still citing the devastation caused by the revolt as the reason why he was unable to deliver promised revenues to the King.|$|E
25|$|On the {{sporting}} scene, Coventry Rugby Football Club was consistently among the nation's leading rugby football sides {{from the early}} 20thcentury, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s {{with a host of}} major honours and international players. Association football, on the other hand, was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> claim to fame until 1967, when Coventry City F.C. finally won promotion to the top flight of English football as champions of the Football League Second Division. They would stay among the elite for the next 34 years, reaching their pinnacle with FA Cup glory in 1987—the first and to date only major trophy in the club's history. Their long stay in the top flight of English football ended in relegation in 2001, and in 2012 they were relegated again to the third tier of English football. Highfield Road, to the east of the city centre, was Coventry City's home for 106 years from 1899. They finally departed from the stadium in 2005 on their relocation to the 32,600-seat Ricoh Arena some {{to the north of the}} city centre, in the Rowleys Green district. Since 2000, the city has also been home to one of the most successful Ice Hockey teams in the country, the Coventry Blaze who are four time Elite League champions.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It was always on the side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E
60|$|The most usual {{modes of}} {{preparing}} the potato {{for the table}} are by roasting or boiling. These processes are so simple that it is commonly supposed every cook understands them without special directions, {{and yet there is}} <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> uninstructed cook who can boil or roast a potato.|$|R
60|$|The sunset {{faded to}} {{twilight}} before anything further happened. The crowd far {{away on the}} left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed. There was <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> intimation of movement from the pit.|$|R
5000|$|Cornwallis {{observed}} [...] "Colonel Marion had so wrought {{the minds}} of the people, partly by the terror of his threats and cruelty of his punishments, and partly by the promise of plunder, that there was <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> inhabitant between the Santee and the Pee Dee that was not in arms against us".|$|R
500|$|In the 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was {{the most}} {{respected}} movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, his own reputation was not strong. Biographer James Curtis writes: [...] "Tracy was <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> blip on the box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more". He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving G. Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist Louella Parsons: [...] "Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM's most valuable stars." ...|$|E
500|$|Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 {{biography}} of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton's Jackson biography, he wrote, [...] "it {{is hard to}} say which is more disgraced, the hero [...] or the historian. The book contains <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> period of good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the admission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others." [...] By 1831, Snelling says, he had become [...] "the laughing-stock of the nation." [...] Remini says that [...] "the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And it was all so needless." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Maurice Hankey became {{determined}} to [...] "bring Ismay in as his deputy and eventual successor" [...] at the CID. Hoping that the appointment would [...] "strengthen {{the organization of}} the CID" [...] and enhance its influence, Hankey offered Ismay the position of Deputy Secretary. Although the appointment meant that Ismay would probably never command troops again, he viewed it as an important opportunity and [...] "accepted with <b>scarcely</b> <b>a</b> moment's hesitation." [...] A week thereafter, Ismay received a letter offering him the command of a cavalry brigade in India, but declined, solidifying his choice to remain a staff officer.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are similar}} {{accounts}} concerning Old Persian:"For a modern student, {{to learn the}} Old Persian script is <b>a</b> work of <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> hour.

60|$|He gently {{slid his}} hand toward hers and slipped his fingers softly around it. She made a slight {{movement}} of withdrawal, but even then--as if in forgetfulness or indifference--permitted {{her hand to}} rest unresponsively in his. It was <b>scarcely</b> <b>an</b> encouragement to gallantry, neither was it a rejection of an unconscious familiarity.|$|R
60|$|It was an {{important}} question, for the rocks round the Shag were covered before full tide, even when the water was still.
