40|$|Computerized seismic {{prospecting}} is an echo-ranging technique usually targeted at accurate mapping {{of oil and}} gas reservoirs. In <b>seismic</b> surveys an <b>impulsive</b> <b>source,</b> often an explosive charge, located at the earth’s surface generates elastic waves which propagate in the subsurface; these waves are scattered by the earth’s geological discontinuities back to the surface, where an array of receivers registers the reflected signals. The data recorded are then processed in a complex sequence of steps. Among them, seismic migration and stacking velocity estimation represent two characteristic components of the process solving the inverse problem of recovering the structure and the physical parameters of the earth’s geologic layers from echo measurements. A complementary tool in relating seismic data to the earth’s inhomogeneities is provided by seismic numerical models, which assume a subsurface structure and compute the seismic data which would be collected in a field survey, by solving the direct problem of exploration geophysics. This paper describes a vectorized and parallelized implementation of a two-dimensional seismic elastic model on the IBM 3090 VF Vector Multiprocessor. An implementation of a parallel seismic migration algorithm is then described, The paper also reports performance data for a vectorlparallel implementation on the IBM 3090 of some typical seismic velocity estimation algorithms. The three problems chosen are representative of a wide class of geophysical computations, and the results summarized in this paper show their suitability for efficient implementation on the IBM 3090 Vector Multiprocessor; combined vector/parallel speedups in the range 15 - 25 are in fact observed.

Several evaluation tests were conducted in the sea using the downsized MSV {{at a depth of}} about 250 m in water. The performance of the downsized MSV was tested for maximum sound level, frequency characteristic, horizontal directivity, and vertical directivity of the sound field generated from the downsized MSV in Suruga Bay about 100 km away from Tokyo. The sound source level and the frequency characteristic were equal to or higher than the estimated specification between 3 Hz and 300 Hz. The intensities of the generated sound fields observed at vertical and horizontal directions were equivalent to each other, which indicate that the generated sound field could be regarded almost omnidirectional. A trial seismic survey using a short streamer was also conducted and a shot gather was acquired with several different conditions in sweep frequency bands and in sweep lengths. The results showed that the downsized MSV could perform well to be deployed as a marine seismic source in shallow water surveys and that MSV would be a versatile source as one of alternatives to the existing <b>impulsive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>sources</b> in practice such as airguns, waterguns, boomers, etc...|$|R

40|$|A digital 3 C array seismic cone {{penetrometer}} {{has been}} developed for multidisciplinary geophysical and geotechnical applications. Seven digital triaxial microelectromechanical system accelerometers are installed at 0. 25 -m intervals to make a 1. 5 -m-long downhole seismic array. The accelerometers have a flat response up to 2 kHz. The seismic array {{is attached to a}} class 1 digital seismic cone, which measures cone tip resistance, sleeve friction, pore-pressure, and inclination. The downhole 3 C array can be used together with <b>impulsive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>sources</b> and/or high-frequency vibrators that are suitable for high-resolution shallow applications. Results from two field experiments showed that a good data quality, including a constant source function within an array, and a dense depth-sampling allowed robust estimation of seismic velocity profiles in the shallow subsoil. Using horizontal and vertical seismic sources, downhole 9 C seismic array data can be easily acquired. The quality of the shear-wave data is much superior when the surface seismic source is a controlled, high-frequency vibrator in stead of a traditional sledge hammer. A remarkable correlation in depth, in a fine scale, between low-strain seismic shear wave velocity and high-strain cone tip resistance could be observed. The array measurements of the full-elastic wavefield and the broad spectral bandwidth are useful in investigating frequency-dependent seismic wave propagation in the porous near-surface soil layers, which is informative of the in situ fluid-flow properties. Stable estimates of dispersive seismic velocity and attenuation can be obtained. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Deconvolution interferometry also {{gives rise to a}} spurious event not present in cross-correlation.

40|$|The use of {{equivalent}} acoustic {{sources to}} describe scattering in a nonuniform medium {{dates back to}} Rayleigh's theory of sound. The idea of equivalent sources in a uniform medium at rest was later developed by Lighthill into his ``acoustic analogy,'' capable of describing the generation of sound by turbulence and other vortical flows. In the present paper Lighthill's acoustic analogy formulation is generalized to encompass initial-value problems; the initial conditions are represented by <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources</b> and dipoles distributed over the domain, and boundary conditions are represented in the usual manner by surface sources and dipoles. David Blackstock's bursting balloon example, discussed in Chapter 3 of Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics, can be solved by this method. However, in situations where the medium is of nonuniform density (for example, a gas with a specified temperature distribution at the initial time), the <b>impulsive</b> <b>source</b> distribution obtained by a direct application of time windowing to the acoustic analogy is nonphysical.

40|$|Traditional data {{acquisition}} practice dictates {{the existence of}} sufficient time intervals between the firing of sequential <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources</b> in the field. However, much attention has been drawn recently {{to the possibility of}} shooting in an overlapping fashion. Numerous publications have addressed the issue from different scopes (de-noising, compressing, blind signal separation etc.) while others have defined the theoretical background. The term 'blending' was introduced to describe this new trend in acquisition designs, the time-overlapping {{data acquisition}}. In turn, the term 'deblending' refers to an algorithm that recovers the data as if they were shot in the traditional way. Such an algorithm is presented in this paper, specially designed for the case of <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources</b> that fire with small time-delays. This algorithm is based on iterative interference estimation and subtraction. The key to signal extraction from blended data is the incoherency of the interference (as opposed to the coherency of the signal) accomplished by resorting the data into a different than the common source domain. The method is applied on a real marine dataset, where the blending process has been simulated numerically. GeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} of the SSRLS algorithm for the standard adaptive filter has been presented in [17, 18], which may be extended to perform theoretical {{analysis of}} the Fx version of the SSRLS algorithm for the ANC systems. This paper develops a modified SSRLS (FxSSRLS) algorithm for ANC of <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources</b> being modeled as symmetric α-stable (SαS) distributions. For stable distributions, the moments only exist for the order lesser than the characteristic exponent [6], i.e., for impulsive noise, second-order moments do not exist. The lower order moments {{are more difficult to}} compute than the second-order moments [24], which makes the theoretical analysis difficult, if not impossible. The non-Gaussian signal processing is in general much more complicated in terms of finding statistics than the Gaussian signal processing. This may be the reason that recent work on ANC of <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources</b> (being modeled as stable process) does not include the theoretical analysis, and in fact, the simulations have been used as a major tool to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal (see, for example, [7, 8, 11]). The interested reader may also look into the recent works on ANC [25 – 31]. Though simulations do not prove, they do demonstrate the effectiveness. In this paper, we have also used computer simulations as the evaluation tool and it is observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms.|$|R
40|$|Astract: Vulcanian eruptions are frequent, small-scale, {{short-lived}} explosive volcanic eruptions, {{which are}} thought to be produced by <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources.</b> The experiments presented here, produced by injections of mixtures of water, alcohol or salt and solid particles into fresh water, created a wide variety of turbulent flows from steady and <b>impulsive</b> <b>sources.</b> We focus on the experimental flows analogous to Vulcanian events – unsteady, finite-volume releases of buoyancy (thermals) and momentum (puffs), and short releases driven by both momentum and buoyancy. Dimensional analysis, based on two controlling source parameters, total injected momentum (M) and total injected buoyancy (B), identified a universal scaling relationship for the propagation of the flows; the non-dimensional, time-varying velocity term (ut 1 / 2 /B 1 / 4), where u is flow front vertical velocity and t is time from flow onset, varies with the time-varying, non-dimensional ratio of source parameters (M/Bt), such that ut 1 / 2 /B 1 / 4 k(M/Bt) 1 / 2. The quantitative relationship successfully describes experiments and several Vulcanian eruptions {{for a wide range of}} initial conditions.

40|$|WOSInternational audienceAcoustic {{propagation}} {{in shallow}} water {{is characterized by a}} set of depth-dependent modes, the modal depth functions, which propagate in range according to their horizontal wavenumbers. For inversion purposes, modal depth function estimation {{in shallow water}} is an issue when the environment is not known. Classical methods that provide blind mode estimation rely on the singular value decomposition of the received field at different frequencies over a vertical array of transducers. These methods require that the vertical array spans the full water column. This is obviously a strong limitation for the application of such methods in an operational context. To overcome these shortcomings, this study proposes to replace the spatial diversity constraint by a frequency diversity condition, and thus considers the case of a field emanating from an <b>impulsive</b> <b>source.</b> Indeed, because of the discrete nature of the wavenumber spectrum and due to their dispersive behavior, the modes are separated in the time-frequency domain. This phenomenon enables the design of a modal filtering scheme for signals received on a single receiver. In the case of a vertical receiver array, the modal contributions can be isolated for each receiver even when using a partial water column spanning array. This method thus eliminates the receiving constraints of classical methods of modal depth function estimation, although it imposes the use of an <b>impulsive</b> <b>source.</b> The developed algorithm is benchmarked on numerical simulations and validated on laboratory experimental data recorded in an ultrasonic waveguide. Practical applications are also discussed...|$|R
