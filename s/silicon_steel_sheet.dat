40|$|To {{shield the}} leakage flux densities of 3 T {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) higher than 1. 5 T MRI and to reduce the degradation of magnetic properties during construction, the design of an open-type magnetically shielded room (MSR) combined with square cylinders made of magnetic and conductive materials should be improved. This paper reports on an optimal design for magnetic cylinders to improve the shielding effect, while also considering ease of construction {{with a view to}} practical use. Firstly, the structure of the magnetic cylinders, such as their opening width and the slit width were optimized using a 3 D linear magnetic-field analysis. Using optimal magnetic cylinders, when the relative permeability (μ_r) of the magnetic material is larger than 10 000, the reluctance of gaps between the cylinders is the main contributor to the leakage flux. So, the required (μ_r) of the magnetic material is 10 000 and oriented silicon steel is adopted instead of the non-oriented type. Secondly, as an optimal construction method, it was determined by experiment that oriented silicon steel sheets, annealed after bending, should be laminated so that the effect of gaps on butt joints between steel sheets on the magnetic property of the cylinder becomes smaller. This enables the relative permeability of 10 000 when the maximum flux density of the material in the cylinder is less than 1. 7 T. Finally, the minimum thickness of oriented <b>silicon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> of cylinders depending on the distance from a 3 T MRI is obtained using linear magnetic analysis under the condition that the maximum flux density of the material of the cylinder is less than 1. 7 T. In the case of the thickness of 3. 8 mm, the leakage flux density of 3 T MRI is decreased to less than a guideline (0. 5 mT) when the distance between the cylinders and the center of MRI is larger than 2 750 mm. This indicates that the optimal design and construction method of an open-type MSR for 3 T MRI composed of magnetic square cylinders are realized...|$|E

40|$|Bolted cores made of coated <b>silicon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> {{constitute}} {{a vital part}} of heavy electrical equipment for transformers, motors and turbogenerators. Bolted laminates are eminently suitable for facilitating smooth magnetic flux paths, but, unfortunately, they are unable to suppress interlaminate shearing caused by flexural vibration generating noise levels often exceeding 100 dB during operation. The resulting din and cacophony in the surrounding has become a major environmental concern. This thesis makes an attempt to develop theoretical, experimental and numerical models for evolving an effective stiffness approach enhancing the design and analysis underlying nonlinear flexure of bolted laminates. While large machine cores contain thousands of thin sheets bolted together along with end plates, this thesis reports the results obtained on two different assemblies. Two 375 mm long 60 mm wide and 10 mm thick plates assembled with 3, 4 or 5 bolts constitute the first configuration. The second one which is much more realistic comprises 80 coated 270 micron <b>silicon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> with end plates of 2 or 4 mm thickness held together by 3 or 5 bolts. Static 3 point bend tests on these bolted assemblies are followed by instrumented impact tests. Static bending tests highlight the role of frictional nonlinearity inducing a drop in the stiffness due to sliding between the plates. An experimentally determined effective modulus in the initial linear range is utilized for static and dynamic finite element simulations. Nonlinear response of bolted plates is simulated using contact elements in between the sliding plates, plates and the bolts heads. Since the first fundamental mode of vibration dominates the tribomechanical vibration induced noise, the primary focus is on the fundamental frequency in bending. There is generally a good overall agreement in all the results obtained through theory, experiment and FE simulation. Experiments, however, unveil quite complex nonlinear effects induced by friction and plasticity outside the scope of this thesis. However, the low amplitude response of bolted laminates which is reasonably well captured in this thesis represents the starting point for initiating a more elaborate effort for addressing large amplitude nonlinear flexure in bolted laminates. These findings shed light on estimating and controlling noise and vibration levels in heavy electric machines...|$|R

As the flux mainly flows in one direction, we use grain-oriented LSSS.

The model accounts for the magnetic stray field (fringing field) that causes eddy currents in {{the plane of the}} sheets, in addition to the main flux causing the classical eddy-current loss. The losses caused by the 3 -D eddy-current pattern, as well as hysteresis and excess losses, are computed and measured for a test setup. A comparison of losses is made for the SMC mounted in the same setup. SMC does not suffer from eddy currents due to fringing flux.
