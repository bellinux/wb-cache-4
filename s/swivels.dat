5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma <b>swivels</b> towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it.|$|E
5|$|The video {{featured}} the physical discipline parkour, in which parkour artist Sébastien Foucan performed routines around the buildings of Tokyo. The video begins showing the Tokyo skyline and parkour artists standing on rooftops. As the spoken introduction starts, Madonna {{is shown in}} her wig dancing {{in front of a}} number of neon signs which contain the words Madonna and Jump in Japanese. The song continues with the dancers jumping from buildings and running through the lanes of the city. Madonna dances to the music and <b>swivels</b> around metallic rods in and around her, of the same design present in her tour. Before the final chorus, the dancers cease their parkour routines and stand on a lamppost.|$|E
5|$|The Machias {{community}} expected retaliation by the British Empire, {{and immediately}} petitioned to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for guidance, supplies, and assistance. The Provincial Congress organized {{the defense of}} Machias and remained vigilant. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted {{one of the three}} captured vessels with breastwork, and armed it with guns and <b>swivels</b> that were taken from the Margaretta, and changed its name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, the Diligent and the Tatamagouche. The ships' officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbor. The Provincial Congress formally recognized O'Brien and Foster's efforts by commissioning both the Machias Liberty and the Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy with O'Brien as their commander in August 1775. Retaliation from the British did not occur until October 18, 1775, with the Burning of Falmouth.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, <b>swivel</b> LCDs (also {{known as}} {{articulating}} screen) are displays that freely rotate while {{attached to a}} camera body. Usually, the camera body is {{much larger than the}} <b>swivelling</b> display. <b>Swivel</b> LCD devices can be considered as <b>swivel</b> lens devices because the camera body can <b>swivel</b> around the small display; albeit, aiming the camera is more difficult. Most camcorders have a <b>swivel</b> LCD.|$|R
5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four <b>swivels.</b> Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{building}} materials {{and other supplies}} led Admiral Graves to authorise a loyalist merchant to send his two ships Unity and Polly from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, escorted by the armed schooner Margaretta {{under the command of}} James Moore, a midshipman from Graves' flagship Preston. Moore also carried orders to recover what he could from the wreck of , which had apparently been run aground in Machias Bay by a patriot pilot in February 1775. After a heated negotiation, the Machias townspeople seized the merchant vessels and the schooner after a short battle in which Moore was killed. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels with breastwork, armed her with the guns and <b>swivels</b> taken from Margaretta and changed her name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, Jeremiah O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, Diligent and Tatamagouche, whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbour. In August 1775, the Provincial Congress formally recognised their efforts, commissioning both Machias Liberty and Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy, with Jeremiah O'Brien as their commander. The community would be a base for privateering until the war's end.|$|E

Between two elements at a node where there is a <b>swivel</b> joint, displacements are continuous and rotations are not. This paper is a contribution to the calculation of the rotations in a <b>swivel</b> point.

50|$|Breech-loading <b>swivel</b> {{guns were}} invented in the 14th century. They were a {{particular}} type of <b>swivel</b> gun, and consisted in a small breech-loading cannon equipped with a <b>swivel</b> for easy rotation, and which could be loaded by inserting a mug-shaped chamber already filled with powder and projectiles. The breech-loading <b>swivel</b> gun had a high rate of fire, and was especially effective in anti-personnel roles.|$|R
