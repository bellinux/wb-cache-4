5000|$|The {{position}} (as {{opposed to}} rotation) {{of the needle}} on a <b>synchroscope</b> indicates the phase angle between the two systems. The angle between the systems is zero when the <b>synchroscope</b> needle is pointing directly to the line in between the [...] "slow" [...] and [...] "fast" [...] markings on the dial. (In the picture example in this article, the zero-phase-angle position is straight upwards, at the [...] "twelve o'clock" [...] position.) ...|$|E
50|$|Greenbaum's firm invented {{and used}} <b>Synchroscope,</b> which {{synchronised}} the visual picture of films with phonograph records {{to create a}} working sound and vision system. Greenbaum produced {{a number of these}} sound shorts of vocal classical music, and in 1908 entered into contracts to supply the machinery to Carl Laemmle's Movie Service Company in Chicago and to another American, Charles Urban, in Britain.Carl Laemmle installed the system in a number of American cinemas, mostly in German-speaking communities. <b>Synchroscope</b> largely petered out because not enough sound films were made to meet demand and because it could only last for two or three reels while the standard length of films was increasingly four or five reels long. Costs had soared by the end of 1908 (the <b>Synchroscope</b> was originally priced at $750 (around $20,000 in 2015); and Schleussner AG bought out Greenbaum's share of Deutsche Bioscope to free up his operations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Synchroscopes</b> are {{electrodynamic}} instruments, which rely on {{the interaction}} of magnetic fields to rotate a pointer. In most types, unlike voltmeters and wattmeters, there is no restoring spring torque for the magnetically produced torques to overcome; the pointer system is free to rotate continually. <b>Synchroscopes</b> have a damping vane to smooth out vibration of the moving system.|$|R
5000|$|All these {{instruments}} use single-phase {{connections to the}} running and incoming systems to simplify the wiring. For most systems, <b>synchroscopes</b> are connected through voltage transformers to reduce the machine voltage to around 120 volts to operate the instruments. <b>Synchroscopes</b> operate only over a limited range of frequencies, a few per cent {{above and below the}} system nominal frequency. Cross-coil type instruments draw a relatively large amount of power from the systems and are intended for only brief operation. The moving-iron and polarized-vane instruments put less burden on the system and can operate for a longer time without overheating.|$|R
5000|$|Since most <b>synchroscopes</b> are {{connected}} {{only to a}} single phase of the two systems, they cannot assure that the phase sequence is correct. When generators are newly connected to a power system, or temporary connections are used, other means are required to assure both systems have the same phase sequence.|$|R
50|$|In AC {{electrical}} power systems, a <b>synchroscope</b> is {{a device that}} indicates {{the degree to which}} two systems (generators or power networks) are synchronized with each other.|$|E
50|$|Paul Martyn Lincoln (January 1, 1870 - December 20, 1944) was {{president}} of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1914 to 1915. He invented the <b>synchroscope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] From top to bottom: <b>synchroscope,</b> voltmeter, {{frequency}} meter. When the {{two systems}} are synchronized, the pointer on the synchrosope is stationary and points straight up.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Synchroscopes</b> {{are used}} in any power plant that connects to an outside power grid and also in {{isolated}} plants containing more than one generator. Each generator must be synchronized with the others before being connected to the plant bus. If line voltages are unequal when they are connected, a heavy current will flow as each line will attempt to equalize the other, causing damage in the process.|$|R
50|$|Synchronizing relays allow {{unattended}} synchronization of {{a machine}} with a system. Today these are digital microprocessor instruments, {{but in the past}} electromechanical relay systems were applied. A synchronizing relay is useful to remove human reaction time from the process, or when a human is not available such as at a remote controlled generating plant. <b>Synchroscopes</b> or lamps are sometimes installed as a supplement to automatic relays, for possible manual use or for monitoring the generating unit.|$|R
50|$|For two {{electrical}} {{systems to}} be synchronized, both systems must operate {{at the same}} frequency, and the phase angle between the systems must be zero (and two polyphase systems must have the same phase sequence). <b>Synchroscopes</b> measure and display the frequency difference and phase angle between two power systems. Only when these two quantities are zero {{is it safe to}} connect the two systems together. Connecting two unsynchronized AC power systems together is likely to cause high currents to flow, which will severely damage any equipment not protected by fuses or circuit breakers.|$|R
5000|$|To allow {{customers}} to use electric clocks regulated by synchronous motors, a Frequency [...] "Indicator" [...] {{was added to}} the Powerhouse switchboard. To allow parallel alternators and power grid, a <b>Synchroscope</b> {{was added to the}} Switch Panel.|$|E
5000|$|The cross-coil <b>synchroscope</b> {{somewhat}} {{resembles a}} wound-field induction motor. A two-phase rotor winding {{is connected to}} the incoming machine source by a phase-shifting network through brushes and slip rings. The stationary field winding {{is connected to the}} incoming source.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{generator}} is turning {{at a lower}} frequency than the grid, the <b>synchroscope</b> needle rotates continually in the direction (usually counterclockwise) marked [...] "slow" [...] or [...] "lag" [...] on the dial to indicate that {{the generator}} is running slower than, or lagging behind, the grid. If the generator is running faster than the grid, the needle rotates continually in the opposite direction, marked [...] "fast" [...] or [...] "lead". Next, the plant operator adjusts the speed of the generator until it is running at precisely the same speed (frequency) as the grid. As the frequency of the generator nears that of the grid, the <b>synchroscope</b> needle slows down and when the frequencies match, the needle stops rotating.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} aid to synchronizing {{a generator}} to another system uses lamps wired between similar {{phases of the}} two systems; when the lamps stay dark, the voltage and frequency of the two systems are the same and the generator may be connected. However, the accuracy {{of this approach is}} low since it is difficult to discern slight phase differences, and the lamps do not show the relative speeds of the two systems. <b>Synchroscopes</b> are instruments that show the relative frequency (speed) difference and the phase angle between the machine to be synchronized and the system voltage.|$|R
40|$|Source {{locations}} of elastic shocks caused by micro-fractures in various rocks subjected to bending stress {{were determined by}} a new experimental system, which consists of piezo-electric type transducers, amplifiers, dual-beam <b>synchroscopes</b> and moving cameras. In heterogeneous rocks, elastic shocks markedly increase before a main rupture. In the earlier stage, sources of elastic shocks locate at random in a rock sample. In the later stage, they concentrate {{in one or more}} limited regions in the sample, and the shock activity in other regions decreases. Just before rupture, one of the highly active regions extends in the direction perpendicular to the applied tensile stress. In rocks with homogeneous structure, however, rupture takes place suddenly without the above-mentioned micro-fracturing process. These results observed in laboratory are very helpful to understand the process of foreshock occurrence in earthquakes. |不均質な岩石に力を加えてゆくと,局部的な破壊に伴う衝撃性弾性波(Elastic Shocks) が発生し,それが次第に増加して主破壊に至るが,その発生過程は岩石の構造と密接な関係を示すことはすでに報告した所である. これまでは,この過程を研究するのに,主として,Elastic Shocksの頻度やエネルギーの変化に注目したが,更に,波動特性や震源分布の特徴を明らかにすることが重要である. 本論文では,この様な目的のため今回開発した測定法について述べ,それを用いて震源分布を求めた結果を述べた. 今回は各種岩石の常圧下の曲げ試験を行なったが,その湯合の岩石の主破壊に至る過程は,Elastic Shocksの震源分布を考慮して,次の様に要約される...|$|R
50|$|TV {{broadcasting}} {{started in}} Japan in 1953. NHK (or Japan Broadcasting Corporation) requested Iwatsu {{to develop a}} new oscilloscope for TVs because oscilloscopes were essential for measuring TV signals and Iwatsu was the only domestic oscilloscope manufacturer at the time. Iwatsu's <b>Synchroscope</b> continued to evolve in response to new demands, such as larger CRTs and higher frequency ranges.|$|E
50|$|In {{some power}} plants, {{a set of}} lamps may be {{connected}} between the generator and system busses (or between the instrument transformers connected to those busses) as a backup to the <b>synchroscope</b> instrument. The lamps flicker at the difference between system and generator frequency. The lamps can be connected to go dark when the phase voltages are identical and in-phase.|$|E
5000|$|In a Weston pattern <b>synchroscope,</b> {{the moving}} element {{is not free}} to rotate {{continuously}} and oscillates back and forth slowly as the two sources are brought into synchronism. The moving pointer is illuminated by a pilot lamp connected to a three-winding transformer fed by both sources. The pointer is only illuminated at the in-phase condition, thereby distinguishing between in-phase and 180-degree out of phase conditions.|$|E
5000|$|When {{operators}} {{of an electric}} generator wish to connect it to the grid, they first start the generator spinning at a rate approximately equal to the line frequency of the grid with which they plan to connect. The voltage of the generator is then matched with the grid by adjusting the field/armature current. The <b>synchroscope</b> {{is connected to the}} power grid and to the generator being started.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} {{is protected}} from electrocution by safety switches and fuses. There {{may also be}} controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard, coming from a generator or bank of electrical generators, especially frequency control of AC power and load sharing controls, plus gauges showing frequency and perhaps a <b>synchroscope.</b> The amount of power going into a switchboard must always equal to the power {{going out to the}} loads.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to synchronizing generators to power systems, similar frequency-difference indicating instruments are used on multiengine ships and aircraft {{to allow the}} operators to exactly synchronize the speed of engines. This helps reduce the noise and vibration due to slight differences, for example, in the speeds of two propellers on an aircraft. In this application a <b>synchroscope</b> responds to slight speed differences {{that would not be}} visible on an engine tachometer.|$|E
50|$|As a pilot aid to {{manually}} synchronizing the propellers, some {{twins have}} a small gauge called a <b>synchroscope</b> mounted in or by the tachometer(s) with a propeller symbol on a disk that spins. The pilot manually fine tunes the engine r.p.m. so as to stop disk rotation, thereby synchronizing the propellers. This is a useful backup to synchronizing engine r.p.m. using the audible propeller beat. This gauge is also found installed with most propeller synchronizer and synchrophase systems. Some synchrophase systems use a knob for the pilot to control the phase angle.|$|E
50|$|Iwatsu {{was ready}} to venture into new {{challenges}} again. The Far East Air Material Command (FEAMCOM) in Tachikawa, Tokyo {{was in need of}} more oscilloscopes (which were scarce and not so advanced at the time) for testing their radar systems. The FEAMCOM cooperated with Iwatsu in developing Japan's first oscilloscope. This oscilloscope's greatest advantage was its ability to hold a waveform still on the CRT, making it easier for the user to observe and measure the waveform. Iwatsu named it <b>Synchroscope,</b> and the first model was delivered to the Ministry of Defense in 1954.|$|E
5000|$|Another manual {{method of}} {{synchronization}} relies on observing an instrument called a [...] "synchroscope", which displays the relative frequencies of system and generator. The pointer of the <b>synchroscope</b> will indicate [...] "fast" [...] or [...] "slow" [...] {{speed of the}} generator {{with respect to the}} system. To minimize the transient current when the generator circuit breaker is closed, usual practice is to initiate the close as the needle slowly approaches the in-phase point. An error of a few electrical degrees between system and generator will result in a momentary inrush and abrupt speed change of the generator.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the {{application}} and the circuit design, the breaker is closed when the <b>synchroscope</b> is passing through approximately [...] "eleven o'clock", while traveling slowly in the fast direction, allowing time for the circuit breaker to close, and for the incoming generator to come onto the grid as a source. The purpose of this action is to prevent {{the possibility of the}} oncoming generator paralleling onto the grid as a load. This has the potential to cause the generator to operate as a motor which can cause damage to the generator and the prime mover (such as a steam turbine or Diesel engine). The machine may be protected from this occurrence by a [...] "reverse power" [...] trip.|$|E
5000|$|A polarized-vane <b>synchroscope</b> has a {{field winding}} with a phase-shifting network {{arranged}} {{to produce a}} rotating magnetic field. The field windings {{are connected to the}} [...] "incoming" [...] machine. A single-phase polarizing winding is connected to the [...] "running" [...] system. It is mounted perpendicular to the field winding and produces a magnetic flux that passes through the moving vanes. The moving vanes turn a shaft that carries a pointer moving over a scale. If the frequency of the source connected to the polarizing winding is different from the source connected to the field winding, the pointer rotates continually at a speed proportional to the difference in system frequencies (the beat frequency). The scale is marked to show the direction of rotation corresponding to the [...] "incoming" [...] machine running faster than the [...] "running" [...] system. When the frequencies match, the moving vanes will rotate to a position corresponding to the phase difference between the two sources. The incoming machine can then be adjusted in speed so that the two systems are in phase agreement.|$|E
5000|$|The Autotron spurred spinoffs: the Secatron (1954) for carton {{makers to}} ensure their {{pictures}} were centred; the Webatron for bag making machines; the Trakatron (1953) for the special requirements of cellophane and paper printers, and the Inkatron (1960) for sheet-fed offset presses. At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The <b>Synchroscope</b> gave machine minders the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop [...] "speckling", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas. In 1966 the Heliostat, which applied an electric charge of several thousand volts to attract ink to paper, appeared. By then Crosfield {{had the support of}} a team of talented researchers, installation engineers, a production facility and sales and administrative staff.|$|E
50|$|September (Michael Cerveris), {{talking to}} December (Eugene Lipinski), implores {{him to help}} fix a key {{component}} of the device, an initiating reactor, to send Michael (Rowan Longworth) to the future, despite knowing this will erase September from time. September pleads for the same compassion that December, like the others of the original Observer team, developed for the humans. Later, September regroups with Fringe to explain the failing reactor and describe the function of the device: to create a wormhole, using the two Observer cylinders as stabilization points on either end, and the large electromagnet needed to launch the second cylinder into the future of 2167. Once the wormhole is stabilized by the red rocks from the mine, Michael would be sent through, to meet an agent {{to take him to the}} Norwegian scientist as to stop the experiment that would be responsible for creating the Observers. As they discuss this, Olivia (Anna Torv) is still concerned as to why Michael willingly let himself be captured previously and believes him to have expected to be rescued. One additional part is revealed to be necessary to assure the magnet's operation: a <b>synchroscope.</b> Peter (Joshua Jackson) begins to dig through the amber in the lab to look for it.|$|E
40|$|The Velocity {{of sound}} wave in air emitted {{continuously}} from a speaker. within the frequency range from 4 kcs to 9 kcs. {{is measured by}} a <b>synchroscope.</b> The measurements {{have been carried out}} by the following methods.

Impact loading {{at one end}} of the cement mortar bar was given by using the air gun. The stress wave picked up by the wire strain gage was recorded on the <b>synchroscope.</b> At first the propagation and reflection of stress wave in the cement mortar bar without fracture was studied. Then, the speed of projectile from the air gun was increased in order to produce the fracture. Specimens of four cases of cross areas were used.

40|$|The {{intense heat}} flux to the {{electrode}} at the arc turminus dictates the design limitation of arc plasma devices. The energy flux {{due to the}} electron current {{is found to be}} the dominant mechanism. The net energy transfer to an anode is far noticeable to a cathode. Therefore a considerable effort has expended in attempt to achieve a good understanding of the anode-phenomena. The longitudinally segmented nozzle anode was used to examine the anode phenomena. This anode was composed of the mutually insulated four sections. Each segmented anode current was measured by the ammeter which was set in the individual anode circuit, and its waveform was observed by dual beam <b>synchroscope.</b> At the same time another <b>synchroscope</b> was used to examine the waveform of the arc voltage. In case of the total arc current being 10 amp., the arc current was concentrated at a downstream end of the anode throat. Its arc turminus fixed there steadily and its attachment area was small. It was shown that, increasing with the total arc current, the segmented anode current distribution shifts gradually its peak value to the upstream segments of the anode nozzle. For the arc current from 15 to 45 amp., the anode spot moved swiftly {{in the form of the}} restrike mode. The mean velocity of anode arc turminus which was determined from electrical measurement was of the order of 20 ? 150 m/sec. As the gas flow rate a increased, its velocity getting faster. Over 50 amp. the steady mode prevailed again, but the anode arc turminus expanded in its size and moved up to the adjacent upstream segments. In case the total current less than 45 amp. segmented anode current distribution was independent of the argon gas flow rate. When the total arc current increased over 50 amp., the influence of the gas flow rate became considerable, and with increasing the gas flow rate the segmented anode current distribution drifted to the downstream. The arc voltage was dependent on the anode attachment position. As the anode arc turminus shifted to downstream, the value of the arc voltage increased...|$|E
40|$|Power system {{restoration}} is well {{recognized as}} one of the key technologies to improve the reliability of power systems. Generally, the restoration process is divided into several stages as preparation, system restoration, load restoration, synchronization and inter-connection. Currently, re-closure of breakers is done by field crews with <b>synchroscope.</b> A novel methodology, entitled as 'virtual synchroscope', is proposed in this paper. By utilizing Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), the proposed methodology compares phasors of voltages at connection points from the two islands with the accurately time-stamped measurements. By adjusting voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase angle in the control center, all the requirements for synchronization are satisfied and the synchronization can be implemented. A case study on a power system is presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. It is proved that the proposed method can meet the requirements of all standards and resulting in smooth synchronization. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe 2011 International Conference on Advanced Power System Automation and Protection (APAP 2011), Beijing, China, 16 - 20 October 2011.

In the non-transferred mode of operation, the arc circuit is completed within the front electrode, and the plasma jet being projected through the nozzle.
