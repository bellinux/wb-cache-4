40|$|A {{series of}} N-substituted analogs {{based upon the}} spiropiperidine core of the lead {{compound}} <b>Spiroxatrine</b> was synthesized. In particular, the new compounds were obtained by replacing the benzodioxane moiety of the <b>Spiroxatrine</b> with several 2 -substituted 1, 3 -dioxolanes. Thus the designed derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as possible NOP receptor ligands. As a conclusion of these studies, the new triazaspirodecanone derivatives showed unique and significant SAR as NOP receptor agonists. In particular, the present study demonstrated that 1 -phenyl- 1, 3, 8 -triazaspiro[4. 5]decan- 4 -one portion together with appropriate 1, 3 -dioxolane substituents {{could lead to a}} new promising class of NOP receptor ligands...|$|E

Moreover, cis diastereoisomers of the hydroxyl derivatives 4 and 22 show a moderately higher degree of stereoselectivity than trans isomers.

40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} effect of 17 β-estradiol {{pretreatment}} on the function and expression of α 2 - adrenergic receptors (ARs) subtypes in late pregnancy in rats. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 37) were treated with 17 β-estradiol for 4 days starting from the 18 th day of pregnancy. The myometrial expression of the α 2 -AR subtypes was determined by real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. In vitro contractions were stimulated with (-) -noradrenaline, and its effect was modified with the selective antagonists BRL 44408 (α 2 A), ARC 239 (α 2 B/C), and <b>spiroxatrine</b> (α 2 A). The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was also measured. The activated G-protein level was investigated by guanosine 5 ’-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS) binding assay. Results 17 β-estradiol pretreatment decreased the contractile effect of (-) -noradrenaline via the α 2 -ARs, and abolished the contractile effect via the α 2 B-ARs. All the α 2 -AR subtypes’ mRNA was significantly decreased. 17 β-estradiol pretreatment significantly increased the myometrial cAMP level {{in the presence of}} BRL 44408 (P = 0. 001), ARC 239 (P = 0. 007), and <b>spiroxatrine</b> (P = 0. 045), but did not modify it in the presence of <b>spiroxatrine</b> + BRL 44408 combination (P = 0. 073). It also inhibited the G-protein-activating effect of (-) -noradrenaline by 25 % in the presence of BRL 44408 + <b>spiroxatrine</b> combination. Conclusions The expression of the α 2 -AR subtypes is sensitive to 17 β-estradiol, which decreases the contractile response of (-) -noradrenaline via the α 2 B-AR subtype, and might cause changes in G-protein signaling pathway. Estrogen dysregulation may be responsible for preterm labor or uterine inertia via the α 2 -AR...|$|E
40|$|Nociceptin or orphanin FQ peptide (N/OFQ) was {{identified}} in 1995 as the endogenous ligand for the opioid receptor ORL- 1, actually denominated NOP, a fourth {{member of the}} classical μ, δ and κ opioid receptors family.

Therefore, NOP receptor represents an interesting target {{for the development of}} new therapeutical agentsagainst the acute cancer pain. On the basis of the confirmed affinity towards NOP receptor of the alpha 2 adrenergic and 5 -HT 1 A partial agonist spiroxatrine(Ki= 127 nM), we focused our attention on the design, synthesis and characterization of novel NOP receptor ligands with a spiropiperidine portion. The aim was to study the effects of some structural modifications on the 1, 4 -benzodioxane moiety ofspiroxatrine. In particular, we carried out: 1) isosteric replacement of C 8 with a nitrogen atom; 2) disconnection of 1 - 8 a and 4 - 4 a bonds of <b>spiroxatrine</b> and of its nitrogen isosteres to give derivatives with a primary or a secondary alcoholic group respectively (2 - 5); 3) replacement of 1, 4 -benzodioxane moiety of <b>spiroxatrine</b> with a 1 -benzhydryloxy-propan- 2 -ol and 2 -benzhydryloxy-propan- 1 -ol moiety in order to increase the steric hindrance (6 - 7).

40|$|In the dog {{saphenous vein}} α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptors mediate noradrenaline-induced contractions in vitro. In order {{to study the}} α 2 -adrenoceptor in isolation, α 1 -adrenoceptors were inactivated by {{treatment}} of tissues with the alkylating agent phenoxybenzamine (3. 0 [*]μM for 30 [*]min) {{in the presence of}} rauwolscine (1 [*]μM) to protect α 2 -adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline-induced contractions of tissues treated with phenoxybenzamine were antagonized competitively by the selective α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine, pKB= 8. 63 ± 0. 07 (means±s. e. mean; n= 3), consistent with an interaction at α 2 -adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline was a full agonist at α 2 -adrenoceptors in dog saphenous vein. By use of the method of partial receptor alkylation and analysis of concentration-effect curve data by direct, operational model fitting methods, the affinity (pKA) and efficacy (τ) were 5. 74 ± 0. 07 and 7. 50 ± 1. 05, respectively (n= 6). Nine other agonists which were examined each had affinities higher than noradrenaline, but {{with the exception of the}} imidazoline, A- 54741 (5, 6 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 1 -naphthyl-imidazoline) had relatively lower efficacies. To compare the α 2 -adrenoceptor in dog saphenous vein to the human recombinant subtypes, the affinities of twenty-one compounds were estimated in functional studies in the dog saphenous vein and in radioligand binding studies for the human α 2 A, α 2 B and α 2 C receptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells. Of twenty-one compounds examined in ligand binding studies, only nine had greater than ten fold selectivity for one human receptor subtype over either of the other two. These compounds were A- 54741, oxymetazoline, guanfacine, guanabenz, prazosin, <b>spiroxatrine,</b> tolazoline, WB 4101 and idazoxan. In dog saphenous vein, their affinities (pKA and pKB for agonists and antagonists respectively) were: A- 54741 (pKA= 8. 03 ± 0. 05), oxymetazoline (pKA= 7. 67 ± 0. 09), guanfacine (pKA= 6. 79 ± 0. 03); guanabenz (pKA= 7. 02 ± 0. 13); prazosin (pKB= 5. 19 ± 0. 08), <b>spiroxatrine</b> (pKB= 6. 59 ± 0. 04), tolazoline (pKB= 6. 21 ± 0. 07), WB 4101 (pKB= 7. 42 ± 0. 09) and idazoxan (pKB= 7. 11 ± 0. 08). Comparisons of affinity estimates for these nine compounds at the receptor in dog saphenous vein and at the human recombinant subtypes suggest that the vascular receptor is most similar to the h α 2 A subtype; correlation coefficients (r) were 0. 82 (h α 2 A), 0. 24 (h α 2 B) and 0. 04 (h α 2 C) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiroxatrine</b> was {{identified}} as a moderately potent (Ki= 118 [*]nM) but non-selective agonist at the human nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor, ORL 1.

NNC 63 - 0532 showed only moderate affinity for the following receptors (Ki values in parentheses) : μ-opioid (140 [*]nM), κ-opioid (405 [*]nM), dopamine D 2 S (209 [*]nM), dopamine D 3 (133 [*]nM) and dopamine D 4. 4 (107 [*]nM) out of 75 different receptors, ion-channels and transporters. In functional assays, NNC 63 - 0532 was shown to be an agonist at ORL 1 (EC 50 = 305 [*]nM), a much weaker agonist at the μ-opioid receptor (EC 50 > 10 [*]μM) and an antagonist or weak partial agonist at dopamine D 2 S (IC 50 = 2830 [*]nM). Thus, NNC 63 - 0532 is a novel non-peptide agonist with ∼ 12 fold selectivity for ORL 1 and may be useful for exploring the physiological roles of this receptor owing to its brain-penetrating properties...|$|E
40|$|Although {{conscious}} {{dogs have}} often been used for colonic motility studies with 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), the effects of 5 -HT on the isolated colon have not been thoroughly characterized yet. The current study was undertaken to characterize the response to 5 -HT of the canine isolated colon longitudinal muscle. Longitudinal strips of canine midcolon deprived of (sub) mucosa were prepared for isotonic measurement. 5 -HT induced contractions from 3 [*]nM onwards, which were not affected by selective inhibition of 5 -HT re-uptake, monoamine oxidase or blockade of α-adrenoceptors. Tetrodotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM) {{did not affect the}} responses to 5 -HT, suggesting that smooth muscle 5 -HT receptors are involved. The selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist SB 204070 (10 [*]nM) slightly enhanced contractions to 5 -HT and therefore it was included in the organ bath solution in all further experiments. The 5 -HT 1 and 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist methysergide (0. 1 [*]μM) depressed the curve to 5 -HT, but the selective 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist granisetron (0. 3 [*]μM) had no effect. Besides 5 -HT, α-methyl- 5 -HT (α-Me- 5 -HT), 5 -methoxytryptamine (5 -MeOT), 2 -methyl- 5 -HT (2 -Me- 5 -HT) and 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT) also induced contractions, with the following rank order of potency (pEC 50 values in parentheses) : 5 -HT (6. 9) =α-methyl- 5 -HT (6. 9) > 2 -Me- 5 -HT (5. 8) = 5 -MeOT (5. 7) = 5 -CT (5. 6), indicative of 5 -HT 2 receptor involvement. α-Me- 5 -HT produced a bell-shaped curve, which was not affected by α-adrenoceptor blockade. 5 -HT, 5 -MeOT, 2 -Me- 5 -HT and 5 -CT produced a monophasic concentration-response curve, consistent with an interaction with a single receptor site. 8 -Hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) and tryptamine only induced contractions at a concentration exceeding 1 [*]μM. The selective 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonist SB 204741 (0. 3 [*]μM) did not affect the curve to 5 -HT. Ketanserin, cisapride and <b>spiroxatrine</b> behaved as competitive antagonists with pKb values of, respectively, 8. 4, 8. 1 and 6. 7. <b>Spiroxatrine</b> (1 [*]μM) shifted the curve to 5 -MeOT rightward yielding an apparent pA 2 of 7. 1. Other antagonists at 5 -HT 2 A receptors also surmountably inhibited the contractions to 5 -HT (apparent pA 2 value in parentheses) : mesulergine (8. 2), cinanserin (8. 2), yohimbine (6. 2) and mianserin (8. 6). However, as well as a rightward shift, methiothepin (8. 3), pizotifen (8. 6) and spiperone (8. 8) also caused a depression of the curve, indicative of ‘pseudo-irreversible' antagonism. Taken together, the above mentioned affinity estimates most closely corresponded to literature affinity values for 5 -HT 2 A receptors. It was concluded that 5 -HT induces contractions of the canine midcolon longitudinal muscle primarily by stimulation of smooth muscle 5 -HT 2 A receptors. The presence of inhibitory 5 -HT 4 receptors cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKinetic {{on and off}} rate {{constants}} {{for many}} receptor ligands are difficult to determine with regular radioligand binding technique since only few of the ligands are available in labeled form. Here we developed a new and simple radioligand binding method for determining the kinetic off-rate constant for unlabeled ligands, using whole cells expressing α 2 A- and α 2 C-adrenoceptors. The new method involves pre-incubation with unlabeled ligand, centrifugation of microtiter plates in order to adhere the cells to the bottom surface, and then upside-down centrifugation of the plates for few seconds to wash away the non-bound fraction of the pre-incubated ligand. The final on-reaction assay for the radioligand is then started by quick addition of a relatively fast-associating radioligand to the cells. The curve obtained is defined by a fairly simple mathematical formula that reflects the simultaneous dissociation of pre-incubated ligand and association of the radioligand. The method proved to produce highly reproducible results in determining the koff constants for various unlabeled ligands. The {{results show that the}} α 2 C-selectivity of MK 912 depends mainly on a very slow off-rate at the α 2 C-adrenoceptor subtype. Regarding the markedly α 2 C- over α 2 A-selective compound <b>spiroxatrine,</b> its much faster on-rate at α 2 C- than α 2 A-adrenoceptors explains much of its exceptional α 2 C-selectivity. Several new techniques for determining the kinetic component of ligand-receptor interactions at molecular level are currently developing. As a reference, based on standard radioligand binding techniques, the present study describes a simple and robust experimental and mathematical procedure for determining koff constants of unlabeled drugs...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} pre- and post-junctional responsiveness in vas deferens from wild-type and α 2 A/D-adrenoceptor knockout mice. The {{response to a}} single stimulus was not significantly different between wild-type and knock-out mice. The isometric contraction to 10 Hz stimulation for 4 s was significantly larger in vas deferens from knockout as compared with wild-type. The maximum potentiation of 10 Hz stimulation-evoked contractions by yohimbine was to 206. 2 ± 38. 0 % of control in wild-type but to 135. 8 ± 13. 6 % of control in knockout. The α 2 A/D-adrenoceptor selective antagonist BRL 44408 significantly increased the 10 Hz stimulation-evoked contraction in wild-type but not knockout, and the reverse was true for the α 2 C-adrenoceptor selective antagonist <b>spiroxatrine.</b> The α 2 B-adrenoceptor antagonist imiloxan {{had no effect on}} the evoked contraction except at high concentrations, and only in wild-type. Following cocaine (3 μM) and BRL 44408 (1 μM), 10 Hz responses were similar in shape and maximum between wild-type and knock-out. The α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist xylazine virtually abolished the early component of the contraction to 10 Hz stimulation in the presence of nifedipine (10 μM) in vas deferens from knockout mice in a way consistent with a change of receptor subtype but without clear evidence for a reduced receptor number. However, the late component of the contraction to 10 Hz stimulation was significantly potentiated by xylazine in tissues from knock-out mice. It is concluded that, although non-α 2 A/D-adrenoceptors replace α 2 D-adrenoceptors in this knockout, the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist data are contradictory. The antagonist data suggest a major loss of prejunctional α 2 -adrenoceptors, but this is not necessarily supported by the agonist data...|$|E
40|$|Determination of the {{physiologic}} {{roles of}} serotonin (5 -HT) {{has long been}} hampered {{by the lack of}} compounds specific for certain of the 5 -HT receptor subtypes. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize vascular serotonin receptors in certain arteries and to develop functional assays for the putative 5 -HT₁(A) and 5 -HT₂ receptors in vascular tissue to test novel compounds. Although 5 -HT₁(A) receptor involvement in the 5 -HT contraction of the canine basilar artery was previously reported, the 8 -OH-DPAT (5 -HT₁(A) specific agonist) EC₅₀ values in the canine, rabbit, guinea pig, and bovine basilar arteries studies were not consistent with the presence of 5 -HT₁(A) receptors. Studies examining the 5 -HT₂ selective antagonist ketanserin, several novel aryltryptamines with a range of affinities, and enantiomers of <b>spiroxatrine,</b> in the 5 -HT-contracted rat aorta showed a good correlation between the aorta affinities and the affinities of these compounds at the [³H] ketanserin binding site (defined as 5 -HT₂) in the rat frontal cortex. Comparison of the affinities of several known and novel compounds in the rat aorta and the rabbit femoral artery to the [³H] ketanserin site affinities in the frontal cortices of both species showed that the rabbit femoral artery 5 -HT₂-like receptor was similar but not identical to either the rat aorta or the CNS sites from either species. The rabbit aorta and the rat femoral artery were then examined to determine if the 5 -HT₂ receptor heterogeneity was species or vascular bed specific. The results from all four vascular tissues showed that no two tissues had identical responses to the compounds studied. The rat aorta appeared unique in the lack of agonist activity of RU 24969 and the non-competitive antagonism of 5 -HT by methysergide, but correlated to the CNS site for the affinities of all compounds. The major finding of the dissertation was the definitive evidence for vascular 5 -HT₂ receptor heterogeneity; this subtype was previously thought to be homogeneous. Development of more selective compounds for 5 -HT receptor subtypes may lead to greater understanding of the physiological roles of serotonin...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of NMDA receptor open-channel blockers [Mg 2 +; (+) - 5 -methyl- 10, 11 -dihydro- 5 H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten- 5, 10 -imine maleate (MK- 801); 1 -amino- 3, 5 -dimethyladamantane (memantine) ] and TTX, high concentrations (30 – 100 μM) of either 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) or α-methyl- 5 -hydroxytryptamine (α-Me- 5 -HT) significantly potentiated NMDA-induced depolarizations of frog spinal cord motoneurones. Potentiation was blocked by LY- 53, 857 (10 – 30 μM), SB 206553 (10 μM), and SB 204741 (30 μM), but not by <b>spiroxatrine</b> (10 μM), WAY 100, 635 (1 – 30 μM), ketanserin (10 μM), RS 102221 (10 μM), or RS 39604 (10 – 20 μM). Therefore, α-Me- 5 -HT's facilitatory effects appear to involve 5 -HT 2 B receptors. These effects were G-protein dependent as they were prevented by prior treatment with guanylyl- 5 ′-imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP, 100 μM) and H-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp-D-Trp-Met-NH 2 (GP antagonist 2 A, 3 – 6 μM), but not by pertussis toxin (PTX, 3 – 6 ng ml− 1, 48 h preincubation). This potentiation was not reduced by protein kinase C inhibition with staurosporine (2. 0 μM), U 73122 (10 μM) or N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide HCl (H 9) (77 μM) or by intracellular Ca 2 + depletion with thapsigargin (0. 1 μM) (which inhibits Ca 2 +/ATPase). Exposure of the spinal cord to the L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers nifedipine (10 μM), KN- 62 (5 μM) or gallopamil (100 μM) eliminated α-Me- 5 -HT's effects. The calmodulin antagonist N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphtalenesulfonamide (W 7) (100 μM) diminished the potentiation. However, the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM Kinase II) blocker KN- 93 (10 μM) did not block the 5 -HT enhancement of the NMDA responses. In summary, activation of 5 -HT 2 B receptors by α-Me- 5 -HT facilitates NMDA-depolarizations of frog motoneurones via a G-protein, a rise in [Ca 2 +]i from the entry of extracellular Ca 2 + through L-type Ca 2 + channels, the binding of Ca 2 + to calmodulin and a lessening of the Mg 2 + -produced open-channel block of the NMDA receptor...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of 5 -HT 1 A-recognition sites and receptor-mediated release of intracellular calcium {{were established in}} two transfected HeLa cell lines (HA 6 and HA 7) expressing different levels of human 5 -HT 1 A receptors (about 3000 and 500 fmol/mg protein, Fargin et al. 1989; 1991; Raymond et al. 1989). The pharmacological profiles of the binding (determined with [H- 3] 8 -OH-DPAT) and the calcium response (measured using Fura- 2) were clearly of the 5 -HT 1 A type. Compounds such as 5 -HT, 5 -CT and 8 -OH-DPAT acted as full agonists on the calcium response in both HeLa cell lines. In addition, methiothepin, pindolol, NAN 190 and SDZ 216 - 525 (Seller et al. 1991) acted as silent and potent antagonists. Marked differences were observed in the responses mediated in the two cell lines. EC 50 values of agonists (particularly 5 -HT, 5 -CT, flesinoxan and 8 -OH-DPAT) were higher in HA 7 cells (up to 80 -fold) than in other 5 -HT 1 A receptor models (e. g. inhibition of adenylate cyclase in calf hippocampus). Further, a variety of compounds (ipsapirone, buspirone, <b>spiroxatrine,</b> MDL 73005) acted as agonists in HA 6 cells, whereas they behaved as silent antagonists in HA 7 cells (which express fewer receptors). By contrast, K(B) values for antagonist's were comparable in HA 6 and HA 7 cells. The present data show that EC 50 values and intrinsic activity for a given drug are subject to large variations depending {{on the number of}} receptors expressed in the target tissue. The results obtained in HA 6 cells are comparable with respect to both potency and efficacy to those observed in calf or mouse hippocampus (inhibition of forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase) whereas the results obtained in HA 7 cells are similar to those reported in mouse cortex (which was suggested to represent an atypical subtype of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor). Since the agonist activity of a given compound at the same receptor can vary markedly, the present data show that intrinsic activity is not only ligand-dependent but also varies with the receptor-effector system studied. In addition, {{there seems to be no}} simple way to make predictions about intrinsic activity, since that feature is model-dependent...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was twofold: {{pharmacologically}} characterize novel ligands and set-up and validate novel in vitro assays for nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) and classical opioid receptors. NOP and opioid receptors are 7 TM receptors coupled with inhibitory G proteins; receptor activation leads to the inhibition of cAMP formation and calcium currents, and opening of potassium channels. Via these cellular inhibitory mechanisms, the N/OFQ – NOP receptor and classical opioid systems regulate a variety of biological functions both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. The calcium mobilization assay has been and still is broadly used as primary screening for novel molecules in academic and industrial in vitro pharmacology laboratories. The use of chimeric G proteins allows to extend the calcium mobilization assay to virtually all types of G protein coupled receptors. This approach was previously used in our laboratories for characterizing NOP receptor ligands. In the frame {{of the present study}}, the calcium mobilization assay has been extended and validated for classical opioid receptors using a panel of standard opioid receptor agonists and antagonist. This test was used for investigating the pharmacological profile of novel opioid ligands including a series of morphine and oxymorphone analogues and novel cyclic endomorphin- 2 derivatives. Calcium mobilization studies together with classical in vitro assays such as receptor binding, [35 S]GTPγS binding and bioassays with isolated organs were applied to novel NOP receptor ligands including i) 3 different series of <b>spiroxatrine</b> derivatives; ii) the antagonist NiK- 21273; iii) [X 5]N/OFQ(1 - 13) -NH 2 derivatives; iv) three tetrabranched derivatives of N/OFQ generated with an innovative chemical approach named peptide welding technology. Recent data demonstrated that biased agonists, i. e. receptor ligands able to select which signaling pathways become activated upon binding to the receptor, may display advantages over unbiased ligands. In particular, in the field of opioids, G-protein (vs arrestin) biased agonists for the mu receptor displayed an increased therapeutic index associated to reduced tolerance liability. No data are yet available about biased agonism in the NOP receptor field. Therefore a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) based assay was set-up for the NOP receptor. This method that allows to study both NOP/G-protein and NOP/β-arrestin interactions has been validated using a large panel of NOP ligands encompassing full and partial agonist as well as antagonist activity. The comparison of data achieved investigating NOP/G-protein and NOP/β-arrestin interaction allowed us to perform the very first study of biased agonism in the NOP receptor field. In summary the studies performed in the frame of my PhD project extend our knowledge on the pharmacological profile of NOP and classical opioid receptors, provided to the scientific community novel compounds, pharmacologically characterized in detail, to be used as research tools and possibly as drug prototypes, and made available novel pharmacological assays useful for selecting fully innovative drugs such NOP receptor biased agonists...|$|E
