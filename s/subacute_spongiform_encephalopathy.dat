40|$|SUMMARY Electron {{microscopic}} {{changes in}} brain biopsies from two cases of <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> are described. Large vacuoles seen in astrocytic and neuronal processes were sur-rounded {{by one or}} more concentric membranes. Dense-core vesicles were found in axonal endings and in nerve cell perikarya; these particles could represent catecholamine-containing vesicles. <b>Subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is a rela-tively rare disease. Although the clinical and electroencephalographical features are well de-fined (Goldhammer, Bubis, Sarova-Pinhas, and Braham, 1972), a definitive diagnosis during life can be made only by cerebral biopsy. During the last few years the main changes have been well described in several papers dealing with the electron microscopical appearance of brain obtained by biopsy.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of a new amphotericin B derivative, MS- 8209, in delaying scrapie, hamsters were infected intracerebrally with the 263 K scrapie agent and treated with MS- 8209 either early {{in the course of}} the disease or continuously. The results show that (i) all treatments lengthened the incubation period of hamster scrapie, (ii) continuous treatment with MS- 8209 doubled the length of the incubation period compared with that observed in infected, untreated animals, and (iii) all treatments delayed the accumulation of a proteinase-resistant prion protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the brain. These findings suggest that MS- 8209 is a powerful tool for investigating the pathogenesis of transmissible <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> Experimental scrapie in hamsters is a simple, reproducible model of transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (TSE) which have been described for many mammalian species. TSE include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and scrapie in sheep and goats. These fatal diseases are characterized by a long incubation period and histopathological changes such as neuronal vacuolization and astrogliosis in the central nervous system. TSE are caused by as-yet-unknown infectious agent...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the pathogenesis of}} scrapie and other human and animal spontaneous and experimental <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (SSE) are presented here. In particular, it is speculated that a PrPsc 27 - 30 -induced suppression of host's defense system is responsible, through {{the existence of the}} different and synergistically operating mechanisms, for the absence of any documented inflammatory or immunologic response during SSE. This could be therapeutically counterparted by the utilization of cytokines (TNF, IL- 1, etc) or cytokine-inducers, provided that synthesis and secretion of the above inflammation mediators on behalf of reticulo-endothelial cells were strongly depressed by PrP 27 - 30, as suggested. Finally, some hypotheses are also made in relation to the blood-brain-barrier's integrity in susceptible hosts. Similarly to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in man, this could play a role also in SSE pathogenesis, facilitating cerebral localization of metals such as aluminum, lead, or silica, which have already been shown to enhance amyloid fibrils' polymerization and deposition within human brain tissue.

40|$|Ten {{patients}} with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, including three cases of trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), developed a chronic myoclonic disorder. The technique of jerk-locked averaging of EEG activity {{was used to}} analyze the myoclonus. Seven subjects demonstrated a focal, contralateral central, negative cerebral potential antecedent to the myoclonic jerks.

40|$|Following {{intracerebral}} {{infection of}} hamsters with scrapie agent replication started {{with or without}} a very short lag phase. Infectivity titres increased exponentially within 35 to 40 days post-infection toa maximum level of 3 x l 09 LDso per brain and then remained constant until death. Minimal detectable amounts of scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) appeared at 42 days and reached high levels 56 days after inoculation. The first clinical symptoms were diagnosed at about 65 days and animals died after 85 to 95 days. These data confirm earlier results in which peripheral infection first revealed agent replication, then SAF formation and finally clinical disease. Unconventional virus diseases, therefore, can best be described as virus-induced, organ-specific amyloidoses, The scrapie agent is an unconventional slow virus. Such viruses cause <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> in animals and man leading to death after a comparatively short progressive clinical course of disease.

40|$|Prions are {{proteinaceous}} pathogens {{responsible for}} <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> in animals and humans. The prions responsible for bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (BSE) are zoonotic agents, causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. The transfer of prions between species {{is limited by}} a species barrier, which is thought to reflect structural incompatibilities between the host cellular prion protein (PrPC) and the infecting pathological PrP assemblies (PrPSc) constituting the prion. A BSE strain variant, designated L-BSE and responsible for atypical, supposedly spontaneous forms of prion diseases in aged cattle, demonstrates zoonotic potential, as evidenced by its capacity to propagate more easily than classical BSE in transgenic mice expressing human PrPC and in nonhuman primates. In humanized mice, L-BSE propagates without any apparent species barrier and shares similar biochemical PrPSc signatures with the CJD subtype designated MM 2 -cortical, thus opening the possibility that certain CJD cases classified as sporadic may actually originate from L-type BSE cross-transmission. To address this issue, we compared the biological properties of L-BSE and those of a panel of CJD subtypes representative of the human prion strain diversity using standard strain-typing criteria in human PrP transgenic mice. We {{found no evidence that}} L-BSE causes a known form of sporadic CJD. IMPORTANCE Since the quasi-extinction of classical BSE, atypical BSE forms are the sole BSE variants circulating in cattle worldwide. They are observed in rare cases of old cattle, making them difficult to detect. Extrapolation of our results suggests that L-BSE may propagate in humans as an unrecognized form of CJD, and we urge both the continued utilization of precautionary measures to eliminate these agents from the human food chain and active surveillance for CJD phenotypes in the general population...|$|R

The autopsy confirmed <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> but no evident neuronal loss was observed. An acute clinical course of CJD may explain this latter histological finding which, in turn, probably provides an explanation for the absence of intellectual impairment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is a <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> {{characterized}} by rapidly progressive dementia, hard to diagnose during life. Materials and Methods: We present {{a case of}} a patient with pathologically confirmed sporadic form of CJD in whom initial diagnostic tests were negative. Two sequential brain single-photon emission computed tomography with Tc- 99 m ethyl-cysteinate dimer were performed, the first one was performed few days after the admission into hospital and the second, 1 month later.

40|$|A 45 {{year old}} woman is {{reported}} who initially {{presented with a}} cerebellar syn-drome, severe ataxia, and dysarthria. She rapidly deteriorated to coma vigile with bilateral myoclonic jerks, flexion rigidity, and immobility necessitating complete nursing. Her EEG showed generalised slow activity and periodic biphasic and triphasic waves. The CSF concentration of neuron specific enolase was very high. Consequently the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was established. Eight months later she died of respiratory com-plications. Thirty years earlier the patient had undergone corneal transplantation for keratoconus. Review of the organ donor’s hospital records showed that death was caused by intercurrent pneu-monia subsequent to <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> confirmed by necropsy.

40|$|The <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> are prion {{diseases}} characterized by acute and rapid neurodegeneration {{that lead to}} the death of the patient within months to a few years. The epidemiology of CJD is complicated and the frequency in Mexico is unknown. We aim to describe the cases of prion disease in Mexico. Consecutive patients who met the diagnostic criteria by the WHO were enrolled. We describe 26 patients with clinical manifestations, imaging and laboratory studies compatible with prion disease. The mean age at onset was 52 years old. The main clinical manifestations were cognitive alterations (69 %) followed by extrapyramidal movements (50 %), abnormal cerebellar function (46 %), behavioral alterations (46 %), myoclonus (46 %) and mood depression (23 %), among other features. Half of the patients progressed rapidly to a state of akinetic mutism (53 %). Only 2 (7. 6 %) patients had a family history of a similar disease. Time interval between onset and diagnosis varied between 71 days to 24 months, with a median of 6 months. The classical bilateral basal ganglia hyperintensities were present in the very early stage of the disease. Protein 14 - 3 - 3 immuneassay in the CSF was positive in all measured cases. Bilateral basal ganglia hyperintensities was the most important early finding, while protein 14 - 3 - 3 was a late finding and the results were usually obtained after the patient was discharged. Around 1. 5 cases of CJD cases per year are reported in our country. When suspected, MRI can support the diagnosis earlier than other studies...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A {{patient is}} {{described}} who showed subacute dementia and ataxia and, finally, acute ascending polyradiculoneuritis. At necropsy, {{together with the}} cerebral and cerebellar lesions that are typical of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the lesions of the spinal motor neurones, the spinal ganglia, and of the roots and peripheral nerves were analogous {{with those of the}} Guillain-Barre-Landry syndrome. The aetiological possibility is discussed either that this is a simple and unique association, or that the disorder is related to the virus nature of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a progressive slow viral disorder in man caused by a transmissible agent whose precise nature remains obscure, {{as is the case with}} kuru in man, scrapie in sheep and goats, and mink encephalopathy, all of which are similarly <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> viral <b>encephalopathies.</b> The neuropathological features include spongy changes of the grey matter with neuronal loss and astroglial hyperplasia, affecting the cerebral cortex, striatum...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Public {{health and}} {{agricultural}} policy attempts to keep bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> out of North America using infectious disease containment policies. Inconsistencies of the infectious disease model {{as it applies}} to the <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> may result in failure of these policies. METHODS: Review of historical, political and scientific literature to determine the appropriate disease model of <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> has always occurred sporadically in man and other animals. Hippocrates may have described it in goats and cattle. Transmission of <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> between individuals is too uncommon for it to be usefully considered an infection. <b>Spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is a somatic disorder whose dissemination within a host or transmission between individuals is more like cancer than infectious disease. <b>Spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> transmission within a species is facilitated in comparison to transmission between species so that cannibalism may amplify the prevalence of the disease. CONCLUSION: Agricultural policy should be directed toward an absolute prohibition on occult cannibalism and away from surveillance, quarantine and slaughter, the principal measures of infectious disease containment used to control bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy...</b>|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSis The {{correlation}} between {{the appearance of the}} characteristic electroencephalographic abnormality, cardinal clinical manifestations, and neuropathological features was studied in four cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome consisting of <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> and classical Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Consideration is given to the differences in the electroencephalographic findings between these two subgroups of the syndrome and on the underlying pathological mechanism. Since Jones and Nevin first described the electroen-cephalographic (EEG) abnormalities of Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome in 1954, the periodic, generalised, and three to four phased complexes of sharp and slow waves (periodic synchronous discharges) have been regarded as the most useful clue to the diagnosis of this syndrome. However, the reported incidence of the periodic synchronous discharges in the EEG of patients with this syndrome has varied from 50 to 900 and the electroencephalographic, clinical, and neuro...|$|E
40|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is {{increasingly}} being reported {{over the last}} three decades as a result of heightened awareness of the disease. Various studies have reported annual incidence of 0. 5 - 1. 5 cases of CJD per million of general population. In India, the disease is still under reported. Over the period spanning from 1968 - 1997, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore recorded 69 cases of CJD from different parts of India in the CJD registry. This paper describes the clinical experience with cases of CJD managed at the Department of Neurology, G. B. Pant Hospital, New Delhi from 1990 - 1998. In this series, {{the mean age of the}} patients was 53. 80 (&#x 002 B;/- 7. 32) years and there were 5 females and 5 males. Myoclonus was present in all the cases and abnormal behaviour with or without other features was the presenting complaint in 7 of the 10 patients, while one patient of CJD had cerebellar ataxia as the presenting feature. One patient with occipital variant of CJD presented with acute onset cortical blindness and myoclonic jerks. One of the patients had acute psychosis precipitated by emotional stress at the onset. Extrapyramidal features were noted in 7 of the 10 patients before death. The mean duration of symptoms from the onset of disease to death was 6. 6 (&#x 002 B;/- 6. 11) months. Classical EEG changes were observed in all the patients, except in one possible case of occipital variant of CJD, where we did not have access to EEG record.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of scrapie, a transmissible <b>subacute</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> is unclear. However, {{certain aspects}} of the known cellular and molecular neuropathology in scrapie led us to hypothesize that cytokines could mediate cerebral pathological changes in this neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, expression of multiple cytokine genes in the brain and peripheral organs of scrapie-infected mice was examined. Late in the course of scrapie, expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha), and IL- 1 beta mRNA was markedly increased in the brain but not the spleen, kidneys, or liver. In time course studies, scrapie-infected mice exhibited increased cerebral expression of the TNF-alpha, IL- 1 alpha, and IL- 1 beta mRNAs by week 15 postinoculation [...] a time point that coincided with the onset of clinical symptoms. Thereafter, the levels of these cytokine transcripts increased progressively to the terminal stages of of the disease (week 25). To determine the relationship of the increased cerebral expression of the cytokine mRNAs to the development of pathological changes in scrapie, we examined the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene (a marker for astrocytosis) and the murine acute-phase response gene homologous to the alpha 1 -antichymotrypsin gene (designated EB 22 / 5. 3). Markedly increased expression of both the glial fibrillary acidic protein and EB 22 / 5. 3 mRNAs was observed in the brain but not the peripheral organs of scrapie-infected mice. The increased expression of both these gene products also occurred at week 15 of infection and, thereafter, increased progressively to the terminal stages of the disease. Therefore, infection of mice with scrapie resulted in significant increases in the expression of the TNF-alpha, IL- 1 alpha, and IL- 1 beta gene products, whose pattern correlated with the onset and development of molecular and clinical pathological changes. Since scrapie is known not to evoke an immune response, the present findings strongly suggest the existence of a localized cerebral host response to the agent during which proinflammatory cytokines could be key pathogenic mediators...|$|E
