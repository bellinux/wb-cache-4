5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey was just a population of a South American species of <b>squirrel</b> monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey and the large gap from the range of any other <b>squirrel</b> monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 {{survey of}} the {{literature}} reported that in India, there were several records of albino mammals including the tiger, lesser rat-tailed bat, chital, common palm civet, Northern palm <b>squirrel</b> five-striped palm <b>squirrel</b> and wild boar.|$|E
5|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey differs in {{coloration}} from South American <b>squirrel</b> monkeys. While South American <b>squirrel</b> monkeys tend to {{be primarily}} greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E

50|$|The Xerinae {{comprise}} a subfamily of <b>squirrels,</b> {{many of which}} are highly terrestrial. It includes the tribes Marmotini (marmots, chipmunks, prairie dogs, and other Holarctic ground <b>squirrels),</b> Xerini (African and some Eurasian ground <b>squirrels),</b> and Protoxerini (African tree <b>squirrels).</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey in {{the wild}} is unknown, but captive specimens {{have been known to}} live more than 15 years. Other <b>squirrel</b> monkey species are known to be able to live more than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow <b>squirrel</b> monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2001. As {{part of the}} Conker video game series, the game follows the story of Conker the <b>Squirrel,</b> a greedy, heavy-drinking red <b>squirrel</b> who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.|$|E
5000|$|American red <b>squirrels</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Eurasian red <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus vulgaris); since the ranges of these species do not overlap, they are both commonly referred to as [...] "red squirrels" [...] in the areas where they are native. The specific epithet hudsonicus refers to Hudson Bay, Canada, where the species was first catalogued by Erxleben in 1771. A recent phylogeny suggests the <b>squirrels</b> as a family can be divided into five major lineages. Red <b>squirrels</b> (Tamiasciurus) fall within the clade that includes flying <b>squirrels</b> and other tree <b>squirrels</b> (e.g., Sciurus). There are 25 recognized subspecies of red <b>squirrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike most <b>squirrels,</b> African pygmy <b>squirrels</b> don’t cache food, {{meaning they}} don’t hide and store their food. Myosciurus pumilio species are omnivorous. These <b>squirrels</b> eat {{scrapings}} from bark, insects, and fruit. It is theorized that oily spores from microscopic fungus {{may be the}} primary substance these <b>squirrels</b> obtain from the bark. African pygmy <b>squirrels</b> are bark gleaners and forage incessantly.|$|R
40|$|In a {{study to}} {{determine}} susceptibility to Borrelia hermsii of various rodents commonly found in or near places where human cases of relapsing fever occurred, chipmunks (Eutamias amoenus), pine <b>squirrels</b> (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus richardsoni), flying <b>squirrels</b> (Glaucomys sabrinus), Columbian ground <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophilus columbianus columbianus), golden-mantled ground <b>squirrels</b> (S. lateralis tescorum), wood rats (Neotoma cinerea cinerea), white-footed deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were exposed to spirochetes either by bites of infected Ornithodoros hermsi or by injection of infectious tick suspensions. Daily microscopic examination of blood samples revealed that pine <b>squirrels,</b> chipmunks, and meadow voles responded with spirochetemias of various degrees and length. Pine <b>squirrels</b> were most susceptible and experienced long-lasting and severe spirochetemias accompanied by typical signs of illness. Flying <b>squirrels,</b> Columbian ground <b>squirrels,</b> golden-mantled ground <b>squirrels,</b> wood rats, and white-footed deer mice did not develop demonstrable spirochetal infection...|$|R

5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit. Other mammals include: nutria, fox <b>squirrel,</b> gray <b>squirrel,</b> flying <b>squirrel,</b> chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E
5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that <b>squirrel</b> monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these <b>squirrel</b> monkeys {{migrated}} to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey and Guatemalan black howler.|$|E

50|$|Sciurinae is a {{subfamily}} of <b>squirrels</b> in the (family Sciuridae), uniting {{the flying}} <b>squirrels</b> with certain related tree <b>squirrels.</b> Older sources place the flying <b>squirrels</b> {{in a separate}} subfamily (Pteromyinae) and unite all remaining sciurids into the subfamily Sciurinae, but this has been strongly refuted by genetic studies.|$|R
5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it was probably a tree <b>squirrel</b> and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the <b>squirrel</b> family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E

5|$|Predator {{detection}} by {{the males}} becomes particularly important {{during the period}} when the infants are born. Raptors spend significantly more time near the <b>squirrel</b> monkey troops during this period, and prey on {{a significant number of}} the newborn infants. Other animals that prey on Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey infants include toucans, tayras, opossums, coatis, snakes, and even spider monkeys.|$|E

50|$|The life {{expectancy}} of flying <b>squirrels</b> in the wild is about six years, but flying <b>squirrels</b> can live up to fifteen years in zoos. The mortality rate in young flying <b>squirrels</b> is high because of predators and diseases. Predators of flying <b>squirrels</b> include tree snakes, raccoons, owls, martens, fishers, coyotes, bobcats, and feral cats. In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) is a common predator of flying <b>squirrels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Rodents {{such as the}} California ground <b>squirrel,</b> western gray <b>squirrel,</b> and dusky-footed woodrat live in this region. Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, western tanagers, and lazuli {{buntings}} {{are common}} in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The pileated woodpecker has been spotted rarely in large pine trees.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{dominance}} hierarchies {{among the}} females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies. Groups of Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican <b>squirrel</b> monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other.|$|E

5|$|Lagrivea is {{a fossil}} genus of <b>squirrel</b> from the Middle Miocene of France. The single species, L. vireti, is known from three mandibles (lower jaws) and two {{isolated}} teeth. All {{come from the}} fissure filling (a fossil deposit formed when a rock fissure filled with sediment) of La Grive L5, part of the La Grive-Saint-Alban complex in Saint-Alban-de-Roche, southeastern France. Lagrivea was a large tree <b>squirrel</b> with flat lower incisors and a large, triangular fourth lower premolar (p4). Each of the four cheekteeth (p4 and three molars, m1 through m3) bears a deep basin {{in the middle of}} the crown. The m3 is about rectangular in shape, but rounded at the back. Although m1 and m2 have two roots, m3 has three.|$|E
5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of <b>Squirrel</b> Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in <b>Squirrel</b> Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E
40|$|Populations of diurnal tree <b>squirrels</b> in the Portland {{area were}} located by mail surveys, {{personal}} interviews, and field inspections. Pine <b>squirrels</b> {{were found to}} reside in thickly wooded residential areas with dense understories and running water nearby. Western gray <b>squirrels</b> occupied habitats in relatively quiet residential neighborhoods, in areas well supplied with mast crops. Western fox <b>squirrels</b> were found to coexist with gray <b>squirrels</b> in their preferred habitat, and also to thrive in park settings with few mast trees and high activity and noise levels. In areas occupied by both fox and gray <b>squirrels,</b> dominant-subordinate relationships were noted. Each species tolerated the others...|$|R
