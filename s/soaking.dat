The Power <b>Soak</b> is an attenuator, put inline between an amplifier and its speakers.

40|$|LectureHeat <b>soak</b> {{is defined}} as heat {{transfer}} from the metal of a seal chamber to the fluid within the seal chamber. Many variables affect heat <b>soak</b> including materials, surface configurations, and film coefficients. Heat <b>soak</b> can be from the seal chamber to the fluid within, or from the fluid to the seal chamber. Typically, the term heat <b>soak</b> is used to describe heat transfer from a hot pump to a cooler liquid within the seal chamber. During {{the development of the}} API 682 seal standard (2004), the API 682 Task Force adopted an equation for estimating heat <b>soak</b> but recommended that the coefficients in the equation should be based on tests. However, there are still little data available and most users simply estimate heat <b>soak</b> using the API 682 default values. For a number of service conditions, the API 682 default equation produces unnecessarily high estimates for heat <b>soak</b> but default estimates are not always high. As a result, auxiliary systems can be incorrectly sized by using the API 682 default equation for heat <b>soak.</b> Improvements are needed in the API 682 heat <b>soak</b> equation. The first step toward improving the API 682 heat <b>soak</b> equation was to use simple one-dimensional find theory to derive a heat transfer equation. Surprisingly, this one-dimensional fin equation could be recast into a form that approximated the API equation but included additional parameters. The theoretical fin equation was checked and further improved using two-dimensional finite element analysis and again by using computational fluid dynamics. The predicted heat transfer compares favorably to measurements in the test lab. Based on these studies, the authors have prepared and offer a table of adjustment factors to be applied to the default API 682 heat <b>soak</b> equation...|$|R

40|$|Leaf extract of Jatropha curcas {{potentially}} as inhibitors of histamine formation on frigate tunaThe {{study of}} the inhibition of histamine formation on the frigate tuna using jatropha leaf extract has been done. Jatropha leaf macerated in stages ranging from hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol. Results of preliminary research note that the ethyl acetate extract and methanol with a concentration of 1 % (w / v) is the best extract that provides antibacterial activity against several of histamine-forming bacteria. In this experiment, frigate tuna were divided into 3 groups, group 1 was <b>soaked</b> for 30 minutes in water, group 2 <b>soaked</b> for 30 minutes in a solution of ethyl acetate extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %, and group 3 was <b>soaked</b> for 30 minutes in a solution of methanol extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %. After that, frigate tuna stored {{at room temperature for}} 5 hours, then analyzed the number of bacterial colony with total plate count method (TPC), number of histamine-forming bacteria and histamine levels. The results showed that the value of TPC the frigate tuna its <b>soaked</b> in water are log 6. 68 (cfu / g), <b>soaked</b> in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 94 (cfu / g) and <b>soaked</b> in a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 61 (cfu / g). The number of histamine-forming bacteria in the frigate tuna its <b>soaked</b> in water are log 5. 62 (cfu / g), <b>soaked</b> in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 40 (cfu / g) and <b>soaked</b> in a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 54 (cfu / g). histamine levels of the frigate tuna its <b>soaked</b> in water are 17. 73 mg / kg, <b>soaked</b> in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are 11. 07 mg / kg and <b>soaked</b> in a solution of methanol extract are 14. 02 mg / kg.
