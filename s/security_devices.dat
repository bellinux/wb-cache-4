5|$|A {{number of}} burglaries by a cat burglar {{take place in}} Springfield, even {{striking}} the Simpsons' house. Among the stolen items include Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, Bart's stamp collection, and the handheld television. In response, the residents of Springfield arm themselves and install <b>security</b> <b>devices.</b> A neighborhood watch group is formed, and the members elect Homer as their leader. The group patrols the streets, but its members only end up violating laws further than catching criminals, turning into vigilantes. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor Kent Brockman's Smartline, the cat burglar calls the show and informs Homer that he will steal the world's largest cubic zirconia from the Springfield museum.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways to {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and <b>security</b> <b>devices,</b> again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{supporting}} characters that consistently appear throughout the episodes. Bosco is {{the proprietor of}} the nearby convenience store and supplies the Freelance Police {{with a number of}} items across the game. Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, as well as many criminal outfits, are after him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns a small office across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a psychotherapist, she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional witness. In a hole in Sam and Max's own office resides Jimmy Two-Teeth, a rat who works as a petty criminal, confidence trickster and fence. He profusely dislikes Sam and Max, who he sees as always interfering with his work.|$|E

25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic <b>security</b> <b>devices,</b> there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid etching process. After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|E

A further target of evasions can be to crash a network <b>security</b> <b>device,</b> rendering it in-effective to subsequent targeted attacks.|$|R

As car theft {{rose in the}} United States during the 1980s, so did the demand for <b>security</b> <b>devices.</b> Rolls Royce, BMW, and General Motors joined Ford and Toyota as customers. In 1985, Issa sold the company to a California-based maker of home alarms, {{and moved to the}} San Diego suburb of Vista, where he has lived ever since, to work for the company. Shortly afterward he left to start Directed Electronics, Inc. (DEI).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a lift between the 99-bay basement car park and the lobby, the tower has nine high-speed lifts, divided into two zones.

The electronic <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> and air conditioning systems were also advanced. The roof of the building's mechanical penthouse, which is adorned with the ANZ Bank logo, is designed to be able to function as a helipad if necessary.|$|E

The remains were held for $20,000 ransom. The ransom was paid and remains were returned, although never verified as his.

500|$|Halden Prison (...) is a maximum-security {{prison in}} Halden, Norway. It has three main units and {{receives}} prisoners {{from all over}} the world, but has no conventional <b>security</b> <b>devices.</b> The second-largest prison in Norway, it was established in 2010 with a focus on rehabilitation; its design simulates life outside the prison. Among other activities, sports and music are available to the prisoners, who interact with the unarmed staff {{to create a sense of}} community. Praised for its humane conditions, Halden Prison has received the Arnstein Arneberg Award for its interior design in 2010 and been the subject of a documentary, but has also received criticism for being too liberal.|$|E
500|$|There are no {{conventional}} <b>security</b> <b>devices,</b> such as barbed tape, electric fences, towers, or snipers. However, {{there is}} safety glass, a 6meter [...] 1.5kilometer (6.5ft [...] 1mi) concrete and steel wall, {{and a system}} of underground tunnels which guards use {{to walk through the}} prison. Although there are surveillance cameras on the prison grounds, they are not present in the cells, the cell hallways, the common rooms, the classrooms, and most of the workshops. While there is little violence reported, almost exclusively in Unit A, officers try to prevent it. If two inmates have a dispute, they engage in a mediation session under staff supervision. If mediation fails, repeated misbehavior or rule violations are punished with cell confinement or prison transference.|$|E
500|$|Deus Ex: Human Revolution – The Missing Link is a {{downloadable}} episode, {{acting as}} a side story within the events of [...] Like the main game, The Missing Link is played from a first-person perspective, using action role-playing and stealth gameplay elements. The style in which the player can navigate environments and overcome obstacles is relatively open: they can either use an action-based approach involving combat with guns, or use stealth to progress through the game undetected. The environments include <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> such as lasers and cameras. These can be negated by hacking terminals or recovering key codes from datapads retrieved from the environments or defeated enemies. Tactics for defeating enemies are also flexible, with players being offered both lethal and non-lethal takedown options for stealth attacks and weaponry. At the start of The Missing Link, protagonist Adam Jensen is stripped of his equipment and augmentations, forcing him to find them again. His augmentations can be upgraded using collectable Praxis Points. The augmentations Adam can be given are separate from the main game, allowing alternate character customization.|$|E
