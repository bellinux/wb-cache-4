The women who use <b>supplements</b> did so {{because they believe that}} it is good for health and are concerned about lack of proper intake of daily meals, more so than the women who used drinks. 3. The women who use <b>supplements</b> do so daily or twice a week which is more often than women who use drinks. 4. The women who use <b>supplements</b> purchase them at a drugstore whereas women who use drinks purchase them at a supermarket. 5. 36. 9 % of the women who use <b>supplements</b> felt an effect whereas 13. 1 % felt no effect. 6. Of the women who use <b>supplements,</b> 32. 1 % snack compared to 11. 1 % of non <b>supplements</b> users;therefore the number of women who snack is larger for those who use <b>supplements.</b> 7. A larger percentage of the women who use <b>supplements</b> have breakfast with someone else in comparison to those women who do not use <b>supplements.</b> 8.
