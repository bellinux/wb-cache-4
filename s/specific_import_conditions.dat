Differences in recognition by importin β 1 were observed between histone H 2 A and the variant H 2 AZ, as well as between histone H 3 / 4 with or without acetylation. The results imply that different histone variants may possess distinct nuclear import properties, with acetylation possibly playing an inhibitory role through NLS masking...|$|R

This seminal work is revisited by means of four critical categories ('assemblage', 'elevation', 'cinematism', and 'exposition'), each of which reveals a distinct aspect of the book. The analysis of multiple layers of meaning indicates that montage {{had a profound impact}} on Giedion's operative criticism.

We use alternatively as instruments product-destination <b>specific</b> <b>imports</b> or tariffs changes, and large foreign shocks such as financial crises or civil wars. Our results show that exogenous variations in foreign sales are positively associated with domestic sales, even after controlling for changes in domestic demand. A 10 % exogenous increase in exports generates a 1 to 3 % increase in domestic sales in the short-term. This result is robust to various estimation techniques, instruments, controls, and sub-samples. We provide empirical evidence suggesting that this positive effect of exogenous changes in exports on domestic sales is related to a relaxation of short-run liquidity constraints...|$|R

Mitochondria with a mutant form of Mia 40 are selectively inhibited in the import of several small IMS proteins, including the essential proteins Tim 9 and Tim 10. The import of proteins to the other mitochondrial subcompartments {{does not depend on}} functional Mia 40. The binding of small Tim proteins to Mia 40 is crucial for their transport across the outer membrane and represents an initial step in their assembly into IMS complexes.

40|$|Chloroplast {{envelope}} quinone oxidoreductase (ceQORH) is {{an inner}} plastid envelope protein that is synthesized without cleavable chloroplast transit sequence for import. In the present work, we studied the in vitro-import characteristics of Arabidopsis ceQORH. We demonstrate that ceQORH import requires ATP and {{is dependent on}} proteinaceous receptor components exposed at the outer plastid surface. Competition experiments using small subunit precursor of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and precursor of ferredoxin, as well as antibody blocking experiments, revealed that ceQORH import does not involve the main receptor and translocation channel proteins Toc 159 and Toc 75, respectively, which operate in import of proteins into the chloroplast. Molecular dissection of the ceQORH amino acid sequence by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent import experiments in planta and in vitro highlighted that ceQORH consists of different domains that act concertedly in regulating import.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2012. Major: Clinical Laboratory Science. Advisor: Professor Gary M. Dunny, Ph. D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 50 pages. Enterococcus faecalis is an increasingly significant pathogenic bacterium in humans, {{as well as}} a commensal member of the intestinal flora. Pheromone-responsive plasmid systems {{play an important role in}} the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among this and other species. pCF 10 is a well-characterized member of this class of plasmids, and allows for transmission of tetracycline resistance in E. faecalis. The experiments described in this thesis were designed to assess the effects of three genes thought to be important for the response of plasmid pCF 10 to the peptide mating pheromone cCF 10 in E. faecalis: 1) the chromosomal locus responsible for pheromone production- ccfA, 2) the plasmid-encoded negative regulator prgY thought to be responsible for sequestration of endogenous pheromone at the cell surface, and 3) the plasmid-encoded positive regulator prgZ, an oligopeptide permease subunit A homolog responsible for <b>specific</b> <b>import</b> of pheromone. In this study transcription emanating from regulatory regions of this plasmid was characterized over time using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results from these assays were confirmed using phenotypic analysis and Northern blotting. Expression of ccfA was shown to be important to moderate the pheromone response. This moderation effect is believed to be the result of basal induction of donor cells, resulting in production of the peptide inhibitor iCF 10 from the plasmid. As the first study to probe PrgY function at the level of transcription, RNA quantitation revealed that levels of endogenous pheromone cCF 10 resulting from processing of the CcfA lipoprotein precursor are insufficient to fully induce a conjugation response in the absence of negative regulator PrgY, suggesting secondary negative regulation. Finally, PrgZ was shown to be important for regulated shutdown of the conjugation response in addition to initiation. This lends evidence to previous research suggesting <b>specific</b> <b>import</b> of inhibitor iCF 10 by PrgZ. Probing the effects of these regulators over time in strains that differ in their ability to secrete pheromone allows us to paint a more complete regulatory picture of this complex and dynamic system...|$|R

A precursor shown to prefer the receptor Toc 132 indeed had relatively more similar import efficiencies between chloroplasts and leucoplasts compared to precursors that preferred Toc 159. Furthermore we found two precursors that exhibited very high import efficiency into leucoplasts. Their transit peptides may be candidates for delivering transgenic proteins into leucoplasts and for analyzing motifs important for leucoplast import...|$|R
40|$|MTR 10, {{previously}} {{shown to}} be involved in mRNA export, was found in a synthetic lethal relationship with nucleoporin NUP 85. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged Mtr 10 p localizes preferentially inside the nucleus, but a nuclear pore and cytoplasmic distribution is also evident. Purified Mtr 10 p forms a complex with Npl 3 p, an RNA-binding protein that shuttles {{in and out of the}} nucleus. In mtr 10 mutants, nuclear uptake of Npl 3 p is strongly impaired at the restrictive temperature, while import of a classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) -containing protein is not. Accordingly, the NLS within Npl 3 p is extended and consists of the RGG box plus a short and non-repetitive C-terminal tail. Mtr 10 p interacts in vitro with Gsp 1 p-GTP, but with low affinity. Interestingly, Npl 3 p dissociates from Mtr 10 p only by incubation with Ran-GTP plus RNA. This suggests that Npl 3 p follows a distinct nuclear import pathway and that intranuclear release from its <b>specific</b> <b>import</b> receptor Mtr 10 p requires the cooperative action of both Ran-GTP and newly synthesized mRNA...|$|R

Empiricists have expressed a concern that scientific propositions, and theoretical terms, should always be, to some degree, related to observable consequences.

To that effect, Ramsey's method of formal elimination of theoretical terms can be an interesting tool. It has faced important logical objections, which have mostly been addressed with respect to the problem of the ontological commitment of the second-order quantification they imply.

To identify intermediate steps during active import, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to identify complexes of translocon components associated with precursor proteins under active <b>import</b> <b>conditions</b> instead of arrested binding <b>conditions.</b> <b>Importing</b> precursor proteins in solubilized chloroplast membranes formed a two-peak distribution in the sucrose density gradient. The heavier peak was in a similar position as the previously reported Tic/Toc supercomplex and was too large to be analyzed by BN-PAGE. The BN-PAGE analyses of the lighter peak revealed that precursors accumulated {{in at least two}} complexes. The first complex migrated at a position close to the ferritin dimer (approximately 880 kDa) and contained only the Toc components. Kinetic analyses suggested that this Toc complex represented an earlier step in the import process than the Tic/Toc supercomplex.

It contained, in addition to the Toc components, Tic 110, Hsp 93, and an hsp 70 homolog, but not Tic 40. Two different precursor proteins were shown to associate with the same complexes.
