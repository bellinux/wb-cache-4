Colonic inflammation was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Five days later colon segments were isolated and used for contractility experiments and immunoblotting. S 1 P contracted control and inflamed colon segments and the contraction was significantly greater in inflamed colon <b>segments.</b> <b>S</b> 1 P-induced contraction was mediated by S 1 PR 1 and S 1 PR 2 in control and S 1 PR 2 in inflamed colon <b>segments.</b> <b>S</b> 1 PR 3 did not play a significant role in S 1 P-induced contractions in control or inflamed colon.

40|$|Functional {{eukaryotic}} voltage-gated Na(+) (NaV) channels comprise four domains (DI-DIV), each containing six membrane-spanning <b>segments</b> (<b>S</b> 1 -S 6). Voltage sensing {{is accomplished}} by the first four membrane-spanning <b>segments</b> (<b>S</b> 1 -S 4), which together form a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). A critical NaV channel gating process, inactivation, has previously been linked to activation of the VSDs in DIII and DIV. Here, we probe this interaction by using voltage-clamp fluorometry to observe VSD kinetics {{in the presence of}} mutations at locations that have been shown to impair NaV channel inactivation. These locations include the DIII-DIV linker, the DIII S 4 -S 5 linker, and the DIV S 4 -S 5 linker. Our results show that, within the 10 -ms timeframe of fast inactivation, the DIV-VSD is the primary regulator of inactivation. However, after longer 100 -ms pulses, the DIII-DIV linker slows DIII-VSD deactivation, and the rate of DIII deactivation correlates strongly with the rate of recovery from inactivation. Our results imply that, over the course of an action potential, DIV-VSDs regulate the onset of fast inactivation while DIII-VSDs determine its recovery...|$|R

We report here the cloning and characterization of WTV genome <b>segment</b> <b>S</b> 5 [2613 base pairs (bp) ] and three related DI RNAs (587 - 776 bp). Each DI RNA was generated by a simple internal deletion event that resulted in no sequence rearrangement at the deletion boundaries. Remarkably, although several DI RNAs have been in continuous passage for more than 20 years, their nucleotide sequences are identical to that of corresponding portions of <b>segment</b> <b>S</b> 5 present in infrequently passaged, standard, transmission-competent virus. The positions of the deletion breakpoints indicate that the minimal sequence information required for replication and packaging of <b>segment</b> <b>S</b> 5 resides within 319 bp from the 5 ' end of the (+) -strand and 205 bp from the 3 ' end of the (+) -strand. The terminal portions of <b>segment</b> <b>S</b> 5 were found to contain a 9 -bp inverted repeat immediately adjacent to the conserved terminal 5 '-hexanucleotide and 3 '-tetranucleotide sequences shared by all 12 WTV genome segments.

30|$|Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) {{channels}} are membrane proteins {{that are responsible}} for the propagation of action potentials in mammals by mediating Na+ influx in excitable cells such as nerve and muscle. In human, NaV {{channels are}} therapeutic targets as their mutations contribute to many diseases. Structures of prokaryotic NaV channels, e.g., NaVAb (Payandeh et al., 2011), NaVRh (Zhang et al., 2012) and NaVMs (Mccusker et al., 2012), were successively determined in the past years. Recently, the cryo-EM structures of two eukaryotic NaV channels were reported (Shen et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2017). NaV channels contain 24 transmembrane helices, where each six consecutive <b>segments</b> (<b>S</b> 1 –S 6) compose a homologous repeat. <b>Segments</b> <b>S</b> 1 –S 4 form four voltage-gated domains (VSDs) respectively, while <b>segments</b> <b>S</b> 5 –S 6 jointly constitute the pore domain (PD) that allows ion conduction. The intervening sequences between S 5 and <b>S</b> 6 <b>segments</b> constitute the selectivity filter (SF), which determines the ion selectivity. Unlike the homotetrameric architecture of prokaryotic NaV channels, eukaryotic NaV channels have the four homologous repeats connected within a single polypeptide, thus leading to asymmetric amino acid distribution in the SF (Shen et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2017). Particularly, the constriction site of the SF in eukaryotic NaV channels consists of four different residues, Asp, Glu, Lys and Ala (or DEKA), each contributed from one homologous repeat. Notably, the DEKA residues are highly conserved in mammalian NaV channels and are essential for the selection of permeating cations (Schlief et al., 1996; Sun et al., 1997), e.g., Na+ vs. K+ ions. Specifically, K is indispensable whereas at least one of D and E should be present to sustain the proper Na+/K+ selectivity. In contrast, the corresponding site contains four identical residues (EEEE or SSSS) in prokaryotic NaV channels (Payandeh et al., 2011; Mccusker et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012).|$|R
40|$|Voltage sensor domains (VSDs) are {{structurally}} and functionally conserved protein modules that {{consist of}} four transmembrane <b>segments</b> (<b>S</b> 1 –S 4) and confer voltage sensitivity to many ion channels. Depolarization is sensed by VSD-charged residues {{residing in the}} membrane field, inducing VSD activation that facilitates channel gating. S 4 is typically {{thought to be the}} principal functional component of the VSD because it carries, in most channels, {{a large portion of the}} VSD gating charge. The VSDs of large-conductance, voltage- and Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels are peculiar in that more gating charge is carried by transmembrane <b>segments</b> other than <b>S</b> 4. Considering its “decentralized” distribution of voltage-sensing residues, we probed the BKCa VSD for evidence of cooperativity between charge-carrying <b>segments</b> <b>S</b> 2 and S 4. We achieved this by optically tracking their activation by using voltage clamp fluorometry, in channels with intact voltage sensors and charge-neutralized mutants. The results from these experiments indicate that S 2 and S 4 possess distinct voltage dependence, but functionally interact, such that the effective valence of one segment is affected by charge neutralization in the other. Statistical-mechanical modeling of the experimental findings using allosteric interactions demonstrates two mechanisms (mechanical coupling and dynamic focusing of the membrane electric field) that are compatible with the observed cross-segment effects of charge neutralization...|$|R
