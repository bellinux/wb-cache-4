500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E

A pre-festival benefit {{show for the}} Woody Guthrie Coalition took place {{the day before the}} festival’s {{official}} start at Cain’s Ballroom in Tulsa and featured Todd Snider. Snider said: “Without debate, he [...] created the job that I do, actually created it, the same way that <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> create a job of being a cook.” [...] Earlier that afternoon, other festival preview performances took place at the Woody Guthrie Center which opened in Tulsa earlier in 2013.

Now, obviously {{the three of us}} weren't going to blurt out, 'Hey, Houston, we've got something moving alongside of us and we don't know what it is', you know?... We knew that those transmissions would be heard by all sorts of people and <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> have demanded we turn back because of aliens or whatever the reason is."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode. He said that he told the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that’s your thing, but get your information correct, because <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> believe that shit, you know?" [...] He then told them {{to take a couple}} of Scientology courses to understand what they do. [...] In the interview, Hayes defended South Park's style of controversial humor, noting that he was not pleased with the show's treatment of Scientology, but conceding that he [...] "understands what Matt and Trey are doing." ...|$|E
60|$|She turned with a quick, nervous {{movement}} {{and glanced at}} the door. Lister imagined she was afraid <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> come out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{think so}} much of that," [...] said Jean, ponderingly. [...] "Jorth has lots of friends here. <b>Somebody</b> <b>might</b> pick us off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah. Pity. Excellent hobby. However--I took a {{snap-shot}} of {{this man}} to show to <b>somebody</b> who <b>might</b> know him better than I did. This is the photograph. Drunk as a lord, is he not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, sir," [...] {{said the}} Major, fuming, [...] "you compel me to say--putting all modesty aside--that I believe the reason Mrs. Riddel would {{have nothing to}} do with you was because she thought <b>somebody</b> else <b>might</b> make a similar offer." ...|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{also reports}} this {{statement}} from the programme: [...] I <b>might</b> ring <b>somebody</b> who <b>might</b> do more damage to him than he would like. I'd try to phone the Ayatollah Khomeini and tell him exactly where this man is.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a signal}} of distress. Another trail crosses the rise a mile off, and I {{was waiting in the}} hope that <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Throw it overboard!" [...] cried Mr. Rover, who {{was enjoying}} the fun, {{but who was}} afraid <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> get a fire ball in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you don't}} {{want to make}} any more {{mistakes}} like that," [...] returned Dick. [...] "If we had gotten a little closer <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> have been killed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It may {{and it may}} not," [...] {{answered}} the father. [...] "Of course the grant is recorded, but with matters in such a revolutionary state the records may at some time be destroyed, and then <b>somebody</b> else <b>might</b> come forward and claim this grant." ...|$|R

60|$|This was {{the first}} time Aubrey had been {{considered}} in condition for such festivities, and the gratification of being superior to <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> account for his glee in invaliding his friend.|$|E
5000|$|The song is a {{plea for}} global unity, with the singer exhorting his {{listeners}} that [...] "So if you meet <b>somebody,</b> it <b>might</b> be someone I know/Brother, if he needs you, take him home". This is suggested to be a means of outreach to those less fortunate in society.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} dug out {{the minute they}} knocked me over and got the papers," [...] {{answered}} Dick Rover.

60|$|With eyes on {{the alert}} for the {{possible}} appearance of <b>somebody</b> who <b>might</b> know him, Tom walked into the office building where Pelter, Japson & Company did business and entered the elevator.

6000|$|... "Before {{they are}} fried," [...] {{finished}} Tom, with a grin. [...] "You see, <b>somebody</b> <b>might</b> lift {{them from the}} henroost before {{you had a chance}} to cook them," [...] he went on soberly.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{thought of}} a good many other names for it," [...] said Pomona, [...] "and I wanted to call it 'The Groundless Prince'; but Jone he said that groundless applies to things {{there is no reason}} for, and as so many princes are of that kind, <b>somebody's</b> {{feelings}} <b>might</b> be hurt.

5000|$|Common modern {{formations}} {{that include}} {{left and right}} midfielders are the 4−4−2, the 4−4−1−1, the 4-2-3-1 and the 4−5−1 formations. Jonathan Wilson describes {{the development of the}} 4−4−2 formation: [...] "…the winger became a wide midfielder, a shuttler, <b>somebody</b> who <b>might</b> be expected to cross a ball but was also meant to put in a defensive shift." [...] A notable example of a right midfielder is David Beckham.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Afraid" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in many ways, but it mainly deals with anxiety and depression, hence the lyrics in the hook/chorus [...] "When I wake up, I'm afraid / <b>Somebody</b> else <b>might</b> take my place".
