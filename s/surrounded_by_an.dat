There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of small trees, and flowers.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) {{began to}} issue their second series of coins. The {{coat of arms}} is {{displayed}} on the obverse side of these coins, <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> inscription comprising the name of Singapore in the four official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English) and the year of minting. In 1987 the dollar coin entered circulation with this same pattern.|$|E

5|$|St Briavels Castle {{is located}} on a spur {{dominating}} a position above the River Wye, on {{the western edge of}} the Forest of Dean. The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone.

The park grounds are <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> moat that once {{included}} a drawbridge, {{which was part of}} earlier fortifications built in 1337. To provide extra protection, these fortifications were constructed and <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> outbuildings.|$|R

5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} <b>{{surrounded}}</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> expanse of green lawn, {{the plan is}} usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} thin atmosphere {{composed of}} carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} thin atmosphere {{composed of}} carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a galaxy that has an elliptical-like nucleus <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1915, at Spina Khaisora (Tochi Valley) During {{operations}} against the Khostwal tribesmen, Captain Jotham, who was commanding {{a party of}} about a dozen of the North Waziristan Militia, was attacked in a nullah and almost <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming force of some 1,500 tribesmen. He gave the order to retire, and could have himself escaped, but most gallantly sacrificed his own life by attempting to effect the rescue of one of his men who had lost his horse.|$|E

5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E
5|$|The Wizard Tower is {{the place}} where the ExtraOrdinary Wizard (Marcia Overstrand) resides along with Ordinary Wizards and the ExtraOrdinary Apprentice (Septimus Heap). Built by the first ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Hotep-Ra, it is a purple 21-floor tower with a gold pyramid at the top, <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> aura of magyk. The Palace is the royal residence, home to Jenna, Sarah and Silas. It is much older than the Wizard Tower with secret places, such as the Queen's room, which is {{accessible}} only to the Queen or the Princess, and has a secret passage to the Marram Marshes.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes, although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.|$|E
