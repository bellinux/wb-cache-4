40|$|Shear blades are {{extensively}} used in {{the recycling}} of metal scrap. A comparative study was conducted on used medium carbon NiCrVMo and CrB containing steel <b>scrap</b> <b>shear</b> blades to better understand their wear mechanisms under service conditions. The microstructure and hardness of worn cutting edges and bulk material were characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and macro/micro hardness testing. Moreover, tensile and Charpy impact properties {{were obtained from the}} bulk material. Several wear mechanisms were identified in both blades which are categorised in two main groups, i. e. spalling and progressive wear. The progressive wear due to abrasive, adhesive and oxidation wear was observed in both blades. In NiCrVMo-steel blades, spalling and crack propagation from surface/subsurface white etching layers mainly caused the severe wear. However, spalling due to delamination wear and crack propagation from severely subsurface deformed layers was the dominant severe wear mechanism in CrB-steel blades...|$|E

50|$|On June 27, 2005, the Department of Energy {{awarded a}} {{contract}} to LATA/Parallax Portsmouth, LLC (LPP). This was the first small business contract by DOE at the Portsmouth site. As part of the environmental remediation of the site, LPP removed 31 facilities; an 18-acre switchyard complex which included 160 towers, 18 large transformers, 10 synchronous condensers, 2 switch houses, 1 2-story control room and numerous other structures. LPP's contract was extended {{as part of the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) stimulus project with their contract ending on March 29, 2011.In 2008, a large project was completed to remove 7,640 tons of <b>scrap</b> material by <b>shearing</b> and disposing of 382 old process equipment converter shells. Between 2003 and 2010, more than 59,500 cubic meters of legacy waste was removed from the site.In September 2010, the DOE awarded the $1.2 billion follow up contract to Fluor-B&W Portsmouth LLC. Fluor-B&W transitioned the remaining LPP scope and workforce on March 29, 2010 and is currently working with USEC to transition remaining personnel and responsibilities for the site.|$|R
6000|$|A more {{delicate}} matter for a convention, however, {{even than the}} selection of candidates, is the framing of a platform for them to stand upon. It was especially delicate for a gathering which represented so many heterogeneous and almost hostile elements. So incongruous an assemblage {{has not been seen}} since the host of Peter the Hermit, unanimous in nothing but the hope of plunder and of reconquering the Holy Land of office. There were War Democrats ready to unite in peace resolutions, and Peace Democrats eager to move the unanimous nomination of a war candidate. To make the confusion complete, Mr. Franklin Pierce, the dragooner of Kansas, writes a letter in favor of free elections, and the maligners of New England propose a Connecticut Yankee as their favorite nominee. The Convention was a rag-bag of dissent, made up of bits so various in hue and texture that the managers must have been as much puzzled to arrange them in any kind of harmonious pattern as the thrifty housewife in planning her coverlet out of the parings of twenty years' dressmaking. All the odds and ends of personal discontent, every shred of private grudge, every resentful rag snipped off by official <b>shears,</b> <b>scraps</b> of Rebel gray and leavings of Union blue,--all had been gathered, as if for the tailoring of Joseph's coat; and as a Chatham Street broker first carefully removes all marks of previous ownership from the handkerchiefs which find their way to his counter, so the temporary chairman advised his hearers, by way of a preliminary caution, to surrender their convictions. This, perhaps, was superfluous, for it may be doubted whether anybody present, except Mr. Fernando Wood, ever legally had one, though Captain Rynders must have brought many in his following who richly deserved it. Mr. Belmont, being chosen to represent the Democracy of Mammon, did little more than paraphrase in prose the speech of that fallen financier in another rebellious conclave, as reported by Milton:-- ...|$|R
