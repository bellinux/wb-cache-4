Image segmentation is used for object tracking in the new MPEG- 7 video compression standard. It is also used in video conferencing for compression and coding purposes. These are {{only some of the}} multimedia applications in image segmentation. It is usually the first task of any image analysis process, and thus, subsequent tasks rely heavily on the quality of segmentation. The proposed method of color image segmentation is very effective in segmenting a multimedia-type image into regions. Pixels are first classified as either chromatic or achromatic depending on their HSI color values. Next, a seed determination algorithm finds <b>seed</b> <b>pixels</b> that are in the center of regions. These <b>seed</b> <b>pixels</b> are used in the region growing step to grow regions by comparing these <b>seed</b> <b>pixels</b> to neighboring pixels using the cylindrical distance metric.

40|$|Abstract—Segmenting semantically {{meaningful}} whole {{objects from}} images is a challenging problem, {{and it becomes}} especially so without higher level common sense reasoning. In this paper, we present an interactive segmentation framework that integrates image appearance and boundary constraints in a principled way to address this problem. In particular, we assume that small sets of pixels, which {{are referred to as}} <b>seed</b> <b>pixels,</b> are labeled as the object and background. The <b>seed</b> <b>pixels</b> are used to estimate the labels of the unlabeled pixels using Dirichlet process mul-tiple-view learning, which leverages 1) multiple-view learning that integrates appearance and boundary constraints and 2) Dirichlet process mixture-based nonlinear classification that simultaneously models image features and discriminates between the object and background classes. With the proposed learning and inference algorithms, our segmentation framework is experimentally shown to produce both quantitatively and qualitatively promising results on a standard dataset of images. In particular, our proposed framework is able to segment whole objects from images given insufficient seeds. Index Terms—Dirichlet processes, image segmentation, proba-bilistic models. I...|$|R

To make use of this for the monitoring of burn scars, this paper presents a new method for the automatic detection of burn scars {{on the basis of}} Sentinel- 2 data. In order to develop a globally applicable method, 108 mono- and bi-temporal features of seven global distributed test sites are analysed in a discriminant analysis to examine their potential for the identification of burned areas.

An {{investigation}} of the ability of high resolution TerraSAR-X data to detect flooded regions in urban areas is described. An important application for this would be the calibration and validation of the flood extent predicted by an urban flood inundation model. To date, research on such models has been hampered by lack of suitable distributed validation data. The study uses a 3 m resolution TerraSAR-X image of a 1 -in- 150 year flood near Tewkesbury, UK, in 2007, for which contemporaneous aerial photography exists for validation. The DLR SETES SAR simulator was used in conjunction with airborne LiDAR data to estimate regions of the TerraSAR-X image in which water would not be visible due to radar shadow or layover caused by buildings and taller vegetation, and these regions were masked out in the flood detection process. A semi-automatic algorithm for the detection of floodwater was developed, based on a hybrid approach. Flooding in rural areas adjacent to the urban areas was detected using an active contour model (snake) region-growing algorithm seeded using the un-flooded river channel network, which was applied to the TerraSAR-X image fused with the LiDAR DTM to ensure the smooth variation of heights along the reach. A simpler region-growing approach was used in the urban areas, which was initialized using knowledge of the flood waterline in the rural areas. <b>Seed</b> <b>pixels</b> having low backscatter were identified in the urban areas using supervised classification based on training areas for water taken from the rural flood, and non-water taken from the higher urban areas. <b>Seed</b> <b>pixels</b> were required to have heights less than a spatially-varying height threshold determined from nearby rural waterline heights. <b>Seed</b> <b>pixels</b> were clustered into urban flood regions based on their close proximity, rather than requiring that all pixels in the region should have low backscatter.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} general obstacle segmentation algorithm for use on board a ground based unmanned vehicle (GUV). The algorithm processes video data captured by a single monocular camera mounted on the GUV. We make the assumption that the GUV moves on a locally planar surface, representing the ground plane. We start by deriving the equations of the expected motion field (observed by the camera) induced by the motion of the robot on the ground plane. Given an initial view of a presumably static scene, this motion field is used to generate a predicted view of the same scene after a known camera displacement. This predicted image is compared to the actual image taken at the new camera location by means of an optical flow calculation. Because the planar assumption is used to generate the predicted image, portions of the image which mismatch the prediction correspond to salient feature points on objects which lie above or below the ground plane, we consider these objects obstacles for the GUV. We assume that these salient feature points (called <b>seed</b> <b>pixels)</b> capture the color statistics of the obstacle and use them to initialize a Bayesian region growing routine to generate a full obstacle segmentation. Alignment of the <b>seed</b> <b>pixels</b> with the obstacle is not guaranteed due to the aperture problem, however successful segmentations were obtained for natural scenes.
