5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to realize their vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering portability, making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging in some respects, and easy in others such as creating basic software. During development, two different versions were developed while the team were {{getting used to the}} new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E
5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was {{the second}} Star Trek series to be {{released}} in high definition on Blu-ray following the earlier releases of Star Trek: The Next Generation, with season one delivered on March 26, 2013. The fans of the franchise were asked for feedback on potential covers for the first season release, but as there was no clear winner, a new design was created based on the feedback received. The second season was released on August 20, 2013, the third season was on January 7, 2014, and the final season on April 29, 2014. The Blu-ray releases featured both the same additional features as the DVD release, in addition to new features exclusive to these releases. In January 2017 a new 24 disc Blu-ray set of the whole series was released. This set includes the whole series in 1080p with a <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> ratio of 1.78:1 (widescreen) and with the sound in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (5 channels plus subwoofer). The set includes 97 episodes from its original broadcast run {{at the dawn of the}} 21st century and features like a cast reunion. Note that the Blu-ray release in 1080p is actually higher than its original broadcast resolution which ranged from 720p to 1080i.|$|E

25|$|The {{diversity}} of mobile phone manufacturers {{has led to}} a need for new unified standards so programs can run on phones from different suppliers – MIDP. The first standard was MIDP 1, which assumed a small <b>screen</b> <b>size,</b> no access to audio, and a 32kB program limit. The more recent MIDP 2 allows access to audio, and up to 64kB for the program size. With handset designs improving more rapidly than the standards, some manufacturers relax some limitations in the standards, for example, maximum program size.|$|E

25|$|Eurocom ported a {{compressed}} and scaled down {{version for}} the Game Boy. It was hindered {{by the lack}} of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small <b>screen</b> <b>size,</b> choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it hard to control. This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Sega Master System, but only in Brazil. However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in What The Heck? is missing.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its own software, the Nintendo 3DS is backward compatible with most Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi software. Like the DSi, the Nintendo 3DS is incompatible with DS software that {{requires the use of}} the Game Boy Advance port. Nintendo DS and DSi software cannot be played with 3D visuals on the 3DS. The original DS display resolutions are displayed in a scaled and stretched fashion due to the increased resolution of the 3DS's screens. If the user holds down the START or SELECT buttons upon launching Nintendo DS software, the emulated screens will be displayed in Nintendo DS's native resolution, albeit smaller with black borders. On the Nintendo 3DS XL, this method yields a viewing size for DS games similar to their native sizes (due to the larger <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> of the XL), unlike on the original 3DS models, where the games appear to be shrunk.|$|E

500|$|Development {{of a large}} DS Lite {{model in}} 2007 {{eventually}} led to the DSi XL (known in Japan as the [...] ). Nintendo had designed a large DS Lite model with [...] screens, compared to the standard [...] screens; development of this new handheld advanced far enough that it could have begun mass production. However, Iwata placed the project on hold due to consumer demand for the DS Lite and Wii. He later pitched the idea of simultaneously releasing large and small versions of the DSi instead, but Nintendo's hardware team was incapable of developing two models concurrently. After finishing work on the DSi, Kuwahara started the DSi XL project and became project leader. The DSi XL, a DSi model with [...] screens, was announced on October 29, 2009. Various names for it were considered, including [...] "DSi Comfort", [...] "DSi Executive", [...] "DSi Premium", [...] "DSi Living", and [...] "DSi Deka" [...] (Japanese for [...] "large"). Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto insisted on [...] "DSi Deka". The handheld has an improved viewing angle over its predecessor, which allows onlookers to see the screen's contents more easily. This feature was absent from the large DS Lite model due to cost issues at the time, which also limited LCD <b>screen</b> <b>size.</b> The cost of LCD screens is determined by how many pieces are cut from a single large glass sheet. To keep these costs within a certain threshold, Nintendo set a <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> limit of approximately , which was later increased to [...]|$|E
500|$|Famitsus writers {{expressed}} disappointment {{over how}} the PSP version's graphics and <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> had not been changed {{in comparison to the}} Sega Saturn version, and of how few adjustments had been made. Despite this, the reviewers positively noted the easier gameplay experience and praised the battle system. Kalata and Snelgrove appreciated the graphics used in the game's dungeons, which they found to be detailed and better-looking than ones in previous games in the series; they also appreciated the battle transitions. On the other hand, they found the graphics for the game's maps to be [...] "not particularly impressive looking", and the graphics for the enemies to be lacking and [...] "barely animated".|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro {{line was}} again updated. LED {{backlighting}} was added {{as an option}} for the 17-inch model.

Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad. When the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold.

Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> allows the sixth row of icons {{to be added to the}} five rows that were present in the iPhone 4.

Despite the splits in opinion, many felt the game's AI was well designed, from the wingmen being competent and performing orders without issues, to the enemy vessels acting in concert with each other during missions, yet one reviewer was dismayed that the game's <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> was fixed and could not be changed.|$|E

As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and 5S can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional [...] "Reachability" [...] gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen.
