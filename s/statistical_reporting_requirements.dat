25|$|Controversy over {{significance}} testing, and {{its effects}} on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its <b>statistical</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> after review, medical journal publishers have recognized the obligation to publish some results that are not statistically significant to combat publication bias and a journal (Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis) has been created to publish such results exclusively. Textbooks have added some cautions and increased coverage of the tools necessary to estimate the size of the sample required to produce significant results. Major organizations have not abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{field of}} {{computational}} chemistry, particularly {{as applied to}} drug design, has become increasingly {{important in terms of}} the practical application of predictive modeling to pharmaceutical research and development. Tools for exploiting protein structures or sets of ligands known to bind particular targets can be used for bindingmode prediction, virtual screening, and prediction of activity. A serious weakness within the field is a lack of standards with respect to quantitative evaluation of methods, data set preparation, and data set sharing. Our goal should be to report new methods or comparative evaluations of methods in a manner that supports decision making for practical applications. Here we propose a modest beginning, with recommendations for requirements on <b>statistical</b> <b>reporting,</b> <b>requirements</b> for data sharing, and best practices for benchmark preparation and usage...|$|E
40|$|Lüder's Financial Management Reform Process Model (2002) is used {{to analyse}} and explain {{the context of the}} {{accounting}} reform process at the central government of Malta, thus introducing Malta in the field of Comparative International Governmental Accounting Research (CIGAR). Organisational Theory that underlies this model is referred to when discussing its limitations. The qualitative research methodology required a set of interviews with actors involved in the reform process, supported by documentary research. The governmental accounting reform process in Malta is described in two phases: the environment of the first phase is assessed as conducive to change; in the second phase, stronger forces at macro level reduced this conduciveness. The long-winding reforms at central government level in Malta may only be illusory because once the <b>statistical</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> for Eurostat were achieved, the reform concept changed. The findings confirm the centrality of the budget in government accounting. The decision by the Maltese Government to adopt International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) {{does not appear to be}} well-informed and appears based on the quest for credibility. The objective of the European Union (EU) 's interest in IPSAS is also questioned since these financial reporting standards do not give budgeting particular importance, and reporting to the EU by member states is already harmonised through the ESA 95...|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} of the WCIO Workers Compensation Data Specifications Manual includes a number of field name changes made to improve consistency in data element conventions, presentation and wording throughout all WCIO manuals. Additionally, in this publication the larger (parent) data elements that were previously comprised {{of two or more}} (child) sub-elements data elements, have been broken out into separate data elements. The current element (parent) name will remain and be displayed as a heading and the sub-elements (children) listed below and shown with their own <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> and formats. These changes represent title and presentation changes only and no changes have been made to the <b>reporting</b> <b>requirement.</b> The element/sub-element changes are identified in the “Reason for Update ” column as such. Also, concurrent with this publication, the WCIO has removed all hardcopy and pre-ASWG references from the WCSTAT. If data providers still need instruction on how to report pre-ASWG units or hardcopy Unit <b>Statistical</b> <b>Reports</b> (USRs), they should use the archived versions of WCSTAT that reside on the archive section of the WCIO website. Furthermore, the hardcopy Unit <b>Statistical</b> <b>Report</b> form will be repositioned on the WCIO website as a stand alone product and be presented as a standard WCIO USR viewing format. If you have any questions about reporting report pre-ASWG or hardcopy USRs you can also contact a specific jurisdiction for more information on their <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Robust {{statistical}} designing, sound statistical analysis, {{and standardized}} presentation {{are important to}} enhance the quality and transparency of biomedical research. This systematic review was conducted to summarize the <b>statistical</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> introduced by biomedical research journals with an impact factor of 10 or above so that researchers are able to give statistical issues′ serious considerations {{not only at the}} stage of data analysis but also at the stage of methodological design. Methods: Detailed statistical instructions for authors were downloaded from the homepage of each of the included journals or obtained from the editors directly via email. Then, we described the types and numbers of statistical guidelines introduced by different press groups. Items of statistical reporting guideline as well as particular requirements were summarized in frequency, which were grouped into design, method of analysis, and presentation, respectively. Finally, updated statistical guidelines and particular requirements for improvement were summed up. Results: Totally, 21 of 23 press groups introduced at least one statistical guideline. More than half of press groups can update their statistical instruction for authors gradually relative to issues of new statistical reporting guidelines. In addition, 16 press groups, covering 44 journals, address particular statistical requirements. The most of the particular requirements focused on the performance of statistical analysis and transparency in statistical reporting, including "address issues relevant to research design, including participant flow diagram, eligibility criteria, and sample size estimation," and "statistical methods and the reasons. " Conclusions: Statistical requirements for authors are becoming increasingly perfected. Statistical requirements for authors remind researchers that they should make sufficient consideration not only in regards to statistical methods during the research design, but also standardized statistical reporting, which would be beneficial in providing stronger evidence and making a greater critical appraisal of evidence more accessible...|$|E
40|$|Senate Bill 780, {{effective}} January 1, 2002, enacted two new laws: the California Freedom of Access to Clinic and Church Entrances (or California FACE) Act, and the Reproductive Rights Law Enforcement Act. The Reproductive Rights Law Enforcement Act added sections 13775 through 13779 to the California Penal Code {{requiring the}} Attorney General {{to collect and}} analyze information relating to anti-reproductive-rights crimes and submit {{a report to the}} Legislature. This publication is the result of that mandate. An 2 ̆ 2 anti-reproductive-rights crime 2 ̆ 2 is defined in section 13776 (a) of the California Penal Code as 2 ̆ 2 a crime committed partly or wholly because the victim is a reproductive health services client, provider, or assistant, or a crime that is partly or wholly intended to intimidate the victim, any other person or entity, or any class of persons or entities from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services client, provider, or assistant. 2 ̆ 2 In order to collect crime statistics mandated by the Reproductive Rights Law Enforcement Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) mailed Information Bulletin 02 - 09 -BCIA (June 2002) to California law enforcement agencies throughout the state. This bulletin announced new <b>statistical</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> for anti-reproductive-rights crimes, as well as the development of an automated reporting system. Guidelines for sending these crime data to the DOJ were provided in Information Bulletin 02 - 15 - BCIA (see Appendices). Information collected by the department includes the date of event; the county and law enforcement jurisdiction where the crime occurred; the number of crime events, offenses, victims, and suspects involved; the type of offenses committed (e. g., vandalism); the offense level (felony or misdemeanor); the nature of the crime (violent or nonviolent); the location of the crime (e. g., a health facility); whether or not a weapon was used (if so, what kind); the race/ethnic group, gender, and age of the victims and suspects involved; a description of involved property (e. g., automobile or structure); the type of property damage; and the estimated value of that property. This publication includes information reported to the DOJ by California law enforcement agencies for 2003. A data spreadsheet, which allows the reader to evaluate information pertaining to each anti-reproductive-rights crime reported, is included. Data tables, which organize and quantify these data, are also included. Because this is the first year antireproductive- rights crime data have been reported to the DOJ, and until trend data become available, conclusions based on the information in this report should be reached with caution...|$|E
