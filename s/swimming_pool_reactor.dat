40|$|Contamination of the {{atmosphere}} by radioactive isotopes of iodine constitutes a serious biological hazard and, for this reason, provisions should be made at reactors to prevent such releases {{in the event of}} an accident. The efficiency of activated charcoal for adsorption of iodine vapor from air streams was measured by using a radioactive tracer method, and efficiencies of 99. 6 to 99. 999 +% were obtained for various conditions. Comparative tests were run with silver-plated copper ribbon. A criterion for selecting an iodine removal material was developed based on efficiency and resistance to air flow. The iodine vapor adsorption efficiency of a commercial charcoal filter was measured. Various materials were considered for possible application in the emergency exhaust system of the building housing the 5 -Mw <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> <b>reactor</b> at the Puerto Rico Nuclear Center. Based upon its high adsorption efficiency and retention properties, it is proposed that activated charcoal be utllized for iodine vapor adsorption. (auth...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} almost 50 {{years of}} operating experience and {{utilization of the}} IEA-R 1 research reactor for research, teaching and radioisotopes production. The current and future program of upgrading the reactor is also described. IEA-R 1 research reactor at the Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares (IPEN), Sao Paulo, Brazil is the largest power research reactor in Brazil, with a maximum power rating of 5 MWth. It is being used for basic and applied research in the nuclear and neutron related sciences, {{for the production of}} radioisotopes for medical and industrial applications, and for providing services of neutron activation analysis, real time neutron radiography, and neutron transmutation doping of silicon. IEA-R 1 is a <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> <b>reactor,</b> with light water as the coolant and moderator, and graphite and beryllium as reflectors. The reactor was commissioned on September 16, 1957 and achieved its first criticality. It is currently operating at 3. 5 MWth with a 64 -hour cycle per week. In the early sixties, IPEN produced 131 I, 32 P, 198 Au, 24 Na, 35 S, 51 Cr and labeled compounds for medical use. In the year 1980, production of 99 mTc generator kits from th...|$|E
40|$|Up to now γ-spectroscopy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} analytical methods in archaeometry. For ceramic samples of the Alepotrypa Cave at Diros, Greece, INAA was also applied. The Cave is of interest for archaeology because of its Neolithic settlement. To shorten the irradiation and the cooling- and measurement-time, and to have a good throughput of samples, epithermal irradiation was used in connection with the loss-free counting technique. The samples, sealed in small plastic capsules, were transferred into a special Cd-container and irradiated in a 5 MW <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> <b>reactor.</b> When opening the highly radioactive Cd-container under water, the light samples rose to the water surface and could be collected there by using grabbing devices. In that way it was possible to measure the isotopes 76 As, 143 Ce, 152 mEu, 72 Ga, 159 Gd, 42 K, 140 La, 56 Mn, 24 Na, 239 Np, 233 Pa, 122 Sb, 46 Sc, 153 Sm, 69 mZn and in some case also 171 Er in a total irradiation-, cooling- and measurement-time of about 1 day for a set of 12 archaeological and 3 reference samples. The statistical evaluation of the samples from the Cave of Diros showed that all shards belonged to a common group of ceramics, which have to be assumed of local origin. The result was in agreement with the archaeological observation that all shards were simple pieces for probably everyday household use. Copyright © 1999 by Marcel Dekker, Inc...|$|E

In particular, reactivity insertion measurements made during the first tests of the RC 1 TRIGA are analysed and the resulting fuel feedback features are compared with statically measured temperature and power coefficients, obtained by measuring both the fuel temperature and the reactivity of a calibrated control rod at different power levels. The comparison shows a significant agreement between the mentioned analysis of TRIGA dynamics and the more recent power coefficient static measurements. In the second part of the work, some transients in sub-critical core configurations relevant to TRADE are preliminary analysed...|$|R
40|$|These {{research}} reactors {{have played}} {{very important role}} in developing India’s nuclear energy programme and in establishing the safety basis for the related activities. Due to diversity in their design, operating power levels and utilization aspects, a slightly flexible and graded approach is necessary for managing safety in these research reactors. Special attention is necessary on account of several irradiations and experiments that are carried out in these facilities. For ensuring continued safety during the operating life of the research reactors a well planned safety management system is in place. The paper outlines the safety management system practised in these research reactors with details of its essential elements. Some important utilization of research reactors Apsara, Cirus and Dhruva, modifications incorporated and up gradation proposed to enhance utilization are also described.

The difference in the damage observed was used to characterize the damage due to neutrons alone.

It is believed that neutron induced ionization damage is essentially due to secondary process of recoils...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work has}} been carried out with an aim to have a {{thorough}} understanding of the mechanism of blister formation and the resulting degradation in the serviceability of the component under simulated in-reactor condition of pressure and temperature. A 220 MWe Indian PHWR Zr- 2. 5 Nb pressure tube spool piece of 165 mm length was charged with a homogeneous hydrogen concentration using lithium hydroxide solution at 300 °C followed by growth of multiple hydride blisters at 10 different locations on the pressure tube outside surface by maintaining cold spots. This blistered tube was subjected to burst test by pressurizing the tube in steps of 20 kg/cm 2 for 10 minutes up to 380 kg/cm 2 at which it burst with sound. The failed tube was examined by neutron radiography, scanning electron microscopy, surface profiling, video microscopy and digital imaging for characterizing the cracked and un-cracked blisters. Neutron radiographs of the hydride blisters were recorded using NR facility at Apsara, a 200 kW <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> type <b>reactor</b> using transfer technique with 25 µm Gd neutron converter screen.

40|$|Neutron induced oxide charge {{trapping}} and {{generation of}} interface states in MOS capacitors with pyrogenic and nitrided pyrogenic field oxides have been studied. In {{order to assess}} the damage due to neutrons alone, {{it is necessary to}} account for the damage produced by the accompanying gamma rays from neutron radiation. This is done by measuring the intensity of gamma radiation accompanying neutrons at different neutron fluences at the irradiation position. MOS capacitor structures were subjected to neutron radiation in a <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> type of <b>reactor.</b> Other samples from the same batch were then subjected to an equivalent dose of gamma radiation from a Co(60) source. The difference in the damage observed was used to characterize the damage caused by neutrons. It is observed that neutrons, though uncharged, are capable of causing ionization damage. This damage is found to be significant when the radiation is performed under biased conditions. Nitridation in different ambients is found to improve the radiation performance of pyrogenic field oxides with respect to positive charge build up as well as interface state generation. Pyrogenic oxide nitrided in N(2) O is found to be the best oxynitride as damage due to neutrons is the least. (C) 2002...|$|R
