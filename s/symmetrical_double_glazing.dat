40|$|During {{the recent}} years window {{manufacturers}} have introduced insulating spacers {{in order to}} reduce heat loss through fenestration products, and to increase the temperature on the interior glazing {{to reduce the risk of}} condensation. There have however been some questions regarding whether the simulated good thermal performance of windows with insulating spacers is comparable to real measured results. In this paper a comparison of total window U-values and glazing temperatures are performed for four different glazing/spacer configurations; one <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with a 12 -mm-thick insulating spacer, one <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with a 15 -mm-thick insulating spacer, one <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with a 12 -mm-thick aluminum spacer, and one <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with a 15 -mm-thick aluminum spacer. For all the glazings one of the glass panes has a low emissivity coating facing the glazing cavity. Hot-box experiments and numerical simulations according to ISO 15099 are performed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{experimental}} setups {{are used}} to determine the solar heat gain coefficient (g value) of a system consisting of <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> and inside blinds. The first setup determines the radiative fraction of the g value, while the second one measures the convective fraction. The measured results from both setups are discussed and compared to model calculations. The measured g value differs by about 18 % from the calculated g value. The g value of the <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with inside blinds is 8 % smaller than the g value of the <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> without blinds. Further investigations are under way to clarify the observed deviations between experiment and model. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this {{research}} document, an attempt {{has been made}} to come across the effect of <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> on the efficiency of a solar thermal collector. Experiments were performed on an active solar energy demonstration system (ET 200). Commercial glass pane of 3 mm thick having the same dimensions as that of the apparatus was placed above the collector at a distance of 2 cm. Tests were done with and without the added glass. Experiments were performed for <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with two positions of the light meter. In one position, it was placed {{in the middle of the}} collector surface. While, in the other, the light meter was placed in the middle of the added glass. To study the effect of <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> on the performance of the solar collector ET 200, the correct position of the light meter was to place it exactly in the middle of the additional pane under the lamp. <b>Double</b> <b>glazing</b> decreased the efficiency of the collector of 15 %...|$|R

The prime aim is to experimentally investigate the influence of control factors namely stone quantity, sea water level and <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> on the yield of the solar still. Nine experiments were conducted based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array. It is noted that <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> effect makes substantial improvement in the yield of solar still. A non-linear regression model is also developed for the process. The optimum parametric conditions are found through the Taguchi method and genetic algorithm. It is confirmed that the optimum conditions exhibit nearly 57 % enhancement in the yield than the yield of conventional solar still without stone bed and <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> effect...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a project which uses two full-scale, three-bedroom {{standard}} houses to identify the impact of changes in building elements and materials on indoor environmental quality. The lightweight, timber framed, stand-alone houses are characteristic of New Zealand construction, and meet the requirements for the current New Zealand Building Code in terms of materials and insulation. One of the houses served as the test case for the research and incorporated high performance argon-filled Low-E <b>double</b> <b>glazing.</b> The second house acted as a control, with identical design and location but built using standard construction practice including conventional <b>double</b> <b>glazing.</b> The paper details {{the impact of the}} Low E argon filled <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> on internal temperature during a monitoring period which ran over the New Zealand winter. It compares results for this wintertime period to the results of previous testing of the same houses over the summertime period, and also examines results in relation to the short-term laboratory-predicted impacts of material thermal performance. Findings indicated that throughout the wintertime period, both houses performed similarly. In both cases the most notable issue was the high internal temperatures reached on cold sunny days. There were minor performance differences between the standard <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> and the Low-E glazing. The temperatures reached in the Low-E test house on cold sunny days were less extreme than in the control house, but overnight and early morning temperatures were lower with the high performance glazing. On cold overcast days there was negligible difference between the two <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> types...|$|R
