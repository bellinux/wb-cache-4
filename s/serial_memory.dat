50|$|One popular {{model that}} has been used to {{organize}} <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> processing is the ACT-R. ACT-R model is Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational. This cognitive architecture has been used to help hierarchically organize <b>serial</b> <b>memory.</b> This model separates declarative memory and production memory into separate functions. During <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> processing, declarative memory works to encode the physical positions of the items in the original memory set. As well, the production memory works to help organize the later recall of the items in the memory set. The ACT-R is a limited-capacity model meaning that there is a limited amount of activation available to use for processing. This limited-capacity helps to explain the linear relationship between time of recall and size of memory set. According to the ACT-R, the longer the original memory set, the longer the recall because the amount of available activation is being divided amongst more items now. More evidence exists for the ACT-R modeling <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> processing. It has been found that the ACT-R models the serial position error nearly perfectly. It produces the same primacy and recency effects found in earlier studies. As well, the ACT-R has been found to model acoustic errors nearly perfectly. It demonstrates the same findings of phonologically similar and different items found in earlier studies.|$|E

Functional and gate-level simulations have been done with Cadence simulator. Lastly the final gate level netlist has been placed and routed with Cadence Silicon Ensemble. A {{great deal of attention}} has been given to design a generic controller that needs simple software and minimum processor access cycle. It is programmed from the processor for different operations of <b>serial</b> flash <b>memories.</b> The structure of the frame, control data and timings are controlled by hardware according to the programmed operation. In addition to this, our <b>Serial</b> Flash <b>Memory</b> Controller module can be used with different flash memories. This is very important property for reusability of the module.

50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>memory</b> {{processing}} {{has been}} studied neurologically, and certain brain regions {{have been found to}} be associated to this processing. There is evidence that both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal region are related to <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> processing. This is because lesions in these areas tend to be related to impaired ability in remembering serial order. These brain regions can have impairments on memory for temporal order. Lesions on the medial prefrontal cortex shows total memory loss for the temporal order of spatial locations (this was tested by ability on a maze task). On the other hand, lesions in the hippocampal regions showed delayed memory loss. The participants remembered for a short time the temporal order of spatial locations; those memory declined thereafter. Rat studies have shown that lesions in the prefrontal cortex cause an inability to remember the 2nd of two items in a set. As well, the rats showed increased corticosterone while experiencing stress during a <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> task. On the other hand, rat studies have also shown that lesions in the hippocampal regions cause an inability to remember the 1st of two items. Furthermore, these rats do not show an increase in their corticosterone while experiencing stress, demonstrating differing effects for differing brain regions. As well it shows that the different brain regions differentially activate corticosterone, a hormone related to memory effects.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} errors {{that exist in}} <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> tasks based on the item's characteristics. Serial {{position}} errors have been discussed earlier, {{in relation to the}} primacy and recency effect. These errors {{have been found to be}} independent from other errors, such as acoustic errors. Acoustic errors result from items that are phonologically similar. An example of this would be recalling [...] "B" [...] as opposed to the actual item [...] "P". These items are phonologically similar and can cause acoustic errors. These are related to the suffix effect as well, which found that the rececny effect was only removed when phonologically similar stimuli were used. As well, other variables of verbal stimuli have been found to cause acoustic errors. Examples of these variables are word length, word frequency and lexicality. These interact to cause acoustic errors in <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> tasks by adding in acoustic confusability amongst the items.|$|E

Like the Olivetti Programma 101, the Busicom design used <b>serial</b> read-write <b>memory.</b> The Busicom memory was based on MOS shift registers rather than the costly Olivetti memory based on magnetostriction wire. However, Intel determined it was too complex, since <b>serial</b> <b>memories</b> required more components, and would use 40 pins, a packaging standard different from Intel’s own 16-pin standard {{and so it was}} proposed that a new design produced with standard 16-pin DIP packaging and reduced instruction set be developed., using Intel’s newly developed dynamic RAM memory. This resulted in the 4004 architecture, which is part of a family of chips, including ROM, DRAM, and serial-to-parallel shift register chips. The 4004 was subsequently designed by Federico Faggin [...] using silicon gate technology and built of approximately 2,300 transistors and was followed the next year by the first ever 8-bit microprocessor, the 3,500 transistor 8008 (and the 4040, a revised and improved 4004). It was not until the development of the 40-pin 8080 in 1974, a project conceived and directed by Faggin [...] that the address and data buses would be separated, giving faster and simpler access to memory.|$|R

50|$|In <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> processing, Primacy {{effect and}} Recency effect effects for {{accuracy}} of recall are commonly found. These effects are found for both visual and auditory stimuli in memory tasks. This means {{that of the}} many items in a memory set during <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> processing, the first item and the last seem to be recalled faster and more accurately than the other items. These effects may exist if recall errors are due to serial position. It is theorized that items are mistaken for other items from a nearby position in the memory set (e.g. the 5th item is mistaken for the 4th item or the 6th item). Since there are more nearby serial positions to middle items in a set, there are therefore more opportunities for mixing-up items. On the other hand, {{there are very few}} serial positions nearby to the first and last position, and therefore these positions may be remembered more accurately (or mistaken less). The first and last position may be less error-prone positions and more easily recalled.|$|E

50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>memory</b> {{processing}} can {{be either}} self-terminating or exhaustive. Self-terminating implies that comparisons stop abruptly {{as soon as the}} target is found, and then the response is generated. Evidence for this method is found in reaction time studies. If the reaction time slope for a positive trial (where the target was present in the memory set) is about half of the slope for a negative trial (where the target was not present in the memory set) this demonstrates self-terminating processing. This is because, on average, participants (on positive trials) will stop comparisons about halfway through when they find the target match but participants (on negative trials) will need to compare until the end when no target match is found. On the other hand, exhaustive implies that comparisons continue until the entire set is compared and then a response is generated. Evidence for this method is also found in reaction time studies. In this case, the reaction time slope is equal for both positive and negative trials, as comparisons are made to the end in both cases. Participants may process some <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> sets using the self-terminating method and in other cases use the exhaustive method, there is no clear distinction between which method is better to use.|$|E
40|$|Nearly a dozen {{distinct}} {{models of}} <b>serial</b> order <b>memory</b> {{have been proposed}} {{over the past two}} decades. Although the underlying processes and mechanisms are often quite different, each model has successfully accounted {{for a wide variety of}} serial order accuracy and error data. The challenge for researchers, then, is to evaluate these models by testing their predictions against new empirical data. The current study provided critical new data as it explored how part-set cuing affects immediate order retention. Using reconstruction of order and serial recall measures, two experiments examined the influences of cue type (consistent, inconsistent, control), cue location (before, after, surround), and list length (8, 16). In addition, the serial recall data permitted fine-grained analyses error patterns (i. e., transpositions, omissions, within-list intrusion, out-of-experiment intrusions). Results suggest that participants can use interitem associative information to facilitate order performance, which poses problems for purely position-based models of order memory.

40|$|Paired {{associates}} and <b>serial</b> list <b>memory</b> are typically investigated separately. An “isolation principle” (J. B. Caplan, 2005) was proposed to explain behavior in both paradigms {{by using a}} single model, in which serial list and paired associates memory differ only in how isolated pairs of items are from interference from other studied items. In the present study, 2 experiments identify a critical dissociation between the 2 paradigms, challenging this unified account. Specifically, forward and backward probes were highly correlated for pairs and less so for short lists (triples). The authors asked whether the isolation principle could quantitatively accommodate this type of dissociation. A simulation confirmed that a single model incorporating the isolation principle can adequately explain this and other dissociations, supporting the common processes view.

5000|$|A problem {{peculiar}} to machines with <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> is the latency of the storage medium: Instructions and {{data are not}} always immediately available and, in the worst case, one must wait for the complete recirculation of a delay line to obtain data from a given memory address. The problem was addressed in the G-15 by what the Bendix literature calls [...] "minimum-access coding." [...] Each instruction carries with it {{the address of the}} next instruction to be executed, allowing the programmer to arrange instructions such that when one instruction completes, the next instruction is about to appear under the read head for its line. Data can be staggered in a similar manner. To aid this process, the coding sheets include a table containing numbers of all addresses; the programmer can cross off each address as it is used.|$|E

These memory impairments may be due to degeneration of the frontal lobe and other age related changes. It is very common for older adults to experience increased source amnesia for memories compared to younger adults. Prevention of source amnesia in older adults may include memory training programs in an attempt to increase cortical thickness in the brain. Research suggests that even the brains of older adults may be capable of continuing plasticity. In one particular study, older adults were exposed to 8-week long memory training programs. These memory-training programs involved <b>serial</b> <b>memory</b> recall practice using mental imagery as a mnemonic device. Adults involved in the memory-training program showed significant improvement in their source memory specifically. In addition to the memory benefits, increased cortical thickness was shown using MRI scans.

Memory was tested either by an item recognition test, choosing between a target {{and a similar}} foil (Experiments 1, 3 a, and 4), or by a relative recency decision between two patterns that occupied adjacent list positions (Experiments 2, 3 b, and 5). For both item recognition and relative recency tasks, accuracy was in most cases constant across serial positions, except for a recency advantage that was usually restricted {{to the most recent}} item or recency decision. Only a small and marginally significant effect of list length was observed for item recognition. Relative recency was more sensitive to list length and fell to near-chance levels with lists of eight items.
