40|$|The {{immersed}} boundary {{method is}} {{an approach to}} fluid-structure interaction that uses a Lagrangian description of the structural deformations, stresses, and forces along with an Eulerian description of the momentum, viscosity, and incompressibility of the fluid-structure system. The original immersed boundary methods described immersed elastic structures using systems of flexible fibers, and even now, most immersed boundary methods still require Lagrangian meshes that are finer than the Eulerian grid. This work introduces a coupling scheme for the immersed boundary method to link the Lagrangian and Eulerian variables that facilitates independent spatial discretizations for the structure and background grid. This approach employs a finite element discretization of the structure while retaining a finite difference scheme for the Eulerian variables. We apply this method to benchmark problems involving elastic, rigid, and actively contracting structures, including an idealized model of the left ventricle of the heart. Our tests include cases in which, for a fixed Eulerian grid spacing, coarser Lagrangian <b>structural</b> <b>meshes</b> yield discretization errors that are as much as several orders of magnitude smaller than errors obtained using finer <b>structural</b> <b>meshes.</b> The Lagrangian-Eulerian coupling approach developed in this work enables the effective use of these coarse <b>structural</b> <b>meshes</b> with the immersed boundary method. This work also contrasts two different weak forms of the equations, {{one of which is}} demonstrated to be more effective for the coarse structural discretizations facilitated by our coupling approach...|$|R

Two acoustic phenomena are investigated: structure borne excitation past by/comming from the gearbox through the nacelle to the receiver and airborne noise directly radiated from the gearbox housing.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{building}} a methodology to couple fluid and structure is addressed in this paper. If {{the goal of the}} fluid-structure simulation is the stability assessment, an important issue to be addressed is the conservation of the momentum and energy exchanged between the participating domains. In realistic aerospace applications, the fluid and <b>structural</b> <b>meshes</b> are not compatible, either because discretized with major geometrical and topological discrepancies, or because different resolution requirements are set. As a consequence, different strategies may be required to solve the interface problem in each specific case. A new scheme is presented, based on the Moving Least Square (MLS) patches technique used in the field of surface reconstruction from N irregularly distributed given data points. The MLS method represents the correct framework which can be easily adapted to different interface problems. The goal is to develop an accurate but flexible method, capable of interfacing arbitrary structural or aerodynamic discretization schemes. A complete independence from the formulation of the structural and aerodynamic solvers is sought, while the conservation properties are retained as far as possible. A few applications are shown to highlight the quality of the proposed scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} static aeroelastic analysis procedure, {{applying a}} modal approach in coupling the fluid dynamic and structural solutions, is presented. The method {{is based on}} a preliminary structural modal analysis from which a number of natural modes is selected {{to be used in the}} creation of a fluid dynamic domain morphing criterion. The mesh is made parametric on modal coordinates and updated using a mesh morphing tool based on radial basis functions (RBF) within the progress of the fluid dynamic computation. An intrinsically elastic numerical model is then created, and no further iteration with the structural solver is required. The modal forces are extracted by integrating the pressure on the wall boundaries and used to define the weights of the morphing action of each modal shape. This is a simplifying alternative to the traditional fluid dynamic-structural analysis coupling approach that makes it possible to bypass several complexities related to the implementation of 2 -way fluid-structure interaction procedures. Furthermore, the modal approach is not affected by the error introduced by the interpolation required in the load-mapping procedure between the nonconformal fluid dynamic and <b>structural</b> <b>meshes.</b> Piaggio property static experimental measurements of a complete aircraft model in transonic conditions were used to validate the accuracy of the method.

40|$|Contact-impact {{algorithms}} are {{an important}} component of numerical simulation software in fast transient dynamics. Traditionally, contact algorithms have been based on so-called sliding lines and sliding surfaces. However, sliding-based algorithms may present some difficulties in detecting contact in complex geometrical situations, especially in 3 D. The pinball contact-impact method as an alternative formulation has been implemented in EUROPLEXUS, initially based upon a strong Lagrange-multiplier based solution strategy of the contact constraints. Recently, at Onera Lille (F) some crash calculations involving many contacts were attempted, initially with linear displacement continuum elements (CAR 4 in 2 D). However, to improve accuracy and to help mitigate spurious locking phenomena, it was desired to perform the same calculations with parabolic elements, namely by the 9 -node Lagrange element Q 93. The present work considers two different approaches to modeling contact with parabolic elements. The first approach uses a phantom mesh of linear-displacement elements, used only for contact detection, and superposed to the <b>structural</b> <b>mesh</b> made of parabolic elements. Such a technique is fully general and could be useful also in other special contact situations, not only with parabolic elements.

However, the exponents of these empirical power-laws are at odds with the analytic values of n = 1 and m= 2, valid for low-density cellular structures in the limit of thin beams. We propose a functional form for K(ϕ) that models the cross-over from a power-law at low densities to a porous solid at high densities; a fit of the data to this functional form yields the asymptotic exponent n≈ 1. 00, as expected. Further, both the intensity of the Poisson-Voronoi process and the collagen concentration in the samples, both of which alter the typical pore or mesh size, affect the effective moduli only by the resulting change of the solid volume fraction.
