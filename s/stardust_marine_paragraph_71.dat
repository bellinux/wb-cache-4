5000|$|Even {{though the}} {{reasoning}} underlying the conclusion in Robertson seems to contradict section 2.1(2) of the Copyright Act, {{it is possible}} to justify the outcome on a policy basis. The motivation to ensure that creators of compilations need not obtain permission from each and every copyright holder of the original constituent works is provided by the Tragedy of the anticommons. Justice Abella indicates that her judgement contemplates the tragedy of the anticommons when at <b>paragraph</b> <b>71</b> she cites the [...] "aftermath of the litigation in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533 U.S. 483 (2001)." [...] In Tasini, the facts were very similar to those in Robertson and freelance authors got a judgement to prevent the New York Times from posting their articles online. The New York Times reacted to this judgement by simply deleting the articles because of the huge cost of locating and negotiating with each freelancer individually for the right to re-post the articles online. As a consequence, the public was no longer able to consult those articles.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} correction {{has been}} made to the Consultant Report, California Feed-in Tariff Design and Policy Options, that was originally posted on the Energy Commission Website on May 4, 2009. The word “not ” was left out of the text in the last sentence of the fourth <b>paragraph</b> on page <b>71.</b> The addition of this text corrects the meaning of the sentence to be consistent with the Energy Commission’s position of not supporting the Procurement Review Group approach used in the California RPS because the approach does not provide transparency for policy makers and the public. Additionally, the extra word “of ” {{at the beginning of the}} sentence is deleted. The version of the Consultant report now posted on the Website incorporates these changes in the last sentence of the fourth <b>paragraph</b> on page <b>71</b> of the report. These changes are shown below in underline/strikeout.

5000|$|On 1 December 2005, the Constitutional Court {{handed down}} its decision: the nine justices agreed {{unanimously}} that the common-law definition {{of marriage and}} the marriage formula in the Marriage Act, {{to the extent that}} they excluded same-sex partners from marriage, were unfairly discriminatory, unjustifiable, and therefore unconstitutional and invalid. In a widely quoted passage from the majority ruling, Justice Albie Sachs wrote: [...] "The exclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and responsibilities of marriage, accordingly, is not a small and tangential inconvenience resulting from a few surviving relics of societal prejudice destined to evaporate like the morning dew. It represents a harsh if oblique statement by the law that same-sex couples are outsiders, and that their need for affirmation and protection of their intimate relations as human beings is somehow less than that of heterosexual couples. It reinforces the wounding notion that they are to be treated as biological oddities, as failed or lapsed human beings who do not fit into normal society, and, as such, do not qualify for the full moral concern and respect that our Constitution seeks to secure for everyone. It signifies that their capacity for love, commitment and accepting responsibility is by definition less worthy of regard than that of heterosexual couples." [...] <b>Paragraph</b> <b>71</b> of the judgment There was some disagreement about the remedy: the majority (eight of the justices) ruled that the declaration of invalidity should be suspended for a year to allow Parliament to correct the situation, as there were different ways in which this could be done, and the Law Reform Commission had already investigated several proposals. If Parliament did not end the inequality by 1 December 2006, then words would automatically be [...] "read in" [...] to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriages. Justice Kate O'Regan dissented, arguing that these words should be read in immediately.|$|R

As {{there are more and}} more kinds of marine monitoring programs, the level of monitoring technology has been improved obviously, and monitoring data resources have increased constantly in number. Under the influence of the good develop-ment background of <b>marine</b> monitoring, the <b>paragraphs</b> below will start with a data quality control method and monitoring data quality control system to briefly introduce the computer control over marine environment data quality. The use of these two computer control methods for data quality has fundamentally improved the data quality of China’s marine envi-ronment monitoring service, and laid a solid foundation for China’s whole competitiveness in the international market...|$|R

The case-law further shows that a Member State, such as the applicant in Case C‑475/10 P, may admissibly bring an action for annulment of a measure producing binding legal effects without having to demonstrate that it has an interest in bringing proceedings....37 Where the action for annulment against an act adopted by an institution is brought by a natural or legal person, the Court of Justice had repeatedly held that the action lies only if the binding legal effects of that act are capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position (see, in particular, IBM v Commission, paragraph 9; Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 29; Case C‑322/09 P NDSHT v Commission 2010 ECR I-0000, paragraph 45).38 It must, however, be emphasised that the case-law cited in the paragraph above was {{developed in the}} context of actions brought before the EU judicature by natural or legal persons against measures of which they were the addressees. Where, as in the case giving rise to the order in Deutsche Post v Commission, an action for annulment is brought by a non-privileged applicant against a measure that has not been addressed to it, the requirement that the binding legal effects of the measure being challenged must be capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position overlaps with the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU....45 It follows from the above that a decision taken pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 is intended to produce binding legal effects within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 36 of this judgment, and therefore constitutes an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 263 TFEU....53 Next, the case-law shows that an intermediate measure is also not capable of forming the subject-matter of an action if it is established that the illegality attaching to that measure can be relied on in support of an action against the final decision for which it represents a preparatory step. In such circumstances, the action brought against the decision terminating the procedure will provide sufficient judicial protection (IBM v Commission, paragraph 12; Case 53/85 AKZO Chemie and AKZO Chemie UK v Commission 1986 ECR 1965, paragraph 19; Case C-400/99 Italy v Commission 2001 ECR I 7303, paragraph 63).54 However, if that latter condition is not satisfied, it will be considered that the intermediate measure - independently of whether the latter expresses a provisional opinion of the institution concerned - produces independent legal effects and must therefore be capable of forming the subject-matter of an action for annulment....55 in this case, it must be held that an information under Article 10(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 produces independent legal effects....71 As for whether Deutsche Post is individually concerned by the act at issue, it should be recalled that, according to consistent case-law of the Court of Justice, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and, by virtue of those factors, distinguishes them individually just {{as in the case of}} the person addressed....73 in that respect, it should be noted that the fact that the act at issue is not addressed to Deutsche Post is irrelevant for assessing whether that undertaking is individually concerned by that measure, for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.74 Next, it must be noted that the information injunction refers to a procedure for examining a State aid measure from which Deutsche Post is alleged to have benefited. The information concerned by the act at issue concern only Deutsche Post. The latter is thus individually concerned by that measure for the purposes of the case-law cited in <b>paragraph</b> <b>71</b> of this judgment.|$|R
30|$|We use {{education}} data to proxy for skills {{at the time}} of immigration. As data on immigrants’ education level {{at the time of}} migration are not well registered, we imputed the missing data as follows. First, if immigrants have not enrolled in any education in Sweden after they arrived, we assumed their education levels at the time of migration are the same as the first record shown in later years. Second, if immigrants enrolled in secondary high school education in Sweden after they arrived, we assumed they had primary education before they arrived. Third, if immigrants enrolled in post-secondary high school (≥[*] 13  years of schooling) after they arrived, we expected that they had a secondary high school education (10 – 12  years of schooling) before they arrived. In total, we imputed 42 % of data on education level for immigrants at the time of migration. Figure  5 shows that the percentage of missing data on education level in each year becomes more homogenous based on imputed data compared with the shares of missing observations in the original data. In addition, by comparing the regression results with and without imputation (Tables  2 and 4 vs. Table  8), it seems unlikely that we create problems by using the imputed data, although potential imputation mistakes on data may still exist (see the detailed discussion in the last <b>paragraph</b> of Section <b>7.1).</b>|$|R
