5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|E

To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and collaborated on all aspects related to times and venues. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a [...] "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E

Although Garland had said as early as 1955 {{that she would never}} do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. Garland was <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately.

25|$|The highest {{stud fees}} are {{generally}} for racing Thoroughbreds, which may charge {{from two to}} three thousand dollars for a breeding to a new or unproven stallion, to <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> for a breeding to a proven producer of stakes winners. Stallions in other disciplines often have stud fees that begin {{in the range of}} $1,000 to $3,000, with top contenders who produce champions in certain disciplines able to command as much as $20,000 for one breeding. The lowest stud fees to breed to a grade horse or an animal of low-quality pedigree may only be $100–$200, but there are trade-offs: the horse will probably be unproven, and likely to produce lower-quality offspring than a horse with a stud fee that is in the typical range for quality breeding stock.|$|E

40|$|PEVs can {{represent}} a significant power resource for the grid. An IVCI with bi-direction V 2 G capabilities would allow PEVs to provide grid support services and thus generate {{a source of}} revenue for PEV owners. The fleet of EV Project vehicles represents a power resource between 30 MW and 90 MW, depending on the power rating of the grid connection (5 - 15 kW). Aggregation of vehicle capacity would allow PEVs to participate in wholesale reserve capacity markets. One of the key insights from EV Project data {{is the fact that}} vehicles are connected to an EVSE much longer than is necessary to deliver a full charge. During these hours when the vehicles are not charging, they can be participating in wholesale power markets providing the high-value services of regulation and spinning reserves. The annual gross revenue potential for providing these services using the fleet of EV Project vehicles is <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>dollars</b> to <b>several</b> million dollars annually depending on the power rating of the grid interface, the number of hours providing grid services, and the market being served.
