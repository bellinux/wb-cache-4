Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely to}} eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and <b>scraper.</b> Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scrapers</b> {{are divided}} into three groups: Uncompahgre <b>scrapers,</b> side <b>scrapers,</b> and end <b>scrapers.</b> They are flake tools that have {{experienced}} unifacial wear. Uncompahgre <b>scrapers</b> are often created on large percussion flakes and tend to only have marginal edge retouching. They {{are thought to have}} been used as butchering tools. The side <b>scrapers,</b> picture to the right, were only created on their lateral edges and most wear is found on the dorsal exterior of the tool. It is thought that this tool was imported from a tool kit and was not made on site. The end <b>scrapers</b> were the second-most abundant tool found at the camp. They are made from more narrow flakes that come off of larger cores.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a microwear {{analysis}} of samples of fan <b>scrapers</b> and fan <b>scrapers</b> spalls from late Pottery Neolithic (PN) and Early Bronze Age (EBA) occupation layers at Ein Zippori, Lower Galilee, Israel are presented. The goal of the microwear analysis {{was to determine the}} function of the fan <b>scrapers</b> and compare the visible usewear on the <b>scrapers</b> found in late PN and EBA lithic assemblages. The results indicate that during both periods most of the fan <b>scrapers</b> were used to skin and butcher animals, while some were also used for hide processing and bone working. The working edges of the fan <b>scrapers</b> had sharp, moderate, or steep edge-angles, and different edges were used for different tasks. Edges with microwear from scraping meat, bone, and hides (including some hides that may have been treated with abrasives) had steep edge-angles, while there were moderate or sharp edge-angles on the edges of fan <b>scrapers</b> used for cutting. Two sub-types of fan <b>scrapers</b> were identified, flat cortex fan <b>scrapers</b> (FCFS), and cortical fan <b>scrapers</b> (CFS) with convex dorsal faces. The CFS were abundant in PN contexts, while the FCFS were more common in EBA layers. However both of the sub-types had similar microwear traces...|$|R

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that a prehistoric settlement occupied the site before the arrival of the Romans. However, Stone Age activity has been recorded in the area. Two Mesolithic flints and a flint flake as well as a Neolithic <b>scraper</b> have been discovered. A shard of late Bronze Age pottery has also been found in situ. Although the area was in the territory of the Celtic tribe Brigantes, it may have been {{under the control of the}} Setantii, a sub-tribe of the Brigantes, when the Romans took control from the ancient Britons.|$|E
5|$|La Rose and La Marguerite are rival {{societies}} that commemorate the Anglo-French {{heritage of the}} island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies {{date back to the}} early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader, the chantwèl, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (<b>scraper).</b>|$|E

40|$|Fan (or tabular) <b>scrapers</b> are a diagnostic  tool type in Chalcolithic Ghassulian and Early Bronze Age lithic assemblages from  the {{southern}} Levant. To date, only {{small numbers of}} fan <b>scrapers</b> have been reported from the Late Pottery Neolithic Wadi Rabah culture. In this paper we present a techno-typological analysis of a fair sample of fan <b>scrapers</b> and fan <b>scrapers</b> spalls from Wadi Rabah and Early Bronze Age layers at Ein Zippori, Lower Galilee, Israel. Techno-typological similarities and differences of Wadi Rabah, Chalcolithic Ghassulian and Early Bronze Age fan <b>scrapers</b> from Ein Zippori and other sites {{in the region are}} presented, trends of change along time are noted, and an updated definition is proposed. Our results indicate that fan <b>scrapers</b> are highly efficient tools for accurate and prolonged animal butchering and hide working. The main advantage of fan <b>scrapers</b> is their mostly flat, thin morphology and large size that permits the creation of several relatively long working edges, various retouched angles (from sharp to abrupt), extensive resharpening, and a comfortable grasp. While fan <b>scrapers</b> were products of a local trajectory in Late Pottery Neolithic Wadi Rabah lithic industries at Ein Zippori, a standardized, off-site manufacturing of fan <b>scrapers</b> is evident during the Early Bronze Age...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the direction of tool movement of end <b>scrapers</b> used by Palaeolithic peoples for hide-working in the Japanese Islands. Specimens are approximately 400 end <b>scrapers</b> from three sites dated to {{the first half of}} the late Palaeolithic in Hokkaido, northern Japan. As a result of examination using a method combining the high-power approach of lithic use-wear analysis with a replication technique for measuring the edge angle and the use angle, it was clarified that end <b>scrapers</b> were used only for hideworking. They were classified into four groups: (1) relatively short end <b>scrapers</b> used in a pulling motion (group A); (2) relatively short end <b>scrapers</b> used in a pushing motion (group B); (3) relatively long and large end <b>scrapers</b> used in a pulling motion (group C); and (4) relatively long and large end <b>scrapers</b> used in a pushing motion (group D). Groups B and D (i. e., for pushing motion) are dominant among whole specimens. This study will contribute significantly to the investigation of tool use strategies, curation systems, and the reduction sequences of end <b>scrapers</b> when compared with results of techno-morphological research. At the same time, the methodology performed for this article enabled to change of needs for hide products in prehistoric society...|$|R

5000|$|In prehistoric archaeology, <b>scrapers</b> are unifacial tools {{thought to}} have been used for hideworking and woodworking. Many lithic analysts {{maintain}} that the only true <b>scrapers</b> are defined on the base of use-wear, and usually are those that were worked on the distal ends of blades—i.e., [...] "end scrapers" [...] (grattoir). Other <b>scrapers</b> include the so-called [...] "side scrapers" [...] or racloirs, which are made on the longest side of a flake, and notched <b>scrapers,</b> which have a cleft on either side that may have been used to attach them to something else.|$|R

25|$|Near to Langley Mill Farm is Fox Hollies, where archaeological {{surveys have}} {{uncovered}} flints {{dating from the}} New Stone Age. Amongst the finds in the area were flint cores and a flint <b>scraper,</b> which had been retouched with a knife.

He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for walking across the snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, leggings and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with sinew. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a <b>scraper,</b> drill, flint flake, bone awl and a dried fungus.|$|E
25|$|Red figure is, put simply, {{the reverse}} of the black figure technique. Both were {{achieved}} by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt <b>scraper,</b> leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay slip. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human habitation in current {{territory of the}} state is a quartz <b>scraper</b> and obsidian blade found in the Tlapacoya area, which was an island in the former Lake Chalco. They are dated to the Pleistocene era which dates human habitation back to 20,000 years. The first people were hunter-gatherers. Stone age implements have been found all over the territory from mammoth bones, to stone tools to human remains. Most have been found in the areas of Los Reyes Acozac, Tizayuca, Tepexpan, San Francisco Mazapa, El Risco and Tequixquiac. Between 20,000 and 5000 BCE, the people here eventually went from hunting and gathering to sedentary villages with farming and domesticated animals. The main crop was corn, and stone tools for the grinding of this grain become common. Later crops include beans, chili peppers and squash grown near established villages. Evidence of ceramics appears around 2500 BCE with the earliest artifacts of these appearing in Tlapacoya, Atoto, Malinalco, Acatzingo and Tlatilco.|$|E
