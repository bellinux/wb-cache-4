40|$|Thermodynamic and {{aerodynamic}} measurements at {{and near}} the endwall of turbine vanes were carried out in a linear cascade with a transonic flow field. The investigations were performed in the Windtunnel for Straight Cascades at DLR Göttingen at representative dimensionless engine conditions of Mach and Reynolds number, Ma 2 is = 1. 0 and Re 2 = 850000 respectively. The endwall film cooling configuration consisted of a slot {{in front of the}} vanes, film cooling holes inside the vane passages and a groove simulating the slit between two adjacent vane platforms, but there was no coolant leakage from the groove. Laser-Two-Focus velocimetry (L 2 F) was used to determine local velocities {{in the vicinity of the}} endwall. At a much larger number of locations compared to the velocity measurements the L 2 F-device was utilized as a seeding particle counter which enabled the determination of local coolant concentration. With these concentration measurements the migration of coolant from the different origins could be traced through the vane passage. By extrapolating the measured concentration values to the endwall adiabatic film cooling effectiveness could be obtained. The measurements at the present slot configuration were compared with previous ones where the <b>slot</b> <b>position</b> was closer to the vane entrance. Whereas the coolant ejection at the previous <b>slot</b> <b>position</b> produced a much more intense horse shoe vortex than without coolant, the new <b>slot</b> <b>position</b> causes no increase of secondary flow. This result proves the previous statement that positioning a coolant opening flush near the saddle point of the upstream endwall boundary layer stagnation region should be avoided. The new <b>slot</b> <b>position</b> improved film cooling effectiveness compared to the previous ones even with half the amount of coolant. By investigating the migration of film coolant from the holes inside the vane passage, ineffective holes could be identified and suggestions for improving the film coolant configuration could be given. At one location adiabatic film cooling effectiveness from these aerodynamic measurements could be compared with a thermodynamic measurement using infrared imaging...|$|R

Circular cylinder performance was evaluated at <b>slot</b> <b>positions</b> of 80 deg to 135 deg, measured relative to freestream; 50 % ellipse performance was measured for angles of attack between - 5 deg and 30 deg.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to determine the ground effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of a lifting circular cylinder using tangential blowing from surface slots to generate high lift coefficients. The tests were made on a semispan model having a length 4 times the cylinder diameter and an end plate of 2. 5 diameters. The tests were made at low speeds at a Reynolds number of approximately 290, 000, over a range of momentum coefficients from 0. 14 to 4. 60, and over a range of groundboard heights from 1. 5 to 10 cylinder diameters. The investigation showed an earlier stall angle and a large loss of lift coefficient as the groundboard was brought close to the cylinder when large lift coefficients were being generated. For example, at a momentum coefficient of 4. 60 the maximum lift coefficient was reduced from a value of 20. 3 at a groundboard height of 10 cylinder diameters to a value of 8. 7 at a groundboard height of 1. 5 cylinder diameters. In contrast to this there was little effect on the lift characteristics of changes in groundboard height when lift coefficients of about 4. 5 were being generated. At a height of 1. 5 cylinder diameters the drag coefficients generally increased rapidly when the <b>slot</b> <b>position</b> angle for maximum lift was exceeded. Slightly below the <b>slot</b> <b>position</b> angle for maximum lift, the groundboard had a beneficial effect, that is, the drag for a given lift was less near the groundboard than away from the groundboard.
