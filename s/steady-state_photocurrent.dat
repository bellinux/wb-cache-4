In this work, TiO 2 nanoparticles were immobilized onto the BDD electrodes by a dip-coating technique. Continuous and uniform mixed-phase (anatase and rutile) and pure-anatase TiO 2 /BDD electrodes were obtained after calcination processes at 700 and 450 ì respectively. The particle sizes of both types of TiO 2 film range from 20 to 30 nm. In comparison with a TiO 2 /indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, the TiO 2 /BDD electrode demonstrates a higher photoelectrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of organic compounds, such as glucose and potassium hydrogen phthalate. Among all the tested TiO 2 electrodes, the mixed-phase TiO 2 /BDD electrode demonstrated the highest photoelectrocatalytic activity, which {{can be attributed to the}} formation of the p-n heterojunction between TiO 2 and BDD. The electrode was subsequently used to detect a wide spectrum of organic compounds in aqueous solution using a steady-state current method.

40|$|Studying {{electron}} transport (ET) through proteins is {{hampered by}} achieving reproducible experimental configurations, particularly electronic contacts to the proteins. The transmembrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a natural light-activated proton pump in purple membranes of Halobacterium salinarum, is well studied for biomolecular electronics {{because of its}} sturdiness {{over a wide range}} of conditions. To date, related studies of dry bR systems focused on photovoltage generation and photoconduction with multilayers, rather than on the ET ability of bR, which is understandable because ET across 5 -nm-thick, apparently insulating membranes is not obvious. Here we show that electronic current passes through bR-containing artificial lipid bilayers in solid “electrode–bilayer–electrode” structures and that the current through the protein is more than four orders of magnitude higher than would be estimated for direct tunneling through 5 -nm, water-free peptides. We find that ET occurs only if retinal or a close analogue is present in the protein. As long as the retinal can isomerize after light absorption, there is a photo-ET effect.

The steady-state problem can provide some qualitative insights into the more difficult transient problem.

The incorporation of bacteriorhodopsin into planar lipid bilayers was achieved by the following methods. (i) Purple membrane patches were transferred from water to solutions of lipids in n-alkanes. Black membranes were formed from such organic suspensions. (ii) Lipid layers containing solvent and purple membranes were spread on an air/water interface.

On irradiation with light of wavelength 330 nm, corresponding to an absorption band in the radical anion, appreciable photocurrents flow and in situ electrochemical electron spin resonance (ESR) shows the formation of the nitrobenzene radical onion. The mechanism of formation is shown to occur via a "photo-ECE" mechanism rather than either "photo-ECEE" or "photo-DISP" processes by means of (i) the variation in photocurrent with flow rate, and (ii) novel phototransient experiments in which the photocurrent is followed after the step-wise application of light to the system after steady-state transport l imited currents have been established in the dark at various flow rates.

The {{observation that the}} photocurrent spectra behavior {{is strongly dependent on}} the bias polarity and amplitude suggests the existence of an intrinsic electric field, determined by the difference in the work function of the metallic electrodes, as well as a field dependence on the free charge carrier generation rates.

However, when considering challenges related with the application of these techniques to the characterization of solid hetero-structures for the use in electronic memory circuits, two major complications become evident: First, the photoinjected (or photogenerated) charge carriers may not betransported across the entire insulating layer of a charge-trapping memory cell but become trapped inside of it. In this case no reliable interpretation of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>photocurrent</b> is possible, which precludes one from carryingout conventional IPE/PC experiments. Second, with the increasing demand for high-permittivity nano-scaled insulators, the problem of leakage currentbecomes more and more acute since it makes thephotocurrent measurements inaccurate, or even impossible. The goal of the current work is to explore the experimental limits of IPE/PCspectroscopy {{in relation to the}} analysis of electronic memory structures. It is shown that photocharging measurements may successfully replace the photocurrent detection and deliver the required information regarding spectral onsets of the IPE and PC. Furthermore, as a bonus, this approach enables the determination of the energy distribution of the gap states (traps) in absolute termsa major step forward, indeed. It is also shown that IPE/PC measurements at room temperature can be used to determine the interface barriers and band gaps of insulators down to a gap width of about 3 eV. Furthermore, instead of simply hampering the measurements, assessing the behavior of the dark (leakage) current can provide valuable information concerning the type of the injection process.

In this paper, we derive asymptotic analytical expressions for the <b>steady-state,</b> transport limited <b>photocurrent</b> generated at MOREs with thin microrings ((ring inner radius) /(ring outer radius) values > 0. 99) for two general types of photoelectrochemical system (a) the PE (photophysical-electrochemical) system, wherein the photoexcited species itself is directly detected on the ring; and (b) the PCE (photophysical-chemical-electrochemical) system, wherein the photoexcited species undergoes a homogeneous electron transfer reaction prior to electrochemical detection. The expressions are generated by exploiting the properties of discontinuous integrals of Bessel functions to solve the diffusion equation for the photogenerated electroactive species {{both inside and outside}} the beam. The resultant solutions are then matched at the beam surface. The expressions themselves are used to design experimental protocols that allow for the complete characterization of the photoelectrochemical kinetics of a system and are tested by using them to interpret the results of a MORE study of the photoelectrochemical behaviour of the Ru(bipy) (3) (2 +) /Fe 3 + photosensitiser/ quenching agent system. The value of the Stern-Volmer constant for the quenching of photoexcited Ru(bipy) (3) (2 +) by Fe obtained (0. 36 m(3) mol(- 1)) compares favourably with the value obtained from fluorescence measurements (0. 9 m(3) mol(- 1)).

40|$|This study {{compares the}} visible light reactivities and {{properties}} of two sensitized Pt/TiO 2 photocatalysts (Pt/ TiO 2 /RuL 3) on which ruthenium bipyridyl complexes (RuL 3) are anchored through carboxylic (c-RuL 3) or phosphonic (p-RuL 3) acid groups. The photoreductive dechlorination of CCl 4 and trichloroacetate (TCA) and the hydrogen production in aqueous suspensions {{were used as}} probe reactions for the visible light reactivity. The molar absorptivity of p-RuL 3 was {{lower than that of}} c-RuL 3, but Pt/TiO 2 /p-RuL 3 exhibited higher visible light activities than Pt/TiO 2 /c-RuL 3 for all tested reactions. On the other hand, the <b>steady-state</b> <b>photocurrent</b> obtained with the Pt/TiO 2 /p-RuL 3 (or TiO 2 /p-RuL 3) electrode was lower than that obtained with the Pt/TiO 2 / c-RuL 3 (or TiO 2 /c-RuL 3) electrode. As for the sensitizer adsorption, more p-RuL 3 than c-RuL 3 adsorbed on a TiO 2 surface over a wide pH range: the adsorption of p-RuL 3 decreased above pH 7, whereas that of c-RuL 3 was reduced even at pH > 4. Therefore, the photoreactivity of Pt/TiO 2 /p-RuL 3 was higher than that of Pt/TiO 2 /c-RuL 3 in the whole pH region tested. However, both sensitizer systems were not stable in aqueous solutions not only under visible light illumination but also in the dark. Both Pt/TiO 2 /c-RuL 3 and Pt/TiO 2 /p-RuL 3 in water gradually lost their photoreactivities with time, although the reactivity of the latter was consistently higher than that of the former. Ruthenium complexes on TiO 2 were slowly photodegraded under visible light, and both carboxylate and phosphonate linkages anchored on the TiO 2 surface were hydrolyzed in the absence of light, which was supported by FT-IR analysis. close 13612...|$|E
30|$|The MoS 2 layer {{crystals}} {{used for}} this study were grown using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using bromine (Br) as the transport agent [17]. The source material powders including molybdenum and sulfur together with the bromine were sealed in a quartz ampoule at a vacuum degree of 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 5  Torr. Prior to the CVT growth process, the ampoules were annealed at 1050  °C in an oven for 1  month to compound the source materials. The temperatures of the source and crystallization ends were, respectively, controlled at 1050 and 960  °C during the CVT growth. The MoS 2 nanoflakes were obtained by exfoliating bulk crystals using dicing tape and were then dispersed on the insulating SiO 2 (300  nm)/n-Si templates with pre-patterned Ti/Au circuits. Two platinum (Pt) metal contacts were subsequently deposited on the selected MoS 2 flakes using focused-ion beam (FIB) technique. The voltage and current of the ion beam for the Pt precursor decomposition were operated at 30  kV and 100  pA, respectively. In addition, silver paste was used for the metal electrode of the millimeter-sized MoS 2 bulks. The crystal quality of MoS 2 was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The thicknesses of the MoS 2 flakes were defined by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Electrical characterization was performed at an ultralow current leakage probe station (LakeShore Cryotronics TTP 4). The dc voltage and current were, respectively, sourced and measured by a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200 -SCS). A Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532  nm was used as an excitation light source for the photoconductivity measurement. An optical diffuser was used to broaden laser beam size (~ 20  mm 2) to uniformly illuminate the conduction channel of the nanoflake and bulk samples for the <b>steady-state</b> <b>photocurrent</b> measurements. The incident laser power was measured by a calibrated power meter (Ophir Nova II) with a silicon photodiode head (Ophir PD 300 -UV).|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} charge {{transport}} {{is fundamental to}} the operation of all electronic devices. In organic photovoltaics, high efficiencies can only be achieved if charge transport is able to extract charge carriers from the active layer with minimal recombination losses. This work presents {{new insights into the}} measurement of charge transport, the underlying physics, as well as new approaches for modelling. Numeric simulation software using a drift-diffusion-recombination model is developed and applied to organic photovoltaic devices. Specifically, this model is used to design and interpret charge transport experiments that are applicable to operational organic solar cells. Charge carrier mobility is studied using photogenerated charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) and the novel technique of resistance-dependent photovoltage (RPV). These experiments demonstrate the absence of "hot carrier" relaxation effects on the timescales of charge transport in several organic photovoltaic polymer:fullerene blends. This is surprising because it has previously been argued that such relaxation is the cause of the deterimental dispersive transport that affects many organic semiconductor devices. It is argued instead that dispersive transport arises from the loss of carriers to trap states. Next, the techniques are extended to recombination measurements, where the recombination coefficient in a benchmark polymer:fullerene system is found to depend upon the polymer's molecular weight. Modelling of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>photocurrent</b> produced by a solar cell demonstrates the conditions under which non-geminate recombination may be avoided, and presents a design rule for avoiding non-geminate recombination. Experimental measurements on devices of varying thickness support the conclusion that the space-charge limited current is a fundamental threshold for high-efficiency photocurrent extraction. Finally, fractional kinetics and generalised diffusion equations are explored. We show that the Poisson summation theorem permits the analytic solution of a fractional diffusion equation to be collapsed into closed form. Subsequently, these techniques are applied to a new type of kinetic model that is capable of unifying normal and dispersive transport within a single framework...|$|E
