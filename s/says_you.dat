25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus <b>says</b> <b>you</b> have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

[...] Following the tampering, Rhimes said she believes that Grey and Shepherd are meant to be together and that it in the end, they will end up with each other. Grey's relationship with Cristina Yang, has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to Grey as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale. Grey has been characterized, by some, as [...] "whiny".

After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman.

500|$|Side Two {{opens with}} the young man's dying {{thoughts}} turning to his recent breakup with the unnamed lover ("Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"); the song was written quite late in the album's production, shortly before the album was released. The song documents the breakup of a relationship where {{despite the fact that}} the man wants and needs the woman, he will never love her; he tries to be positive and supportive, however, in emphasizing that wanting her and needing her are very positive things—i.e., [...] "ain't bad"—which gives the song an ironic twist. A further twist is that the reason the man will never love the woman is because he already loves another woman, who broke up with him because she already loved another man. Rundgren identifies how the song was influenced by the Eagles, who were successful at the time. The producer also highlights the [...] "underlying humor in the lyrics", citing the line [...] "There ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box." [...] He <b>says</b> <b>you</b> could only [...] "get away" [...] with that lyric [...] "in a Meat Loaf song".|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{shows how}} Chicanas, like women {{of many other}} ethnicities, {{internalize}} these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In The House on Mango Street, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman’s hips have: [...] "They’re good for holding a baby when you’re cooking, Rachel <b>says...</b> <b>You</b> need them to dance, says Lucy... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know." [...] Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her [...] "sexual initiation"—an assault {{by a group of}} Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but [...] "by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives.|$|E

500|$|During {{both the}} late 1990s and the 2000s, glam metal {{began to have}} {{something}} of a revival. Some established acts who had managed to weather the storm enjoyed renewed popularity, others reformed and new bands emerged to emulate the glam metal style. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with [...] "It's My Life" [...] (2000). They branched into country music with a version of their 2005 song [...] "Who <b>Says</b> <b>You</b> Can't Go Home", which reached {{number one on the}} Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 and the rock/country album Lost Highway which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound and reached number one on the Billboard 200. Mötley Crüe reunited with Vince Neil to record the 1997 album Generation Swine and Poison reunited with guitarist C.C. DeVille in 1999, producing the mostly live Power to the People (2000); both bands began to tour extensively. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007). The long-awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum in the US, produced no hit singles, and failed to come close {{to the success of the}} band's late 1980s and early 1990s material.

Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. [...] There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 {{by the death of}} bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long-awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close {{to the success of the}} band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008).
