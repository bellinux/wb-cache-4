50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>metabolites</b> are organic {{compounds}} {{that are not}} {{directly involved in the}} normal growth, development, or reproduction of an organism. Unlike primary <b>metabolites,</b> absence of <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolites</b> does not result in immediate death, but rather in long-term impairment of the organism's survivability, fecundity, or aesthetics, or perhaps in no significant change at all. <b>Secondary</b> <b>metabolites</b> are often restricted to a narrow set of species within a phylogenetic group. <b>Secondary</b> <b>metabolites</b> often {{play an important role in}} plant defense against herbivory and other interspecies defenses. Humans use <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolites</b> as medicines, flavorings, and recreational drugs.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of jasmonic acid {{may play a role in}} downregulation of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolite</b> production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes {{digestive}} fluids are sterile before pitchers {{open and}} contain secondary metabolites and proteins {{that act as}} bactericides and fungicides after the pitcher opens. While the digestive fluid is being produced, the pitcher is not yet open, {{so there is no}} chance of microbial contamination. During pitcher development, at least 29 digestive proteins including proteases, chitinases, pathogenesis-related proteins and thaumatin-like proteins are produced in the pitcher fluid. In addition to breaking down prey, these can act as antimicrobial agents. When the pitchers open, the fluid is exposed to bacteria, fungal spores, insects and rain. Often pitchers have a lid that covers the trap, excepting a few (e.g. N. lowii, N. attenboroughii and N. jamban), preventing rain water from entering. The lid inhibits rainwater from diluting the digestive fluid. Once the bacteria and fungi enter the fluid, secondary metabolites are produced in addition to antimicrobial proteins. Naphthoquinones, a class of <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolite,</b> are commonly produced, and these either kill or inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria and fungi. This adaptation could have evolved since Nepenthes plants that could produce secondary metabolites and antimicrobial proteins to kill bacteria and fungi were most likely more fit. Plants that produced antimicrobial compounds could prevent loss of valuable nutrients gained from insects within the pitcher. Since Nepenthes cannot digest certain bacteria and fungi, the bactericides and fungicides allow plants to maximize nutrient uptake.|$|E
