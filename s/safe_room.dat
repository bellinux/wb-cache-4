5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them.

5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense of Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private <b>safe</b> <b>room.</b> At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) awarded over 2 {{million dollars}} for the {{construction}} of area <b>safe</b> <b>rooms.</b> The <b>safe</b> <b>rooms</b> in Dyersburg are located beside Dyersburg High School and across from Fire Station 1 in Downtown.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safe</b> <b>rooms</b> {{may contain}} {{communications}} equipment, {{such as a}} cellular telephone, land-line telephone or an amateur radio transceiver, so that law enforcement authorities can be contacted. There {{may also be a}} monitor for external security cameras and an alarm system. In basic <b>safe</b> <b>rooms,</b> a peephole in the door may be used for a similar purpose. <b>Safe</b> <b>rooms</b> are typically stocked with basic emergency and survival items such as a flashlight, blankets, a first-aid kit, water, packaged food, self-defense tools, a gas mask, and a simple portable toilet.|$|R
50|$|More {{expensive}} <b>safe</b> <b>rooms</b> have {{walls and}} a door reinforced with sheets of steel, Kevlar, or bullet-resistant fiberglass. The hinges and strike plate are often reinforced with long screws. Some <b>safe</b> <b>rooms</b> may also have externally vented ventilation systems and a separate telephone connection. They might also connect to an escape shaft.|$|R
5|$|Through his confession, Cobb makes {{peace with}} his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's {{projection}} and wakes Fischer {{up with a}} kick. Revived at the mountain hospital, Fischer enters a <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake {{on the plane and}} Saito makes a phone call.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1980s, Enya has {{attracted}} the attention of several stalkers. In 1996, an Italian man who was seen in Dublin wearing a photograph of Enya around his neck, stabbed himself outside her parents' pub after being ejected from the premises. In 2005, two people broke into her home; one attacked one of her maids and left with several of Enya's items. Enya raised the alarm in her <b>safe</b> <b>room.</b> The incident led Enya to spend roughly £250,000 on security improvements, covering gaps in the castle's outer wall and installing bollards and iron railings.|$|E
25|$|General Stone {{orders the}} {{building}} to be quarantined and District One {{to be put into}} Code Red lockdown. Civilians are herded into safe rooms, but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room containing a large crowd and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The mob - now with half its members infected - breaks out of the <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> and into the streets. Scarlet, a U.S. Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy, and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. General Stone orders District One to be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but he refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who are possibly infected.|$|E
25|$|Back in 1973, Wolverine {{contacts}} Xavier and Beast then recruit Quicksilver {{to release}} the young Magneto from his prison underneath the Pentagon, {{where he had been}} captive since 1963 for his apparent role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and of which he kept maintaining his innocence. Magneto helps them stop Mystique from killing Trask at the Paris Peace Accords but then decides to take matters at his own. He laces the prototype Sentinels with steel to be able to control them, commandeers the Sentinels at their White House unveiling to attack the crowd, then sets the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium around the White House as a barricade. Using his powers, Magneto pulls the <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> out of the White House, makes a speech at the television cameras regarding mutant superiority, and prepares to kill President Richard Nixon and his cabinet. Afterward, Nixon turns out to be Mystique in disguise who shoots Magneto in the neck. Magneto is labeled a mutant terrorist for his attack against Nixon and the world leaders unite to hunt him down. His actions also demonstrate the threat the Sentinels pose if they are in the wrong hands and used against people, becomes one of the contributing factors that lead to the cancellation of the Sentinel program and averting the dystopian future.|$|E

500|$|This brings Marius to the [...] "present day" [...] of the game's narrative: {{he gives}} the small sack, {{containing}} Boudica's severed head, to his subordinate, escorts Nero to his <b>safe</b> <b>room,</b> and tells his tale. Nero, who has since deduced that Marius is Damocles, flees deeper into his bolt hole. As Marius gives chase, he is temporarily distracted by Aquilo, {{the god of the}} north wind, who has been aiding Nero and whose stated goal is to cause the collapse of Rome. He is then mortally wounded by Nero and his elite guard, who were waiting to ambush him. However, Summer helps Marius claim the victory, and Marius tosses both Nero and himself off a parapet, where Nero is impaled on the sword of his own statue, fulfilling the Oracle's prophecy. Marius falls to the ground and dies from his wounds as Summer and Aquilo both vanish.|$|E
500|$|Various {{scenes in}} the episode were changed or removed because of {{broadcast}} censors. Originally, just after Peter hands Brian his test results from the MacArthur Program, Peter was to ask [...] "Would a retarded person have peed in their pants?", then urinate in his trousers. However, because broadcasting standards prohibited this, it was changed to [...] "Well, would a mentally retarded guy have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house in celebration of his fantastic test results?". Brian stating to Peter [...] "In your fucking face, Fuckwad" [...] after Peter performs poorly on the test was censored from television broadcasting and on the censored track on the DVD, but can be heard uncensored on the uncensored audio track. This {{marks the first time}} that the word [...] "fuck" [...] has been heard uncensored in a Family Guy episode. The Family Guy orchestra sung and recorded a song for a sequence which showed several Quahog citizens learning and talking about Peter being declared as retarded. However, this was removed from the episode because broadcasting standards believed it used the word [...] "retarded" [...] too many times. After Peter loses custody of the kids, Chris was originally to stay with Mort Goldman, Stewie with Cleveland and Meg with Quagmire. During this original sequence, Mort was to tell Chris that he has two anuses, causing Quagmire to force Meg to lock him in a <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> as he could not trust himself around Meg's friends, but the series was prohibited from broadcasting it by an unknown authority, presumably broadcasting standards.|$|E
2500|$|In private homes, some similar {{stairway}} {{rooms have}} been used, or an interior room/closet kept clear to quickly allow entry when a storm is {{seen or heard}} approaching (the wind roar intensifies, sounding like a swift [...] "freight train" [...] coming nearer, louder). With weeks or months to prepare, an interior <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> can be constructed, with space for emergency water, food and flashlights, and a telephone to call for rescue if the exit becomes blocked by falling debris.

40|$|Throughout the United States, {{hundreds}} of tornados and several hurricanes affect people’s livelihoods each year. These natural disasters not only cause structural damage to property, they also cause numerous injuries, and regrettably, {{far too many}} deaths of people caught in their path. In an effort to increase the probability of surviving the strong winds and associated flying debris of these ferocious storms, a number of Americans are installing <b>safe</b> <b>rooms</b> in their homes. In recent years, researchers at the U. S. Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), in Madison, Wisconsin, {{conducted a series of}} studies to examine the effectiveness of various materials and wall designs for use in such <b>safe</b> <b>rooms.</b> A key element of the research was the use of an air-pressure debris launcher that was donated to FPL by th...|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, Torre and {{his wife}} Ali {{established}} the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation. In October 2007 the Foundation partnered with the Union City, New Jersey Board of Education and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (NHCAC) to establish the Foundation's Margaret Place initiative at Union City, New Jersey's José Martí Middle School, with a $325,000 donation from Verizon. It continues to receive yearly funding from that company of up to $65,000. The Foundation's mission is to educate and prevent domestic violence. Margaret's Place is named after Torre's mother, who {{was a victim of}} verbal and physical abuse at the hands of Torre's New York City Police officer father when Torre was a child. Torre describes his father as a [...] "bully", and while Torre himself was not a target of his father's violence, he has related that he never felt safe at home, and grew up in fear for his mother, saying, [...] "I always felt responsible for it. I never thought I belonged anywhere. I never felt safe except on the ball field." [...] Margaret's Place is a comprehensive program that provides students with a <b>safe</b> <b>room</b> in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic violence intervention and prevention in order to address the student's home situation and educate them to understand domestic violence's impact on the community. The children are also given the opportunity to read, play games or talk about their experience with others. The program, which is administered by health care professionals from North Hudson Community Action Corp, also includes an anti-violence campaign within the school, and training for teachers and counselors. It has grown to 11 sites in the region, though Union City's is the only such program in New Jersey.|$|E
