50|$|Many locals in {{the region}} attest to {{environmental}} damage that allegedly developed {{as a result of}} the leak. Past oil spills in the delta's creeks have been left to fester for decades, polluting the air, soil, and water of impoverished communities. Nigeria <b>sees</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> output growth largely in offshore fields and does not want spills there to compound its environmental woes. Checks by Sahara Reporters revealed that the fishermen reportedly hauled in fish killed in the ExxonMobil’s oil spill in a location about 20 kilometers from the shoreline and supplied the bad fish to unsuspecting members of the public. The Nigerian Environmental Rights Action group issued a demand for N51 billion ($100 Million) from ExxonMobil in Nigeria for their failure to compensate fishermen within the coastal areas who suffered devastating losses due to the oil company’s exploration activities and major oil spills. Thick balls of tar have also been sighted washed upon the shoreline as well as oil slicks. The spill has only exacerbated the already growing problem of pollution in the Delta. The Nigerian government estimates there were over 7,000 spills, large and small, between 1970 and 2000, according to the BBC. That is approximately 300 spills a year, and some spills have been leaking for years. Vast swathes of the Delta have been seen covered with tar and stagnant lakes of crude due to oil spills of the past.|$|E
40|$|At {{a time of}} {{economic}} retrenchment and growing uncertainty within Europe, it may seem strange that the UK <b>sees</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> military security increasingly ‘east of Suez’. Such an emotive phrase suggests imperial ambitions {{at a time when}} UK armed forces are smaller than they have been for 200 years. But there are compelling reasons for the UK to take its Gulf relationships much more seriously. The military intends to build up a strong shadow presence around the Gulf; not an evident imperial-style footprint, but a smart presence with facilities, defence agreements, rotation of training, transit and jumping-off points for forces that aim to be more adaptable and agile as they face the post-Afghanistan years from 2014. The Minhad airbase at Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has emerged as the key to this smart presence and more will be heard about it, alongside the Typhoon deal with the UAE, in the near future. This may not yet be declared government policy; indeed, the governmen...|$|E
50|$|In {{this period}} there was {{considerable}} disparity in the systems used on the railways of the country, and compatibility between locomotive and the vehicles of another company, for example on through trains, was a serious issue. The company began to <b>see</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> as an ally of the Midland Railway, a large English system using the automatic vacuum brake, and in 1884 decided to convert to that system. There was a lengthy transition period during which compatibility with other companies' rolling stock was a problem.|$|R

China now <b>sees</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> growth within this strategy and accordingly as driven by: a rising share of consumption; moving to a low-carbon economy; and innovation. Two indicators are examined – capital efficiency {{and the relationship between}} greenhouse gas emissions and output. These help us to understand the scale of the challenges and possibilities in China over the coming decades. The power of China’s example will be immense in influencing the world’s transition to a low-carbon economy and thus how successful the world will be in managing the huge risks of climate change. The 12 th plan is very likely to establish China as a leader in the new energy-industrial revolution and demonstrate to the world the potential of this revolution. The implications for the rich countries from such radical change are profound and they should be discussing now how they will handle and respond to such massive change. ...|$|E

40|$|Critical success {{factors and}} lessons learnt from our {{mistakes}} {{are two sides}} of the same coin. Evidence which contributes to debates in this area can emerge from a number of different sources. The current era of using the Web and the Internet to enhance learning builds on significant advances which were made from the mid- 1990 's. Over the last decade and a half numerous projects and programs worldwide have attempted to harness the power of computers and communications technologies to enhance learning. The literature on technology enhanced learning contains much on individual innovations which have been engineered to address specific educational issues. But individual institutions are also consolidating learning through activities such as benchmarking of e-learning. The evidence can therefore be drawn from two rather different perspectives, the individual technologically inspired view, and the more holistic, strategic, institutional view. Most conferences and workshops report on success stories only. But reality consists of successes, failures, and many points in between. Perhaps the most interesting is the knowledge which has accumulated which enables project managers to identify potential failures at an early stage and apply remedial measures. This type of knowledge is extremely valuable. Millions are being invested to innovate education, and to build European-wide strength and cohesion in the area of technology enhanced learning. As a community which <b>sees</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> strength in knowledge, harnessing technology effectively to facilitate high quality post-secondary education is especially important. For this reason, it would be especially helpful to develop a Pan European perspective which is able to differentiate between factors which are specific to particular approaches to education, and those understandings which have a more global value. A useful discussion was begun at previous conferences, but there are many more contributions which could be made. What hard-learned lessons aren't we hearing about? What are the challenges that even successful projects have faced? What about the projects that don't' work out as planned...|$|E

The objective of this work is the approach to the new legal framework applicable to the cogeneration activity in Portugal. In thatway, an energy audit was done based on an existing cogeneration plant. A comparison of the results obtained by applying the newlegal framework with the results obtained by previous legislation was carried out. The avoided CO 2 emissions were comparedwith separate heat and electricity production.

40|$|Increasing {{importance}} of environmental concerns, {{growing demand for}} renewable energy, future introduction of electrical cars, improving energy efficiency, ambivalent attitude of society to nuclear power and multiple other external factors may become driving forces for future changes within the hydropower field in Sweden. On the other hand the dynamics for these changes can emerge from the value-systems, arguments, intentions and actions of the stakeholders, {{many of which are}} not satisfied by the present situation within the sector, but <b>see</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> changes in a different way. This makes the study case of hydropower in Sweden challenging for technology assessment {{and at the same time}} the technology assessment method, the scenario workshop that can provide interaction among the opposing parties and serve as a bridging event between the phase when various ways of future technology development are promoted by various actors and the decision-making phase. The ensuing research question is if the scenario workshop can be successfully applied to the hydropower case, the technology which is more than hundred years old, and if it can improve communication among the stakeholders to enhance their learning. The learning implies different dimensions such as Improved articulation of the problems at hand, probing each other‟s world and better understanding of the other stakeholders‟ positions and value systems, driving forces and crucial events for the future development of the whole hydropower sector and possible scenarios for this development. In order to answer this question more than 20 interviews with the main stakeholders have been carried out and a workshop based on possible external and internal future scenarios for hydropower in Sweden was organized. Evaluation of the workshop showed that the chosen method was efficient and the aim, which was stakeholders learning, was reached...|$|R

40|$|The article {{investigated}} the geopolitical {{assessments of the}} results of the Summit of «Group of Twenty», which took place in Hangzhou from 4 till 5 September, 2016. The main idea of this event was the development of  innovation, healthy, coherent and inclusive economy. Moreover, important for the geopolitical consolidation of efforts of member countries in the context of further development of the world economy was making such documents as: Contours of the innovative growth of «Group of Twenty», Action plan of «Group of Twenty» in connection with a new industrial revolution, Hangzhou action plan, which set out a strategy for overall and confident growth and also initiative of «Group of twenty» in development and cooperation in the field of digital economy. Important thing is that analysis of the Summit’s results for world regions is important from a geopolitical point of view. We can predict that in the future geopolitical dialogue between the EU and the US in the economy will become more vital for both sides, and will enable to contribute to the implementation of more global challenges of the global economy. We should mention that Summit of «Group of Twenty» largely determined the prospects of global economic processes and build a new world economic order with the introduction of innovative approaches and elements of the digital economy. Activity on the functioning of the global economy should be based on the collective efforts of all participants and take into account all the realities on the international stage. No less important is that the Summit proved the presence of leading geopolitical centers that affect not only the balance of power in the world, but also the further development of key economic processes. Each of these centers <b>sees</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> not only the global economy but the global system as a whole as well as its geopolitical influence in certain regions and countries. On the one hand, as for the development of innovative, healthy, coherent and inclusive global economy, we should say that this is a long-term process, which must go through a series of complex geopolitical discussions and negotiations as to what will be the future of the world economy. On the other hand, in order to achieve the final goal, we must also consider the political and security aspects. Without achieving normalization of relations between the parties, which are now involved in the conflicts in different regions without increasing counteracting terrorism, without implementation of the agreements, without actualization of the role of diplomacy it is not possible the formation of a stable, functional and efficient global economic system. Geopolitical factors largely determine not only the behavior of states on the international stage, but also the ways in which global processes carried out, including economic. Therefore, in this context important is the consolidation of efforts and resource potential for continuation of work on a new global economic order of the XXI century, which would take into account all needs of humanity...|$|E

Whilst the availability of market data has benefits it also creates problems, notably those relating to questions of meaning, judgment and intervention: how {{to make sense of}} these flows – how to <b>see</b> the ‘market’, <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> and thus act pre-emptively. Over more recent years financial organisations have been turning to new technologies of representation, in particular the design and application of visualisation software in an effort to enable better visual imagination of and interaction with markets as they unfold in real-time. ‘What {{you see is what you}} risk’ in many respects captures the thinking or at least the desire underlying the employment of the latest visualisation software. The more powerful one’s vision the better able one is to participate in increasingly complex {{financial markets}}, at least in theory. Based on recent interviews with those involved in developing and using the latest visualisation software within some of the key markets of global finance, and developing the influential work of Daniel Beunza and David Stark, and Karin Knorr Cetina, in particular, this paper adopts a cultural economy of finance perspective to examine the implications of these new techniques of representation. The paper argues that the latest visual turn within finance should be afforded a more central position in the study of contemporary financial market practices. ...|$|R
