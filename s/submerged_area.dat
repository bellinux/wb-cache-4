40|$|Schistosomiasis japonica is an {{infectious}} disease caused by Schistosoma japonicum, {{and it remains}} endemic in China. Flooding is the main hazard factor, as it causes the spread of Oncomelania hupensis, the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, thereby triggering schistosomiasis outbreaks. Based on multi-source real-time remote sensing data, we used remote sensing (RS) technology, especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to carry out warning research on potential snail habitats within the snail dispersal range following flooding. Our research result demonstrated: (1) SAR data from Sentinel- 1 A before and during a flood were used to identify <b>submerged</b> <b>areas</b> rapidly and effectively; (2) the likelihood of snail survival {{was positively correlated with}} the clay proportion, core area standard deviation, and ditch length but negatively correlated with the wetness index, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), elevation, woodland area, and construction land area; (3) the snail habitats were most abundant near rivers and ditches in paddy fields; (4) the rivers and paddy irrigation ditches in the <b>submerged</b> <b>areas</b> must be the focused of mitigation efforts following future floods...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} and monitoring of fluvial topography at high {{spatial and temporal}} resolutions is in increasing demand {{for a range of}} river science and management applications, including change detection, hydraulic models, habitat assessments, river restorations and sediment budgets. Existing approaches are yet to provide a single technique for rapidly quantifying fluvial topography in both exposed and <b>submerged</b> <b>areas,</b> with high spatial resolution, reach-scale continuous coverage, high accuracy and reasonable cost. In this paper, we explore the potential of using imagery acquired from a small unmanned aerial system (UAS) and processed using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry for filling this gap. We use a rotary winged hexacopter known as the Draganflyer X 6, a consumer grade digital camera (Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX 3) and the commercially available PhotoScan Pro SfM software (Agisoft LLC). We test the approach on three contrasting river systems; a shallow margin of the San Pedro River in the Valdivia region of south-central Chile, the lowland River Arrow in Warwickshire, UK, and the upland Coledale Beck in Cumbria, UK. Digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos of hyperspatial resolution (0. 01 - 0. 02 m) are produced. Mean elevation errors are found to vary somewhat between sites, dependent on vegetation coverage and the spatial arrangement of ground control points (GCPs) used to georeference the data. Mean errors are in the range 4 - 44 mm for exposed areas and 17 - 89 mm for <b>submerged</b> <b>areas.</b> Errors in <b>submerged</b> <b>areas</b> can be improved to 4 - 56 mm with the application of a simple refraction correction procedure. Multiple surveys of the River Arrow site show consistently high quality results, indicating the repeatability of the approach. This work therefore demonstrates the potential of a UAS-SfM approach for quantifying fluvial topography...|$|R

40|$|The Selvagens Islands {{are located}} in the northeastern Atlantic between the Canary Islands and Madeira Island. As a result of their small size, remote {{location}} and harsh sea conditions only a few studies have been conducted to describe their marine species diversity. We were able to identify 29 new coastal fish species, an increase of 33 % in the ichthyofauna described for these islands (n = 88). There is a prevalence of species with tropical affinities and only 2. 3 % (n = 2) are endemic to Macaronesia. Considered a stepping-stone colonization vector from the nearest continental shore, as proposed by other authors for this region, the Selvagens Islands host 34. 1 % of the ichthyofauna described for the much larger Canary Islands (nspecies = 258, <b>submerged</b> <b>area</b> nSelvagensIs. = 2. 3 %) and 47. 3 % of the ichthyofauna described for the more distantly located Madeira Island (nspecies = 186, <b>submerged</b> <b>area</b> nSelvagensIs. = 17. 9 %). Interestingly, 6. 8 % (n = 6) of the species failed {{to bridge the gap between}} the Selvagens Islands and Madeira Island. Data collected so far showed no trend toward an increasing number of species with high dispersal capability. The Selvagens Islands are an example of a high coastal species diversity occurring even in very small areas of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean.
