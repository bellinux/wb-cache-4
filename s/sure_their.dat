25|$|Trout {{from local}} streams {{had been a}} dietary staple since the {{earliest}} days of settlement in the Catskills. The farmers used every means they could, including bait, nets, and even sledgehammers, to catch enough to make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> families had plenty to eat whatever the outcome of their harvests. By the 1840s the Esopus's trout fishery was beginning to attract anglers from outside the region. Many stayed at Milo Barber's Inn in Shandaken.|$|E
25|$|Egyptians {{looked at}} the afterlife as a {{continuation}} of this life, and believed {{that they would be}} able to enjoy many of the same activities. They also held the belief that {{they would be able to}} maintain the same social hierarchy. Egyptians, especially upper class Egyptians, were very preoccupied with making <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> life to come would be as comfortable, if not more comfortable, than their life on earth. They took every precautionary measure to ensure that they would enjoy the same comforts. Excavated tombs were found to contain food, painted murals, statues, jewelry, and various other items.|$|E
25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants. The role of the Squad Leaders is to make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> respective rows are at rehearsal on time, take attendance for the row, and make sure all members in the row are striving for their best during each rehearsal and performance. Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row challenges on Mondays. The Squad Leaders must also try out for the band, typically during {{the week before the}} rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad Leaders have been cut from the band in past years. In this case, the Assistant would become Head Squad Leader, and one of the highest scoring returning band members would be offered the position of Assistant.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, nutritional needs, reproductive status, and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively to make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> diet and environmental conditions are conducive to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd {{that are in the}} resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called heifers. They will grow up {{to take the place of}} older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd.|$|E

[...] The friend also said that Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced. She and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma. Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting {{in the back of the}} car trying to make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> mother was still breathing.|$|E
500|$|There is {{no record}} of the {{children}} giving a formal concert at Versailles. In February 1764 they were given 50 louis d'or (about 550 florins) and a gold snuff-box by the royal entertainments office, presumably for entertaining the royal family privately, but no more details are available. Further concerts were given in Paris on 10 March and on 9 April, at a private theatre in the rue et Porte St Honoré. At the same time Wolfgang's first published works were printed: two pairs of sonatas for harpsichord and violin, K. 6 and 7, and K. 8 and 9. These pairs became Opus 1 and Opus 2 in Leopold's private catalogue of his son's work. The first pair was dedicated to the king's daughter, Madame Victoire de France, the second to the Countess of Tessé. Mozart biographer Stanley Sadie comments that some aspects of these pieces are rather childish and naïve, but that nevertheless their technique is [...] "astonishingly <b>sure,</b> <b>their</b> line of thinking is clear and smooth, and their formal balance is beyond reproach".|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E
500|$|When the American {{actress who}} had been hired to play Anne dropped out just {{before the start of}} {{principal}} photography, Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role. Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own, and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously, who she said had much more personality than Anne. She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written. Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film, and that only the American characters had discernible personalities. Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough, Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright Tennessee Williams and their experience in theatre, leading the director to make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> shared scenes [...] "were an ordeal to endure". The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa, [...] "leave my woman alone!" [...] Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly, continuing over the film's end credits. She had been directed to scream only a little, but knowing it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete, Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time, much to Argento's and the crew's surprise. Nicolodi said the scene was her [...] "cathartic release from the whole nightmare".|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E

500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make <b>sure</b> <b>their</b> voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E
