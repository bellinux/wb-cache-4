40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{computational}} {{performance of the}} direct <b>substructuring</b> method. <b>Substructuring</b> is used to reduce the computing time in the implicit simulation of single point incremental forming (SPIF). <b>Substructuring</b> divides the finite element (FE) mesh into several non-overlapped <b>substructures.</b> The <b>substructures</b> are categorized into two groups: the plastic–nonlinear–substructures and the elastic–pseudo-linear–substructures. The plastic <b>substructures</b> assemble {{a part of the}} FE mesh that is in contact with the forming tool; they are treated by the fully nonlinear method. The elastic <b>substructures</b> model the elastic deformation {{of the rest of the}} FE mesh. Two approaches are used to treat the elastic substructures: the linearized approach and the condensed linearized approach. In both approaches, the geometrical and the material behaviour are assumed linear within the increment. The geometrical and material nonlinearity are considered after convergence. Combined with the plastic <b>substructures</b> treatment, the approaches are refered to as the plastic linear elastic (PLE) approach and the plastic condensed linear elastic approach (PCLE). The <b>substructures</b> categorization in plastic and elastic <b>substructures</b> is adapted during the simulation to capture the tool motion.

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} for an arbitrarily interconnected collection of <b>substructures</b> are derived. The <b>substructures</b> are elastic bodies which may be idealized as finite element assemblies and are subject to small deformations relative to a nominal state.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a direct <b>substructuring</b> method {{to reduce the}} computing time of implicit simulations of single point incremental forming (SPIF). <b>Substructuring</b> is used to divide the finite element (FE) mesh into several non-overlapping parts. Based on the hypothesis that plastic deformation is localized, the <b>substructures</b> are categorized into two groups: the plastic—nonlinear—substructures and the elastic—pseudo-linear—substructures. The plastic <b>substructures</b> assemble {{a part of the}} FE mesh that is in contact with the forming tool; they are iteratively updated respecting all nonlinearities. The elastic <b>substructures</b> model the elastic deformation {{of the rest of the}} FE mesh. For these <b>substructures,</b> the geometrical and the material behaviour are assumed linear within the increment. The stiffness matrices and the internal force vectors are calculated at the beginning of each increment then they are statically condensed to eliminate the internal degrees of freedom (DOF). In the iteration process the condensed stiffness matrices for the elastic <b>substructures</b> are kept constant. The condensed internal force vectors are updated by the multiplication of the condensed stiffness matrices and the displacement increments. After convergence, any geometrical and material nonlinearity for the elastic <b>substructures</b> are nonlinearly updated. The categorization of <b>substructures</b> in plastic and elastic domains is adapted during the simulation to capture the tool motion. The resulting, plastic and condensed elastic, set of equations is solved on a single processor. In an example with 1600 shell elements, the presented <b>substructuring</b> of the SPIF implicit simulation is 2. 4 times faster than the classical implicit simulation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the concept of modelling dynamical systems using numerical–experimental <b>substructuring.</b> This type of modelling is applicable to large or complex systems, where {{some part of the}} system is difficult to model numerically.

Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production.

Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E

A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier13 was repaired.

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the <b>substructure</b> of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since {{the addition of the}} steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves.

5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately.

However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers. The three piers from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17. On August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge. The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.|$|E
