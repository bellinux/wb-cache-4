5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A <b>screen</b> <b>overlay</b> adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An <b>screen</b> <b>overlay</b> shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E
500|$|The iPad 2 {{features}} an Apple A5 package-on-package (PoP) System-on-chip (SoC), which comprises a 1GHz dual-core 32-bit Cortex-A9 CPU, 512 MB of RAM and a dual-core PowerVR SGX543MP2 GPU. Other features include {{front and rear}} cameras, a three-axis gyroscope, headset controls, proximity and ambient light sensors, microphone, magnetometer, accelerometer and a 9.7inch multi-touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024×768 hence resulting in 132 ppi. The iPad 2 has four physical switches, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute. The home button on the iPad 2 is [...] "easier to double tap" [...] than the previous generation of the iPad. Apple reduced {{the size of the}} iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display, integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch <b>screen</b> <b>overlay,</b> and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery. The iPad 2's screen is thinner, lighter, and yet stronger than the original iPad's. The iPad 2 also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter and through AirPlay as of iOS 5.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different <b>screen</b> <b>overlays</b> and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|R

50|$|Tomohiro Nishikado's {{original}} Western Gun {{design was}} based on discrete logic, like most video arcade games of the time. When Dave Nutting adapted it for Midway, he decided to base it on the Intel 8080, which made Gun Fight the first video game to use a microprocessor, since his company Dave Nutting Associates had already licensed the technology for the first arcade pinball machine to include a microprocessor, The Spirit of '76. Nishikado believed that his original version was more fun, but {{was impressed with the}} improved graphics and smoother animation of Midway's version. This led him to design microprocessors into his subsequent games, including the blockbuster 1978 shoot 'em up hit Space Invaders. Gun Fight uses a black-and-white raster monitor and a yellow <b>screen</b> <b>overlay.</b>|$|E

Four methods for presenting help were compared: WINDOW (a five line help display was presented simultaneously with the display of task text), DUAL (two lines of help were presented simultaneous with the task on the first help request, and a full <b>screen</b> <b>overlayed</b> the task on the next request), FULL (a full <b>screen</b> of help <b>overlayed</b> the task), and MANUAL (help was available off-line in a book). Two types of tasks were assigned to users in each help condition: SIMPLE (all necessary information to complete the tasks was given) and COMPLEX (users were forced to find and remember information pertinent to task completion). Typical computer tasks, such as file and job management were performed. Measures were taken for each set of simple or complex tasks. Dependent measures were 1) the average time to complete each task, 2) the number of steps taken beyond the optimal number for the set, 3) the average time spent in help per task, 4) the average time spent in help per request, 5) {{the average number of}} times help was accessed per task, and 6) the average total time to complete each task, including help time. The FULL help group spent significantly less time in help per task, and along with the DUAL help group, less time in help per request than did the other groups. However, FULL help users spent significantly longer in help per task than DUAL help users spent on the full screen of help presented to them per task...|$|R

It {{was inspired by the}} radar displays used in World War II. Goldsmith and Mann were granted their patent in December 14, 1948 {{making it one of the}} first ever patent for an electronic game. Entitled [...] "Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device", the patent describes a game in which a player controls the CRT's electron gun much like an Etch A Sketch. The beam from the gun is focused at a single point on the screen to form a dot representing a missile, and the player tries to control the dot to hit paper targets put on the screen, with all hits detected mechanically. By connecting a cathode ray tube to an oscilloscope and devising knobs that controlled the angle and trajectory of the light traces displayed on the oscilloscope, they were able to invent a missile game that, when using <b>screen</b> <b>overlays,</b> created the effect of firing missiles at various targets. [...] To make the game more challenging, its circuits can alter the player's ability to aim the dot. However, due to the equipment costs and various circumstances, the Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device was never released to the marketplace. Only handmade prototypes were ever created.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{a model for}} the design of {{mathematical}} software was developed and tested. The model, which is based upon current cognitive theories of learning, was used to design Transformer, a computer learning environment (CLE) for exploring transformational geometry. ^ In a pilot study, the software was used in middle-school classrooms and in in-service workshops, and then refined for use in the current study which tested the design model qualitatively. Two cycles of in-depth interviews were conducted with each of twelve high-school students, who used the CLE to solve geometric problems. Transcripts from videotapes of student work on two problems were extracted and subjected to a protocol analysis. Analysis revealed patterns of misconceptions and patterns of problem-solving approaches by the students, which led to suggested improvements in software design model and in the CLE. The most common misconceptions, confusions regarding reflections and rotations, led to redesigning display features including placement of mirrors and animation of rotation. ^ Many participants found the use of both physical manipulatives and transparent <b>screen</b> <b>overlays</b> a significant problem-solving aid. It was concluded that CLEs which incorporate the use of such manipulatives would be easier to understand for many students. The model was expanded to include design principles of making the CLE accessible to a greater number of students. ^ Implications of the research for mathematics education and for software design are discussed and suggestions for further testing of the model presented.

40|$|Various {{studies have}} shown {{subjects}} to mislocalize cutaneous stimuli in an idiosyncratic manner. Spatial properties of individual localization behavior can be represented {{in the form of}} perceptual maps. Individual differences in these maps may reflect properties of internal body representations, and perceptual maps may therefore be a useful method for studying these representations. For this to be the case, individual perceptual maps need to be reproducible, which has not yet been demonstrated. We assessed the reproducibility of localizations measured twice on subsequent days. Ten subjects participated in the experiments. Non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli were applied at seven sites on the lower arm. Subjects localized the stimuli on a photograph of their own arm, which was presented on a tablet <b>screen</b> <b>overlaying</b> the real arm. Reproducibility was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the mean localizations of each electrode site and the slope and offset of regression models of the localizations, which represent scaling and displacement of perceptual maps relative to the stimulated sites. The ICCs of the mean localizations ranged from 0. 68 to 0. 93; the ICCs of the regression parameters were 0. 88 for the intercept and 0. 92 for the slope. These results indicate a high degree of reproducibility. We conclude that localization patterns of non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli on the arm are reproducible on subsequent days. Reproducibility is a necessary property of perceptual maps for these to reflect properties of a subject’s internal body representations. Perceptual maps are therefore a promising method for studying body representations...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{screen and}} isolate peptide {{antibiotics}} producing epibiotic bacteria {{from the surface}} of the sea fan Juncella juncea, and partially purify the active compound. Methods: In this study, epibiotic bacteria were isolated by swabbing a small area of the coral surface with a sterile cotton swab, which was then directly swabbed on to Zobell marine agar plates. Antibiotic production was <b>screened</b> using agar <b>overlay</b> method and the active peptide was partially purified using anion exchange chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Phylogenetic identification based on comparative sequence analysis of 16 Ss rRNA gene indicated that the stain fell under the genera Streptomyces. Results: In the initial <b>screening</b> using agar <b>overlay</b> method the strain was found to exhibit broad spectral activity exhibiting both antibacterial and antifungal activities. Protease digestion of the crude extract resulted in the loss of activity indicating the proteinaceous nature of the active molecules. Bioassay guided purification using anion exchange chromatography, and RP-HPLC was carried and the active peptide was partially purified. An epibiotic Streptomyces strain CN 3 producing potent broad spectral peptide was isolated. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of epibiotic bacteria associated with corals as a potential source for the discovery of novel antimicrobials and other natural products...|$|R
