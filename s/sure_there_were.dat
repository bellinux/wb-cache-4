5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
25|$|Sega was {{supportive}} of the team's rewriting of the plot, sending over quality assurance and cohesion strike teams to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no issues with the in-game reactivity or plot holes, but they didn't have much involvement {{in regards to the}} narrative itself, with the publisher mainly focusing on the game and combat design. However, Urquhart said {{that one of the reasons}} for the game's development problems was due to indecision on Sega's part, particularly in regards to budgeting; he gave an example of one long segment of the game that cost around US$500,000 to produce, which was eventually cut because Sega thought it wasn't a good fit for the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} also secured $200 million {{of funding for}} Ottawa's O-Train expansion project after Treasury Board President John Baird reviewed the project to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no cost overruns. The money was secured after Ottawa's new council voted on the project. However, in November, Nepean-Carleton MP Pierre Poilievre announced that, despite opposition from most of Ottawa City Council, $35 million of the transit funding was to be diverted for a new Rideau River bridge crossings between the two Ottawa growing suburban communities, Barrhaven and Riverside South. Poilievre had stated that if the city of Ottawa would present a transit plan, a request to the government for new money for public transit projects will be granted. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated that no provincial money {{will be given to}} the bridge project if no rapid transit corridor is included.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the good}} reviews, {{there was no}} {{universal}} acclaim from critics as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] " [...] wasn't the most spectacular half-hour from this truncated season" [...] and [...] "unfortunately, there wasn't all that much that was funny about it. <b>Sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a couple of decent one-liners, but overall [...] offered up nothing new." [...] Despite these criticisms, Canning added further praise to the [...] "Midnight Train to Georgia" [...] performance. Canning gave this episode a rating of 8.4 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird {{was eager to}} use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, {{he was proud of}} the way the film was developed, noting that [...] "We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E

2500|$|Dayan's {{contention}} {{was denied}} by Muky Tsur, a longtime {{leader of the}} United Kibbutz Movement who said [...] "For <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> discussions about going up the Golan Heights or not going up the Golan Heights, but the discussions were about security for the kibbutzim in Galilee," [...] he said. [...] "I think that Dayan himself didn't {{want to go to}} the Golan Heights. This is something we've known for many years. But no kibbutz got any land from conquering the Golan Heights. People who went there went on their own. It's cynicism to say the kibbutzim wanted land." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Colombia was home to a German colony - estimated by the United States government in December 1941 to consist of about 4,000 people - and a small village of Japanese farmers in Cauca. The Americans were concerned {{about the possibility of a}} [...] "fifth column" [...] of subversives forming in Colombia and carrying out sabotage and the like against the nearby Panama Canal Zone. However, this view, in most instances, was not shared by the Colombian government. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some Axis agitators, such as the businessman Emil Prufert in Barranquilla, but the Colombian government was not convinced that all immigrants from Axis countries were enemy agents.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Hague, {{a friend}} of Al Smith, backed Smith against Franklin D. Roosevelt during {{the race for the}} Democratic nomination. When Roosevelt won the nomination, Hague offered to {{organize}} the biggest political rally anyone had ever seen if Roosevelt would launch his presidential campaign in New Jersey. When Roosevelt formally began his campaign with an event at the Jersey Shore town of Sea Girt, Hague's machine made <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several thousand Hudson County voters looking on and cheering. [...] Hague’s support was rewarded with funding for a massive medical center complex complete with a maternity hospital named after his mother, Margaret Hague. During the 1936 campaign Hague provided 150,000 adults and children to cheer Roosevelt during a visit.|$|E

2500|$|Hitchcock {{was glad}} to be out from under Selznick's thumb. There would be [...] "no sudsy violins in big love scenes, no more {{recycling}} of Selznick's favorite cues from past movies. He made <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no south-of-the-border cliches." [...] Selznick's exit also brought Hitchcock and Webb together into their natural sympatico. [...] "Selznick deplored 'Hitchcock's goddamned jigsaw cutting,' the dreamlike, jagged images that create his signature subjectivity. But Webb didn't mind jigsaw cutting at all. It complemented his fragmented musical architecture, just as the blocked passions of the film's characters reflect his unresolved harmonies. Like Hitchcock, Webb favored atmosphere and tonal nuance over broad gestures. Both men were classicists dealing in darkness and chaos." [...] They featured complementary personalities, too: [...] "Webb had a modest ego, a handy trait when working for a control addict like Hitchcock." [...] Notorious was, however, their only film together.|$|E
2500|$|With six laps {{remaining}} in the Bojangles' Southern 500, Busch cut a tire and subsequently caused a wreck that involved not only his car but also Ryan Newman. When leaving his pit (directly in front of Newman), Busch did a burnout and sped next to where crew members and NASCAR officials where standing. Following {{the conclusion of the}} race, while entering pit road, Busch bumped Newman's car. Busch explained the incident as an accident and unrelated, caused by taking his helmet off and not seeing where he was going. Andrew Rueger, Newman's gas man, went after Busch following the race. This turned into a heated argument, accidentally knocking over a NASCAR official. Newman, giving an interview to Sports Illustrated, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's easy to say that Kurt blew a fuse again, I'm not sure why he did it and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. And nobody is. I think the chemical imbalance speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going. I'm pretty <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> 42 other guys that are taking their helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me." [...] On May 15, 2012, NASCAR announced that Busch had been fined $50,000 and placed on probation until July 25, 2012 for [...] "reckless driving on pit road during the race" [...] and for being [...] "involved in an altercation with another competitor after the completion of the race." ...|$|E
