40|$|Most optimal {{survey design}} {{algorithms}} for resistivity imaging have not incorporated {{prior knowledge of}} the resistivity of the subsurface. The resulting surveys are optimal for a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>earth,</b> but little investigation has yet been carried out to test whether they are robust, i. e. that they remain optimal when applied to imaging heterogeneous subsurface resistivity distributions. This paper compares a generic survey, {{which is designed to}} maximise the estimated model resolution evenly across a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>earth,</b> with specific surveys similarly designed for a number of heterogeneous resistivity distributions. In terms of both the average estimated model resolution and the correlations between the inverted and true resistivity models, the generic and heterogeneous survey designs give near-identical results. This suggests that surveys designed using <b>homogeneous</b> <b>earth</b> approximations are robust in the presence of resistivity heterogeneities and are therefore generally applicable. Traditional dipole-dipole surveys with the same number of measurements do not give such good inverted images, and their degree of optimality (measured either by average resolution or image correlation) is less robust in the presence of heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Geometric {{ideas and}} {{techniques}} {{play an important}} role in operator theory and the theory of operator algebras. <b>Smooth</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> Structures in Operator Theory builds the background needed to understand this circle of ideas and reports on recent developments in this fruitful field of research. Requiring only a moderate familiarity with functional analysis and general topology, the author begins with an introduction to infinite dimensional Lie theory with emphasis on the relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebras. A detailed examination of <b>smooth</b> <b>homogeneous</b> spaces follows. This study is illustrated by familiar examples from operator theory and develops methods that allow endowing such spaces with structures of complex manifolds. The final section of the book explores equivariant monotone operators and Kähler structures. It examines certain symmetry properties of abstract reproducing kernels and arrives at a very general version of the construction of restricted Grassmann manifolds from the theory of loop groups. The author provides complete arguments for nearly every result. An extensive list of references and bibliographic notes provide a clear picture of the applicability of geometric methods in functional analysis, and the open questions presented throughout the text highlight interesting new research opportunities.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} lateral heterogeneities in the upper mantle on the calcula-tion of postglacial land uplift. For the model calculations we use a commercial finite-element code, which enables us to solve the equations governing a layered, isotropic, incompressible, Maxwell-viscoelastic half-space with laterally varying layer thicknesses and physical properties. Following previous investigations performed by Sabadini, Yuen & Portney (1986) and Gasperini & Sabadini (1989), we extend their results using a more realistic loading history and different earth models. We then focus our attention on the question whether lateral heterogeneities in the upper mantle can be modelled correctly using a set of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>earth</b> models. To this end, a comparison of model calculations using both laterally <b>homogeneous</b> and heterogeneous <b>earth</b> models is performed. We find that lateral heterogeneities in the upper mantle significantly influence the calculated postglacial land uplift. The resolving power of relative sea-level observations for the prescribed lateral heterogeneities {{used in this study}} is mainly focused on obser-vations around the load margin and outside the glaciated areas, where differences in predicted land uplift between individual models are large enough to be resolved by observations. We can qualitatively determine lateral heterogeneities in the upper mantle using a set of laterally <b>homogeneous</b> <b>earth</b> models, if the geological structure, for example a con-tinental margin, is known. However, in order to infer the correct values of lithospheric thickness and asthenospheric viscosity, we need to use laterally heterogeneous models.
