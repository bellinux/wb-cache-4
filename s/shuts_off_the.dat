5|$|Begun in 1292, the Anglican parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist {{gradually}} evolved until taking its present general form {{during the reign}} of Charles II, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and {{is said to have been}} built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634–1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, a {{different}} model called the opponent process model was proposed. This model explained {{that these two}} processes opposed each other to produce sleep, as against Borbely's model. According to this model, the SCN, which {{is involved in the}} circadian rhythm, enhances wakefulness and opposes the homeostatic rhythm. In opposition is the homeostatic rhythm, regulated via a complex multisynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus that acts like a switch and <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> arousal system. Both effects together produce a see-saw like effect of sleep and wakefulness. More recently, it has been proposed that both models have some validity to them, while new theories hold that inhibition of NREM sleep by REM could also play a role. In any case, the two process mechanism adds flexibility to the simple circadian rhythm and could have evolved as an adaptive measure.|$|E

500|$|Much of [...] "Boom Town" [...] {{was filmed}} on Cardiff Bay, with one scene in {{particular}} {{in front of the}} Millennium Centre, in February 2005. The Doctor is seen reading the Welsh newspaper Western Mail; Davies stated that he wanted to incorporate Welsh culture because the series is made in Wales and contains a lot of Welsh crew members. He also wanted to show off how beautiful the area could be. The night shoot of Rose and Mickey in front of the water tower at Roald Dahl Plass had to be extended to two nights because it was below the temperature at which the fountain automatically <b>shuts</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> dinner scene between the Doctor and Margaret was filmed in January 2005 at the Cardiff restaurant Bistro 10 before the rest of the episode was filmed; Eccleston filmed the scene while Piper and Barrowman were filming scenes for [...] "The Empty Child". [...] This was due to scheduling conflicts with Badland. Some of the schedule was also rearranged because of the death of Piper's uncle, resulting in her and Eccleston being replaced by doubles during some scenes {{near the end of the}} episode. The egg Margaret turns into was a reused prop from the second episode, [...] "The End of the World".|$|E

The {{struggle}} gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest during a struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone; in desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence, stating that [...] "It's the rules", but Adam, who suffered only a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet cover. As Lawrence crawls {{out of the room}} to find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim, following the rules of his own game to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body. As the tape ends, the [...] "corpse" [...] rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which was drained when Adam awoke. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote, briefly electrocuting Adam. John <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights, while Adam screams in terror as John slams the door shut, leaving him to die.|$|E

[...] The pair demand that he open his trunk. [...] Inside are many CDs—the man proclaims his love of music—and a checker board. [...] To pass the time, the mysterious man engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers. [...] They play several rounds. [...] Reyes eventually realizes that the checkers' colors (red & black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and herself (a brunette); The pair realize that the last victim, the numerologist (victim number 7) was a blonde, and that the murderer has been following a pattern of killing a blonde, then a redhead, then a brunette. [...] Thus, a redhead and a brunette are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. [...] Scully and Reyes also realize that, although they assumed that the car that exited the garage was the killer, it was possible that the killer might still be inside the garage with them. [...] Scully and Reyes begin searching, but are surprised by the killer, who <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights, grabs Reyes and eventually gets hold of her gun. [...] However, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), also realizing that the number [...] "6" [...] pattern is actually a [...] "9" [...] and that the killer must intend to have two more victims, arrives {{in the nick of time}} to shoot him.

2500|$|Another game of {{capture the}} flag follows {{in the next}} stage as the {{afternoon}} activity. While playing, Bart must avoid counselors, bullies, killer hornets and traps {{set out for the}} escaped madman Mort. The fourth stage is dinner break and {{is the same as the}} lunch break stage. Later that day, Bart and Lisa decide to escape from Camp Deadly, both because it is too dangerous and because they cannot stand it anymore. However, Ironfist Burns overhears their plans. At night, in the next stage, they escape by climbing to the other side of a mountain called Mount Deadly. The game's final stage takes place in a forest on the other side. Part-way through, Lisa is kidnapped, and Bart later finds her at a power station with Ironfist Burns. Bart defeats him and frees Lisa. Together, they find and flip a switch at the station that <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> power at Camp Deadly and puts an end to their stay there.|$|E

6000|$|The plateau of pitch now widened out, and {{the whole}} ground looked like an asphalt pavement, half {{overgrown}} with marsh-loving weeds, whose roots feed in the sloppy water which overlies the pitch. But, as yet, {{there was no sign}} of the lake. The incline, though gentle, <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> view of what is beyond. This last lip of the lake has surely overflowed, and is overflowing still, though very slowly. [...] Its furrows all curve downward; and it is, in fact, as one of our party said, 'a black glacier.' The pitch, expanding under the burning sun of day, must needs expand most towards the line of least resistance, that is, downhill; and when it contracts again under the coolness of night, it contracts, surely from the same cause, more downhill than it does uphill; and so each particle never returns to the spot whence it started, but rather drags the particles above it downward toward itself. At least, so it seemed to us. Thus may be explained the common mistake which is noticed by Messrs. Wall and Sawkins {148b} in their admirable description of the lake.|$|E
