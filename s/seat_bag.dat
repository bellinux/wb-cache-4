50|$|In bicycling, a {{saddlebag}} or <b>seat</b> <b>bag</b> is a bag attached {{under the}} saddle or seat. Smaller bags are typically {{used to hold}} a few items such as spare inner tubes, puncture repair kit, tools, rain gear, food, first-aid kit, etc. Seat bags are common on touring bicycles, racing bicycles, and cross country mountain bikes.|$|E

For example, in 1969 there were competing designs for lap and 3-point seat belts, rapidly tilting <b>seats,</b> and air <b>bags</b> being developed.
