40|$|AbstractThe {{elevation}} of the cytosolic and nuclear Ca 2 + concentration is a fundamental signal transduction mechanism in almost all eukaryotic cells. Interestingly, three Ca 2 +-mobilising second messengers, d-myo-inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3), cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+) were identified in a phylogenetically wide range of different organisms. Moreover, in an as yet very limited number of cell types, <b>sea</b> urchin eggs, <b>mouse</b> pancreatic acinar cells, and human Jurkat T-lymphocytes, all three Ca 2 +-mobilising ligands {{have been shown to}} be involved in the generation of Ca 2 + signals. This situation raises the question why during evolution all three messengers have been conserved in the same cell type. From a theoretical point of view the following points may be considered: (i) redundant mechanisms ensuring intact Ca 2 + signalling even if one system does not work, (ii) the need for subcellularly localised Ca 2 + elevations to obtain a certain physiological response of the cell, and (iii) tight control of a physiological response of the cell by a temporal sequence of Ca 2 + signalling events. These theoretical considerations are compared to the current knowledge regarding the three messengers in <b>sea</b> urchin eggs, <b>mouse</b> pancreatic acinar cells, and human Jurkat T lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Pax- 6 {{is known}} to be a key {{regulator}} of vertebrate eye development. We have now isolated cDNA for an invertebrate Pax- 6 protein from sea urchin embryos. Transcripts of this gene first appear during development at the gastrula stage and are later expressed at high levels in the tube foot of the adult sea urchin. The sea urchin Pax- 6 protein is highly homologous throughout the whole protein to its vertebrate counterpart with the paired domain and homeodomain being virtually identical. Consequently, we found that the DNA-binding and transactivation properties of the <b>sea</b> urchin and <b>mouse</b> Pax- 6 proteins are very similar, if not identical. A potent activation domain capable of stimulating transcription from proximal promoter and distal enhancer positions was localized within the C-terminal sequences of both the <b>sea</b> urchin and <b>mouse</b> Pax- 6 proteins. The homeodomain of Pax- 6 was shown to cooperatively dimerize on DNA sequences consisting of an inverted repeat of the TAAT motif with a preferred spacing of 3 nucleotides. The consensus recognition sequence of the Pax- 6 paired domain deviates primarily only at one position from that of BSAP (Pax- 5), and yet the two proteins exhibit largely different binding specificities for individual, naturally occurring sites. By creating Pax- 6 -BSAP fusion proteins, we were able to identify a short amino acid stretch in the N-terminal part of the paired domain which is responsible for these differences in DNA-binding specificity. Mutation of three Pax- 6 -specific residues in this region (at positions 42, 44, and 47 of the paired domain) to the corresponding amino acids of BSA...|$|R

In Schistosoma japonicum chronic infection models, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L 1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L 2) expression as well as TLR 2 expression gradually increased in B 6 mice, while only PD-L 2 expression significantly decreased in TLR 2 (-/-) mice. Meanwhile, Programmed Death 1 (PD- 1) expression on CD 4 (+) T cells was down-regulated in TLR 2 (-/-) mice after a large number of egg appeared. We also found that stimulation with schistosome antigens, especially SEA, could up-regulate PD-L 2 expression on BMDCs in a TLR 2 -dependent manner in vitro. Schistosome antigens primed-BMDCs with impaired expression of TLR 2 or PD-L 2 could induce CD 4 (+) T cells to produce low level of IL- 10 or high level of IFN-γ. Our results indicated that TLR 2 signaling can direct PD-L 2 expression on DCs, which binds to PD- 1 mainly on CD 4 (+) T cells, to help inhibit T cells response in Schistosoma japonicum infection...|$|R
