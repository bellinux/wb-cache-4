50|$|Walker {{began to}} learn {{photography}} {{some time in}} the late 1930s, and after World War II he established a commercial photography studio in Los Angeles. Through most of the 1950s he was in high demand for his creative advertising work that featured striking visual images and intense colors. During this time he began creating a series of highly distinctive nudes that used the <b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect</b> to meld form and surface together. He also spent much time studying the traditional collotype printing process, and he was the most prominent of a new breed of photographers who helped revive the popularity of this process.|$|E
5000|$|Dazeley studied {{photography}} at Holland Park Comprehensive (now {{known as}} the Socialist Eton) [...] and started assisting the photographer Peter Sowerby at Essex West Studios off Fleet Street, London in 1963. His work has won awards from organisations across the world, including the Association of Photographers, the Royal Photographic Society in the UK, EPICA in France, Applied Arts Magazine in Canada, Graphis Inc. in the USA [...] Dazeley works with Platinum prints and {{is currently working on}} several projects including X-ray, flowers, pregnant women, anamorphic nude and solarisation (<b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect)</b> photography, out of his own studio complex in Chelsea, London.|$|E
50|$|Titarenko's {{prints are}} {{created in the}} {{darkroom}} by photographer himself, sources called him {{a master of the}} darkroom technic. Selective bleaching and toning (often done by brush) add depth to his palette of grays. Like Man Ray and Maurice Tabard, Titarenko uses solarisation, but unlike his predecessors, he exposes the print to light during the developing process mostly at the edges and in such a subtle way that it only lowers the contrast and creates a very particular kind of gray silver 'veil'. Nonetheless, in order to emphasize the dramatic aspects of the City of Shadows series, he sometimes uses the <b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect</b> called the Mackie line.|$|E
40|$|Conditions for {{producing}} the <b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect</b> in Eastman fine grain release positive 5302 film were established. Modifications {{of the second}} developer to develop more internal latent image {{by the addition of}} potassium iodide or to increase solution ~ physical development by the addition of sodium thiocyanate and sodium sulfite were performed. These modifications made no significant change in the <b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect.</b> When chemical fog (from sodium borohydride) was substituted for the exposure during development, no reversal corresponding to the <b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect</b> was obtained...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Sabattier</b> <b>effect</b> {{has seen}} a {{resurgence}} of interest due to the discovery that Polaroid Type 55 material {{can be used to}} achieve it. In this article the application of a less well known material, Polaroid Type 57 or 667 is demonstrated to be equally or even more suited to the task when coupled with modern digital image management techniques...|$|E
