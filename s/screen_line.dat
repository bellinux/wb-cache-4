This paper makes a first attempt to develop a systematic way for selecting cordon and <b>screen</b> <b>lines</b> for a given study area and road network. Two integer programming models are developed: one is to choose the optimal locations of a given number of survey stations to separate as many origin-destination pairs as possible {{and the other is}} to determine the minimum number of survey stations to separate all origin-destination pairs.

50|$|Often, the {{graphics}} chips used in home computers and video game consoles had limited capabilities. Raster interrupts {{were incorporated into}} these video chips allowing skilled programmers to transcend these limitations. A software-serviced interrupt would be set to trigger when a given <b>screen</b> <b>line</b> was refreshed, and the interrupt routine could then reload the chip's registers. In doing so, {{the graphics}} chip state could be changed at a specific screen position allowing sprites to be repositioned, additional colors inserted, or graphics modes to be changed giving the graphics hardware the appearance of greater capability than it was inherently endowed.|$|E

However, programmers {{in search of a}} graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the <b>screen</b> <b>line</b> by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this [...] "mode" [...] was best suited to displaying static images.|$|E

50|$|The {{machine is}} based around a Z80B CPU clocked at 6 MHz and a 10,000-gate ASIC. The ASIC {{performs}} a similar {{role in the}} computer to the ULA in the ZX Spectrum. The Z80B CPU accesses selected parts of the large memory space in its 64 KB address space by slicing it into 16 KB banks and using I/O ports to select the particular blocks appearing in each 16 KB bank. The basic SAM Coupé model has 256 KB of RAM, upgradable internally to 512 KB and externally with an additional 4 MB (added in 1 MB packs). The computer has a direct connection for a cassette recorder for data storage but two 3.5 inch floppy disk drives can be installed within the case as well. Six channels of 8-octave stereo sound are provided by a Philips SAA1099 sound generator chip. The ASIC also includes a <b>screen</b> <b>line</b> interrupt, allowing video effects to be synchronised to specific display lines with little effort.|$|E

40|$|In the {{commercial}} city of Lagos, Nigeria, traffic congestion poses {{a great challenge}} to commuters, particularly businessmen and workers that need to keep appointments and report in offices timely. A great amount of productive man-hours is therefore wasted in traffic congestion. This coupled with the psychological stress, {{and the loss of}} potential income that commuters experience in traffic jams present a frustrating scenario to those affected. As a result, traffic managers are motivated to understand traffic information through data generated from vehicle counts as a means of guiding road users on how to avoid traffic jams in routes. This is an urban traffic corridors problem, which {{plays an important role in}} urban traffic network analysis. Unfortunately, till date, there is sparse documented information on urban traffic corridors relevant to Lagos, Nigeria.

30|$|Congestion pricing {{is seen as}} an {{effective}} policy to address traffic congestion. In such policies where money, people and authorities are involved, the success generally hinges upon two factors: equity (being fair) and acceptability (to both people and authorities). The primary concern is the equity, for which “tradable credit scheme (TCS)” has been introduced and extensively studied in the literature. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the trading schemes, the TCS has yet to find any foot in the real world. To this end, a novel idea of rewarding has substituted the trading component to be known as toll-and-subsidy scheme (TSS). The idea is to charge the drivers on some roads (toll) while rewarding them to use other alternative—and perhaps underutilized—roads (subsidy). The research of the TSS is in its infancy stage. The problem to be tackled in this study is as follows: Given a set of roads constituting a cordon line around the central business district (CBD) or across a <b>screen</b> <b>line,</b> how much toll or subsidy should be assigned to each road? The problem is first transformed into a capacitated traffic assignment problem. We employ a solution method based on augmenting the travel time of roads up to the level at which the traffic volumes do not exceed some target rates. A real dataset from the city of Winnipeg, Canada, is used as a pilot study. We then discuss policy-related applications of the TSS. It is proved in the literature that one can obtain optimal TSSs for various objectives and considerations. To this end, the non-negativity of the toll values is relaxed which results in a valid toll set. Nevertheless, the computational time is found to be of highest significance. Our method differs {{in the fact that the}} traffic volumes are bounded from the above and it is quite affordable. The main contribution is first to highlight the concept of subsidy along with traditional thought of merely toll. Second is to interpret the Lagrangian values of the capacity constraints as the values of the toll/subsidy.|$|E
40|$|Theme EThe {{problems}} of scheduling and schedule co-ordination in bus operations have conflicting objectives related to user’s cost and operator’s cost. Passengers {{would like to}} have public bus services where there is less waiting time. Operators on the other hand would like to earn profit with lesser vehicle operating cost and a minimum number of buses. In developing countries where overloading of buses has long been considered necessary to ensure bus travel remains affordable to most socioeconomic groups, bus operators would in addition to larger headways, like to have higher load factors to increase revenue even though passengers would prefer less load factors as it provides a more comfortable journey. All these factors are further constrained by the fare levels, which may not make the revenue adequate to operate at the most economically optimal frequency and load factor. This paper considers a method that is an extension to Newell’s Optimal Dispatching Policy, to determine a fleet size and dispatching rate based on both operator’s cost and user’s cost including the disutility of standing, in order to arrive at a global cost optimum. It further investigates the financial viability of providing such a service and sets out a financial viability domain within which optimization can occur in practice. If the resulting dispatching rate is lower and does not fall within the domain of financial viability, then operating subsidies are considered necessary to maintain the economically optimum dispatching rate. This method to compute optimized dispatching rates is based on screen-line counts across given locations along a bus routes used in conjunction with a limited sample of on-board boarding and alighting surveys. Passenger revenues have been computed by a process of multiplication of the rationalized origin-destination matrix by the fare for distance travelled between the respective origins and destinations. Indicators have also been developed to determine average trip lengths for each route and average revenue per passenger together with the points of maximum capacity along the route. These indicators describe the nature of the demand that the bus route serves. The <b>screen</b> <b>line</b> counts provide the hourly variation in demand over a bus route throughout the day, which has been expressed in terms of a polynomial equation to determine the variation of demand over different time periods. By combining both functions, a composite function has been developed to determine; the daily passenger demand on a given route; the total revenue for operators, the average load factor and locations on the route where maximum loading occurs.
