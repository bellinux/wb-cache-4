2500|$|A Parliamentary session concludes {{in one of}} two ways. First, the President, on Cabinet's advice, may [...] Parliament by {{proclamation}} in the Government Gazette. Prorogation has {{the effect}} of suspending the sitting of Parliament, but MPs retain their seats and it is not necessary for an election to be held. Uncompleted Parliamentary business is not affected by a prorogation, and is carried over from one session to the next. For instance, Standing Order 88(1) of the Standing Orders of Parliament states: [...] "A Bill before Parliament <b>shall</b> not <b>lapse</b> upon the prorogation of Parliament and all business and proceedings connected therewith shall be carried over to the next session of the same Parliament and continue from the stage that it had reached in the preceding session." [...] The period between sessions is called a recess.|$|R
2500|$|By 12 March he had {{established}} that, should the Home Rule Bill be passed under the Parliament Act 1911, the Army Annual Act should be amended in the Lords to stipulate that the Army could not [...] "be used in Ulster {{to prevent or}} interfere with any step which may thereafter be taken in Ulster to organise resistance to {{the enforcement of the}} Home Rule Act in Ulster nor to suppress any such resistance until and unless the present Parliament has been dissolved and a period of three months <b>shall</b> have <b>lapsed</b> after the meeting of a new Parliament". The Shadow Cabinet consulted legal experts, who agreed wholeheartedly with Law's suggestion. Although several members expressed dissent, the Shadow Cabinet decided [...] "provisionally to agree to amendment of army act. but to leave details and decisions as to the moment of acting to Lansdowne and Law". In the end no amendment to the Army Act was offered, though; many backbenchers and party loyalists became agitated by the scheme and wrote to him that it was unacceptable – Ian Malcolm, a fanatical Ulster supporter, told Law that amending the Army Act would drive him out of the Party.|$|R
60|$|If, by any {{possible}} mismanagement of {{that part of}} the revenue which is left at discretion, or by any other mode of prodigality, cash should be deficient for the payment of the lowest classes, I propose that the amount of those salaries where the deficiency may happen to fall shall not be carried as debt to the account of the succeeding year, but that it <b>shall</b> be entirely <b>lapsed,</b> sunk, and lost; so that government will be enabled to start in the race of every new year wholly unloaded, fresh in wind and in vigor. Hereafter no civil list debt can ever come upon the public.

60|$|For {{if there}} be no such actual thing as individuality, if the feeling we call by that name be naught but the {{transient}} illusion the Buddhists {{would have us believe}} it, any faith founded upon it as basis vanishes as does the picture in a revolving kaleidoscope,--less enduring even than the flitting phantasmagoria of a dream. If the ego be but the passing shadow of the material brain, at the disintegration of the gray matter what will become of us? <b>Shall</b> we simply <b>lapse</b> into an indistinguishable part of the vast universe that compasses us round? At the thought we seem to stand straining our gaze, on the shore of the great sea of knowledge, only to watch the fog roll in, and hide from our view even those headlands of hope that, like beseeching hands, stretch out into the deep.|$|R

Each and all of the provisions made in this will for my wife are in lieu of any and all rights or claims and estates she may have in our community property, if any there be (I consider that practically all of my estate is my sole and separate property), or in my separate estate by reason of any right of dower or other interest. Should she elect to claim or receive any part of our community property, or any part of my estate (exclusive, however, of a family allowance during probate of this my will) otherwise than under and pursuant to the terms of this will, she shall receive no benefits or real or personal property hereunder; and each and all of the provisions herein made for her <b>shall</b> thereupon <b>lapse</b> and become null and void, and the property or interest which she might otherwise have been entitled to receive under this will, shall go to the other beneficiaries hereunder as above provided, to the exclusion of my wife. I thus require her to take an election because it is my firm belief that she will be better provided for if she elects to receive the provisions of this will. I nominate and appoint the Title Insurance & Trust Company, of Los Angeles, California, a California corporation, to be the executor hereunder, and I request that it as executor and my trustees, or any administrator or trustee acting hereunder, shall be exempt from giving surety or sureties upon their bond as such. I hereby authorize my said executor and the trustees hereunder, to sell and convey any or all of my estate, real or personal, without license of court, free and discharged of all trusts, and without any liability upon the part of the purchaser to see to the application of the purchase money.
