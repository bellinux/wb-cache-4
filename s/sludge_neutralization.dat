40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{municipal}} sewage sludge (MSS) elementary analysis and energetic potential based on measurement of {{heat of combustion}} (higher heating value HHV) and calculation of calorific values (lower heating value LHV). The analysis takes into the consideration water content in sewage sludge, at different utilization stages, in wastewater treatment plants in Gdańsk Wschód and Kościerzyna – Pomeranian Voivodeship. The study yielded the following results (in % dry matter) : ash 19 ÷ 31 %, C - 31 ÷ 36 %, H - 5 ÷ 6 %, N - 4 ÷ 6 %, O - 28 ÷ 32 %, S – 1 %. Calorific value of stabilized sludges in Gdańsk was on average 13. 8 ÷ 15 MJ/kg. In case of sludges not undergoing digestion from Kościerzyna WWTP, the calorific value was {{at the level of}} 17. 5 MJ/kg. Thus, sewage sludges are good energy carriers. High water content though is the problem, as it lowers the useful effect of heat.

40|$|Sludge {{dewatering}} {{is important}} in sludge management and disposal. In practice, chemical conditioners are often introduced to aid sludge dewatering. This study investigated the simultaneous application of chitosan and metal cations as dual-conditioners to improve sludge dewaterability. The dewatering performance of sludge was evaluated using three common measurements, i. e. capillary suction time, specific resistance to filtration, and moisture content of the filtered sludge cake. The effectiveness of metal cations in sludge conditioning and dewatering was found, in ascending order, to be Na+ < K+ ≈ Mg 2 + < Ca 2 + < Al 3 + < Fe 3 +. Dual-conditioning using chitosan and metal cations further enhanced dewaterability.

40|$|Increasing {{wastewater}} {{produced in}} large cities due to {{the rapid growth of}} population and industries is forcing local wastewater treatment plants to process more wastewater than before with existing equipment such as digesters. Increasing throughput without increasing digester capacity could result in poor mixing of sludge in digesters and lead to digester failure. Therefore more studies are required to understand the mixing phenomenon inside digesters especially when thickened sludge is processed. This paper reports an experimental study on the mixing of digested sludge in an unbaffled cylindrical vessel agitated by a 6 -bladed 45 ° pitched turbine pumping in both downward and upward directions. A transparent model liquid (xanthan gum Keltrol T) was used as it exhibits rheological properties similar to those of digested <b>sludge.</b> An acid-base <b>neutralization</b> reaction was used in the flow visualization of the mixing process. The effect of specific impeller power input (P/V) on the mixing pattern and unmixed volume was investigated using 0. 15 and 0. 4 wt% (low and high viscous) solutions. Both downward and upward pumping impellers produced a cylinder-shaped cavern (well-mixed region) with ringshaped unmixed regions inside in the low viscous solution. With an increase in mixing time, the rings were found to disappear and the cavern size increased. In the case of the high viscous solution, both downward and upward pumping impellers produced just a cavern. The cavern increased in size with an increase in mixing time but never disappeared regardless of (P/V) used...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rather}} high uranium {{concentration}} of about 10 to 60 mg/l (maximum of 250 mg/l in 2002) in the acidic flood {{water from the}} former in-situ leach mine Königstein, a first treatment stage for uranium removal and processing has been implemented, followed by the further water treatment in a HDS (high density <b>sludge)</b> plant for <b>neutralization</b> and removal of various metals (Fe, Al, Zn, etc.), sulphate and naturally occurring radio-nuclides. In the late nineties, the former uranium plant was converted to a state-of-the-art processing unit meeting the specific requirements with regard to controlled flooding and recycling criteria for uranium. Uranium processing includes ion exchange for uranium removal from the flood water, multi-stage elution, precipitation of uranium oxide (UOX), and UOX washing and de-watering for removal of dissolved impurities. HDS treatment efficiency and sludge de-watering properties were considerably improved by applying a staged neutralization technology to limit super-saturation of mineral phases {{as well as the}} formation of amorphous solids and to increase the precipitation rate of crystalline phases in significantly larger particles. Adsorption on Fe phases is important to remove various metals and radio-nuclides efficiently. Centrifuges are used for sludge de-watering to levels 48 M % solids (average), thus, enabling disposal of the de-watered sludge to a dump at the site directly.

Soil samples were collected before installation of experiment for chemical and heavy metal analysis. To the 20, 40, 60 and 80 days after the planting were appraised the parameters of the culture development in the field: stature and diameter of plants and number of leaves. After harvesting the production components were evaluated: length and diameter of spikes, number of useful plants and mass of grains. The soil samples were collected for evaluation of the heavy metals: copper and zinc and chemical analysis. The results were appraised for the software SISVAR. LNK version 13. 0 and Minitab being accomplished with Tukey test for comparison of averages with 5 % level significance. It was observed that the addition of Copper and Zinc through biossolid contributed with small increment in the tenors of x these in the soil in function of the concentration of the elements in the residue as well as the low amounts applied, and for the parameters of the culture development, the best answers were obtained in the treatments that used the sludge, when compared with the control and fertilizer mineral. For the length and diameter of spikes and mass of grains the largest averages were obtained in the 15 Mg. ha- 1 of sludge treatment.

40|$|La présence de {{concentrations}} élevées en métaux lourds retrouvés dans les boues de stations d'épuration est un facteur important limitant ainsi leurs différents modes de dispositions (rejet en mer, enfouissement, incinération, ou même recyclage comme fertilisant agricole ou forestier) par crainte de dégâts considérables qui pourraient être causés à l'environnement. L'objectif de ce travail consistait à mettre au point un procédé qui permettrait conjointement la stabilisation des boues municipales et l'enlèvement des métaux lourds qui y sont associés. L'approche poursuivie dans cette étude était de vérifier si ce procédé microbien, conçu pour enlever les métaux lourds associés aux boues municipales, pourrait éventuellement remplacer les procédés conventionnels de stabilisation des boues municipales, ce qui réduirait considérablement les temps et coûts de traitement. Ce procédé microbien consiste à utiliser des souches de thiobacilles qui oxydent le soufre élémentaire, produisant ainsi de l'acide sulfurique, et par la même occasion une forte baisse de pH (1. 5). Les résultats obtenus en cultures discontinues, en bioréacteurs, avec des boues primaires provenant de la station d'épuration de la Communauté Urbaine de Québec (C. U. Q. - Est) montrent que cette chute de pH entraîne une solubilisation importante des métaux (Cr: 56 %, Cu: 97 %, Fe: 30 à 40 %, Pb: 69 %, Zn: 98 %), du phosphore (52 %), ainsi qu'une réduction appréciable des matières volatiles en suspension (40 à 50 %), et ce, après seulement 7 jours de traitement. Le soufre nécessaire à la biolixiviation- stabilisation est introduit, dans le cas de notre étude, sous forme de granules ou de blocs. Ce choix de la forme de soufre influe beaucoup sur la qualité de la boue produite, ainsi que sur son pouvoir acidophile après neutralisation. Le soufre en blocs s'avère plus efficace et aussi préférable au soufre en granules quant au pouvoir acidophile, après neutralisation, de la boue produite. Given {{the potential}} geochemical mobility and recognizd toxicity of heavy metals, their presence at high concentrations in sewage sludges imposes serious limitations on various sludge disposal practices (ocean disposal, landfill, incineration, or {{use as a}} fertilizer in agriculture or forestry), The objectve of this work {{was to develop a}} process that would permit the simultaneous stabilization of sewage sludges and the removal of heavy metals associated with them. The approach followed was to verify if this microbial leaching procedure could eventually replace conventional sludge stabilization processes and hence considerably reduce the time and cost of treatment. The microbial process consists of using thiobacillus strains which, in the presence of air, oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid, thus reducing the pH to very acidic levels (pH 1. 5). This biological oxidation of elemental sulfur is brought about by two groups of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, the less-acidophilic and the acidophilic thiobacilli. The initial acid production and pH reduction is due to the less-acidophilic bactena (Thiobacillus thioparus) which lower the pH to about 4. 0. This is followed by the growth of acidophilic bacteria (Thiobacillus thiooxidans) and fruther pH reduction. Batch culture experiments were carried out in 30 L and 8 L reactors with primary sludges obtained from the Quebec urban community's wastewater treatment centre. Elemental sulfur and inoculum were added {{at the beginning of each}} experiment The inoculum was prepared by adding 1 % tyndalized sulfur powder to fresh secondary sludge and incubating for 8 days (final pH 1. 5 to 2. 0). A small portion (5 %) of this acidified sludge was then used as an inoculum for another batch of fresh sludge and this process was repeated several times until an acclimatized inoculum was obtained which could oxidize elemental sulfur rapidly, without an appreciable lag phase. The elemental sulfur necessary as substrate for the simultaneous bioleaching and sludge stabilization was introduced in the form of granules (2. 4 to 4 mm diameter) or blocks (25 mm diameter). Sludge pH and ORP were measured at 24 hour intervals and all other measurements were carried out at 48 hour intervals. The results demonstrate that the addition of elemental sulfur and inoculum resulted in a considerable lowering of the sludge pH during the incubation period. Such pH lowering was not observed in cultures to which sulfur and inoculum were not added. This lowering of pH (2. 1) was related to the quantity of substrate (sulfur) and inoculum present in the medium. An increase in the medium ORP (from - 50 to about 500 mV) was also observed. Acidification of the medium along with the elevated ORP levels resulted in the solubilization of metals initially present in the sludge. This pH reduction, after only 7 days of treatment, effected an important metal solubilization (Cr: 56 %, Cu: 97 %, Be: 30 - 40 %, Pb: 69 %, Zn: 98 %), as well as an appreciable reduction in phosphorus (52 %) and in the volatile suspended solids concentration (40 - 50 %). In addition, the sludge which initially had a highly repulsive odour was rendered odourless. In a previous study we had showm that for an optimum rate of acidification of the sludge a minimum concentration of elemental sulfur (2 g/L) was necessary, even though only 40 % of this sulfur was oxidized. In the present experiment the physical form of the sulfur was shown to influence both the quality of sludge produced and its acid-generating capacity after neutralization. Sulfur in the form of blocks was more efficient than granules in that the elemental sulfur could be readily separated from the sludge at the end of the treatment, yielding a <b>sludge</b> after <b>neutralization</b> that had a low acid-generating capacity. In the case of granules, the unused sulfur was broken down into a fine powder during the course of the bioleaching experiment and could not be separated from the leached sludge - even after <b>neutralization,</b> the leached <b>sludge</b> exhibited a high acid-generating capacity, which would limit its use as a fertilizer on agricultural land...|$|R
40|$|The {{initial phase}} of bulk waste removal {{operations}} was recently completed in Tank 5 F. Video {{inspection of the}} tank indicates several mounds of sludge still remain in the tank. Additionally, a mound of white solids was observed under Riser 5. In support of chemical cleaning and heel removal programs, samples of the sludge and the mound of white solids {{were obtained from the}} tank for characterization and testing. A core sample of the sludge and Super Snapper sample of the white solids were characterized. A supernate dip sample from Tank 7 F was also characterized. A portion of the sludge was used in two tank cleaning tests using oxalic acid at 50 C and 75 C. The filtered oxalic acid from the tank cleaning tests was subsequently neutralized by addition to a simulated Tank 7 F supernate. Solids and liquid samples from the tank cleaning test and neutralization test were characterized. A separate report documents the results of the gas generation from the tank cleaning test using oxalic acid and Tank 5 F sludge. The characterization results for the Tank 5 F sludge sample (FTF- 05 - 06 - 55) appear quite good with respect to the tight precision of the sample replicates, good results for the glass standards, and minimal contamination found in the blanks and glass standards. The aqua regia and sodium peroxide fusion data also show good agreement between the two dissolution methods. Iron dominates the sludge composition with other major contributors being uranium, manganese, nickel, sodium, aluminum, and silicon. The low sodium value for the sludge reflects the absence of supernate present in the sample due to the core sampler employed for obtaining the sample. The XRD and CSEM results for the Super Snapper salt sample (i. e., white solids) from Tank 5 F (FTF- 05 - 07 - 1) indicate the material contains hydrated sodium carbonate and bicarbonate salts along with some aluminum hydroxide. These compounds likely precipitated from the supernate in the tank. A solubility test showed the material to be water-soluble consistent with the determined composition. The analytical data for the solid residues filtered from the oxalic acid solution and filtered oxalic acid indicate {{a large portion of the}} Tank 5 F sludge used in the tank cleaning test dissolved into the oxalic acid. The results of a material balance calculation indicate a high percentage of the iron, uranium, sodium, and aluminum dissolved during both tests. Approximately half of the manganese, a small portion of the plutonium, and essentially none of the nickel dissolved during the tank cleaning tests. Additionally, the results show slightly higher dissolution of the sludge in the 75 C test compared to the 50 C test however, the amount of sludge dissolution gained by using the higher temperature remains small. Some uncertainty remains with respect to the amount of plutonium dissolved in the tank cleaning test. The neutralization of the filtered oxalic acid solutions from the cleaning test produced a large volume of solids ({approx} 2 X the original sludge mass after filtration and air drying). A large portion of the increase in solids could be attributed to the formation of sodium oxalate. The data from analysis of the solid residues filtered from the neutralization tests and the filtrate obtained indicate most of the iron, uranium, manganese, and a large portion of the aluminum precipitated during the neutralization tests. The data for the 50 C test and the 75 C test show good agreement with the exception of the amount of aluminum precipitated from the neutralization. The slower addition rate of the oxalic acid filtrate to the simulated Tank 7 F supernate in the 75 C test might account for the smaller amount of aluminum precipitated and differences in the particle size/morphology and composition of the particulates. Some evidence of uranium separation from other sludge elements appears in the 75 C data. Data collected from the tank cleaning and neutralization tests indicates most of the uranium dissolved during the cleaning test with oxalic acid along with the iron, aluminum, and sodium in the <b>sludge.</b> During the <b>neutralization</b> of the oxalic acid, the majority of the uranium precipitates from solution along with the iron and other typical sludge elements. The CSEM results of the 75 C neutralization test provide some evidence of uranium separation from other sludge elements. However, the CSEM analysis looked at a very small amount of sample, which might not be representative of the bulk material and the sludge sample also showed areas of high uranium concentration. Additionally, how the test results will scale to the full-scale neutralization in a waste tank remains uncertain. The analysis of the oxalic acid filtrates indicates that only a small portion of the plutonium dissolved during the tank cleaning test. However, the analytical data from the solid residues filtered from the cleaning test contradict the solution data and indicate approximately half of the plutonium dissolved...|$|R
