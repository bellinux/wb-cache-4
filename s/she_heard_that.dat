Before WCW's collapse, she engaged in a brief feud with Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas, who defeated her and partner Billy Kidman at Fall Brawl in a Mixed Tag Team Scaffold match. Madusa took a big bump during this match and wasn't seen again on WCW TV. She left the company when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} World Wrestling Federation, was going to buy WCW. Because she had a previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company. She retired from professional wrestling for good in 2001 because she did not like the direction in which women's wrestling was going; according to her, it was becoming less about real wrestling and more about Bra and Panties matches.|$|E

Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

500|$|After Thorpe's {{funeral was}} held at St. Benedict's Catholic Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma, his body was lying in state at Fairview Cemetery after {{citizens}} had paid to have it moved to Shawnee by train from California. The people were in a fund-raising effort to erect a permanent monument and burial place for Thorpe at the town's Athletic Park. Local officials had asked the state legislature for funding but were turned down, so they doubled their efforts {{to raise the money}} on their own. Meanwhile, Thorpe's third wife, unbeknownst to the rest of his family, [...] "stole" [...] Thorpe's body and had it shipped to Pennsylvania when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the small Pennsylvania towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were seeking to attract business. She made a deal with officials which, according to Thorpe's son Jack, was done by Patricia for monetary considerations.

Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's {{going to be on}} my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when I got this, people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend to hand it to another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists.|$|E
500|$|Ferrier {{spent two}} months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought {{to her at the}} {{hospital}} by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would {{no longer be able to}} negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if {{he really wanted to}} be with her or if it was just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E

2500|$|Following the 1953 {{death of}} renowned athlete and Olympic medal winner Jim Thorpe, Thorpe's widow and third wife, Patricia, was angry when the {{government}} of Oklahoma would not erect a memorial to honor him. When <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were desperately seeking to attract business, she {{made a deal with}} civic officials. According to Jim Thorpe's son, Jack, Patricia was motivated by money in seeking the deal.

2500|$|For {{the next}} twenty-two years she {{remained}} {{in the custody of}} the Danish state, incarcerated without charge or trial in Copenhagen Castle's infamous Blue Tower (Danish, Blåtårn). She lived under meagre and humiliating conditions for the daughter of a king, and was for years deprived of almost all comforts. During these years she perforce showed great stoicism and ingenuity. She wrote that her cell was small, filthy, foul, infested with fleas, and that the rats were so numerous and hungry that they ate her night candle as it burned. She learned to piece together pages for writing from the wrappers on the sugar that she was given, and to make ink for her fowl's quill by capturing the candle's smoke on a spoon. Slowly she adjusted to her plight, ceased longing for revenge or death, and developed a mordant humor. She studied the vermin who were her only companions, recording her observations and conjectures about their instincts. When <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> her husband had died abroad, she marvelled that she felt only relief that he had finally eluded his persecutors.|$|E

To record the song, she flew to Los Angeles for roughly a week. Despite growing increasingly exhausted during the recording sessions, when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> a 90-piece orchestra would be arriving to record the instrumental she begged to stay and witness the event.
