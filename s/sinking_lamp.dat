50|$|The pair {{proceeds}} to the Bermuda Triangle, where the Genie prepares to <b>sink</b> the <b>lamp</b> {{into the depths}} of the sea to prevent his powers from being abused. Al, however, unwilling to let his friend go, asks for one final wish, which is fulfilled. With the reward money from Siracusa's capture, the Haddins buy the nightclub and celebrate its reopening, with the Genie staying with them as a normal human being.|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{populations of}} fungus beetles may first show up trapped in bathtubs, <b>sinks</b> or around <b>lamps</b> and TV sets. They do not bite, sting, spread human {{diseases}} nor damage wood, food, fabric, etc. {{they are just}} annoying little bugs that will non go away.|$|R
60|$|I {{waited and}} waited, expecting every instant {{to hear the}} command {{to turn up the}} light; but none came. I waited still, and looked with {{harrowing}} intensity at the rolling billows of smoke still pouring out of the glowing casket, whilst the <b>lamps</b> <b>sank</b> down and went out one by one.|$|R
60|$|It {{raced to}} meet the ship, and, with a pause, as of girding the loins, the Nan-Shan lifted her bows and leaped. The flames in all the <b>lamps</b> <b>sank,</b> darkening the engine-room. One went out. With a tearing crash and a swirling, raving tumult, tons of water fell upon the deck, as though the ship had darted under {{the foot of a}} cataract.|$|R
60|$|The night advanced--the noises faintly {{reaching}} me {{from the}} streets, <b>sank</b> and ceased--my <b>lamp</b> flickered and went out--I heard the carriage return with Clara from the ball--the first cold clouds of day rose and hid the waning orb of the moon--the air was cooled with its morning freshness: the earth was purified with its morning dew--and still I sat by my open window, striving with my burning love-thoughts of Margaret; striving to think collectedly and usefully--abandoned to a struggle ever renewing, yet never changing; and always hour after hour, a struggle in vain.|$|R
40|$|Light-emitting diode (LED) is {{a modern}} {{lighting}} device. If the heat dissipating mechanism of LED desk lamp is not well designed, the induced high temperature will cause the reduction of illumination and life time of lamp. Therefore, the heat sink design becomes a key technology for LED lighting device. This study developed a methodology to design and analyze a heat sink for LED cooling. Four different types of heat sinks with fins in longitudinal or transverse directions and with or without vents on the base plate were compared. By using the CFD software FLUENT, heat flux and temperature around the heat sink were analyzed, and the surface temperature distribution was also investigated. The simulation outcomes were compared with experiments results to verify analysis accuracy. The comparisons show only slight differences, and the deviations were less than 4. 0 %. For cooling LED desk lamp, the design of using 12 vents {{on both sides of}} heat sink through natural convection to create the chimney effect was adopted; consequently, the temperature dropped 5 °C in average. This design can also reduce the material of heat <b>sink,</b> LED <b>lamp</b> weight, and production cost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using {{heat sink}} to {{increase}} the cooling area is the most familiar and fundamental method in LED heat management technology. We develop a new configuration of finned heat <b>sink</b> for LED <b>lamp.</b> It is a circular cylinder with many plate fins radially arranged on the external surface. There are many straight ducts inside the peripheral wall of the cylinder. These ducts form the chimney ef-fect to enhance the heat transfer. This work experimentally investigated the chimney effect on the heat transfer characteristics of the finned heat sink under the free convection state. The aluminum-alloy plate spreader with two vertical plate fins {{was selected as the}} control group. The experimental group was the heat sink having the same configuration of the control group but had a vertical pas-sage within the spreader. The results show that the vertical passage did strengthen 8. 3 ~ 12. 1 % free convection performance for the present test heat sink...|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, John {{turned the}} car round and {{drove back to}} the bend. The road was narrow, but there was room for two {{vehicles}} to pass, provided that both kept well to the proper side. John, however, took the middle and did not swerve much when a dazzling beam swept round the curve. He blew his horn; there was an answering shriek from an electric hooter, and then a savage shout. John, who was near the left side now, but not so close as he ought to have been, freed the clutch and used the brake, and the other car, missing him by an inch or two, plunged into the wet grass across the road. As he stopped he saw the boggy soil fly up and the <b>lamps</b> <b>sink</b> towards the ground. Jumping off, he found the car had brought {{up in front of a}} wall, with the front wheels buried to the axle. The driver and a very angry man in a soft hat were getting out.|$|R
30|$|These newly {{proposed}} FOMs help {{to analyze}} as many complex aspects together as possible. But some points are not taken into account. Optical consideration includes only the luminous flux, not light quality parameters like CCT and CRI. Bulb-G {{has the highest}} CCT, {{despite the fact that}} it has satisfying results for manufacturer’s and consumer’s other primary concerns. Bulb-B with very high efficacy and low combined resistances has very good results; although it has the highest thermal resistance, which normally compromises reliability and life time. However, bulb-B is supposed to have a very long lifetime according to the information provided by manufacturer. It can be explained with the high quality of driver electronics and LEDs. Intricate surface of heat sink is not desired from vendor in common but it does not directly mean that this will bring unacceptable time increase or price jump for the production. It is also possible to make this advantageous, when the lighting manufacturers have access for the development of the production technology. While these FOMs provide a tool to compare various design options, manufacturing and cost of the thermal solution should be considered together. FOMs provide a good general view from many aspects. Some or all of them can be case-based used for a detailed analysis and comparison. It should be remarked that the evaluation method is not only based on cooling approaches or heat <b>sink</b> performances of <b>lamps.</b> In this study total system performances are presented, which is also affected by LED packages, driver electronics, optical components, other thermal components and different operating conditions. For a plain performance evaluation of various design approaches of heat sinks, thermal and optical analysis of lamps can be computationally performed based on CAD models under same boundary conditions that may affect above mentioned factors in future studies.|$|R
