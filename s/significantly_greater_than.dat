5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> one {{have been}} observed, {{so there are}} no confirmed observations of comets that are likely to have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the range was 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum range was 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E
5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} remanufacturing process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit used was derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E

5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of 2 new teams, a new ten-team format was created. This new format consists of 74 matches and was introduced as retaining the previous format would result in 94 matches, <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> the 60 matches from the previous season, where teams compete in a double round-robin tournament. The knockout stage was changed to a playoff format. If a match ends in a tie, a Super Over will be played to determine the winner.|$|E

25|$|The adoptee {{population}} does, however, {{seem to be}} more at {{risk for}} certain behavioral issues. Researchers from the University of Minnesota studied adolescents who had been adopted and found that adoptees were twice as likely as non-adopted people to suffer from oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (with an 8% rate in the general population). Suicide risks were also <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> the general population. Swedish researchers found both international and domestic adoptees undertook suicide at much higher rates than non-adopted peers; with international adoptees and female international adoptees, in particular, at highest risk.|$|E

Therefore, the equitable chromatic threshold of this graph is 2n+2, <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> its equitable chromatic number of two.|$|E
25|$|Asian golden {{cats are}} poached mainly for their fur. In Myanmar, 111 body parts {{from at least}} 110 {{individuals}} were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006.

Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with China and Thailand and cater to international buyers, although the Asian golden cat is completely protected under Myanmar's national legislation. Effective implementation and enforcement of CITES is considered inadequate.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} the {{diameter}} of a trapped particle is <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> the wavelength of light, the trapping phenomenon can be explained using ray optics. As shown in the figure, individual rays of light emitted from the laser will be refracted as it enters and exits the dielectric bead. As a result, the ray will exit in a direction different from which it originated. Since light has a momentum associated with it, this change in direction indicates that its momentum has changed. Due to Newton's third law, {{there should be an}} equal and opposite momentum change on the particle.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy of}} Ireland {{is a modern}} {{knowledge}} economy, focusing on services and high-tech industries and dependent on trade, industry and investment. In terms of GDP per capita, Ireland is ranked {{as one of the}} wealthiest countries in the OECD and the EU-27 at 5th in the OECD-28 rankings as of 2008. In terms of GNP per capita, a better measure of national income, Ireland ranks only slightly above the OECD average, despite significant growth in recent years, at 10th in the OECD-28 rankings. GDP (national output) is <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> GNP (national income) due to the repatriation of profits and royalty payments by multinational firms based in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|An area of {{the east}} face of 67,400 m² was laser-scanned, {{creating}} 22 overlapping computer images, with measurements accurate to between 3 and 5cm. Careful computer analysis revealed that in the twelve-month period between scans, the measured area had lost 536 m³ of rock. This is comparable to an erosion rate across the entire measured {{area of the}} face of 8.4mm per year – a figure <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> those found in rock walls of high-altitude permafrost in Switzerland and Greenland. The project concluded that the higher rock fall rate exhibited on the Tour Ronde {{and elsewhere in the}} Mont Blanc massif was linked to the degradation in permafrost which would have held the mountain together more effectively, but which now exposed it to greater weathering through the freeze-thaw cycle of water, with maximum occurrence during warm summers.|$|E

25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
