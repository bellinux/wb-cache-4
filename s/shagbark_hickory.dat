5|$|<b>Shagbark</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya ovata) {{has over}} 130 named cultivars. They are a {{valuable}} {{source of food}} for wildlife, and were eaten by indigenous peoples of the Americas and settlers alike.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{tree species}} have been {{observed}} near Lake Chillisquaque. These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> black tupelo, American basswood, eastern hop-hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory's</b> nut is edible {{and has a}} {{very sweet}} taste.|$|R
50|$|Shellbark hickory grows best on deep, fertile, moist soils, most {{typical of}} the order Alfisols. It does not thrive in heavy clay soils, but grows well on heavy loams or silt loams. Shellbark hickory {{requires}} moister situations than do pignut, mockernut, or <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickories</b> (Carya glabra, C. alba, or C. ovata), although it is sometimes found on dry, sandy soils. Specific nutrient requirements are not known, but generally the hickories grow best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils.|$|R
50|$|The {{nuts are}} edible with an {{excellent}} flavor, {{and are a}} popular food among people and squirrels alike. They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long {{time it takes for}} a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. <b>Shagbark</b> <b>hickories</b> can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts {{can be used as a}} substitute for the pecan in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.|$|R
25|$|In {{southern}} Michigan {{and northern}} Indiana, which are {{mainly in the}} oak-hickory and elm-ash-cottonwood cover types, trees utilized as roosts include green, white, and black ash (Fraxinus nigra), silver maple, <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> and American elm. And finally, in the southern areas of the Indiana bat's range (primarily Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Alabama), which include the oak-hickory and oak-pine cover types, Indiana bats utilize <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> white oak, red oak, pitch pine (P. rigida), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), loblolly pine (P. taeda), sweet birch (Betula lenta), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis).|$|E

In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville's forest cover was 28.9%.|$|E
25|$|The house {{sits on a}} half-acre (2,000 m²) lot, {{the remnant}} of the much larger {{original}} farm, at a bend in First Street. Willsey Brook bounds it on the south, and the canal bed, now dry and overgrown, {{is located in the}} woods a few hundred feet (approximately 100 m) to the east. The house itself is surrounded by tall trees, including a 175-year-old <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory</b> tree to the southeast that has helped to date the house's construction.|$|E
50|$|The nuts of {{some species}} are palatable, {{while others are}} bitter and only {{suitable}} for animal feed. <b>Shagbark</b> and shellbark <b>hickory,</b> along with pecan, are regarded by some as the finest nut trees.|$|R
5000|$|American chinquapin is {{also highly}} {{susceptible}} to chestnut blight. The European chestnut and the West Asian species are also susceptible, but less {{so than the}} American species. Surviving chestnut trees are being bred for resistance to the blight, notably by the American Chestnut Foundation, which aims to reintroduce a blight-resistant American chestnut to its original forest range within {{the early decades of}} the 21st century. The resistant species—particularly Japanese chestnut and Chinese chestnut, as well as Seguin's chestnut and Henry's chestnut—have been used in these breeding programs in the US to create disease-resistant hybrids with the American chestnut. [...] It's important to realize, though, that even Chinese chestnut trees vary considerably in blight resistance. Some individuals are quite susceptible while others are essentially immune to the disease. Many kinds of environmental stress may break down a tree's resistance to blight. Indeed, at higher elevations in areas exposed to severe climate, normally resistant, Oriental chestnuts have been killed by blight. The fungus will also infect other tree species such as oaks, red maples, staghorn sumacs, and <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickories.</b> Once infected, these trees will also exhibit orange bark with cankers. However, they will not exhibit shoot die back and death of the main tree. Instead the pathogen will be able to persist in trees, causing the fungus to be able to attack new growth in American Chestnut trees.|$|R
50|$|The bark {{of mature}} trees is grey, {{composed}} of tight, flat-topped intersecting ridges that can appear quite blocky but are generally strap-like. Occasionally, the ridges may {{separate from the}} trunk in peeling strips, loose at both ends, a trait characteristic of <b>Shagbark</b> and Shellbark <b>Hickories.</b> Young, vigorously growing trees {{are more prone to}} producing peeling bark than mature individuals.|$|R
25|$|While {{the refuge}} is {{protected}} {{primarily for the}} bird life, several rare or uncommon plant species have also {{been found in the}} grasslands, where Kentucky bluegrass is the dominant species Frank's sedge, small-flowered agrimony, purple milkweed, small white aster, Bush's sedge, coontail and watermeal. A few tree species, such as white ash, American elm, eastern red cedar, and pin oak, also flourish in those sections. The woodlands on the periphery are dominated by several oak species, red maple, sugar maple, <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory</b> and tulip trees.|$|E
25|$|Indiana bats {{were found}} {{in a variety of}} plant {{associations}} in a southern Iowa study. Riparian areas were dominated by eastern cottonwood, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). In the forested floodplains, the dominant plants included black walnut (Juglans nigra), silver maple, American elm (Ulmus americana), and eastern cottonwood. In undisturbed upland forest, the most common plants were black oak (Quercus velutina), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya ovata), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). Black walnut, American basswood, American elm, and bur oak dominated other upland Indiana bat sites.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} factor relating to roost suitability is tree condition. Indiana bats prefer dead or dying trees with exfoliating bark. The amount of exfoliating bark present {{on a tree}} seems to be insignificant. Indiana bats show an affinity for very large trees that receive lots of sunlight. Typically, Indiana bats roost in snags, but a few species of live trees are also utilized. Live roost trees are usually <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> silver maple, and white oak. Shagbark hickories make excellent alternate roosts throughout the Indiana bats' range due to their naturally exfoliating bark. Although Indiana bats primarily roost under loose bark, a small fraction roost in tree cavities.|$|E
50|$|Waterfall Glen’s 773-acre Bluff Savanna, which roughly {{covers the}} {{southern}} part of the preserve between Argonne National Laboratory and the Des Plaines River. Waterfall Glen is one of highest ranked conservation areas in the county,it contains 422 native plant species, including one state threatened and 36 of special concern. Individual black and white oaks, <b>shagbark</b> and bitternut <b>hickories,</b> and black walnuts range from 180- to 215-years-old.With Waterfall Glen having older trees and being wooded birds like pileated woodpeckers, scarlet tanagers, ovenbirds, wood thrushes, broad-winged hawks, and barred owls, are attracted to the area and some species breed there. Ephemeral ponds make the savanna an essential habitat for salamanders and frogs.|$|R
5000|$|Pin oak {{is a major}} {{species in}} only one forest cover type, pin oak-sweetgum, which is found on bottom lands and some upland sites {{throughout}} the central portion of the pin oak range. Associated species in this type include red maple (Acer rubrum), American elm (Ulmus americana), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), willow oak (Quercus phellos), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii), swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), and shellbark (Carya laciniosa) and <b>shagbark</b> (Carya ovata) <b>hickories.</b> Pin oak and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) vary in their relative proportions in this cover type. Large areas of almost pure pin oak occur on the [...] "pin oak flats" [...] of the upland glacial till plains or in the bottom lands of the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{species of}} pines {{characteristic}} of the Appalachians are eastern white pine (...) , Virginia pine (...) , pitch pine (...) , Table Mountain pine (...) and shortleaf pine (...) [...] Red pine (...) is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers {{as far south as}} West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in E. Lucy Braun's 1950 classic, Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are white basswood (...) , yellow buckeye (...) , sugar maple (...) , American beech (...) , tuliptree (...) , white ash (...) and yellow birch (...) [...] Other common trees are red maple (...) , <b>shagbark</b> and bitternut <b>hickories</b> (...) and black or sweet birch (...) [...] Small understory trees and shrubs include flowering dogwood (...) , hophornbeam (...) , witch-hazel (...) and spicebush (...) [...] There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American ginseng (...) , goldenseal (...) , bloodroot (...) and black cohosh (...) [...]|$|R
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{in what would}} be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of American sycamore, beech, black walnut, eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were American elm, ash, beech, and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed {{the valley of the}} Cuyahoga River bluegrass, white clover, and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, passenger pigeon, quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} {{theme of}} this region is shaped by rolling hills, Great Lakes shorelines including coastal dunes on the west coast, large inland lakes, numerous rivers and large forests. A tension zone is identified running from Muskegon to Saginaw Bay marked by a change in soil type and common tree species. North of the line the historic presettlement forests were beech and sugar maple, mixed with hemlock, white pine, and yellow birch which only grew on moist soils further south. Southern Michigan forests were primarily deciduous with oaks, red maple, <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> basswood and cottonwood which are uncommon further north. Northern Michigan soils tend to be coarser, and the growing season is shorter with a cooler climate. Lake effect weather brings significant snowfalls to snow belt areas of Northern Michigan.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} 29 tree species that Indiana bats use during the summer. The {{greatest}} number of tree species {{are found in the}} central portion of Indiana bats' range (primarily Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and Kentucky), but this is likely because the majority of research conducted on the species has occurred in this region. Roost trees from these central states, which are mainly in the oak-hickory cover type, include silver maple, red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), white oak (Q. alba), red oak (Q. rubra), pin oak (Q. palustris), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q. stellata), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), eastern cottonwood, <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory,</b> bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory (C. alba), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American elm, slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash (F. americana), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
500|$|A prairie {{restoration}} {{project began}} on [...] within Silver Springs in 1980; [...] {{was added to}} the restoration project in 1991. The IDNR undertook another prairie restoration in an area within the park, {{on the north side of}} the Fox River, in 2002. For the 2002 project, the IDNR removed numerous invasive species from the area including: basswood, ash, maple, and exotic honeysuckle. The non-native exotic honeysuckle species had thrived in the absence of fire through human intervention. These actions were meant to allow native burr and black oak, and <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory</b> a chance to reproduce.|$|E
500|$|As a {{saprobic}} fungus, Sarcoscypha occidentalis {{is part of}} {{a community}} of fungi that {{play an important role in}} the forest ecosystem by breaking down the complex insoluble molecules cellulose and lignin of wood and leaf litter into smaller oligosaccharides that may be used by a variety of microbes. Fruit bodies of S.coccinea may grow either solitarily, scattered or grouped together on sticks, twigs, and fragments of dead wood, usually somewhat decomposed and partially buried in the top [...] of soil and forest litter. It prefers soil that is moist and shaded and has a high content of humus. Like all Sarcoscypha species, it prefers the wood of angiosperms, such as oak, maple, and basswood; one field guide notes a preference for <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory.</b> In the United States, it fruits from late spring to early autumn, which contrasts it with S.coccinea, found usually in the spring.|$|E
2500|$|Salyers {{and others}} [...] {{suggested}} a potential roost density of 15 trees/ha was needed, or 30 roosts/ha if artificial roost boxes are erected in a stand with American elm and <b>shagbark</b> <b>hickory.</b> The roosting home range used by any single Indiana bat was {{as large as}} 568 hectares in an oak-pine community in Kentucky.
