25|$|Pesticides and {{herbicides}} {{are applied}} to agricultural land to control pests that disrupt crop production. Soil contamination can occur when pesticides persist and accumulate in soils, which can alter microbial processes, increase plant uptake of the chemical, and also cause toxicity to <b>soil</b> <b>organisms.</b> The {{extent to which the}} pesticides and herbicides persist depends on the compound’s unique chemistry, which affects sorption dynamics and resulting fate and transport in the soil environment. Pesticides can also accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and <b>soil</b> <b>organisms.</b> In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects, such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests (i.e. insects that prey on or parasitize pests) than they are to the target pests themselves.|$|E
25|$|Soil ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among <b>soil</b> <b>organisms,</b> and between biotic and abiotic aspects of the soil environment.

25|$|Tillage is the {{practice}} of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till.

25|$|Biomes are terminologically {{similar to}} the concept of ecosystems, and are climatically and {{geographically}} defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as communities of plants, animals, and <b>soil</b> <b>organisms,</b> often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation.|$|E
25|$|These {{are large}} robust flies with massive eyes that often show colored patterns. Antennae are {{characteristic}} with three dissimilar segments projecting forward from head. Wings {{are large and}} strong with complex venation, and often with complex patterns of brown on clear background. These flies are adapted to hunt widely for their hosts during daytime. Females take repeated small blood meals from their hosts to support development of a large batch of eggs. Eggs are laid on wet soil where larvae develop, sometimes over {{one or two years}} by feeding on <b>soil</b> <b>organisms.</b> Males do not feed on blood. Hosts of females include all species of mammalian livestock animals and horses. Tabanid flies have large mouthparts comprising three pairs of cutting / slashing elements that pierce skin in a superficial wound. Blood flowing from this is imbibed through a sponge-like element of the mouthparts, the labella (similar to that shown in photograph of Calliphora).|$|E
25|$|Between 21March and mid-July, around 27PBq of caesium-137 (about 8.4kg) {{entered the}} ocean, with about 82percent having flowed {{into the sea}} before 8April. However, the Fukushima coast {{has some of the}} world's strongest {{currents}} and these transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated <b>soil.</b> <b>Organisms</b> that filter water and fish {{at the top of the}} food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentrations in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above the normal concentrations prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.|$|E

2500|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} is an organochloride {{with the}} formula H2C=CHCl {{that is also}} called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) or chloroethene. This colorless compound is an important industrial chemical chiefly used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). About 13 billion kilograms are produced annually. VCM is among the top twenty largest petrochemicals (petroleum-derived chemicals) in world production. The United States currently remains the largest VCM manufacturing region because of its low-production-cost position in chlorine and ethylene raw materials. China is also a large manufacturer {{and one of the}} largest consumers of VCM. Vinyl chloride is a gas with a sweet odor. It is highly toxic, flammable, and carcinogenic. It can be formed in the environment when <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> break down [...] "chlorinated" [...] solvents. Vinyl chloride that is released by industries or formed by the breakdown of other chlorinated chemicals can enter the air and drinking water supplies.

2500|$|The two {{dominant}} vegetation {{types of}} this mountain region, forests and meadows, have very distinct {{differences in their}} microclimates. [...] The amount of solar radiation and UV exposure can vary substantially in our northern latitude largely based {{on the time of}} day, slope, season, cloud cover and vegetation. Temperatures adjust accordingly to this solar radiation and exposure. [...] The parklands of this montane region have a much larger range of temperatures as compared to the hemlock forests. The range can be as much as [...] while the range in the forests rarely exceeds [...] This is due to the canopy of the trees, creating a much more protected environment as compared to the open meadows. [...] In addition soil temperatures directly impact biological activity affecting <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> and root systems. Daily and season temperature changes greatly affect the soils' heat loss and gain. However, the snowpack acts as an insulating buffer against temperature change in soils.

In Czech Republic there are legally used only those pesticide products, which are registered by SRS (State Phytosanitary Administration).
