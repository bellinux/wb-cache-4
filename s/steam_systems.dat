The <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> operates {{with an annual}} budget of $ 8. 9 million (local currency was converted to US Dollars). Normal steam demand ranges from 500, 000 to 600, 000 lbs/hr. 380, 000 lbs/hr is imported from an outside power plant and 170, 000 lbs/hr is internally generated as waste heat recovery. The <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> analysis identified energy savings worth of $ 2, 400, 000 per year. The optimization measures were in two categories: ? no cost / low cost that can be done through better maintenance and improvement of operating conditions. ? major improvement that requires a significant amount of investment, that includes the modification of process and major equipment. Though the findings are specific to a single site, the basics of <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> analysis are applicable to any <b>steam</b> <b>system.</b> A critical review on any <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> always identifies controllable wastes.

Its pH-adjusting qualities then become distributed throughout the steam plant to provide corrosion protection. Morpholine is often used in conjunction with low concentrations of hydrazine or ammonia to provide a comprehensive all-volatile treatment chemistry for corrosion protection for the <b>steam</b> <b>systems</b> of such plants.

40|$|Karlshamnsverket is an {{oil fired}} reserve power plant, {{situated}} in the southeast part of Sweden. The power plant consists of three units with a total capacity of 996 MWel and it operates at least 4000 hours in standby annually. The most common standby mode is the 2 hour standby. At 2 hour standby mode the power plant is required to produce electricity to the grid within 2 hours. The order for a start-up is either given by the owners or Svenska Kraftnät. During standby the power plant needs steam to maintain readiness. Steam is supplied to the support <b>steam</b> <b>system,</b> either by an electric heater or by an oil boiler. The support <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> {{is divided into two}} circuits, a non-oil circuit and an oil circuit. Within these two circuits there are a total of ten heat consumers that are active during 2 hour standby. A heat consumer in this thesis is connected to the support <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> and is supplied with steam during 2 hour standby. Such heat consumer may be the deaerator or the heating of the oil tanks. At this time the amount of steam supplied to the heat consumers during 2 hour standby is unknown. The oil boiler of the support <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> has during a normal year 3000 operating hours. This means fuel is consumed when the power plant is not running, thus not generating any profit, only increased costs, for Karlshamnsverket. Therefore there is a strong economic incentive to reduce the running cost of the support <b>steam</b> <b>system.</b> In this thesis the support <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> and its heat consumers are mapped and measured at 2 hour standby to determine their respective heat requirement. The results from the measurements show that a total of 18. 1 MW of steam is required to operate the support <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> at maximum load. The oil boiler of the support <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> has a maximum capacity of 13 MWsteam. The efficiency of the oil boiler is determined to be 85 % via a created model. At this load the oil boiler has approximately 2 MW of flue gas losses. This flue gas loss can be minimized, thus increasing the energy efficiency of the oil boiler. The suggested energy efficiency measure is to install an economiser into the present oil boiler’s flue gas train. To avoid flue gas condensation the economiser is placed after the current Electro Static Precipitator (ESP). The proposed capacity of the economiser is 1. 4 MW and delivers feed water at 80 ºC to the oil boiler. This lowers the fuel consumption with approximately 46 tons of LS HFO per year. The investment cost is approximated to 1. 5 MSEK, resulting in a payback period approximately to 4 – 5 years. The annual savings are determined to be between 300 000 – 340 000 SEK...|$|R
