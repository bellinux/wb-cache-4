40|$|The {{following}} conclusions can {{be drawn}} from the connections between the flow behaviour of the adhesives and the results of the <b>screen</b> and <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> test: 1) Adhesives with structurally viscous behaviour are best suited to <b>screen</b> and <b>stencil</b> <b>printing.</b> If adhesives with thixotropic flow behaviour are used, they must be able to reconstruct their thixotropic structures within {{a very short period of}} time. 2) The viscosity of the adhesive at shear rates from 0. 01 to 0. 1 should be as high as possible. The current findings indicate that the viscosity should be higher than 500 Pa s. 3) A high viscosity at a low shear rate is not the only criterion which indicates the suitability of the adhesives for <b>screen</b> and <b>stencil</b> <b>printing.</b> For printing very detailed structures, a noticeable flow should only occur at shear stresses of 80 Pa or above, with a viscosity of 300 Pa s or greater. When testing the suitability of an adhesive for <b>screen</b> and <b>stencil</b> <b>printing,</b> it is important to identify first of all whether it has a time-dependent flow behaviour. If this is the case, the adhesive must be subjected to pre-shear before the measurements are made. The flow behaviour in the low shear rate range is the decisive factor. Measurements relating to shear stress up to a shear rate of 10 1 /s have proved to be suitable. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
40|$|The mesh {{has been}} an {{interference}} factor {{in the making of}} close tolerance high resolution <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> <b>stencils.</b> Radiation strikes the surface of the threads and is reflected into the light sensitive emulsion causing a deterioration in the sharpness of the stencil edge. This problem has been largely overcome by the introduction of dyed mesh. However, by purposely exploiting the reflective properties of the mesh, a random, or irregular pattern of dots can be produced. This is accomplished by exposing a continuous tone positive to a screen that has been coated with a photosensitive emulsion. Five screens of varying mesh counts were constructed. The test procedure involved experimenting with a number of variables including photosensitive materials, coating thickness and wash-out procedures. Comparisons of the differences in the random dot structure from one screen to another were made and analyzed. Results of this study showed that there is a correlation between thread frequency and the degree of hardening caused by undercut that is produced in the coating around these threads...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIndustrial silicon {{solar cells}} like Passivated Emitter and Rear Cells (PERC) {{typically}} apply a screen-printed (Ag) front {{contact with a}} single print process using a mesh screen. It {{has been shown that}} using stencils instead of screens improves the finger profile leading to slightly higher cell conversion efficiencies. However, so far <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> required an extra printing step for the busbars since conventional stencils do not support H-pattern designs. In this paper, we evaluate a novel “single print” stencil from ASM AE that allows to print busbars and fingers in a single print step. We apply the novel single <b>print</b> <b>stencil</b> to high-efficiency PERC solar cells and compare it to today's industrial <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> processes (single print and dual print) as well as to a high performance dual-printed front side grid applying a stencil for the fingers and a screen for the busbars. The printed finger width ranges from 35. 8 ± 2. 3 μm for 30 μm stencil opening to 46. 7 ± 3. 4 μm for 40 μm screen opening which leads to an 0. 5 %abs increased metallized area on the front side of the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> fingers compared to the <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> fingers. The resulting average finger height is 22. 3 μm for the stencil groups and 11. 9 μm for the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> Ag finger which leads to a difference in the finger line resistance and an additional series resistance contribution for the screen-printed cells of 0. 05 Ωcm 2. We achieve almost identical PERC cell efficiencies with the single <b>print</b> <b>stencil</b> and the dual <b>print</b> <b>stencil</b> process obtaining best values up to 21. 1 % and average values of 21. 0 %. In contrast, both <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> groups achieve 0. 2 %abs lower average conversion efficiencies mostly due to the lower Jsc and FF. The advantage of the dual print process compared to single print is shown in the increased Voc by 1 to 2 mV due to the used non-firing through Ag busbar paste. With these results we demonstrate that the single <b>print</b> <b>stencil</b> process saves two process steps compared to dual <b>print</b> using a <b>stencil</b> while obtaining the same PERC cell performance with an efficiency gain of 0. 2 %abs compared to today's industrial <b>screen</b> <b>print</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|Adhesives used in micro-manufacturing {{processes}} must {{be applied}} in fine structures and minute quantities. Micro-manufacturing therefore presents a challenge regarding both the application techniques and {{the properties of the}} adhesives being used. Up until now users have {{had little choice but to}} test adhesives in direct applications. Apart from being highly complex, such testing delivers no transferable results. The key to resolving this problem lies in the rheology of adhesives. The ability to apply an adhesive is crucially influenced by its rheological properties - its flow behaviour. Relatively little research has been undertaken to date on the correlation between flow properties and adhesive application in the area of micro-manufacturing. Of the different techniques used for applying adhesives in micro-manufacturing, the research reported in this paper focuses on <b>screen</b> and <b>stencil</b> <b>printing,</b> although stamping and ink jet application are also of interest. Different adhesives, covering both filled and non-filled systems, were used in these studies. The application behaviour and evenness of deposits were evaluated. The flow behaviour of the adhesives was characterised in detail.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} printed wearable electrode networks on textiles for monitoring human biopotentials from the skin surface. The aim was to fabricate garments to monitor human biopotentials, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), on a long term basis. A literature review was carried out to examine fabrication methods for wearable electrode networks on textile and <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> is selected for this work. Several conductive and insulating screen printable pastes were then evaluated for this application and suitable pastes were selected. <b>Screen</b> <b>printing</b> was used to create networks of conductive tracks {{on the surface of}} woven textiles. These networks connect electrodes at different sites to electronics at a central location. The conductive tracks are composed of a silver polymer layer with thickness 5 - 10 ?m entirely encapsulated in polyurethane. The durability of these printed conductive tracks is investigated with cyclic stress and washing machine tests. A significant improvement in the durability of these tracks is achieved by using two different polyurethane pastes and optimising the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> layer structure. Tracks that can reliably endure 10 typical domestic machine washes without breaking are demonstrated. Carbon loaded silicone rubber is <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> to form electrodes on exposed conductive pads at the terminations of <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> conductive tracks. The carbon loaded rubber formulation is optimised to provide electrodes with low resistivity, low surface energy and high flexibility. By using <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> rather than <b>screen</b> <b>printing,</b> the thickness of the electrodes is increased, causing them to protrude from the textile surface, which is useful in ensuring stable electrode-skin contact. Passive and active electrodes are fabricated on woven textiles using <b>screen</b> and <b>stencil</b> <b>printing,</b> and their performance is evaluated. The passive electrodes have issues with DC instability, but have suitable performance for some electromyography tasks and basic heart rate monitoring. The active electrodes show comparable performance with the gold standard, commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The printed textile electrode networks are demonstrated in four applications: a one-lead bipolar heart monitoring belt, a Frank configuration vector-cardiogram monitoring vest, a headband as an electromyographic (EMG) and electrooculographic (EOG) computer interface, and an armband used to examine electromyographic activity in the upper arm. <b>Screen</b> <b>printing</b> on textiles is shown to be a low-cost alternative fabrication process for durable wearable electrode networks on textiles, capable of providing high signal quality. These printed textile electrode networks are shown to be applicable to ambulatory monitoring, to reduce the associated cost and discomfort, and in hospitals and research to reduce electrode setup time...|$|R

40|$|This thesis work {{demonstrates}} the feasibility to fabricate high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells by using metal <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> technique to replace <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> or electroless plating techniques for implementing crystalline silicon solar cell front metallization. The developed laser-cut stainless steel stencils successfully challenge {{two of the}} cell performance limitations associated with commercial <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> technology: the wide and non-uniform front gridline fingers and low height-to-width aspect ratio of the fingers. These limitations lower the short circuit current density, the fill factor and, in turn, the efficiency of a <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> solar cell. Metal stencils are capable of printing fine, high and continuous features on the cell front that have a high aspect ratio. Both single-level and double-level structured stainless steel stencils for solar cell front metallization have been developed, with laser-cut double-level stainless steel stencils being demonstrated {{for the first time}} worldwide. Both of them are able to print fine, high and continuous gridline pattern to the front surfaces of solar cells in one step, with a certain number of special short bridges being put at the places where fingers meet busbar and along fingers and busbar. The deformation issue of the very thin stainless steel foils due to its thermal expansion in the process of laser cutting is solved by increasing the energy content in each laser pulse that impinges upon the stainless steel foil with changed Q-switch frequencies, while maintaining the laser average output energy in unit time to an optimum value. A chemical etching process has been developed to etch the dross that results from laser cutting, resulting in well formed metal <b>stencils</b> suitable for <b>printing.</b> By a comparison between the metal <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> and conventional mesh <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> silicon solar cells, which are fabricated on similar Cz silicon wafers with a almost identical cell processing sequence except for using different front contact printing masks, the following conclusions are reached: Fired Ag finger lines with 75 -&# 956;m width on finished solar cells, using a double level stainless steel stencil can be achieved. In contrast, the fired Ag finger line on finished solar cells using a traditional mesh screen is 121 -&# 956;m wide. The <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> finger is smoother and more uniform than by <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> and the former has a 25 -&# 956;m fired finger height with a 0. 33 height-to-width aspect ratio, compared to a 10 -&# 956;m fired finger height with a 0. 08 height-to-width aspect ratio for the later. With these advantages, the 4 -cm 2 stencil-printed silicon solar cells has an averaged 1. 28 mA/cm 2 higher short circuit current and an averaged 5. 9 % higher efficiency than the 4 -cm 2 <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> silicon solar cell, which identifies one of the key advantages of solar cell metallization schemes by using metal <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> in place of <b>screen</b> <b>printing.</b> Using a &# 147;feedback alignment&# 148; method for registration of the laser-formed metal <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> pattern and the laser-formed groove pattern, Ag paste can be printed and filled into wafer grooves by using a hand-operated without an optical vision system. The fired finger profile is 50 -&# 956;m wide and 22 -&# 956;m high. The best metal <b>stencil</b> <b>printed,</b> selective emitter silicon solar cell demonstrates a 34. 2 mA/cm 2 short circuit current density, 625 mV open circuit voltage, 0. 77 fill factor and 16. 4 % efficiency, with an excellent spectral response at short wavelengths due to its selective emitter cell structure. It is believed that the performance of this type of solar cell can be enhanced with a screen printer that has an optical vision system and an automatic alignment device.
