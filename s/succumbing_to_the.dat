5|$|Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories were merged in 1930 as Wonder Stories, and the {{quarterly}} was renamed Wonder Stories Quarterly. The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold Wonder Stories to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled Thrilling Wonder Stories, it continued for nearly 20years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines. Startling itself lasted only {{to the end of}} 1955 before finally <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline of the pulp magazine industry.|$|E

Orhan's successor, Murad I was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, just like Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks, Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with Philippopolis falling after major campaigning between 1363–4 and Adrianople <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans in 1369.|$|E

In his honour, the team donated a new award to the league, the Vezina Trophy, to be given to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals over the course of the season. The first recipient was his replacement, George Hainsworth. Vezina was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame upon its creation in 1945.|$|E
5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E

She learns that her parents are eagerly awaiting a marriage proposal for her. Unwilling to get married, and hoping that the groom's family will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late to find Chandrakumar (the groom) and his family patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, {{he says that he}} likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her family begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. <b>Succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{was created}} on February19, 1895 by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature from {{portions}} of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address the concerns of Englewood Township's leaders, the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May3, 1921, and June1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Rama bhakti movement in the 12th century, numerous works adopted the concept of Maya Sita. Devotees could not bear that Sita – the consort of Rama and the chief goddess of Rama-centric sects – was kidnapped by the demon Ravana and had to suffer his imprisonment and was defiled by his touch. The Maya Sita concept saves Sita from suffering Ravana's custody and <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temptation of acquiring the illusory deer. Instead, the texts create an illusory Sita, who does not recognize the illusory deer. The illusory deer motif in the Ramayana may have inspired the Maya Sita concept too. Maya Sita also excuses Sita from rebuking Lakshmana when she forces him to leave her and aid Rama in the illusory deer tale.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
