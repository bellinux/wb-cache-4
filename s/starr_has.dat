5|$|In 1980, {{while on}} the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he {{was the first of the}} Beatles to become a {{grandfather}} upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> seven grandchildren – one from Zak, three from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> {{been involved in}} a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{controversial}} figures, Kenneth <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> {{been the subject}} of political satire. The book, And the Horse He Rode In On, by James Carville, attempts to portray Starr's time as special prosecutor in a comedic, negative light. At the end of his tenure at Baylor, many have called Starr a hypocrite for playing a role in covering up the Baylor Football sex scandal, considering how harshly he stood against Clinton in regards to Clinton's scandal.|$|E

25|$|He {{devoted his}} life to caring for his younger brother Robert, who was {{disabled}} and lived with cerebral palsy, which was another factor in his lack of relationships. At some point in the 1920s, or possibly earlier, he read the writings of Mary Baker Eddy, including Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Cornell considered Eddy's works to be among the most important books ever published after the Bible, and he became a lifelong Christian Science adherent. Christian Science belief and practice informed Cornell's art deeply, as art historian Sandra Leonard <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> shown.|$|E

500|$|<b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> {{said that}} his {{favourite}} drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played together as a double-drumming team on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s, on Ringo and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For Ringo's Rotogravure in 1976, Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination, crediting himself as [...] "Thunder" [...] and Keltner as [...] "Lightnin'".|$|E

500|$|Starr re-recorded [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] for his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses, in a {{collaboration}} with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles {{songs such as}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends", [...] "Good Day Sunshine" [...] and [...] "Baby, You're a Rich Man". The original version has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album Goodnight Vienna. Since his return to touring in 1989, <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> performed [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] regularly {{in concert with the}} various incarnations of his All-Starr Band.|$|E
500|$|Commentators have {{interpreted}} the song, and particularly this statement, {{as an attack}} by Starr on his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney. <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> denied any such interpretation, instead [...] "claiming that the song was inspired by Bolan and nothing more", Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes. Starr had publicly criticised McCartney's solo albums McCartney (1970) and Ram (1971) on release, and author Bruce Spizer paraphrases {{the message of the}} middle eight as [...] "a plea for Paul to produce better music". The mention of [...] "sound wasted" [...] could also be a reference to McCartney's overindulgence with cannabis, Rodriguez suggests. A further example of Starr's allegedly anti-McCartney message exists in the song's first verse: ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} consider [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{to be one}} of Starr's signature tunes. In his contemporary {{review for}} Rolling Stone, Ben Gerson praised it as a song on which [...] "a stunning alchemy occurs"; author Peter Doggett likens the track to a [...] "lost gem" [...] from the Beatles' Abbey Road album. [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] was later included on Starr's compilations Blast from Your Past (1975) and [...] (2007). <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> often performed it in concert with his All-Starr Band, whose second album, [...] (1993), opens with the song. A version from the 1973 recording session with Lennon on lead vocals appeared on the 1998 box set John Lennon Anthology.|$|E

Starr produced the track with Voormann. The sessions for [...] "Blindman" [...] took place at Apple on 18–19 August, with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voormann. Like the film Blindman (1971), the song is held in low regard by critics; Spizer describes it as [...] "a muddy-sounding dirge with little to recommend".|$|R
500|$|<b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> {{performed}} [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{in concert}} on {{several of his}} tours with the All-Starr Band. It was the opening song throughout their 1992 North American and European tours, the last of which included a return to Liverpool for Starr's first concert {{in the city of}} his birth since the Beatles had played there in December 1965. A live version from this European tour, recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival on 13 July 1992, appeared as the opening track of his album [...] Backed by the Roundheads, Starr played the song during his 2005 TV concert appearance for Soundstage, a performance that was released two years later on the album [...] and on DVD in 2009.|$|E
500|$|<b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> {{performed}} [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] {{in concert}} with his All-Starr Band, beginning with the band's debut tour of North America in July–September 1989. The song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour, however, in favour of the 1963 Lennon–McCartney composition [...] "I Wanna Be Your Man". Live versions of [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] have appeared on the multi-disc compilation The Anthology... So Far (2001) and King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All-Starr Band (2002). The latter version was recorded during a US tour in August 2001, {{at which point the}} All-Starr line-up was Starr (vocals), Mark Rivera (saxophone), Ian Hunter (guitar), Roger Hodgson and Howard Jones (keyboards), Greg Lake (bass) and Sheila E.

500|$|<b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} {{praise from}} critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him [...] "a superb actor, an absolute natural". By the mid-1960s, Starr {{had become a}} connoisseur of film. In addition to his roles in A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and Let It Be (1970), Starr also acted in Candy (1968), The Magic Christian (1969), Blindman (1971), Son of Dracula (1974) and Caveman (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point! He co-starred in That'll Be the Day (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in The Last Waltz, the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, <b>Starr</b> <b>had</b> made Milwaukee her home town {{and was a}} popular act in clubs in the region.

50|$|After John Lennon's {{murder in}} late 1980, Starr {{returned}} home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which <b>Starr</b> <b>had</b> purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager {{to move on to}} his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, {{a former member of the}} recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and <b>Starr</b> <b>had</b> known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording shortly afterwards begun and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after <b>Starr</b> <b>had</b> previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and keyboardists Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a review}} in Art Monthly in 2000 a critic {{described}} Starr's new exhibition in London The Bunny Lakes are Coming: [...] "Art {{is meant to}} be more sensitive than popular culture but doesn't always manage it. The Bunny Lakes are Coming is a melange of pop cultural melancholy and terror that is as sensitive as a fresh bruise. Starr's longstanding interest in the exploration of internality through the products of popular culture has been chided in the past. If returning home is a way of testing whether you have moved one, <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> not endeavoured to please. Her new work is as dark as her early work was light. Maybe her early work was too soft, now it's too soft to touch." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{genesis of}} the California Sound {{is said to be}} the Beach Boys' debut single [...] "Surfin'" [...] in 1961. While the band's leader Brian Wilson then collaborated with Jan Berry for several hit singles written and {{produced}} for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the California Sound. University of Southern California history professor Kevin <b>Starr</b> <b>has</b> stated that the band was historically important for embodying the era of the Silent Generation, which he described as unpolitical. He explained that the group [...] "could not help but mythologize a landscape and way of life that was already so surreal, so proto-mythic, in its setting. Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound." [...] The California Sound was thus a musical translation of the California Myth. In the book Pioneers of Rock and Roll: 100 Artists Who Changed the Face of Rock, Harry Sumrall summarized: ...|$|E

50|$|District Judge James Robertson {{dismissed}} {{the charges against}} Hubbell and his wife on July 1, 1998, ruling that Independent Counsel Kenneth <b>Starr</b> <b>had</b> overstepped his authority in bringing the Hubbell indictment. Judge Robertson ruled that <b>Starr</b> <b>had</b> violated Hubbell's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination by building a case that relied on materials collected under an immunity agreement with Hubbell. Starr appealed to the Court of Appeals and Judge Robertson was affirmed. Starr then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In an 8-1 decision (with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist the lone dissenter), the Supreme Court also {{ruled in favor of}} Hubbell.|$|R
