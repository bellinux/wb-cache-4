40|$|Denmark's future {{energy system}} is to be entirely based on {{renewable}} energy sources. Municipalities will {{play an important role}} as local energy planning authorities in terms of adopting and refining this vision in different local contexts. Based on a review of 11 municipal energy plans, this paper examines to what extent municipal energy planning matches national 100 % renewable energy strategies. The results indicate a willingness among Danish municipalities to actively carry out energy planning, and the plans reveal a large diversity of (new) activities. At the same time, however, there is a strong need for better coordination of municipal energy planning activities at the central level. It is suggested that the role of municipalities as energy planning authorities needs to be outlined more clearly in, e. g., <b>strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> which integrates savings, efficiency and renewable energy in all (energy) sectors. This requires the state to provide municipalities with the necessary planning instruments and establish a corresponding planning framework. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} a simultaneous centralisation and decentralisation during the implementation of the 100 % renewable energy vision. The paper outlines a basic division of tasks between the central and the local level within such a <b>strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> system. <b>Strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> Municipal energy plans 100 % renewable energy systems...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the coordination between different political and administrative levels, {{in order to}} improve the process of implementing energy efficiency measures within the buildings owned by the Danish municipality of Stevns. The theoretical and methodical foundation of this thesis builds upon a mixture of core elements of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Planning,</b> Backcasting and Multi-level Governance. Where <b>Strategic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Planning</b> and Multi-level Governance define the theoretical framework of the study, Backcasting outlines the overall analytical structure in four separate analyses: (1) a discussion of the transitional goal, based on a set criteria. (2) A mapping of the current energy efficiency initiatives in the municipality of Stevns and (3) the policy measures and political agreements governing energy efficiency as a whole. (4) An assessment of the main transition conditions, including the establishment of a transition goal, {{in the form of an}} energy savings potential. The thesis concludes in the characterization of an energy plan for the municipality of Stevns, which details a long-term energy strategy, describing the steps needed in fulfilling the set potential. Furthermore, we argue that an improvement of the existing data collection and knowledge sharing tools are necessary, in supporting the overall creation, identification, and sharing of best practice knowledge between the political and administrative levels...|$|E
40|$|As {{a measure}} to {{mitigate}} global warming through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, there is broad agreement that the Danish energy system must undergo a process of transition towards a renewable energy supply. To support this transition, {{a proposal for a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> has been presented by the Danish Energy Authority (DEA) and Local Government Denmark (LGDK). It is a planning tool facilitating local planning towards a more flexible and efficient energy system. The concept {{is in the process of}} being developed and this thesis aims at contributing to this development. The thesis strives to provide this through a comprehensive case study using the Region of Zealand as it’s base. By asking: Which possibilities and challenges exist for a strategically long-term transition of the energy system in the Region of Zealand to a renewable energy supply, and what elements are thereby derived for the development of <b>strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning?</b> Two separate but interacting objectives are proposed for the study: 1) The development of a strategic and long-term transition plan for the Region of Zealand and 2) consequently deriving the challenges and possibilities for a <b>strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> in order to contribute towards further development and refinement of the concept. The study starts by a theoretical discussion and methodological operationalization of the concept, followed by four separate analyses. First a discussion of the transitional goal, secondly by a mapping of the initial energy system, production, consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Thirdly a review of the main transition conditions: the potential for energy savings and renewable energy production is being performed, and finally the energy transition analysis outlines the way for the regional energy system, towards a renewable energy supply in 2050. The thesis results in a proposed energy balance for the Region of Zealand in 2050 as well as an associated system transition plan. Through the elaboration of this transitional plan, a methodology for strategic and systemic energy planning has been developed, which facilitates robust, long-term action plans. This approach is further condensed, alongside the other experiences derived from the case study, in order to summarize the recommendations, which this study can pass on to the planning process towards the future sustainable energy systems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRenewable {{energy is}} clean {{sources of energy}} that have a much lower {{environmental}} impact than conventional energy technologies. Renewable energy sector plays {{a very important role}} in the <b>strategic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> process in any country.
