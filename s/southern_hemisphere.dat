5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere)</b> to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> {{they feed}} almost {{exclusively}} on euphausiids (mainly the genera Euphausia and Thysanoessa), as well as taking small amounts of amphipods (e.g. Themisto gaudichaudii) and various species of fish. Of the more than 16,000 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in their stomachs, 99.4% fed on euphausiids, 0.5% on fish, and 0.1% on amphipods. In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume E. superba.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the <b>southern</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. <b>Southern</b> <b>hemisphere</b> noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the <b>southern</b> <b>hemisphere</b> has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E

5|$|The IWC {{prohibited}} {{hunting in}} the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> in 1976. The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species in the North Pacific and <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> over-reporting fin whale catches to cover up illegal takes of other species. In the North Pacific, they reported taking over 10,000 fin whales between 1961–79, while the true catch was less than 9,000. In the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> they reported taking nearly 53,000 between 1948 and 1973, when the true total was a little over 41,000. The fin whale was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific in 1976, and in the North Atlantic in 1987, with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes. All populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Conservation Union Red List.
