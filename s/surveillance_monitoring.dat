5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 to 200 Nmi. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring <b>surveillance,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and policing by these nations, increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources, and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2010, India {{has more}} {{reported}} cases of TB than any other country. This is {{in part due to}} severe mismanagement of diagnosis and treatment of TB within the private health care sector of India that serves about 50% of the population. [...] There are therefore calls for the private sector to engage in the public Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program that has proved effective in reducing TB amongst the patients receiving health care through the government. Additionally, a study by Maurya et al. conducted in 2013 shows evidence that there is a burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in India and change is needed for testing, <b>surveillance,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and management.|$|E

50|$|Between 1997 and 2001, Sidén {{developed}} {{a series of}} video installations focused on surveillance and infrastructure. Day's Inn (1997) and Who Told The Chambermaid? (1998) show the inner-workings of a hotel on <b>surveillance</b> <b>monitors</b> mounted on a shelving system that includes towels, new toilet paper rolls, and other backroom items, suggesting that a hotel employee is spying on its guests. The camera views include the front desk, corridors, and storage closets, and they also go into the rooms, revealing dozens of guests involved in activities such as reading a newspaper, going to the bathroom, masturbating or having sex. Station 10 and Back Again (2001) repeats the formula, but uses a fire station instead of a hotel. The shelving system contains hoses and helmets, and the <b>surveillance</b> <b>monitors</b> show firemen eating, showering, sleeping, exercising and responding to an alarm. All three of these pieces are silent; their executions were all preceded by on-site research, during which Sidén lived on location. Who Told The Chambermaid? showed at the 1999 Venice Biennale.|$|R

40|$|In general terms, <b>surveillance</b> and <b>monitoring</b> {{technologies}} aim at {{understanding what}} people do in a given environment, whether this means {{to ensure the safety}} of workers on the factory floor, to detect crimes occurring in indoor or outdoor settings, or to monitor the flow of large crowds through public spaces. However, <b>surveillance</b> and <b>monitoring</b> technologies rarely consider that they analyze human behavior, a phenomenon subject to principles and laws rigorous enough to produce stable and predictable patterns corresponding to social, affective, and psychological phenomena. On the other hand, these phenomena are the subject of other computing domains, in particular Social Signal Processing and Affective Computing, that typically neglect scenarios relevant to <b>surveillance</b> and <b>monitoring</b> technologies, especially when it comes to social and affective dimensions of space in human activities. The goal of this paper is to show that the investigation of the overlapping area between <b>surveillance</b> and <b>monitoring</b> on one side, and Social Signal Processing and Affective Computing on the other side can bring significant progress in both domains and open a number of interesting research perspectives. 1...|$|R

Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated tracking surveillance system. Automated video <b>surveillance</b> <b>monitors</b> people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the amount of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.|$|R
