5|$|Dana Rosemary Scallon {{announced}} on 19 September {{that she would}} be seeking a presidential nomination. She initially attempted to gain the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> 20 Oireachtas members. However, by 21 September, she only secured the support of one TD. She instead began the process of seeking support from county and city councils.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration was {{dedicated}} in Constitution Gardens on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> all the original signers are carved in stone with their names, places of residence, and occupations.|$|E
5000|$|For example, all prime {{numbers have}} a prime <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> {1}, the squares of primes have a prime <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> {2}, the {{products}} of 2 distinct primes have a prime <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> {1,1} and {{the products of}} a square of a prime and a different prime (e.g. 12,18,20,... have a prime <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> {2,1}.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a Weyl group element is {{defined in terms of}} the number of its simple Weyl reflections. Actual {{calculations}} hence are not always possible especially for Weyl groups with higher order like $E_ 8 $ Weyl group. By extending the concept from <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a Weyl reflection to <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a weight, we show that <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a weight is defined without referring to Weyl reflections, Though both have the same result, the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a weight can be calculated for any Lie algebra.

5|$|Scattered objects, {{like other}} trans-Neptunian objects, have low densities and are {{composed}} largely of frozen volatiles {{such as water}} and methane. Spectral analysis of selected Kuiper belt and scattered objects has revealed <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> similar compounds. Both Pluto and Eris, for instance, show signatures for methane.|$|E
5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} referendum if <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E

40|$|Let us {{consider}} a compact oriented riemannian manifold M without boundary and of dimension n = 4 k. The <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> M {{is defined as}} the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a given quadratic form Q. Two different products could be used to define Q and they render equivalent definitions: the exterior product of forms and the cup product of cohomology classes. The <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a manifold is proved to yield a topological invariant. Additionally, using the metric, a suitable Dirac operator can be defined whose index coincides with the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the manifold. ...|$|R
5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were still largely governed by age-old social customs. Many ways in which family relations were conducted during the Han were already stipulated in the ancient Confucian canon, especially in the Book of Rites. This became accepted as the mainstream guide to ethics and custom. In terms of private commercial contracts, they usually entailed information on the goods transferred, the amount paid, {{the names of the}} buyer and seller, the date of transfer and the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, {{probably}} of mushroom poisoning. He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal and devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} of the issue. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E

50|$|The {{ordinary}} {{electronic passport}} no longer bears the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the issuing authority as such {{information has been}} embedded in the digital information system, thus only bearing the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the passport holder. However, the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the bearer is still manually done during the interview by the immigration officer although digital <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the holder is {{also included in the}} digital information embedded on the electronic chip along with the ten-fingerprints and digital face photograph. Above the <b>signature,</b> reminder <b>of</b> the inclusion of the chip on the passport can be found requesting appropriate treatment of the passport to avoid chip disturbance as such passport should not be bent and/or exposed to extreme radioactivity devices.|$|R
30|$|In this technique, the {{algorithm}} uses the “Signature” of each action to sort {{the pool of}} candidate actions. The <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> an action is the traffic which has been generated when it was performed previously possibly from another state of the application (For example, in Fig.  7 the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> clicking on P 2 is {Rb 1,Rb 2 }). The <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> an action may also be discovered without the need to execute the action; for example, the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> clicking on “contact-us” in Fig.  7 can be discovered by just looking at its href property in the DOM (Fig.  14). It is notable that the session reconstruction algorithm {{does not have the}} <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> all actions; the signature for an action is extracted once an action is evaluated for the first time.|$|R
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Ferdinand VII {{refused to}} renew the Spanish Constitution of 1812, {{returning}} the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ramírez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 reales. The issues were printed by Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company and featured the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> treasurer José Bacener and Ramírez. The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's profile in the two varieties and were numbered manually. No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related {{to the creation of}} these notes have surfaced. These issues were collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, leaving only a few dozen intact.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Castelli and Álzaga plotted to oust Liniers and {{constitute}} a local government Junta, {{similar to those}} of the metropoli. This project was not shared by most of the natives or by the head of the Regiment of Patricians, Cornelio Saavedra. Manuel Belgrano proposed as an alternative to support the plans of Princess Charlotte, which were supported by Castelli and other criollos. Belgrano, who held monarchist ideas, argued that the Carlotist project would be the most practical means of achieving independence from Spain in the circumstances. On September 20, 1808, Castelli wrote a letter to Charlotte, with the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> Antonio Beruti, Hipólito Vieytes, Belgrano, and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña.|$|E

5|$|In years since, <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> water {{have been}} found to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the {{bistatic}} radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
5|$|On June 3, 2013, BFDF {{turned in}} over 16,000 {{signatures}} petitioning to recall Morse to the Colorado Secretary of State, Republican Scott Gessler, of which only 7,178 {{needed to be}} certified in order to force a recall election. In addition, over 13,000 signatures were turned in to recall Giron, of which 11,285 needed to be certified. Efforts to recall McLachlan failed, collecting only about 8,500 <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> the 10,587 needed. Likewise, the efforts to recall Hudak also failed, falling short of the 18,962 signatures needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus may {{be capable of}} {{producing}} lightning. The existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. In 2006–07, Venus Express clearly detected whistler mode waves, the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is {{at least half of}} that on Earth. In 2007, Venus Express discovered that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole.|$|E

5|$|This {{park was}} {{constructed}} {{to commemorate the}} official joining of Ikata to her Sister City of Red Wing, Minnesota, after which it is named. Of note is the 21-meter stainless-steel monument located {{at the entrance of}} the park, a twin sister of the one in Bay Point Park, Red Wing. Beneath the monument lies a commemorative stone plaque bearing the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> each of the mayors at the time. It is home to Adventure Hill—a playground full of climbing nets, roller slides, and other children's play equipment. The park is free and open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there {{was less than a}} 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E
