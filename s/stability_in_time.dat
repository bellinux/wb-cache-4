Almost sufficient and necessary conditions for <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> average and extinction of each population are established under some assumptions. And two facts are revealed: both <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> average and extinction have closer {{relationships with the}} general Lévy jumps, firstly; and secondly, the distributed delay {{has no effect on}} the <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> average and extinction of the stochastic system.

Solid magnetic nanoparticles are adsorbed strongly at the oil-water interface {{and are able to}} stabilize emulsions of oil and water. In this work emulsions stabilized by magnetite nanoparticles were obtained using high-energy ultrasound waves and a cavitation mechanism and, next, their <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> was tested by means of acoustic waves with a low energy, without affecting the structure. An acoustic study showed high <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> of magnetic emulsions stabilized by magnetite particles.

In 1999 the essential ambivalence and uncertainty which have come to characterise the process of European integration have been all too apparent.

Using {{the white}} noise setting, in {{particular}} the Wick product, the Hermite transform, and the Kondratiev space, we present {{a new approach to}} study linear stochastic systems, where randomness is also included in the transfer function.

We also consider the case of dissipative systems for both discrete and continuous time systems.

The frequently used ex situ and the rarely used in situ build-up methods were compared. Important aspects of the industrial applicability of these films, their <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> and possible differences in their morphology were investigated. The films revealed a granular pattern, with grain diameters of 270 (87 nm for glass (up to 8 bilayers) and 303 (89 nm for titanium (up to 10 bilayers), independently of the build-up procedure.

40|$|Central European {{countries}} {{have achieved a}} remarkable performance in restructuring their production sector toward world markets. It {{could not have been}} successful without relative macroeconomic <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of recurrent financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. The most crucial factor has been a sustained inflow of foreign direct investment and a correlative limitation of foreign indebtedness. Eschewing excessive exposure to hot money has permitted governments to adjust their exchange rates away from the extremes of hard peg and pure floating. Consequently monetary policy has been able to strike a workable balance between the objectives of fostering competitiveness and reducing inflation steadily. This experience provides strong evidence for intermediary exchange rate regimes against so-called corner solutions. However these regimes are softer than formal target zones. For ceec they require either adaptation to the convergence criteria or delayed entry into emu. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that strong domestic financial systems {{play an important role}} in attaining overall economic development and stabilization. The role played by foreign banks in achieving this goal, however, is still controversial. This article brings new evidence to the debate over foreign participation by examining the lending patterns of domestic and foreign banks in Argentina and Mexico during the 1990 s. The authors conclude that foreign banks in both countries typically have stronger and less volatile loan growth than their domestic counterparts. The corollary to this finding, however, is that bank health—not ownership per se—is the critical element in the growth, volatility, and cyclicality of bank credit. Still, diversity of ownership is found to contribute to greater credit <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of financial system turmoil and weakness.

Consider a partitioning of the complex plane C into two disjoint sets C g and C b such that C g is open, i. e., C = C g [C b. A matrix is called C g -stable if its spectrum (:) is contained in C g.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss a family of fully {{discrete}} velocity-correction methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These schemes, like classical pressure-correction methods, allow to segregate the calculation of the velocity from that of the pressure. The key point is that the velocity in one time step is extrapolated from previous velocities, a pressure is then computed and finally the velocity is updated. We discuss the <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> of some schemes of this type, as well as their space stabilized version to allow equal velocity-pressure interpolations and convection dominated flows. ...|$|E
