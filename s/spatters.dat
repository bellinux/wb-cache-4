50|$|A <b>spatter</b> cone is a low, steep-sided hill or mound that {{consists}} of welded lava fragments, called <b>spatter,</b> which has formed around a lava fountain issuing from a central vent. Typically, <b>spatter</b> cones are about 3-5 m high. In case of a linear fissure, lava fountaining will create broad embankments of <b>spatter,</b> called <b>spatter</b> ramparts, along {{both sides of the}} fissure. <b>Spatter</b> cones are more circular and cone shaped, while <b>spatter</b> ramparts are linear wall-like features.|$|R

50|$|<b>Spatter</b> cones and <b>spatter</b> ramparts are {{typically}} formed by lava fountaining associated with mafic, highly fluid lavas, {{such as those}} erupted in the Hawaiian Islands. As blobs of molten lava, <b>spatter,</b> are erupted into the air by a lava fountain, they can lack {{the time needed to}} cool completely before hitting the ground. Consequently, the <b>spatter</b> are not fully solid, like taffy, as they land and they bind to the underlying <b>spatter</b> as both often slowly ooze {{down the side of the}} cone. As a result, the <b>spatter</b> builds up a cone that is composed of <b>spatter</b> either agglutinated or welded to each other.|$|R
500|$|When Lester {{is caught}} masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about {{their lack of}} {{intimacy}} {{is the first time}} he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's [...] "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to [...] "regain a voice in a home that [...] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when [...] Angela and he almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and [...] "wraps her up". Mendes called it [...] "the most satisfying end to [...] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a [...] "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks [...] "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood <b>spatters</b> as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is [...] "the culmination of the theme" [...] of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.|$|E
500|$|According to Patti Bellantoni, {{colors are}} used symbolically {{throughout}} the film, none {{more so than}} red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and [...] " [...] Lester's arc". First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality. The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a [...] "façade for suburban success". Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they signify [...] "a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality". Carolyn feels that [...] "as long as there can be roses, all is well". She cuts the roses and puts them in vases, where they adorn her [...] "meretricious vision of what makes for beauty" [...] and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela–Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses—and thus Carolyn—out of the shot. Lester's epiphany {{at the end of}} the film is expressed by rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels. The constant use of red [...] "lulls [...] subliminally" [...] into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood <b>spatters</b> on the wall.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving <b>spatters</b> of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a mist of red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror at her reflection and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball.|$|E

The metal {{transfer}} behaviors of basic flux cored wire at different arc voltage and welding current {{and the resultant}} welding <b>spatter</b> were investigated by using a high speed camera.

Similar to <b>spatter</b> cones, Hornitos are rootless, meaning they form {{on the surface of}} lava flows like <b>spatter</b> cones.

40|$|Violent crimes often {{result in}} blood-shed events {{associated}} with blood <b>spatter.</b> Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) {{serves as a}} good tool and effective approach to reconstruct the events that occur in a crime scene. Among other bloodstain patterns, impact <b>spatter</b> patterns are commonly found at crime scenes. An impact pattern {{is formed as a}} result of an impact force striking an exposed blood source and can be described as a radiating pattern of small individual drops. In most cases of BPA, the reconstruction of the events taken place involve investigating the blood drop flight dynamics and the mechanics of impact <b>spatter</b> generation to determine the origin of the impact. Thus, the discipline of Fluid Dynamics (FD) is also involved in most BPA cases. However, in the cases of multiple impact <b>spatter</b> generation events within a crime scene, it complicates the interpretation and analysis of the impact <b>spatter</b> pattern. There are many variables of blood drop flight dynamics and mechanisms of impact <b>spatter</b> generation in which a blood drop is exposed to and generated from. The variables of blood drop flight dynamics such as drop deformations/oscillations, breakup, diameter with respect to velocity and air/wind currents do affect a drop while in flight which may alter the trajectory curvature of a blood drop. However, it is relatively unknown in scientific literature how the variables of impact <b>spatter</b> generation setup such as the height of the blood source and impact force applied would affect the horizontal distance travelled by a blood drop generated from an impact <b>spatter.</b> Theoretically, there is also limited literature with regards to the correlation of blood drop flight dynamics to maximum horizontal distance travelled by blood drop. This literature review aims to address the effect of blood drop flight dynamics and the mechanisms of impact <b>spatter</b> generation setup have on the maximum horizontal distance travelled by a blood drop. The purpose of this literature review is to dictate parameters for potential research that may aid in answering the investigative question...|$|R

The breadth of sands has a various aspect, according as there are pools, or moisture enough to glisten, or a drier tract; and where the light gleams along a yellow ridge or bar, it is like sunshine itself. Certainly the temper of the day shifts; but the smiles come far the seldomest, and its frowns and angry tears are most reliable. By seven o'clock pedestrians began to walk along the promenade, close buttoned against the blast; later, a single bathing-machine got under way, by means of a horse, and travelled forth seaward; but within what distance it finds the invisible margin I cannot say,--at all events, it looks like a dreary journey.
