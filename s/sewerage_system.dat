MWSS was privatized in 1997, which split the water concession into {{the east and west}} zones. The Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part. It now provides the supply and delivery of potable water and <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> in Manila, but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water.

5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks.

5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E

5|$|In August 1849 the MCS {{appointed}} Joseph Bazalgette to {{the position}} of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the railway industry until overwork had brought about a serious breakdown in his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position was too much for Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans {{for the development of the}} <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> The Metropolis Management Act 1855 replaced the commission with the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which took control of the sewers.|$|E
5|$|The Victoria Embankment is a {{road and}} river-walk {{on the north}} bank of the River Thames, formed from land {{reclaimed}} during the construction of Joseph Bazalgette's <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> in the late 19th century.

Running from north-east to south-west these are called Temple Gardens, the Main Garden, the Whitehall Garden and finally the Ministry of Defence section; the last of these was laid out in 1939–1959. All four gardens contain works of commemorative sculpture and further memorials are located on the river-walk or road itself, making the Embankment {{one of the main}} sites for commemoration in London.

25|$|From {{as early}} as 1535 there were efforts to stop polluting the River Thames in London. Beginning with an Act passed that year that was to {{prohibit}} the dumping of excrement into the river. Leading up to the Industrial Revolution the River Thames was identified as being thick and black due to sewage, and it was even said that the river “smells like death.” As Britain was the first country to industrialize, {{it was also the}} first to experience the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and was the first to construct a modern <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. During the early 19th century, the River Thames was effectively an open sewer, leading to frequent outbreaks of cholera epidemics. Proposals to modernise the <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> had been made during 1856, but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament realised the urgency of the problem and resolved to create a modern <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
