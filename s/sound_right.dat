500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony?

500|$|Because of his {{motor neurone}} disease, Hawking {{is unable to}} speak, and he {{communicates}} using a custom-made computer. With small movements of his body, Hawking writes a text onto the computer, which is then spoken by a voice syntheziser.

[...] "It's easy to do a fake Stephen Hawking in your comedy TV show", Selman said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "Any computer can sound just like his computer, but every line that we wrote for him, he typed in himself and we recorded with our microphones as if it had come out of a regular mouth."

[...] Andy Hermann of PopMatters viewed Black Cherry as [...] "a weird, edgy album, {{the work of}} two doggedly {{maverick}} talents chasing their muses wherever they take them". Wes May of About.com dubbed it a [...] "rare electronica album of warmth and depth" [...] and {{found it to be}} [...] "the ultimate chillout pleasure". Drowned in Sound's Gen Williams expressed that the album's [...] "crystalline, neon-edged beauty, its pulsing army of beats and Alison's lush, lethargically versatile vocals, swinging between sultry and seraphic throughout, make it—for now at least—a largely satisfying record that indicates imminent and deserved success for Goldfrapp." [...] In a mixed review, Heather Phares of AllMusic commended Goldfrapp for their [...] "artistic risk-taking", but felt that the album [...] "sounds unbalanced, swinging between delicate, deceptively icy ballads and heavier, dance-inspired numbers without finding much of a happy medium between them." [...] Michael Idov of Pitchfork criticised the duo's switch to electro music, while describing Black Cherry as [...] "a soundtrack to excruciatingly banal seduction".|$|E
500|$|Mahler made {{arrangements}} with the impresario Emil Gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in Munich {{in the autumn}} of 1910. He soon regretted this involvement, writing of his fears that Gutmann would turn the performance into [...] "a catastrophic Barnum and Bailey show". Preparations began early in the year, with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of Munich, Leipzig and Vienna. The Munich Zentral-Singschule provided 350 students for the children's choir. Meanwhile, Bruno Walter, Mahler's assistant at the Vienna Hofoper, was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists. Through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns, before assembling in Munich early in September for three full days of final rehearsals under Mahler. His youthful assistant Otto Klemperer remarked later on the many small changes that Mahler made to the score during rehearsal: [...] "He always wanted more clarity, more sound, more dynamic contrast. At one point during rehearsals he turned to us and said, 'If, after my death, something doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>right,</b> then change it. You have not only a right but a duty to do so.'" ...|$|E

A music video for this version was created by adding additional footage to the original video. It premiered on June 21, 2010.

This version featured Tinie Tempah and Tinchy Stryder in place of Minaj and Ross. It premiered on June 11, 2010 on Tim Westwood's Radio 1Xtra daytime show Westwood. It was released as track two on the UK Digital EP single, released June 20, 2010. A final remix was created after Diddy highlighted his intent to find a UK emcee to record {{a new version of the}} song with him. Skepta was chosen for the remix, which was released as the [...] "Official Grime Remix". It is the only remix which alters the song's production, and was released only in the UK, on August 12, 2010. A video for the grime remix was released on November 5, 2010. On January 5, 2010, MTV reported the emergence of a new remix of [...] "Hello Good Morning".

500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal <b>sound</b> <b>right,</b> which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Watermark firmly {{established}} Enya's sound of multi-layered vocals, keyboard sounds and influences of Celtic music. Enya {{felt the need}} to have layers of vocals to add a [...] "human element" [...] to her music as solely using keyboards and digital sampling sounded, to her, [...] "a bit linear and straight". The idea of the multi-vocals originate when Enya was a member of Clannad, her family's Celtic band, in the early 1980s. With Nicky as their manager, influenced by The Beach Boys and the [...] "wall of sound" [...] technique made famous by producer Phil Spector, the two often discussed the idea of layering Enya's voice to make it its own instrument. After experimenting with the concept on Enya the vocals became more established on Watermark, with as many as over 200 vocal tracks were painstakingly recorded for certain sections. In one instance, around 90 tracks had been put down during a period of several days but the two felt they did not <b>sound</b> <b>right,</b> so they erased them and started over. This was a case particularly during the recording of [...] "Miss Clare Remembers", a piano instrumental, when they experimented the idea of adding vocals but decided against keeping them.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the sheer}} size of Callas's instrument, Celletti says, [...] "Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it {{frequently}} contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium." [...] Rodolfo Celletti wrote that Callas had [...] "a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice" [...] ("una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that [...] "she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience." [...] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, [...] "But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, {{at the bottom of the}} range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big <b>sound</b> <b>right</b> up to the top." [...] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a [...] "dramatic soprano with an exceptional top", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a [...] "huge soprano leggiero".|$|E
2500|$|Halfway to Sanity {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. When {{it was released}} in September 1987, the New York Post praised it to be another well pieced album by the Ramones, and Billboard exclaimed that Sire should have released [...] "Go Lil' Camaro Go" [...] as a single. However, in the United Kingdom, the album received virtually no attention from professional critics. Ramones Fanzine writer Mark Bannister explained {{that the reason for}} the silent press in the United Kingdom was that the album [...] "didn't <b>sound</b> <b>right</b> without some more of Joey's songs to balance out Dee Dee's. There was no equilibrium." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album one and a half out of five stars, saying that although it remains similar to Animal Boy in that it features the use of heavy guitars, but asserted that it is [...] "much sharper record" [...] only because it did not overlook the band's [...] "trashy pop roots." [...] He pointed out that their musical style was inconsistent, going on to say that the band could have went about their second decade of music making [...] "more gracefully" [...] but concluded by saying that although it was not as [...] "strong" [...] as 1983's Subterranean Jungle or 1984's Too Tough to Die, it was the last release where the band actually [...] "sounded like they mattered." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote a shorter review, where he states: [...] "It kills me to say this, but with Richie or whoever on the lam, Dee Dee moonlighting as a punk-rapper, Joey frequenting all-acoustic showcases, and Johnny Johnny, a great band has finally worn down into a day job for night people." ...|$|E
