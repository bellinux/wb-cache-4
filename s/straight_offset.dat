40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present {{numerical}} results for vortex tube reconnection for three different initial configurations: (i) initially <b>straight</b> orthogonally <b>offset</b> tubes, (ii) initially parallel counter-rotating vortices that are sinusoidally perturbed, and (iii) reconnecting vortex rings. Our {{aim is to}} detect some universal mechanism for core reconnection. The mixing of the fluid by the reconnection process is demonstrated by tracing passive markers placed initially near the vortex tubes involved in reconnection. For these numerical simulations we use the 3 D vortex–in–cell (VIC) method. In order to overcome {{the problem of the}} large time required for single- processor calculations, we constructed a numerical code for the multiprocessor environment of a graphics card. We show that the VIC method is very well suited for parallel computation. We carefully tested the method by comparing the numerical results with theoretical results (for motion of a vortex ring and other published results). The computational speed obtained was nearly 50 times greater than for a single processor...|$|R
5000|$|A scythe {{consists}} of a shaft about 170 cm long called a snaith, snath, snathe or sned, traditionally made of wood but now sometimes metal. Simple snaiths are <b>straight</b> with <b>offset</b> handles, others have an [...] "S" [...] curve or are steam bent in three dimensions to place the handles in an ergonomic configuration but close to shaft. The snaith has either one or two short handles {{at right angles to}} it, usually one near the upper end and always another roughly in the middle. The handles are usually adjustable to suit the user. A curved, steel blade between 60 to 90 cm) long is mounted at the lower end at 90°, or less, to the snaith. Scythes almost always have the blade projecting from {{the left side of the}} snaith when in use, with the edge towards the mower; left-handed scythes are made but cannot be used together with right-handed scythes as the left-handed mower would be mowing in the opposite direction and could not mow in a team.|$|R

Developed in an experiment pool-type fishway prototype and including fish of different sizes, this study investigates: i) the efficiency of passage through submerged orifices or notches; ii) the effect of velocity, turbulence and Reynolds shear stress on this species’ behaviour; iii) the suitability of <b>straight</b> and <b>offset</b> orifices to fish’s passage and, finally, iv) the efficiency of <b>offset</b> and <b>straight</b> orifices with a deflector bar for this specimens’ movements. The fishways {{was found to be}} efficient to the upstream passage of this species. Submerged orifices were preferentially used by specimens, mainly by small fish which, although their higher rheotatic capacity, showed strong difficulties to pass through the fishway. The behaviour of the latter was also the most affected by turbulence and Reynolds shear stress, which seemed to be the variables affecting fish’ movements the most. Straight orifices were found not be adequate to fish passage, even when added of a deflector bar. The results are discussed in terms of future research delineation...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{odd number}} of {{cylinders}} in each bank, V6 designs are inherently unbalanced, regardless of their V-angle. All straight engines with an odd {{number of cylinders}} suffer from primary dynamic imbalance, which causes an end-to-end rocking motion. Each cylinder bank in a V6 has an odd number of cylinders, so the V6 also suffers from the same problem unless steps are taken to mitigate it. In the horizontally opposed flat-6 layout, the rocking motions of the two <b>straight</b> cylinder banks <b>offset</b> each other, while in the inline-6 layout, the two ends of engine are mirror images {{of each other and}} compensate every rocking motion. Concentrating on the first order rocking motion, the V6 can be assumed to consist of two separate straight-3 where counterweights on the crankshaft and a counter rotating balance shaft compensate the first order rocking motion.|$|R

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) A vernier offset is detected at once among straight lines, and reaction times are almost {{independent of the}} number of simultaneously presented stimuli (distractors), even if absolute orientation cues are masked by varied orientation of the verniers. This result implies that the human visual system processes vernier offsets in parallel. Reaction times for identifying one <b>straight</b> target among <b>offset</b> verniers, on the other hand, increase with the number of stimuli. The same is true for the identification of a vernier offset to one side among verniers offset to the opposite side, if absolute orientation cues are masked. These tasks require serial or semi-parallel processing. Chevrons and curved targets show the same pattern of results. Even deviations below a photoreceptor diameter can be detected at once. The visual system thus attains positional accuracy below the photoreceptor (continued on back) 14. SUBiECT TERMS (key words) 15.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) Young male {{engineering and}} science students were selected as subjects after being tested on Guilford-Zimmerman battery of Perceptual Speed (scores greater then 45) and Visual Orientation (scores greater than 25), Witkin's Group of Embedded Figures test (scores greater than 10), and for visual acuity. In this study visual acuity could {{be met with}} wearing of eye glasses, otherwise the above criteria were identical to selection criteria for the USAF. The test task required subjects to judge when a parallelogram and a trapezoidal shape were horizontal in an impoverished visual environment. The shapes provided were scaled to simulate carrier deck outlines at ranges of 1, 3 / 4, and 1 / 2 miles and glide slopes of 3. 5, 4. 0 ??, and 4. 5 ??. All presentations were made with the decks offered either <b>straight</b> ahead or <b>offset</b> 10 ?? to the simulated flight path. The main effects of range and deck shape {{were found to be}} significant. The results obtained with the trapezoidal deck were found to have less error than those obtained from the rectangular deck especially at the closer ranges...|$|R
50|$|The Mount Panorama Circuit {{was opened}} in 1938, and first {{used for the}} 1938 Australian Grand Prix. The track follows public roads and {{is known for its}} 174-metre {{difference}} between its highest and lowest points. The first turn, Hell Corner, is a ninety-degree left-hander. Mountain Straight, a gentle climb where the cars reach speeds of 255 km/h, leads into Griffin's Bend, an off-camber right-hander which then leads into The Cutting, a sharp left-hander with a steep incline. Reid Park follows, a complex corner where a number of drivers have spun after not short shifting at the apex. The course continues down to Sulman Park and McPhillamy Park. Drivers are unable to see the descending road and enter Skyline and the first of The Esses at 220 km/h before The Dipper, {{one of the most famous}} corners in Australian motorsport. Cars then negotiate Forrest's Elbow before powering down Conrod Straight, the fastest section of the track where cars can reach 300 km/h. The Chase is a long sweeping chicane where cars are on the rev limiter turning at 300 km/h before a large braking zone to exit at 130 km/h. Murray's is the 23rd and final turn, and also the slowest part of the circuit, before cars return to the start-finish straight. The start-finish <b>straight</b> features an <b>offset</b> start, with the finish line towards the back of the starting grid closer to Murray's Corner.|$|R
40|$|Continued {{progress}} to reduce fan noise emission from high bypass ratio engine ducts in aircraft increasingly relies on accurate {{description of the}} sound propagation in the duct. A project has been undertaken at NASA Langley Research Center to investigate the propagation of higher order modes in ducts with flow. This is a two-pronged approach, including development of analytic models (the subject of a separate paper) and installation of a laboratory-quality test rig. The purposes of the rig are to validate the analytical models and to evaluate novel duct acoustic liner concepts, both passive and active. The dimensions of the experimental rig test section scale to between 25 % and 50 % of the aft bypass ducts of most modern engines. The duct is of rectangular cross section so as to provide flexibility {{to design and fabricate}} test duct liner samples. The test section can accommodate flow paths that are <b>straight</b> through or <b>offset</b> from inlet to discharge, the latter design allowing investigation of the effect of curvature on sound propagation and duct liner performance. The maximum air flow rate through the duct is Mach 0. 3. Sound in the duct is generated by an array of 16 high-intensity acoustic drivers. The signals to the loudspeaker array are generated by a multi-input/multi-output feedforward control system that has been developed for this project. The sound is sampled by arrays of flush-mounted microphones and a modal decomposition is performed at the frequency of sound generation. The data acquisition system consists of two arrays of flush-mounted microphones, one upstream of the test section and one downstream. Th...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBy scaled {{physical}} modelling, we {{have investigated}} the mechanical response to gravitational forces in an oceanic lithosphere, overlying a less dense asthenosphere. In the models, an upper wedge-shaped layer of sand represented an oceanic lithosphere (0 ­ 35 Ma old, with a half-spreading velocity of 3 cm/yr), and a lower layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), mixed with dense wolframite powder, represented the asthenosphere. In the models, as in nature, isostatic compensation resulted in uplift of ridges and subsidence on their flanks. The resulting relief was responsible for ridge push. We tested two main configurations: <b>straight</b> ridges and <b>offset</b> ridges. In all the models, ridge push was sufficient to cause plate motion, underlying advection, and symmetrical rifting at the ridge axis. There {{was no need to}} impose plate motions through external pistons and motors. In models of straight ridges, the style of normal faults in the axial rift zone depended on the local thickness of the brittle sand layer. For thick layers, normal faults rafted out from the active zone of rifting, creating a fossil topography of tilted blocks, between faults dipping toward the ridge. In a model of an offset ridge, with thin lithosphere at the ridge crest and no embedded weakness, ridge push was responsible for a short transform fault, linking en-échelon rifts. In a similar model, but with thick lithosphere, an oblique rift formed at about 20 ° to the offset trace. We conclude that ridge push was not adequate to create an ideal transform fault. In a model of an offset ridge, with an embedded thin vertical layer of pure PDMS at 90 ° to the ridge, transform motion concentrated along this weak layer, and the resulting structural style was very similar to that in nature. On the basis of these results, we infer that, in nature, (1) ridge push can indeed drive plate motion, and (2) ridge push can drive strike-slip motion on transform faults, provided that these are weaker than the adjacent oceanic lithosphere and that they form early in the history of spreading...|$|R
