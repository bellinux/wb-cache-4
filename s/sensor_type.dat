She was {{originally}} from Kusagakure and later another unnamed village, but after the latter was destroyed she was taken in by Orochimaru, eventually becoming a loyal servant to him. After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side. Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she seemingly moved on from Sasuke and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter Sarada. Karin is a <b>Sensor</b> <b>Type,</b> able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing Naruto's chakra as [...] "bright and warm". She also can heal people if they bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks all over her body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by Kanako Tōjō up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over. In English, she is voiced by Ali Hillis except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where she is voiced by Michelle Ruff.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{software}} platform {{that aims to}} be flexible and extensible, receiving data from a variable range of <b>sensor</b> <b>types,</b> dynamically attached to subsea measuring stations. Unlike most existing solutions the platform {{is designed to be}} neither data-centric nor visualisation-centric, but seamlessly integrates both, management and visualisation, of measurement data. The modular software platform can be extended by plugins, which are used to provide support for additional <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> and visualisations, as well as extend existing platform functions. A description mechanism for <b>sensor</b> <b>types,</b> measurands and visualisations enables automated selection of visualisations appropriate for displaying certain types of measurement data. This approach ensures that important data is displayed in an effective manner when it is needed and reduces configuration efforts that would otherwise be spent by the user to set up the monitoring environment...|$|R

50|$|The {{two major}} types of digital image sensor are CCD and CMOS. A CCD sensor has one {{amplifier}} {{for all the}} pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS active-pixel sensor has its own amplifier. Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power. Cameras with a small sensor use a back-side-illuminated CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. Overall final image quality is more dependent on the image processing capability of the camera, than on <b>sensor</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E

The 4.0L engines {{as used in}} the 1990-1994 XJ40 cars continued with the crank sensor and empty distributor type of ignition system and the hot-wire Mass Air Flow <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> of fuel injection control system as the 1988-1989 3.6L XJ40 cars.|$|E
50|$|In late December 1975, the 7405th flew {{its last}} EC-97G mission from Wiesbaden Air Base when the USAF turned the base {{over to the}} United States Army and moved its {{operations}} to Rhein-Main AB. There, redesignated as the 7405th Operations Squadron, it acquired three heavily modified C-130E Hercules, airlifters in name only. By this time, technology improvements were such that each aircraft could carry a variety of sensors with advanced capabilities. Thus, if one <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> detected a new and unusual activity, the aircrew could almost instantly bring other sensors to bear on it. This ability provided lucrative intelligence time and time again.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} an {{overview}} is given over condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM) for offshore wind turbines {{with a special}} focus on two innovative <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> – Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) and Microelectromechnical Systems (MEMS) sensors. Based on a limited literature survey and interviews with wind turbine operators {{the state of the}} art and the future needs in this field are assessed for CM and SHM. A short overview is given over different concepts using FBGs for composite material monitoring and for other CM applications. MEMS sensors are described and some available sensors are shown as well as concepts for (e. g. wireless) networks of such sensors for CM and SHM. The need for remote presence and cost-effective operations is a strong case for systems including CM and SHM. Thus the need for new <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> is widely considered to be a key to future off-shore wind energy harvesting. In conclusion an outlook is given on future work including the assessment of such <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> in test structures and real life application tests...|$|R

The aim of this international project is to develop a smart hybrid gas multi-sensor module for environmental applications, i. e., by combining classical thick- and thin-film elements with polymer-film based sensors and also a signal processing ASIC within a single package, which should be useful for all <b>sensor</b> <b>types.</b> The module can be used for multi-sensor operation when connected to an intelligent signal-processing unit...|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} for the non-linear characteristics and inability to detect the polarity of a magnetic field, the following structure is used for sensors. It consists of stripes of aluminum or gold placed on a thin film of permalloy (a ferromagnetic material exhibiting the AMR effect) inclined at an angle of 45°. This structure forces the current not to flow along the “easy axes” of thin film, but at an angle of 45°. The dependence of resistance now has a permanent offset which is linear around the null point. Because of its appearance, this <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> is called 'barber pole'.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{resonance}} technology enables measurement {{within a}} small cavity, the sensors therefore {{tend to be}} typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity {{and the fact that}} it does not require re-calibrating once installed.|$|E
5000|$|The C.I.P. almost {{exclusively}} uses {{one type of}} Piezoelectric sensor (called a [...] "channel sensor") made by the Swiss company Kistler that require drilling of the cartridge case before firing the proofing cartridge in a specially made test barrel. SAAMI uses another type of Piezoelectric sensor (called a [...] "conformal transducer") that conforms to the contours of individual chambers and that therefore does not require prior drilling of the cartridge case. These are mostly made by the US company, PCB Piezotronics. Conformal Piezo transducers are more expensive to use because every different chamber wall shape requires a separate transducer whose piston matches that wall contour at the pressure sampling hole location. The channel <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> is more economical to own because each sensor may be moved between all chambers that have the same size sample hole, {{of which there are}} only two.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Chinese <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> used for terrestrial remote sensing has necessitated an additional effort to evaluate and standardize the data they acquire. In this study, we assessed the potential use of GF- 1 WFV (Wild Field Camera), ZY- 3 MUX (Multi-spectral camera), and HJ- 1 CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensor data for grassland monitoring by comparing spectral field measurements, vegetation coverage, and the leaf area index (LAI) of grassland stands with reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Based on spectral field measurements, the characteristic differences of spectral response functions of the sensors were analyzed. Based on simulations using the SAIL bidirectional canopy reflectance model coupled with the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model (PROSAIL), we investigated the effects {{of changes in the}} sensors’ zenith angle caused by side sway. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) Differences in the adjusted coefficients of determination (R 2) exist when comparing correlations between the reflectances from the three <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> in different bands. The values of R 2 are 0. 556 – 0. 893 and 0. 819 – 0. 850 for the infrared and red bands, respectively, and these data show a better correlation for the red band than for the infrared band. Fitted slope equations revealed inconsistencies in the data between the different <b>sensor</b> <b>types.</b> In the red band, GF- 1 WFV and HJ- 1 CCD data are the most consistent, but in the near-infrared band, GF- 1 WFV and ZY- 3 MUX data are the most consistent; (2) The correlation of NDVIs obtained from the different <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> is high (R 2 between 0. 758 and 0. 852); however, the consistency is low in that the NDVI based on GF- 1 WFV data is significantly higher than that based on ZY- 3 MUX and HJ- 1 CCD data. In contrast, the mean difference is small between the NDVIs based on ZY- 3 MUX and HJ- 1 CCD; (3) Correlation analysis between ground grass-coverage and measured LAI data shows that the three <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> are better at estimating coverage than the LAI, and that the GF- 1 WFV sensor gave the best performance; (4) Changes in the sensors’ zenith angle caused by side sway were proven to have greater impact on reflectance and NDVI than the spectral response function; (5) For LAI values of 0 – 3, the NDVI changes significantly with increasing LAI, and differences between the three <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> are obvious. For LAI > 3. 5, the NDVI appears to experience a saturated tendency, which greatly reduces the differences between the sensors...|$|R

5000|$|Non-Intrusive Stress Measurement (System) (NSMS) is {{a method}} for {{determining}} dynamic blade stresses in rotating turbomachinery. NSMS is also known by the names [...] "Blade Tip Timing" [...] (BTT), [...] "Arrival Time Analysis" [...] (ATA), [...] "Blade Vibration Monitoring" [...] (BVM) Beruehrungslose Schaufel Schwingungsmessung (BSSM), and [...] "Blade Health Monitoring" [...] (BHM). NSMS uses externally mounted sensors to determine the passing times of turbomachinery blades. The passing times after conversion to deflections, {{can be used to}} measure each blade’s vibratory response characteristics such as amplitude/stress, phase, frequency, and damping. Since every blade is measured, stage effects such as flutter, blade mistuning, and nodal diameter can also be characterized.The measurement method has been used successfully in all stages of the gas turbine engine (fan, compressor, and turbine) and on other turbo-machinery equipment ranging from turbo chargers to rocket pumps. The ability to apply the technology to a given situation is dependent upon a <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> that can meet the environmental requirements.|$|E

The advantage of trimaran include stability and high speed in rough seas, and large deck area equivalent to much larger ship, thus enabling small ship to carry helicopter {{that can only be}} carried by larger ships in traditional monohull design. Designed by the Multihull Ship Technology National Defense Important Academic Majors Laboratory (多体船技术国防重点学科实验室) of Harbin Engineering University, Type 917 carries a pair of newly designed rescue boat, with one on each side, stored in the davit position. The ship is equipped with a newly designed H/PJ14 single 30 mm gun controlled by electro-optical <b>sensor.</b> <b>Type</b> 917 series in PLAN service are designated by a combination of two Chinese characters followed by three-digit number. The second Chinese character is Jiu (救), meaning rescue in Chinese, because these ships are classified as rescue ship. The first Chinese character denotes which fleet the ship is service with, with East (Dong, 东) for East Sea Fleet, North (Bei, 北) for North Sea Fleet, and South (Nan, 南) for South Sea Fleet. However, the pennant numbers may have changed due to the change of Chinese naval ships naming convention.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), {{with the}} {{cooperation}} of 14 other Federal agencies, has proposed a quality assurance plan for acquiring digital imagery in the United States. This plan is a result of cooperative work with sensor manufacturers, data providers, and the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS). The plan identifies four key components affecting quality when acquiring digital imagery. The four components are 1) <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification, 2) data provider certification, 3) contracting guidelines for procuring digital imagery, and 4) quality assessment guidelines. The implementation details in each component are still being developed and will be further refined; however, the <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification component is the most mature and four key digital aerial sensors systems have completed certification. The <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification process is being further refined 1 through the lessons learned from the initial certifications and certification documentation has been updated. Currently, the <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification approval is being considered as a requirement for procurements for use by officials in the United States.
