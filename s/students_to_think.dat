5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her <b>students,</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E

25|$|Students {{with genuine}} {{difficulties}} (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with basic facts, answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor number sense and have poor short-term memory.

25|$|Matisse was {{recognised}} as {{a leader}} of the Fauves, along with André Derain; the two were friendly rivals, each with his own followers. Other members were Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and Maurice de Vlaminck. The Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826–1898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he pushed his <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.|$|E
25|$|Many sports popular {{today were}} formalised by British Public schools and {{universities}} in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and act {{as part of a}} team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.|$|E
25|$|A {{key part}} of the Scripps {{experience}} is the Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Studies, a sequence of three classes that encourage <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> critically and challenge ideas. Every first-year student takes Core I in the fall, which introduces students to major ideas that shape the modern world. Core II seminars focus on specific ideas introduced in Core I and are usually team-taught by two professors in different fields, such as physics and art. The concluding Core III classes encourage discussion and critical thinking for first-semester sophomores, culminating in individual projects that often lead to students' senior thesis or project.|$|E

Business simulation is a teaching method that can assist in developing a learning environment, which exposes <b>students</b> <b>to</b> complex situations that needs strategic decision- making. At Faculty of Economics and Business UKM, business simulation has been integrated in strategic management course as a platform for <b>students</b> <b>to</b> make management decision in a dynamic environment. A study on 120 students had been conducted to measure {{the effectiveness of the}} simulation on a longitudinal basis. Our findings show that some learning occurred in problem solving, financial management, and production management and marketing management fields.

25|$|These {{classes are}} {{generally}} organized {{so that students}} {{have the opportunity to}} choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, {{beginning}} a {{reform of the}} institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about military history by asking {{what they would have}} done in the place of the commanders. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, but this is not corroborated by Wilson’s diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.|$|E

500|$|In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, {{starting}} {{a period where}} natural sciences were esteemed. Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various {{places in the world}} to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his [...] "apostles". His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him.

In preparation for the hearing, Eddy organized a 24-hour watch at 8 Broad Street, during which she asked 12 <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about Spofford for two hours each and block malicious mesmerism from him.
