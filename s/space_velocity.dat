5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> of 16.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this system {{can be used to}} compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The {{combination of}} these two motions gives a <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> {{of the star}} relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, {{it has been found}} that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E
40|$|A sample {{containing}} 4 614 {{stars with}} available <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> and high-quality kinematical {{data from the}} Arihip Catalogue is formed. For the purpose of distinguishing galactic subsystems the cumulative distribution of <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> is studied. The fractions of the three subsystems are found to be: thin disc 92 %, thick disc 6 % and halo 2 %. These results are verified by analyzing the elements of velocity ellipsoids and the shape {{and size of the}} galactocentric orbits of the sample stars, i. e. the planar and vertical eccentricities of the orbits...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the expected <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> and misalignment angles of the eccentric binary pulsars {{for a range}} of possible progenitor systems and natal kick models. In particular, the effect of the orbital separation at the instant of supernova is discussed. The results of our simulations, combined with recent proper-motion and misalignment angle measurements, lead us to conclude that, although the known systems generally provide evidence for asymmetric supernovae, none of the proposed natal kick velocity distributions are adequate. Instead, we find that while kicks are required to explain the <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> of J 0045 - 7319 and B 1259 - 63, a slow kick velocity distribution with &# 0963; = 0 km s - 1 and &# 0956; = 50 km s- 1 predicts <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> that demonstrate the best agreement with observation. The expected misalignment angle distributions for B 1534 + 12, J 0045 - 7319, and B 1259 - 63 favor larger kicks but do not preclude a slow kick velocity distribution. Such a model is, however, inconsistent with the large kicks usually invoked to explain the velocities of single pulsars. We discuss possible means to reconcile the <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> of eccentric binary pulsars and the velocity distribution of the pulsar population. These include constraining the progenitor systems of binary pulsars to preclude tight post-common-envelope systems and erroneous pulsar velocity measurements due to an inaccurate distance model...|$|R

5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E

40|$|Although {{magnetic}} fields {{have been discovered}} in ten massive O-type stars during the last years, the origin of their {{magnetic fields}} remains unknown. Among the magnetic O-type stars, two stars, HD 36879 and HD 57682, were identified as candidate runaway stars in the past, and theta^ 1 Ori C was reported to move rapidly away from its host cluster. We search for {{an explanation for the}} occurrence of magnetic fields in O-type stars by examining the assumption of their runaway status. We use the currently best available astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric data to calculate the kinematical status of seven magnetic O-type stars with previously unknown <b>space</b> <b>velocities.</b> The results of the calculations of <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> suggest that five out of the seven magnetic O-type stars can be considered as candidate runaway stars. Only two stars, HD 155806 and HD 164794, with the lowest <b>space</b> <b>velocities,</b> are likely members of Sco OB 4 and NGC 6530, respectively. However, the non-thermal radio emitter HD 164794 is a binary system with colliding winds, for which the detected magnetic field has probably a different origin in comparison to other magnetic O-type stars.

40|$|We use astrometric, {{distance}} and spindown data on pulsars to: (1) estimate three-dimensional velocity components, birth distances from the galactic plane, and ages of individual objects; (2) determine {{the distribution of}} <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> and the scale height of pulsar progenitors; (3) test spindown laws for pulsars; (4) test for correlations between <b>space</b> <b>velocities</b> and other pulsar parameters; and (5) place empirical requirements on mechanisms than can produce high velocity neutron stars. Our approach incorporates measurement errors, uncertainties in distances, deceleration in the Galactic potential, and differential galactic rotation. We focus on a sample of proper motion measurements of young pulsars (< 10 Myr) whose trajectories may be accurately and simply modeled. This sample of 47 pulsars excludes millisecond pulsars and other objects that may have undergone accretion-driven spinup.
