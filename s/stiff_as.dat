5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly <b>stiff,</b> <b>as</b> {{it is to}} this day. Of course, I said {{as little as possible}} about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
25|$|Exoskeletons contain chitin; the {{addition}} of calcium carbonate makes them harder and stronger. Ingrowths of the arthropod exoskeleton known as apodemes serve as attachment sites for muscles. These structures are composed of chitin, and are approximately six times as strong and twice as <b>stiff</b> <b>as</b> vertebrate tendons. Similar to tendons, apodemes can stretch to store elastic energy for jumping, notably in locusts.|$|E

Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited {{to a sort of}} [...] "proto-down" [...] not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx: decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body—although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens—and the lower neck.|$|E

500|$|On 17 August 1696, 11-year-old Christian Shaw, the {{daughter}} of a local landowner, John Shaw of Bargarran, saw one of her family's servants, Catherine Campbell, steal a drink of milk. Shaw reported the theft to her mother, whereupon Campbell cursed her, wishing that the Devil would [...] "haul her soul through Hell". Four days later Shaw encountered Agnes Naismith, an old woman reputed to be a witch. The following day, 22 August, Shaw became violently ill with fits, similar to the symptoms reported a few years earlier in the American Salem witch trials of 1693. After eight weeks Shaw's parents took her to see the eminent Glasgow physician Matthew Brisbane, who could find no cause for her symptoms. For eight days after her visit Shaw seemed to have recovered, but then [...] "the fits returned with increased violence. She would become as <b>stiff</b> <b>as</b> a corpse and be senseless and motionless".|$|E
500|$|Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and <b>stiff</b> <b>as</b> the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) can {{modulate}} arterial stiffness by regulating both {{functional and}} structural {{changes in the}} arterial wall. Tissue transglutaminase (TG 2) {{has been shown to}} contribute to increased central aortic stiffness by catalyzing the cross-linking of matrix proteins. NO S-nitrosylates and constrains TG 2 to the cytosolic compartment and thereby holds its cross-linking function latent. In the present study, the role of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) -derived NO in regulating TG 2 function was studied using eNOS knockout mice. Matrix-associated TG 2 and TG 2 crosslinking function were higher, whereas TG 2 S-nitrosylation was lower in the eNOS-/- compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and blood pressure measured noninvasively were elevated in the eNOS-/- compared with WT mice. Intact aortas and decellularized aortic tissue scaffolds of eNOS-/- mice were significantly <b>stiffer,</b> <b>as</b> determined by tensile testing. The carotid arteries of the eNOS-/- mice were also <b>stiffer,</b> <b>as</b> determined by pressuredimension analysis. Invasive methods to determine the PWV-mean arterial pressure relationship showed that PWV in eNOS-/- and WT diverge at higher mean arterial pressure. Thus eNOS-derived NO regulates TG 2 localization and function and contributes to vascular stiffness...|$|R
2500|$|Kevlar, most {{commonly}} thought of in bullet-resistant vests, {{has become a}} common component of composite sticks. [...] Originally added to increase the durability of aluminium stick blades, it became an ideal addition to the more fragile wooden and carbon fiber sticks, and today it is a material used by many manufacturers. [...] Properties that make Kevlar an ideal strengthening material are its tendency not to shatter like carbon fiber. Kevlar will yield; stretch permanently without exploding when the yarn exceeds its maximum tensile strength. [...] However, Kevlar is not as <b>stiff</b> <b>as</b> carbon fiber, and does not attach as strongly to the epoxy resin in the manufacturing process as carbon fiber. [...] Price wise, Kevlar and Carbon Fiber are similar on a cost per yard basis.|$|E
2500|$|Van Swieten has not {{fared well}} in {{assessments}} {{of his personal}} demeanor. [...] In a frequently reprinted remark, Haydn remarked to Georg August Griesinger that van Swieten's symphonies were [...] "as <b>stiff</b> <b>as</b> the man himself." [...] He maintained a firm social distance {{between himself and the}} composers he patronized, a distance rooted in the system of aristocracy still in force in the Austria in his day. [...] Sigismund Neukomm wrote that he was [...] "not so much a friend as a very self-opinionated patron of Haydn and Mozart." [...] Olleson suggests that [...] "in his own time van Swieten won little affection" [...] (adding: [...] "but almost universal respect."). He also was not close to his fellow aristocrats; although his public roles in music and government were prominent, he avoided salon society, and after 1795 expressed content that he lived in [...] "complete retirement".|$|E
