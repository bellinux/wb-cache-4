5|$|The LSA aims {{to advance}} the {{scientific}} study of language and accomplishes this goal through advocacy efforts. The Society, recognizing its growing role in advocacy, established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in 1969 to better liaise between its membership and the government. Around that same time, the LSA began working with other professional organizations to meet and exchange research as part of the Consortium of <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> Associations (COSSA). During the Reagan administration after cuts to <b>social</b> <b>science</b> funding in 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded COSSA as an advocacy effort for the funding of <b>social</b> <b>science</b> research.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} of <b>social</b> <b>science</b> {{is the study}} of the logic and method of the social sciences, such as sociology, anthropology, and political science. Philosophers of <b>social</b> <b>science</b> are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agency.|$|E
5|$|Academic Decathlon was {{originally}} organized {{differently than the}} current competition. The original ten events were aesthetics (music and visual arts), conversation, essay writing, mathematics, practical arts, formal speech, physical science, <b>social</b> <b>science,</b> current events, extracurricular activities, and English literature, grammar, and reading. Over time, those events evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, science, social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music. Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place {{of one of the}} other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either science or <b>social</b> <b>science</b> and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year's Science, Language and Literature, Music, <b>Social</b> <b>Science,</b> Art, and Economics curriculum.|$|E

5|$|Despite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has {{influenced}} proponents of control theory, {{and is often}} mentioned as a classic sociological study.

5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German <b>social</b> <b>science</b> and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first <b>social</b> <b>science</b> course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of <b>social</b> <b>science</b> in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E

5|$|The {{events are}} split up into two groups: the seven {{objective}} tests (art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and <b>social</b> <b>science)</b> the three subjective events (essay, interview and speech). In addition, {{there is a}} SuperQuiz relay event. The former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each, {{with the exception of}} math, which has 35 questions. Beginning in the 2012-2013 season, the SuperQuiz written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six of the objective subjects: art, economics, language and literature, music, science, and <b>social</b> <b>science.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} larger role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium of <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support of <b>social</b> <b>science</b> research.|$|E

30|$|In the West, i.e. Western Europe, given unique {{historic}} and cultural circumstances, modern <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> emerged and became dominant {{over the last}} 500  years (Delanty 2005).

However, if we speak of ‘Western’ <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> we {{have to admit that}} there are substantial differences between European and US-American societies and their <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> (Herpin 1973; Martinelli 2008).

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>sciences</b> and {{technology}} have {{an essential role}} in formation of society. Through <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> one can understand what society needs and how these needs can be provided. Also, <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> provide knowledge that address social demands, and possible solutions for problems of the society. The use of technology is obvious in all spheres of society and driving changes in daily life. Research in <b>Social</b> <b>Sciences</b> and Technology (RESSAT) journal emerges within this context and provides a scholarly platform to bring together articles related to <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> {{and technology}}. As an international peer-reviewed journal, RESSAT will seek to publish articles that draws on the anthropology, archaeology, criminology, education, economics, geography, history, information and communications technology (ICT), law, linguistics,  religion, political science, psychology, and sociology. With great pleasure we welcome all authors involved in improving research in <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and technology. RESSAT can be distinguished from other journals available in <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> by its inter-disciplinary focus and its priority on the use of technology in <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> RESSAT provides an academic platform for authors to publish empirical studies together with discussion of conceptual and methodological issues of relevance to <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and technology. ...|$|R
