5|$|A Tahitian {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact with European explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced {{by a group of}} men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum called tō‘ere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a <b>single-headed</b> upright drum called fa‘atete, a <b>single-headed</b> hand drum called pahu tupa‘i rima, and a double-headed bass drum called tariparau.|$|E
5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set {{out through}} a cave system to reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, believing they are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only <b>single-headed.</b> They conclude they must be weakened Weeping Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and they continue to flee.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The <b>single-headed</b> dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
25|$|The German Empire of 1871–1918 had re-introduced {{the medieval}} {{coat of arms}} of the Holy Roman Emperors, in use during the 13th and 14th centuries (a black <b>single-headed</b> eagle on a golden background), before the {{emperors}} adopted the double-headed eagle, beginning with Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1433. The <b>single-headed</b> Prussian Eagle (on a white background; blazoned: Argent, an eagle displayed sable) {{was used as an}} escutcheon to represent the Prussian kings as dynasts of the German Empire. The Weimar Republic introduced a version in which the escutcheon and other monarchical symbols were removed.|$|E

25|$|The conga, {{also known}} as tumbadora, is a tall, narrow, <b>single-headed</b> drum from Cuba. Congas are staved like barrels and {{classified}} into three types: quinto (lead drum, highest), tres dos or tres golpes (middle), and tumba or salidor (lowest). Congas are traditionally used in Afro-Cuban genres such as conga and rumba, although they are now very common in some other forms of Latin music, including descarga, Afro-Cuban jazz, salsa, songo, merengue and Latin rock.|$|E
25|$|The silver double-headed eagle surmounted by {{a golden}} three-pronged Saxon crown {{has been used}} by several units of the British Army as a heraldic device for Mercia since 1958. It is derived from the {{attributed}} arms of Leofric, Earl of Mercia in the 11th century. It is worth noting, however, that Leofric is sometimes attributed a black, <b>single-headed</b> eagle instead. The example on the left is the official device of the Mercian Regiment.|$|E
25|$|The modern multi-tenors {{evolved from}} {{horizontally}} mounted dual <b>single-headed</b> bass drums first {{used by the}} Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps in the late 1960s. Early multi-tenors had shells with a flat bottom. These drums sounded a lot like timpani, so they were called timp-toms. As drum sizes got smaller, more drums began {{to be added to}} multi-tenor configurations. The largest sets of multi-tenors had 7 drums and were carried by both the 1977 and 1992 Spirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps tenor lines.|$|E
25|$|From {{the reign}} of Frederick Barbarossa in 1155 the <b>single-headed</b> eagle {{became a symbol of}} the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle was clearly derived from the Roman eagle and {{continues}} to be important in the heraldry of those areas once within the Holy Roman Empire. Within Germany the placement of one's arms in front of an eagle was indicative of princely rank under the Holy Roman Empire. The first mention of a double-headed eagle in the West dates from 1250 in a roll of arms of Matthew Paris for Emperor Frederick II.|$|E
25|$|The oldest extant Hydra {{narrative}} {{appears in}} Hesiod's Theogony, while the oldest {{images of the}} monster are found {{on a pair of}} bronze fibulae dating to c. 700 BCE. In both these sources, the main motifs of the Hydra myth are already present: a multi-headed serpent that is slain by Heracles and Iolaus. While the fibulae portray a six-headed Hydra, its number of heads was first fixed in writing by Alcaeus (c. 600 BCE), who gave it nine heads. Simonides, writing a century later, increased the number to fifty, while Euripides, Virgil and others did not bother to give an exact figure. Heraclitus the paradoxographer rationalized the myth by suggesting that the Hydra would have been a <b>single-headed</b> snake accompanied by its offspring.|$|E
25|$|Timbales are tuned {{much higher}} than a tom of the same diameter, and {{normally}} played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. They have relatively thin heads and a very different tone than a tom, but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms. Attack timbales and mini timbales are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in 2010s genres and in more traditional forms of Latin, reggae & numerous world music styles. Gong drums are a rare extension to a drum kit. The <b>single-headed</b> mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (sizing around 20-24 inches in diameter), but has the same purpose {{as that of a}} floor tom.|$|E
25|$|As {{the use of}} {{the long}} drum began to spread across Europe, many composers and musicians started looking for even deeper tones {{that could be used in}} compositions. As a result of this demand, a narrow-shelled, <b>single-headed</b> drum called the gong drum was {{introduced}} in Britain during the 19th century. This drum, which was 70-100 centimeters in diameter and deep-shelled, was similar to the long drum in both size and construction. When struck, the gong drum produced a deep sound with a rich resonance. However, the immense size of the drum, coupled with the fact that there was not a second head to help balance the sound, meant that gong drums tended to produce a sound with a definite pitch. As a result, they fell out of favor with many composers, as it became nearly impossible to incorporate them in an orchestra in any meaningful way.|$|E
25|$|Modern marching {{bands and}} drum corps use multi-tenors, which consist of several <b>single-headed</b> tom-toms {{played by a}} single drummer. The bottoms of the shells are open and beveled to project {{the sound of the}} drum forward. Double-ply PET film heads are {{typically}} used for increased sound projection and durability. They are typically played with wooden- or aluminum-shafted mallets that have disc-shaped heads made of nylon. Mallets with felt or fleece heads, drum sticks, drum brushes, and other implements are occasionally used to achieve different timbres. The playing technique used for multi-tenors is somewhat different from that of a snare drum, and more like that of a timpani because the drumhead is struck closer to the edge instead of in the center. This creates a sound with more overtone, as opposed to striking the drumhead in the center, which produces a very short, dull sound with few overtones that is considered undesirable for multi-tenors.|$|E
25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. <b>Single-headed</b> drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the four}} images [...] is <b>single-headed</b> with four arms that are adorned with a sword, [...] a book {{on top of a}} lotus, a bow and an arrow. Each wall in the shrine is {{dedicated}} to a Buddha image. Manjushri is depicted on the main wall, seated on a lion throne; the side walls have images of Amitabha on the right and Aksharabhya on the left. The images are set around the central image of Manjushri in a niche in the wall. Manjushri is adorned with jewellery (pearls and other moulded forms) and a crown made of a flower band. In the base of the throne on which the Manjushri image is deified, is a depiction of 'Seven Jewels' and 'Eight Suspicious Symbols' (flanked by lions) enclosed in a square frame that is distinctive. The top of the throne frame has makara mountings.|$|E

2500|$|According to Carl-Alexander von Volborth {{the first}} {{instance}} {{of the use of}} an eagle as an heraldic charge is the Great Seal of the Margrave Leopold IV of Austria in 1136, which depicts him carrying a shield charged with an eagle. Also from about this time is a coin showing a <b>single-headed</b> eagle, minted in Maastricht (the Netherlands), dating from between 1172 and 1190 after contacts with the East via the Crusades. [...] One Gilbert d'Aquila was granted Baronetcy of Pevensey by William after the Battle of Hastings. The family who held Pevensey castle and the newly formed Borough of Pevensey used the eagle symbol in the 11th century.|$|E
2500|$|John died at Limnia in 1297. John Lazaropoulos, in his Logos, {{notes that}} {{when his son}} Alexios succeeded him, {{the western part of}} his realm was under heavy {{pressure}} from [...] "the godless Agarenes" [...] and only Kerasous, part of Chalybia, Oinaion, and [...] "the thirteen towns or forts of Limnia" [...] remained to the Empire; John may have been leading his forces against the enemy when he died. His body was transported to his capital and interred in the Panagia Chrysokephalos Church ("Golden-headed" [...] Virgin). Portraits of John and his wife Eudokia could be seen in the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa, prior to its reconstruction in 1863. These portraits were notable that his robes were adorned with the <b>single-headed</b> eagle [...] "the special emblem of the Comneni of Trebizond", while her robes bore the double-headed eagle of Byzantium.|$|E
2500|$|By the 13th {{century the}} {{imperial}} {{coat of arms}} was generally recognised as: Or, an eagle displayed sable beaked and membered gules (a black eagle with wings expanded with red beak and legs on a gold field). During the medieval period the imperial eagle was usually <b>single-headed.</b> A double-headed eagle is attributed as the arms of Frederick II in the Chronica Majora (c. 1250). In 1433 the double-headed eagle was adopted by [...] Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. Thereafter the double-headed eagle {{was used as the}} arms of the German emperor, and hence as the symbol of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. From the 12th century the Emperors also used a personal coat of arms separate from the imperial arms. From the reign of Albert II (reigned 1438–39), the Emperors bore the old Imperial arms with an inescutcheon of pretence of his personal family arms, which appears as the black eagle with an escutcheon on his breast.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{category}} is the bocuses (sing. bocú alt. pl. bocúes), also called fondos ("bottoms").“The bokú is a <b>single-headed</b> drum, skin {{nailed to the}} shell, shell open at one end, long, shaped like a conic section and made of staves with iron hoops that circle them and hold them together. [...] They are heated with fire and played {{with both hands and}} no sticks. [...] The musician or bokusero carries the drum on his left side, hung over the shoulder with a strap.” (Ortíz II 1952-5:34) [...] Nowadays, the skin is usually held on by a metal hardware system {{similar to that of the}} commercial conga drum. [...] Anywhere from four to 16 bocuses are used in one conga (Brea and Millet 1993:179). [...] The bocuses play simple interlocking parts with few variations (however, the sum of the parts results in quite a complex drum melody). [...] A smaller bocú, called a quinto or bocusito, plays complex off-beat figures and improvisations.|$|E
2500|$|While plesiosaurs varied {{little in}} the build of the trunk, and can be called [...] "conservative" [...] in this respect, there were major {{differences}} between the subgroups as regards {{the form of the}} neck and the skull. Plesiosaurs can be divided into two major morphological types that differ in head and neck size. [...] "Plesiosauromorphs", such as Cryptoclididae, Elasmosauridae, and Plesiosauridae, had long necks and small heads. [...] "Pliosauromorphs", such as the Pliosauridae and the Rhomaleosauridae, had shorter necks with a large, elongated head. The neck length variations were not caused by an elongation of the individual neck vertebrae, but by increasing the number of these cervical vertebrae. Elasmosaurus has seventy-two neck vertebrae; the known record is held by the elasmosaurid Albertonectes, with seventy-six cervicals. The large number of joints implied suggested to early researchers that the neck must have been very flexible; indeed, a swan-like curvature of the neck was assumed to be possible - in Icelandic plesiosaurs are even called Svaneðlur, [...] "swan lizards". However, modern research has confirmed an earlier conjecture of Williston that the long plate-like spines on top of the vertebrae, the processus spinosi, strongly limited a vertical movement. Although horizontal curving was less restricted, in general the neck must have been rather stiff and certainly was incapable of being bent into serpentine coils. This is even more true of the short-necked [...] "pliosauromophs", which had as few as eleven cervicals. With early forms, the amphicoelous or amphiplat neck vertebrae bore double-headed neck ribs; later forms had <b>single-headed</b> ribs. In the remainder of the vertebral column, the number of dorsal vertebrae varied between about nineteen and thirty-two, of the sacral vertebrae between two and six, and of the tail vertebrae between about twenty-one and thirty-two. These vertebrae still possessed the original processes inherited from the land-dwelling ancestors of the Sauropterygia and had not been reduced to fish-like simple discs, as happened with the vertebrae of ichthyosaurs. The tail vertebrae possessed chevron bones. The dorsal vertebrae of plesiosaurs are easily recognisable by two large foramina subcentralia, paired vascular openings at the underside.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Savage realism' is {{the result}} of a desire to {{represent}} an object as it is known to be, and not as it appears. Thus Catlin, among the Red Indians, found that the people refused to be drawn in profile. They knew they had two eyes, and in profile they seemed only to have one. Look at the Selinus marbles, and you will observe that figures, of which the body is seen in profile, have the full face turned to the spectator. Again, the savage knows that an animal has two sides; both, he thinks, should be represented, but he cannot foreshorten, and he finds the profile view easiest to draw. To satisfy his need of realism he draws a beast's head full-face, and gives to the one head two bodies drawn in profile. Examples of this are frequent in very archaic Greek gems and gold work, and Mr. A. S. Murray suggests (as I understand him) that the attitude of the two famous lions, which guarded vainly Agamemnon's gate at Mycenae, is derived from the archaic double-bodied and <b>single-headed</b> beast of savage realism. Very good examples of these oddities may be found in the 'Journal of the Hellenic Society,' 1881, pl. xv. Here are double-bodied and single headed birds, monsters, and sphinxes. We engrave (Fig. 15) three Greek gems from the islands as examples of savagery in early Greek art. In the oblong gem the archers are rather below the Red Indian standard of design. The hunter figured in the first gem is almost up to the Bushman mark. In his dress ethnologists will recognise an arrangement now common among the natives of New Caledonia. In the third gem the woman between two swans may be Leda, or she may represent Leto in Delos. Observe the amazing rudeness of the design, and note the modern waist and crinoline. The artists who engraved these gems on hard stone had, of necessity, much better tools than any savages possess, but their art was truly savage. To discover how Greek art climbed in a couple of centuries from this coarse and childish work to the grace of the AEgina marbles, and thence to the absolute freedom and perfect unapproachable beauty of the work of Phidias, is one of the most singular problems in the history of art. Greece learned something, no doubt, from her early knowledge of the arts the priests of Assyria and Egypt had elaborated in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Nile. That might account for a swift progress from savage to formal and hieratic art; but whence sprang the inspiration which led her so swiftly on to art that is perfectly free, natural, and god-like? It is a mystery of race, and of a divine gift. 'The heavenly gods have given it to mortals.' ...|$|E
