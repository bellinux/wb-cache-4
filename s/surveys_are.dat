Visual <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> used to find ash trees {{displaying}} emerald ash borer damage, and traps with colors attractive to emerald ash borer, such as purple or green, are hung in trees as part of a monitoring program.

5|$|<b>Surveys</b> <b>are</b> {{needed to}} {{determine}} existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises {{because they are not}} adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. For successful reintroductions, connectivity between sites with low population density is considered ideal. Protected area extensions are also needed in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Past <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) {{no longer}} believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, {{a review of}} photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were collected at the Falls when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected. Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred {{at or near the}} Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance is problematic and confusing.|$|E

City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E

These <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> most often presented in the form of average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around as few as 3,700 vehicles used the route daily near Palominas and as many as 31,000 daily near the northern terminus at Sierra Vista.

In 2009, MDOT determined that 692vehicles a day used the segment near the state park. Through the middle section in Garden, the peak volume was 892vehicles daily which dropped to 878at the USjunction. The commercial AADT was 54trucks for the entire highway.
