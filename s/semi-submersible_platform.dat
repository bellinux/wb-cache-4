50|$|A <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform</b> is a {{specialised}} {{marine vessel}} {{used in a}} number of specific offshore roles such as offshore drilling rigs, safety vessels, oil production platforms, and heavy lift cranes. They are designed with good stability and seakeeping characteristics. Other terms include semi-submersible, semi-sub, or simply semi.|$|E
50|$|Semi-submersible marine {{structures}} are typically only movable by towing. <b>Semi-submersible</b> <b>platforms</b> have the principal characteristic of remaining in a substantially stable position, presenting small movements when they experience environmental forces {{such as the}} wind, waves and currents. <b>Semi-Submersible</b> <b>platforms</b> have pontoons and columns, typically two parallel spaced apart pontoons with buoyant columns upstanding from those pontoons to support a deck. Some of the semi-submersible vessels only have a single caisson, or column, usually denoted as a buoy while others utilize three or more columns extended upwardly from buoyant pontoons. For activities which require a stable offshore platform, the vessel is then ballasted down so that the pontoons are submerged, and only the buoyant columns pierce the water surface - thus giving the vessel a substantial buoyancy with a small water-plane area. The only concrete semi-submersible in existence is Troll B.|$|R
50|$|<b>Semi-submersible</b> <b>platforms</b> {{operate in}} {{a wider range of}} depths, mostly {{relatively}} deep, and bottom work {{is more likely to be}} in saturation and using heliox.

5000|$|After the warship {{project was}} {{finished}} in the early 1990s, MIL-Davie Shipbuilding, along with the Davie yard in Lauzon went into receivership. After being bought by the Quebec government, Davie was sold to Dominion Bridge Company for $1. In 1998, the parent Dominion Bridge Company went into bankruptcy and the Davie shipyard went into trusteeship in 1998. It was sold again in 2000 and became [...] "Industries Davie, Ltd". During this period, the company undertook a number of projects involving vessels and rigs which serve the offshore oil and gas market.

50|$|There are {{different}} types of offshore drilling units such as the oil platform, jackup rig, submersible drilling rig, <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform</b> and of course drillships. All drillships have what is called a”moon pool”. The Moon pool is an opening {{on the base of}} the hull and depending on the mission the vessel is on, drilling equipment, small submersible crafts and divers may pass through the moon pool. Since the drillship is also a vessel, it can easily relocate to any desired location. But due to its mobility, drillships are not as stable compared to semi-submersible platforms. To maintain its position, drillships may utilize their anchors or use the ship’s computer-controlled system on board to run off their Dynamic positioning.|$|E

40|$|A novel tuned heave plate energy-harvesting system (THPEH) is {{presented}} for the motion suppressing and energy harvesting of a <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform.</b> This THPEH {{system is designed}} {{based on the principle}} of a tuned mass damper (TMD) and is composed of spring supports, a power take-off system (PTO) and four movable heave plates. The permanent magnet linear generators (PMLG) are used as the PTO system in this design. A <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform</b> operating in the South China Sea is selected as the research subject for investigating the effects of the THPEH system on motion reduction and harvesting energy through numerical simulations. The numerical model of the platform and the THPEH system, which was established based on hydrodynamic analysis, is modified and validated by the results of the flume test of a 1 : 70 scale model. The effects of the parameters, including the size, the frequency ratio and the damping ratio of the THPEH system, are systematically investigated. The results show that this THPEH system, with proper parameters, could significantly reduce the motions of the <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform</b> and generate considerable power under different wave conditions...|$|E

They are generally anchored by combinations of chain, wire rope or polyester rope, or both, during drilling and/or production operations, though they can also be kept in place by the use of dynamic positioning. Semi-submersibles can be used in water depths from 60 to 3000 m.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an aero-hydro-elastic {{model of a}} semi-submersible floating wind turbine. A specific attention is drawn to hydrodynamic modeling options and their effect onthe dynamic response of the platform. The NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine mounted on the historical concept of <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform</b> Dutch tri-floater is considered. Aspecific hydrodynamic model of loads on a <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>platform</b> is used within the wind turbine design code FAST from NREL. This hydrodynamic model includes nonlinearhydrostatic and Froude-Krylov forces, diffraction/radiation forces obtained from linear potential theory, and Morison forces {{to take into account}} viscous effects on the bracesand damping plates. The effect of the different hydrodynamic modeling options is investigated. As one could have expected, it is found that the effect of viscous drag on braces, and nonlinear Froude-Krylov loads, becomes larger with increasing wave height. Their effect remains of small order. Simulations also are run with directional waves, it is found that wave directionality induces larger transverse motions...|$|E
