5|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{at the end of}} 1989, when the title was to be decided between <b>Senna</b> and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens {{collided}} at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by <b>Senna.</b> Prost walked away while <b>Senna</b> returned to the track. <b>Senna</b> {{went on to win the}} race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, the Brazilian received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading <b>Senna</b> to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favoring his compatriot Prost. Senna's disqualification meant that it was mathematically impossible for him to overhaul Prost's points total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman. There has been much debate as to whether <b>Senna</b> was overambitious in his overtaking manoeuver, whether Prost intentionally ran into <b>Senna,</b> or whether the collision was simply a racing incident between two teammates who were embittered with each other.|$|E
5|$|Despite a spin, <b>Senna</b> was {{the fastest}} driver {{at the end}} of Friday's session with a time of 1:21.548, almost five-tenths of a second faster than Schumacher and Berger. Senna's {{teammate}} Damon Hill was seventh, having spun himself, over 1.6 seconds behind <b>Senna.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Senna's</b> {{death was}} {{considered}} by many of his Brazilian fans {{to be a national}} tragedy, and the Brazilian government declared three days of national mourning. Contrary to airline policy, <b>Senna's</b> coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country not as cargo but in the passenger cabin of Varig's McDonnell Douglas MD-11 commercial jetliner (registration PP-VOQ (cn 48435/478)), accompanied by his younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. <b>Senna's</b> coffin was covered with a large Brazilian flag.|$|R
50|$|In April 2002, <b>Senna's</b> FW16 {{chassis number}} 02 was {{returned}} to the Williams team. The team reported that the car was in an advanced state of deterioration and was subsequently destroyed. <b>Senna's</b> helmet {{was returned to}} Bell, and was incinerated. The car's engine was returned to Renault, and its fate is unknown.|$|R
2500|$|At the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello {{incorporated}} part of <b>Senna's</b> helmet design {{into his}} own. For the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, another variant of <b>Senna's</b> helmet {{was used by}} Lewis Hamilton and by Barrichello too. Hamilton used the design with permission from <b>Senna's</b> sister Viviane and the helmet was later sold {{in support of the}} IAS. At the 2015 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton again varied his helmet design (this time, the rear only given FIA restrictions on design changes in force from 2015) accompanied with a Twitter announcement stating [...] "Just for you, Brazil!! A tribute to the greatest".|$|R
5|$|During the 1993 season, Prost and <b>Senna</b> {{continued}} their on-track rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix {{due to the}} hostility of Brazilians towards him. The two {{continued their}} on-track battles at Silverstone where <b>Senna</b> aggressively defended his position against Prost. At Prost's last Grand Prix, the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, he was pulled up by <b>Senna</b> onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.|$|E
5|$|Prost won his fourth, and final, title, {{but in a}} {{year where}} he was {{regularly}} challenged by teammate Hill, and Ayrton <b>Senna.</b> Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, as the clause in the Frenchman's contract did not extend to 1994 and <b>Senna</b> {{would be able to}} join Williams for the upcoming season, and instead opted to retire as the driver with the record for most grand prix victories — a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and <b>Senna</b> embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as <b>Senna</b> had declined a handshake the race before. Prost's performances earned him an OBE.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{after the}} 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, {{where the two}} drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (cf. 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, <b>Senna</b> got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, it was Prost this time that got away the better of the two; but <b>Senna</b> forced his way past Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement {{at the start of}} the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with <b>Senna.</b> <b>Senna</b> argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring <b>Senna</b> because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season.|$|E

5|$|There {{was another}} {{controversial}} incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari {{was unable to}} put up a challenge regularly to Senna's frontrunning McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled <b>Senna</b> for 4th place, but he felt <b>Senna</b> defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, <b>Senna</b> ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton <b>Senna</b> joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that <b>Senna</b> would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, <b>Senna</b> died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed <b>Senna</b> simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E
5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, <b>Senna</b> made his move at the Casino Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, <b>Senna</b> bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded <b>Senna</b> for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined <b>Senna</b> US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|E

2500|$|An {{estimated}} {{three million}} people flocked {{to the streets of}} <b>Senna's</b> hometown of São Paulo to offer him their salute. This is widely accepted as the largest recorded gathering of mourners in modern times. Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in Ibirapuera Park. [...] After the public viewing, a 21-gun salute was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven Brazilian Air Force jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to Morumbi Cemetery. [...] Many prominent motor-racing figures attended <b>Senna's</b> state funeral, such as team managers Ken Tyrrell, Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart. [...] The pallbearers included drivers Gerhard Berger, Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost, Thierry Boutsen, Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Roberto Moreno, Derek Warwick, Maurício Gugelmin, Hans Stuck, Johnny Herbert, Pedro Lamy, Maurizio Sala, Raul Boesel, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, and Christian Fittipaldi. Neither Sid Watkins nor Jo Ramírez, the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because they were so grief-stricken. <b>Senna's</b> family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of <b>Senna's,</b> to attend the ceremony, after an altercation between Ecclestone and <b>Senna's</b> brother Leonardo at Imola regarding Ecclestone's misconstrued reaction to the news of Ayrton's death {{and the fact that the}} race had not been abandoned after his accident. FIA President Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger, which took place on 7 May 1994, in Salzburg, Austria. Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, [...] "I went to his funeral because everyone went to <b>Senna's.</b> I thought it was important that somebody went to his." [...] <b>Senna's</b> grave bears the epitaph [...] "Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus", which means [...] "Nothing can separate me from the love of God" [...] (a reference to Romans 8:38–39).|$|R

5|$|Vettel {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Hamilton lost time due to struggling {{to pass the}} lapped cars of <b>Senna</b> and Glock. Glock attempted to pass <b>Senna</b> around the outside heading into the first corner {{but was unable to}} move ahead. On lap 37, Glock again attempted to overtake <b>Senna</b> but the two cars collided. The incident caused a puncture on Glock's car that very nearly threw him into the wall and forced him to make a pit stop, though his crew were not ready for him and he lost several seconds as the tyres were brought out. <b>Senna</b> remained on the circuit with a damaged front wing, and made a pit stop on the next lap. Sutil overtook Buemi for seventh place on lap 40. Hamilton was eight tenths of a second quicker than race leader Vettel on the same lap and reduced the gap to 11.9 seconds. Hülkenberg's car emitted blue smoke from the rear on the next lap but disappeared on the 42nd lap. It was announced two laps later that Button, Barrichello, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Petrov, Liuzzi, Sutil, Buemi and de la Rosa were under investigation for exceeding the speed limit during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|After {{causing a}} {{collision}} with Bruno <b>Senna</b> in Spain, Schumacher received a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco; but started sixth owing to his penalty. He later retired from seventh place in the race.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} standards in safety following this race, there was a 20-year gap between the deaths of Ratzenberger and <b>Senna,</b> and the crash of Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix which led to his death the following year.|$|E

The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges. The cause of <b>Senna's</b> accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking. The column had been cut and welded back together at <b>Senna's</b> request in order for him to be more comfortable in the car.|$|R
50|$|Nigel Mansell led {{the race}} in his Williams FW14B-Renault up until lap 70, but then {{suffered}} a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton <b>Senna's</b> McLaren-Honda. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than <b>Senna's</b> and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final three laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just two-tenths of a second behind the Brazilian. It was <b>Senna's</b> fifth win at Monaco, equalling Graham Hill's record. Ricardo Patrese took the final podium position after just holding off Michael Schumacher's Benetton who finished fourth.|$|R

5|$|Ayrton <b>Senna</b> was a Brazilian racing {{driver who}} won three Formula One world championships. He entered Formula One in 1984 with the Toleman team, but after one season, {{he moved to}} Lotus. He spent three seasons with Lotus before moving to McLaren in 1988. Over the next five years, the intense rivalry between <b>Senna</b> and Alain Prost, a leading Formula One driver, came to the forefront, with {{particularly}} notable race incidents and collisions occurring between the two. <b>Senna</b> won all three of his world championships during his six seasons with McLaren, in 1988, 1990 and 1991. He wanted to move to Williams after 1992, but was prevented from doing so by a clause in Alain Prost's contract. He moved to Williams in 1994, but during the third race of the season, {{he was killed in}} an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. He was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era, and is considered by some as the greatest racing driver of all time.|$|E

5|$|M. nigrocincta ants are diurnal {{and do not}} hibernate. They are omnivores, {{and feed}} on other insects {{including}} caterpillars and spiders, as well as honey water. M. nigrocincta has been observed to prey on the larvae of imperial hairstreak butterflies, even jumping while carrying them. Predators of the M. nigrocincta (and the Myrmecia genus as a whole) includes spiders, birds, lizards, mammals and other predatory invertebrates, including assassin bugs and Redbacks. The ants have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and <b>Senna</b> acclinis and are considered as a possible pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although <b>Senna</b> acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict capacity to effect pollination.|$|E
