The Fringe team discovers {{that a second}} building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and people inside together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using the technology that Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns that because of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one <b>sometime</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few days.|$|E

25|$|Further in the future, Orion's stars will {{gradually}} {{move away from}} the constellation due to proper motion. However, Orion's brightest stars all lie at a large distance from the Earth on an astronomical scale—much farther away than Sirius, for example. Orion will still be recognizable long after most of the other constellations—composed of relatively nearby stars—have distorted into new configurations, {{with the exception of a}} few of its stars eventually exploding as supernovae, for example Betelgeuse, which is predicted to explode <b>sometime</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> million years.|$|E
25|$|In August 1889, Dixon {{accepted}} a post in New York City, {{despite the fact}} that his Boston congregation was willing to double his pay if he would stay. In New York, Dixon would preach at new heights, bumping elbows with the likes of John D. Rockefeller and Theodore Roosevelt (whom he helped in a campaign for New York Governor). <b>Sometime</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five years, however, Dixon became disillusioned with the church, and he began to believe that he could no longer belong to any particular denomination. So, in 1895, Dixon resigned from the Baptist ministry, and started preaching at a nondenominational church. He continued preaching there until 1899 when he began to lecture full-time.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Brownback, {{however it}} died in Congress <b>sometime</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year. The bill was {{introduced}} {{based on the}} findings that science has progressed {{to the point where the}} human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans. Since the bill's death in congress there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Initially, the Olympic Village was to {{be located}} entirely on the McCormick Place truck yards, but in November 2006, The Michael Reese Hospital site became listed for sale. [...] Planners {{determined}} that the Hospital site would likely have been superior in terms of lower cost and more successful urban planning implementation. In November 2007, Mayor Daley announced a plan to acquire the [...] site, and the following June the hospital decided that it would cease operations. In July 2008 the city announced its official bid for the property: The city planned to borrow $85 million to buy the Michael Reese Hospital campus, near 31st and King Drive, from its current owner, Medline Industries. Medline would only get $65 million, because the company agreed to make a $20 million “charitable contribution” back to the city. The city would use that $20 million to pay {{up to five years}} of interest on its $85 million debt, demolish the hospital, and clean up the site. Then <b>sometime</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> couple years it planned to sell the site for at least $85 million to a developer or developers, who in turn were expected to build a complex big enough to house about 15,000 Olympians. After the games the developer would sell or rent out the units.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, let us {{examine a}} {{situation}} which would exhibit memorylessness. Imagine a long hallway, lined {{on one wall}} with thousands of safes. Each safe has a dial with 500 positions, and each has been assigned an opening position at random. Imagine that an eccentric man walks down the hallway, stopping once at each safe to make a single random attempt to open it. In this case, we might define random variable X as the lifetime of his search, {{expressed in terms of}} [...] "number of attempts the man must make until he successfully opens a safe". In this case, E will always be equal to the value of 500, regardless of how many attempts have already been made. Each new attempt has a (1/500) chance of succeeding, so the man is likely to open exactly one safe <b>sometime</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 500 attempts -- but with each new failure he makes no [...] "progress" [...] toward ultimately succeeding. Even if the man has just failed 499 consecutive times (or 4,999 times), we expect to wait 500 more attempts until we observe the next success. If, instead, this man focused his attempts on a single safe, and [...] "remembered" [...] his previous attempts to open it, he would be guaranteed to open the safe after, at most, 500 attempts (and, in fact, at onset would only expect to need 250 attempts, not 500).|$|E
