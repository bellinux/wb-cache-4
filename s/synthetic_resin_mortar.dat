40|$|DE 102006017547 A 1 UPAB: 20071129 NOVELTY - The {{component}} has thermoelectrical {{pairs of}} side pieces (101, 102) of n and p conductors, which are connected {{with each other}} by an electrically conductive contact layer (103), which is made of galvanically separated material. Intermediate layers made of electrically non-conductive material are arranged between the side pieces, where the non-conductive material consists of ceramic, glass, quartz, porcelain, plastic, <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin,</b> <b>mortar,</b> enamel, aerosol or mica. The side pieces are thermally parallel and electrically connected in series by the contact layer using galvanotechnic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing a thermoelectric component. USE - Used for cooling and/or heating interior and/or exterior of a pipe, and for measuring a direct measured variable e. g. temperature, and indirect measured variable e. g. specific heat, heat conductivity, heat capacity, pressure, flow rate and reaction energy. Can also be utilized directly or indirectly for storage of data. ADVANTAGE - The individual n and p conductor side pieces are electrically connected by galvanotechnic, thus allowing the contact material to be directly attached on the side pieces, which are provided with detention layers and diffusion barriers, and hence enabling a contact between the pieces without a soldering process...|$|E
40|$|Several masonry {{structures}} of historic centers show; diffuse crack patterns and hazardous safety conditions, especially {{due to their}} dead load and the consequent time dependent phenomena, together with environmental cyclic actions. In the paper, the structural problem is briefly examined considering some case histories, and some relevant analyses results are reported. A bed joint reinforcement consolidation technique, performed by insertion of bars or plates of several possible materials (steel, FRP laminates) and successive repointing of the joints is then proposed. Some considerations on the technical feasibility are first illustrated (joint preparation, selection of materials, both for strengthening and repointing) {{and the results of}} a numerical model taking into account the essential non-linearities of the material properties are shown. Steel reinforcement has been for the moment considered and <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> and lime <b>mortars</b> have been tested to fill the reinforced joints.

Accordingly，in this paper, we used the columnar samples 	which were arranged frequently as the supporting insulating 	material or insulator in the insulation design 	of practical apparatus and the arc resistances were investigated. 	As the result，it was clarified that the arc resistances 	of columnar sample decreased more remarkably than 	that of plateone. Furthermore， there existed the cases 	of equal arc resistance and of different one in various 	diaineters of section of sample in the several <b>synthetic</b> 	<b>resins.</b> 	From these results， it was clarified that the effect 	of geometrical form of sample existed in the arc resistance 	of <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin...</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{oxidized}} and xanthated a subbituminous coal from Montelíbano Córdoba (Colombia) {{with carbon}} disulfide in a basic solution, at 30 or 5 – 10  °C at different coal particle sizes. The exchange {{capacity of the}} xanthated coal increased when the particle size decreased. Only a commercial <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> showed a slightly higher exchange capacity than our xanthated coal. In general, Hg 2 + was removed less effectively from the aqueous solutions than Cd 2 +. Oxidation, previous to xanthation, increased metal retention in the coal to values comparable with those of a commercial <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin.</b> In general, the exchange capacities for the exchangers followed this order: Commercial activated carbons < non-treated subbituminous coal < our activated carbon < sulfonated subbituminous coal < our xanthated coal < commercial <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin.</b>|$|R

30|$|Multilayer {{materials}} of cultural heritage such as historical materials and artwork are analysed as cross-section samples using microscopy and FTIR microscopy. Most commonly, these samples {{are embedded in}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin,</b> ground and polished. During this process, {{there is a high}} potential for the <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> to contaminate the sample. The resin penetrates into the open pores or cracks in the sample, or solvent of the resin can partially dissolve some layer of the analysed sample. In both cases, the presence of <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> significantly distorts the results of analysis, particularly the analysis of peripheral layers, which are of course the most contaminated. Interpretation of the FTIR spectra of individual layers is very difficult; it can be ambiguous and largely subjective. Moreover, analysed layers are usually a mixture of substances, where the studied substance (for example organic binder) is present as a minor component.|$|R
30|$|The {{contamination}} of sample with embedding material may also {{occur as a}} result of smearing during dry or wet polishing. When such smearing does occur, all layers of the sample, peripheral layers as well as inner layers, are affected the same way without any distinction. Nevertheless, the {{contamination of}} inner layers of the sample with <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> had been tested as well. The infrared spectra of these layers are not distorted with strong vibration bands of <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> (the concordance of these with the infrared spectra of inner layers of the sample KBr is more than 92 % on the average, where the concordance between first layers is only 78 % on the average). On the contrary, the use of liquid glass and Herkules as a barrier method can show a higher smearing effect on the contamination of surface of the sample than the <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin.</b>|$|R
